First of all, maximum values for residues must be kept as low as possible.
Public health and best agricultural practices should be normative in this respect.
I should like to say right now, Commissioner, that non-chemical control should take precedence over chemical control.
Secondly, children are particularly vulnerable because their livers are not yet fully developed.
Research in the Emma Childrenâs Hospital in Amsterdam has shown that certain residues can seriously hamper childrenâs development.
It is therefore of the utmost importance for children to be adequately protected, and so I would ask you all to support Amendment No 67.
Thirdly, clear and strict regulations would eliminate the current distortions of competition when crop protection products are allowed to be used.
That would be a welcome development.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for the broad support on the Commission proposal in this important area.
May I express my thanks once again to Mr Sturdy, the rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts in bringing this to a conclusion.
I am heartened that we share a common understanding of the objectives to be achieved by this proposal: simplification, consumer protection and the achievement of the single market through harmonisation.
I would also note that Parliament's deliberations and discussions echo many of the themes and issues raised in the Council discussions.
As far as the Council is concerned, I understand that a political agreement will be sought next week and a common position before the summer break.
Given the consistency in views between Parliament and the Council â views shared by the Commission â I am confident that we can now move forward rapidly towards early adoption of this proposal.
We have made good progress in setting out the legal and administrative framework whereby consumers will be protected from unacceptable levels of residues whilst at the same time ensuring that there is a single market by permitting trade in agricultural commodities.
There are seven specific topics that arose in the discussions on which I would like to focus.
The first of these is the notion of a default limit-of-determination MRL.
This is very important.
By accepting the concept of a default 'zero tolerance' MRL, we have found a solution for residues of the 400 substances we took off the market in 2003 for which the remaining residues should have moved out of the food chain by 2005.
This means that, if we do not set a specific Community MRL, we do not expect to see any residues.
This should help to avoid nasty surprises in future and give us a legal tool to help fight misuse of pesticides.
The application of a default MRL, however, raises a problem â what to do with all the national MRLs that we already have and that are not yet harmonised.
Here we are introducing the concept of temporary MRLs.
I recognise that the issue of temporary MRLs raises some anxieties, but can assure you that the European Food Safety Authority will be involved in this process.
It does not mean that we are suddenly increasing consumer exposure to residues.
On a positive note, the setting of temporary MRLs will finally achieve harmonisation and will centralise the MRL process, ensuring that high standards are established and maintained in future.
Also on the positive side, our proposal aims to screen these temporary MRLs and to remove those that are clearly unacceptable whilst permitting the existing situation to continue, pending the detailed evaluations undertaken under Directive 91/414/EEC.
Please remember that we are not changing any agricultural practices here.
Whatever residues that have been circulating over the past ten or twenty years will still be circulating tomorrow at the same or at lower levels, but not at higher levels.
In relation to agricultural practices, I recognise the desire that there should be a preference for non-chemical methods of agricultural production over chemical methods.
However, this is not the appropriate text to regulate that issue.
Directive 91/414/EEC on the marketing and use of pesticides governs agricultural production and I intend to bring forward proposals to amend it later this year.
These proposals will be submitted as part of a package together with our proposals on the sustainable use of pesticides.
I am sure that there will be ample opportunity at that stage to discuss the broader issue of chemical and non-chemical methods.
It is also important to recognise the new role of the European Food Safety Authority.
I am sure that this will improve consumer protection and the scientific basis underpinning decisions taken.
I know what Mr Sturdy said about the support, financial and otherwise, for the European Food Safety Authority.
The Authority should also have an important role in risk communication and provide a reasoned voice in relation to the acceptability of any risks involved.
Not only will consumers be protected; they will be seen to be protected.
EFSA will also be deeply involved in scientific issues.
Immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption, cumulative risk assessments: these are emerging issues where the regulatory science is still trying to catch up with the latest advances in research.
We will be looking to the Authority to help us make progress in this sphere, not just in the context of setting MRLs but also in the scientific data that we will be requiring in the dossiers that industry should be submitting to us under Directive 91/414/EEC.
I have already referred to the setting of temporary MRLs as leading finally to the achievement of the single market in this area.
However, let us not forget the global aspect.
The Community is one of the biggest importers of food in the world.
Consequently we also import a lot of residues.
This proposal will set up for the first time a clear procedure for import tolerances, for assessing those residues and for ensuring that only those that are deemed acceptable will be allowed.
This is an important obligation in relation to the WTO: any decisions taken on the acceptability or otherwise of imports will be based on clear procedures and a sound scientific risk assessment.
Finally, the strengthened provisions on monitoring and control measures should boost confidence among all parties and ensure that we have the tools available to justify and to maintain that confidence.
A full listing of the Commissionâs position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament.
I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for this sitting.(1)
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (Î5-0253/2004) by Mrs Ghilardotti, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament: Modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union â a plan to move forward (CÎÎ(2003) 284 â C5-0378/2003 â 2003/2150(ÎÎÎ)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, CommissionerÂ Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission presented the communication on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union to theCouncil and the European Parliament.
This communication responds to the report of 4 November 2002 of the High Level Group of Company Law Experts, which Commissioner Bolkestein appointed for the purpose of, precisely, recommending a modern regulatory framework for company law in Europe.
The communication sets out the major political objectives that should guide all our future initiatives.
It includes an action plan which lays down a timescale for a series of instruments, regulatory or otherwise, intended to be set up in the short, medium and long term, together with a grid indicating the priority of the measures themselves.
In this proposal, the Commission has taken into account the need to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, basing its own regulatory approach on gradual application, without however, losing sight of regulatory developments at international level.
There are two fundamental objectives sought by the Commission by reforming company law in Europe: strengthening shareholdersâ rights and third partiesâ protection; fostering efficiency and competitiveness of businesses.
The main grounds underlying this initiative can be distinguished as the establishment of a more homogenous reference framework for company law in order to facilitate cross-border establishment and restructuring; the creation of conditions to prevent a repetition of recent corporate scandals â among which the scandal in my country stands out owing to its size â the consequences of which have severely affected millions of peopleâs livelihoods, pensions, jobs, savings and investments; making the most of the advantages offered by the internal market.
In order to realise the first objective proposed by the action plan, it is essential to provide an effective, up-to-date system to protect shareholders and their rights.
We must also take into due consideration the position of certain third parties, who are particularly qualified in terms of their interests: creditors and workers.
From this point of view, the Commissionâs approach to the issue of governance seems simplistic and inadequate.
Corporate governance is presented as a problem confined solely to relations between shareholders and management, as if a business were a body solely concerned with shareholdersâ interests.
In this way it is describing a virtual company, without giving due importance to workers and without more general responsibilities towards other categories of parties with an interest in the life of the company itself such as, for example, creditors and other stakeholders.
With regard to the second objective, competitiveness of businesses may be fostered by various elements, including the inevitable existence of an appropriate regulatory framework for company law, firmly balanced between national and Community measures.
I believe that the challenge that we must meet today is to aim to bring out the distinctive, characteristic features of European capitalism in the age of globalisation.
In other words, we need to ascertain whether there is a true European model, which differs significantly from the North American model, not because it corresponds with and emerges from a framework of challenges and issues other than those which concern everyone in a context of economic globalisation, but because it considers social consequences and implications, making it more balanced and more human: a model, therefore, which seeks to conceive of the essential core of the corporate model, represented by a companyâs interests, not just as the common interest of members and shareholders but as the interest of the company itself, a company which, as an independent economic operator, is also responsible for the specific interests of all parties outside and within the company itself.
These include employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, the public administration, in its capacity as distributor of welfare and tax revenue, and the entire civil society, which is structurally connected, by means of the general and common interest, to the companyâs prosperity and continuity.
One final comment of a general nature: we need to obtain the correct balance between self-regulation and legislative regulation when the European governance framework is formulated.
Today there is a widespread tendency to fill regulatory gaps with self-regulation codes.
This is positive but it does not go far enough.
We need to maintain a system of legally binding rules, equipped with effective sanctions, applied by public bodies entrusted with the tasks of guidance and monitoring.
The aim must be precisely to globalise governance rules and to place the public supervisory authorities into a network.
On this basis, we have focused our attention on certain key points, which I will just mention: transparency and shareholdersâ rights, role of institutional investors, promotion of the role of independent directors, the specific issue of corporate pyramids, rights of workers as particularly qualified creditors of the company and the centrality of a system of public oversight of audits.
Â Â  C. Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes this debate on company law and corporate governance and the action plan connected therewith â an action plan adopted by the Commission almost one year ago.
We broadly support the content of the resolution which has been submitted to Parliament.
We very much thank Mrs Ghilardotti for the quality of her report.
This action plan is based on the firm belief that a self-regulatory market approach, based solely on non-binding recommendations, is clearly not always sufficient to guarantee the adoption of sound corporate governance practices.
Only if there a number of tailored rules will markets play their disciplining role and ensure diligent business conduct.
This is why, in view of the growing integration of European capital markets, a common approach should be adopted at EU level, laying down a few essential rules and adequate coordination of corporate governance codes.
Recent scandals have therefore strengthened the Commission's determination to implement its action plan.
My services are actively working in five areas to have proposals ready, where possible, later this year.
The five areas are as follows: first, the role of non-executive directors; second, the remuneration of directors; third, the responsibility of directors for company accounts; fourth, the full disclosure of intra-group relations and transactions with related parties, including transparency in the company accounts of offshore special purpose vehicles; and fifth, the disclosure of corporate governance practices.
The aim is therefore not to re-examine or reconsider the action plan in the light of recent developments, as requested in the motion for resolution; rather, it is to learn from those developments and to take due account of them when preparing the various initiatives that it contains.
When implementing the action plan, the Commission will also take due account of the interests of the various stakeholders â to which Mrs Ghilardotti made reference â and, where appropriate, distinguish between listed and non-listed companies and large and small shareholders, as is also requested in the motion for resolution.
It is of the utmost importance that we restore trust and confidence in the audit function.
I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur agrees with the main elements of the reform which I have set out in the proposal for an eighth directive on statutory audit.
That should allow us to proceed quickly and, I hope, reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament in a single reading.
I know that the issue of non-audit services delivered to the audited entity is particularly delicate.
The Commission has published a recommendation on auditor independence which sets out the conditions under which such services are still allowed.
We need to see how this recommendation is applied in practice.
Many Member States are in the process of transposing this recommendation into their national law.
It would therefore not be appropriate, at this stage, to fundamentally change our approach in that area.
However, in our communication of May 2003, we announced our intention to carry out a study that will examine whether further changes in that area are needed.
The results of the study will be available next year.
At that time, we shall decide whether new initiatives are necessary.
In Europe, investors need to be better organised and more vocal advocates of corporate change.
However, a sound corporate governance framework will not be achieved by the markets simply acting on their own, nor by the introduction of an overly prescriptive legal infrastructure.
The challenge we are all facing here is to find the right balance between regulatory and market-based incentives and penalties.
We therefore support the broad thrust of this resolution and we are working resolutely along those lines.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to thank our rapporteur, because I believe that we have here a good proposal for the position of Parliament.
I admit that we are only at the communication stage at present. This is a start, but the hard part will come later.
Perhaps peopleâs positions will harden then.
However, this is a good starting position, and gives us the green light for our negotiations on this subject.
I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that self-regulation has demonstrated its limitations.
Self-regulation is not enough to define the new balance that is necessary in order to organise countervailing power within the undertaking, because it cannot be the shareholders themselves who organise that countervailing power.
In order to organise real countervailing power, you need to take all the partners into account.
That is the thinking behind the position which our rapporteur is proposing to Parliament and which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will support with great determination.
It seems to me that the only difficulty here is first of all ensuring that there is a willingness to organise countervailing power by achieving a balance between the various partners, but there also has to be a willingness to preserve what could be a corporate model which corresponds to the balance that has been achieved as a result of our European experience, without necessarily copying other models.
Finally, we are moving forward here, on legislation which will be very complicated to implement, at a time when these same issues are under discussion in every Member State.
That, I believe, is the real difficulty on which you or your successor will have to take a decision.
How can we make our rates of progress coincide, so that what is decided in Brussels is not immediately rendered obsolete by what the Member States themselves have implemented in the context of their national legislation?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the opinion given by the Committee on Industry emphasises the need for the principles of corporate governance to be dynamic and flexible.
The subsidiarity principle should be followed in order to leave scope for distinctive national features and traditions in the area, and we must avoid central corporate governance as far as possible.
We must not strive for harmonisation of different codes of corporate governance.
The share of voting power for different types of share is another example of what should not be decided at EU level, as this would cause problems for small- and medium-sized enterprises, or future companies, in some EU countries.
Instead, what European industry needs is even greater openness and transparency in governance and accounting.
This will improve the future flow of capital and market position.
I note that some of the rapporteurâs views conflict with the committeeâs opinion, but I wish to point out that there was a broad consensus on the adoption of the opinion and that it accords well with the Commission communication.
Â Â  . Mr President, successful corporate governance is bound up with a reduction in security in cross-border investments and an increase in the mobility of capital.
For the Europe of the 25 members, this imposes the need for us to impart an overall identity to business through which its international influence will be exerted.
This identity for Europe cannot be divorced from practices which are sensitive to social and environmental issues.
That is why I particularly regret that my fellow members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected my proposed amendment to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which I submitted that all directives on company law should include an obligation to inform and consult with the workers' representatives whenever important decisions are to be taken which affect the continuing existence of companies and jobs.
It is a pity that, whenever we try to join forces with the productive system and employment interests, there is a rallying against such proposals, as if they represented a mortal danger.
Similarly, as far as protecting shareholders is concerned, I think that, without doubt, the protection of their rights should be strengthened.
However, and I am pleased that the Commissioner admitted this, we must in all cases accept the distinction between large and small shareholders, especially with regard to the use of modern technology in the exercise of shareholders' voting rights, given that small shareholders are more exposed to risk.
I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market accepted the amendment in question.
Finally, for the same reasons, special care must be taken to address methods which result in shareholders' being cheated out of their votes, as happens with arrangements which allow for the informal organisation of systems for the representation of shareholders by large anonymous groups.
To close, I should like to thank the rapporteur, whose basic positions I agree with.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Ghilardotti for her excellent work in committee in writing this report.
At the same time, I would like to thank Mr Winterâs committee and the European Commission for this most excellent action plan.
It is a very moderate and purposeful document, which quite deliberately does not try to do too much.
I do not think we need any European corporate governance codes, it is quite sufficient if activities are sensibly coordinated and harmonised in the Member States.
It is obvious that our systems of company law differ greatly and that harmonisation has not progressed very far as yet.
A number of very important directives, like the fifth, have been filed away by the Council and never seen the light of day again.
Against this background, it is of course right not to want to go ahead with a European corporate governance code, because it will not work without a common, harmonised system of company law.
That is why I believe, and the Ghilardotti report confirms it, that the Commission has presented a very good paper here and a good action plan over all.
There were of course some differences of opinion between the political groups in the internal debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I want to make clear, however, that these were not differences of principle, but differences over how things are formulated and the amount of detail gone into.
For example, Mrs Ghilardotti made a number of proposals, in particular for including trade union staff and social rights in the report.
My group took the view that we should not do so in detail, because this is a paper about the company law action plan and not a social report or a social paper.
That is why, in our group, we quite deliberately confined ourselves to a general statement on the social reasons for restricting property rights, and we believe that is sufficient and that there is no need for other social aspects to be mentioned in this report.
In all other respects, we believe this is a good report.
With one amendment, we as a group will be voting for this report as it emerged from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Â Â  Mr President, I should explain that I am the non-executive chairman of a medium-sized regional media group in the United Kingdom.
I will start by briefly stating what I think corporate governance will not do.
It will not necessarily make companies perform better or more profitably, and it will not necessarily cut out criminal or unethical behaviour, but it will set down a series of criteria for corporate behaviour that are likely to enhance transparency, accountability and systems of business conduct, which in turn give the wider world, shareholders, stakeholders and others an idea of what is going on.
That is politically essential for 20th century European capitalism, set in a social market economy.
It is interesting how company law in the various Member States has created companies that differ qualitatively from one other.
European company law can either legislate to harmonise this, or do nothing and let the inevitable process of convergence be driven by the market, providing no particular model is discriminated against.
I would add that I am conscious of some of the waspish remarks made about what happens in my country.
Against this background, the principle of 'comply or explain' is the right point to start from.
Finally, we must not forget that in the global marketplace currently being created by the World Trade Organization, uncompetitiveness is a certain precursor of economic failure.
If we fail to grasp this essential point we shall destroy ourselves, disinherit our children and betray Europe and our own countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is just one point I should like to stress at the end of this debate: the matter of stakeholders and corporate social responsibility.
The Commission's action plan is part of an overall strategy to foster the efficiency and competitiveness of businesses and to strengthen shareholders' rights and the protection of third parties.
However, there are also related initiatives which are part of that overall strategy.
They include the Commission's activities on corporate social responsibility and in particular the work of the European Multi-stakeholder Forum, set up at the initiative of my former colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
It would therefore have been inappropriate to introduce under this action plan another policy framework concerning corporate social responsibility.
What matters more is to do what Mrs BerÃšs has asked the Commission to do, which is to take due and full account of the interests of all stakeholders in the measures the Commission will adopt.
The action plan clearly recognises this need and the Commission is therefore committed to acting accordingly.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (Î5-0192/2004) by Mr Radwan, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a legal framework for a single payment area (2003/2101(ÎÎÎ)).
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, the European Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs fully support the aim of creating a single payment area in the European Union.
There continue to be very significant national barriers in the form of different national regulations, national legislation and national supervision; even today, these make it difficult to create a single internal market for bulk payments, which would ultimately benefit the citizen.
We took the first steps in this direction some time ago with cross-border transfer fees.
That, too, required an initiative at European level.
We also support, for example, the introduction of a single direct debit system, which has not so far been possible.
Imagine, it is now possible for a citizen to travel to another state, but he still cannot have payments debited at home, but he has to choose a national bank to do it.
The question is, how do we achieve this objective?
I am a strong advocate of the approach of incremental legislation in line with the principle of subsidiarity, with self-regulation in first place, that is self-regulation by the banks.
We have the European Payments Council â which can, should, and indeed must set the parameters for the creation of the technical interfaces for cross-border activity, for example.
Then, also with subsidiarity in mind, I would prefer the next steps to be taken in directives and only enact in regulations what is really necessary to do uniformly.
I would also like to sound a warning to the industry here, since it is itself always talking about self-regulation: these requirements will also have to be complied with and corresponding standards created without undue delay.
Consumer protection presents a greater problem in this Commission document.
It contains some ideas which in my view go far beyond our objective, and I have the impression that there are some people in the Commission â let me make clear that I do not mean you, Commissioner Bolkestein â who have lost sight of the idea of citizens taking responsibility for themselves.
They suggest that the bank should in future be liable for a basic transaction.
For example, if customers buy something over the Internet and the purchase is void, they want their money back, and if they cannot turn to the supplier, they should be able to turn to the bank, which had nothing to do with the basic transaction.
I am sure things like that can be settled by the market â and you are an advocate of the market, after all â by having products that provide safeguards; a fundamental liability of the banks in such cases should be rejected, however, as should the proposal that cardholderâs liability be limited to EUR 150 when the card is lost, regardless of how they have behaved.
If they go away on holiday, discover on setting out that they have lost their card, and report it three weeks later, the cardholderâs liability will still be limited to EUR 150.
I think we should give a little more protection to people who act responsibly than to those who act irresponsibly.
I am, however, pleased to welcome the fact that the Commission has taken up the idea of establishing a single EU-wide telephone number that can be called if a card is lost â a short number that is easy to remember and that the citizens can dial quickly.
I would also like to stress that the creation of a single payment area should not result in national structures that are working well and efficiently being made less economic.
We must not go about it in a way that is detrimental to operational national systems.
Coming back to consumer protection, however, may I appeal to you, Mr Bolkestein, in the ongoing discussions within the Commission, to speak up for mature and responsible citizens and see that responsibility is left with them.
The Lisbon objectives of becoming the most innovative and fastest-growing region in the world are held up to us repeatedly.
Everyone is brandishing the slogan âless bureaucracyâ.
Mr Bolkestein, the text we have before us should be judged by whether it creates more bureaucracy or makes life easier for banks and citizens in the single European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is the third time that I have come to a plenary session to address the issue of payments.
An efficient and secure payment system is an essential complement to the free movement of goods and services in the European Union.
Let me give you one figure to illustrate this. Every EU citizen carries out, on average, 138 non-cash payment transactions each year.
An efficient system must be based on a robust and dynamic regulatory framework that ensures competition, consumer protection and safety in payment transactions.
Pan-European trade needs an effective underlying payment system if it is to expand.
The regulation on cross-border payments adopted in 2001 has made it easier and cheaper to perform many types of payments in euro within the internal market.
However, we are not yet where we want to be and need to be.
Significant obstacles remain, as are highlighted in our communication.
To deliver an improved regulatory environment for payments, remaining legal and technical barriers to intra-EU payments should be identified and removed.
In other words, the whole internal market ought to be transformed into one efficient domestic payment area.
That is our main purpose.
EU legislation in this field is necessary.
But for certain issues, self- or co-regulation could be the best approach.
That also satisfies Mr Radwan's desire for more subsidiarity.
As always, the solution should be proportionate to the problem it is intended to solve.
The four guiding principles for the Commissionâs future regulatory proposal should be as follows. Firstly, to modernise the existing EU legislation on payments.
Secondly, to inject more competition into this market for the ultimate benefit of our citizens. The basic idea is that the provision of payment services should be open to all appropriate providers, but without sacrificing consumer protection.
We must therefore design an appropriate supervisory framework matching all types of payment service providers.
The guiding principle here must be: 'same business, same risks, same rules'.
Thirdly, we need to develop a trustworthy pan-European payment area in which consumers feel that they have the same protection, no matter where they are and what kind of payment instrument they use.
A single and balanced set of rules should be defined on parties' rights and obligations regarding, for example, misuse of a payment instrument and revocability of payment orders.
Fourthly, we need to incorporate the relevant Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, special recommendations into EU legislation to combat the financing of criminal activities.
Let me stress that given their decisive contribution to the competitiveness of our economy, payments are high on the Commissionâs agenda.
We shall need the strong support of this Parliament, and in this respect I am encouraged by the terms of the resolution which has been put forward by Mr Radwan.
I welcome all amendments submitted by Members of this House.
I shall wind up by thanking Mr Radwan for the report which he has submitted and I assure him that, just as he wishes to have less bureaucracy, that is precisely what this Commissioner and the Commission as a whole also want.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous legislature, the Euro was established as scriptural (non-cash) money.
It has now, in the current legislature, become the currency of twelve countries of the European Union.
The creation of the single currency does not, however, automatically mean that there is a single payment area, in which the same rules apply across the board.
This is one of the major tasks facing the European Union in the next legislature.
The Commission waited until the last possible moment for the banking system to establish self-regulation following the creation of the single currency.
After the Euroâs inception in 1999, however, two markets were established for the purposes of payments â a national market and an international market.
There was no internal market governed by domestic rules regulating payments in the new currency, which, although a single currency, functioned as a foreign currency, subject to commission and other foreign exchange charges.
This situation was partially solved by Regulation No 2560 of December 2001 concerning electronic transfers and payments.
Since then, self-regulation still does not appear to have worked; the directives have not worked either, as they must be transposed into the law of each country, and this has not been carried out at the same time or in the same manner.
This is an area that requires rigorous rules to be applied simultaneously and uniformly throughout the internal market.
It is therefore my opinion that only by establishing regulations can we give the citizens and companies the security that a payment system requires.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a pity that the debates on consumer credit and on the single payment area were not combined, because the same issue is at stake in both of them: do we want to construct a European market in retail financial services?
Up to now, priority has been given to the wholesale market and to investment services.
During this legislative period, the only initiative of any note â though it is an important one â has been the one on the rules for setting rates for cross-border payment transactions within the euro zone.
This debate is, therefore, important and I believe that we must now set a clear political objective. That, I believe, is what the Commission wants.
The euro cannot be a complete success unless we construct the euro zone as an internal area for payment methods.
In order to do that, it is vital that we should achieve interbanking in the infrastructure.
The activity of supplying payment services presupposes, admittedly, the removal of national obstacles, but at the same time it also requires prudential supervision.
It is on that basis that the internal retail banking market, and in particular the consumer credit market, will be able to develop, and that in turn will allow European banking operators to emerge.
Of course, within that integrated area it will be necessary to take into account the diversity of the operators involved, and in particular the special nature of savings banks and mutual societies.
What, though, is the best way to proceed?
The application of the âcountry of originâ rule with minimum harmonisation seems to us to be negative, both as regards consumer protection and from the point of view of fair competition.
Mr Radwanâs report, which leans in that direction, gives far too much preference to self-regulation.
On the other hand, however, maximum harmonisation would leave no room for diversity and would, therefore, also cause a problem.
That is why I believe that the best solution is to agree on the common principles of general interest, the common concepts, particularly with regard to universal access to payment methods with a high level of security, services which are inexpensive but in which there is great confidence.
The rules governing cross-border transactions must be precise, and intense cooperation is necessary between national regulators.
With that in mind, there are several points in MrÂ Radwanâs report which in my opinion require adjustment.
Thus in paragraph 17 the rule recommended by the Commission should be reinstated, that is, the rule restricting customersâ liability to EURÂ 150 in the event of unauthorised transactions where they have not given notification.
As for pan-European direct debit, account-holders must be able to refuse a payment before it is debited from their account.
If there is a substantial modification in rates, it must be possible to close or move an account, at no cost, at the request of the customer.
It is also necessary to re-establish the liability of the payment service providers over the whole of the payment chain.
Finally, it is also necessary to have stronger Community rules to combat the funding of terrorism.
The system of complete information must, therefore, also apply to payment transfers outside the Community as well as those within the Community.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is grateful for the general support it has received in this debate.
I see no further reason why I should ask more time of Parliament than I have already done.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
â A5-0213/2004 by MrÂ Mombaur, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on amendment of the legal basis and on the âgeneral orientationâ of the Council with a view to adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply;
â A5-0254/2004 by MrÂ SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on conditions for access to the gas transmission networks.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentleman, the regulation which is the subject of MrÂ SeppÃ€nenâs report is a most important element of European legislation aimed at completing the task of creating a fully operational competitive European market in natural gas.
It is an essential supplementary instrument to the second directive on the internal market in gas.
This is because it lays down the minimum requirements for the key aspect of the approach to liberalisation of the energy market, namely access to the networks for third parties.
I am fully aware the draft regulation on conditions of access to gas transmission networks has given rise to a series of interesting debates over the last few weeks.
I should therefore like to take advantage of this opportunity to clarify some issues where I believe further explanation is still required.
It is important to reflect firstly on what the draft regulation is designed to achieve, and secondly, on why is it needed and what significance it has?
Clearly, the regulation supplements the directive on the internal market and fills the gap remaining.
Indeed, both the second directive on the internal market in gas and the proposed regulation are based on the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and competition.
Clearly, both legislative acts recognise the fundamental importance of access to the network by third parties.
The directive, however, only defines the objectives, whereas the regulation lays down a series of minimum requirements to be met with regard to the crucial issue of access to the network by third parties.
Obviously, a number of conditions will have to be met in order to comply with the provisions and objectives contained in the directive, as there are qualitative implications to opening up the market in addition to quantitative ones.
These conditions are also needed to ensure the market is competitive and can be exploited in full.
This discussion concerns drawing on the experience gained during liberalisation of the gas markets.
Experience has shown that failure to meet such requirements will mean that conditions of access to the European market will not meet the needs of opening up the market in gas.
Competitiveness and smooth operation of the latter will not be ensured either.
All this has been the subject of debate at the MadridÂ Forum for a year.
Essentially, the participants in that forum laid down the requirements.
The latter amount to minimum conditions agreed by all those involved in the MadridÂ Forum.
The aim is to create and guarantee a level playing field for access to this market.
To summarise, if this regulation comes into force, in the version proposed by the Commission, there can be every confidence that the means and systems are in place to allow it to become operational.
I must remind the House that our common aim is to create an internal market in gas within the EuropeanÂ Union.
Gas should be able to flow freely across all the networks in the Union.
This means gas will be able to cross borders unrestricted.
It also means that no restrictions can be placed either on its movement within the various MemberÂ States of the Union.
This is the reason why it has been stated specifically that all transport networks are covered by the proposed regulation, not simply cross-border networks.
Turning to the role of the gas sector in the years to come, there can be no doubt that close cooperation between the sector and the Commission will be essential.
This should be borne in mind when it comes to defining the general standards for the gas market in the future.
For obvious reasons, the Commission proposed the committee procedure.
The latter will have no influence in this regard, however.
It is not aimed at restricting the role of the sector and certainly not at excluding it from the drafting of future measures.
Quite the opposite is the case.
The Commission is open to proposals emphasising the role of the sector here and now and in the future.
I should now like to turn to MrÂ Mombaurâs report.
I shall focus on those parts of it concerning measures to ensure the security of natural gas supply.
You will recall that last December, the Council unanimously adopted a political guideline.
The Council also amended the legal basis for the Commissionâs proposal.
ArticleÂ 100 is now the legal basis instead of ArticleÂ 95.
The EuropeanÂ Parliament report we are today debating also supports the change in the legal basis.
The House will be aware that the Commission does not endorse such a change of legal basis.
On the occasion of the Council held on 15Â December 2003, the Commission issued a statement reserving its position on the change of legal basis.
We shall stand by our statement and position when the Council finally adopts the text of the directive in question.
Please allow me to outline the reasons for maintaining our position.
I shall be brief.
We appreciate that part of the text of the draft directive refers to the security of supply.
The text also contains references to the operation of the internal market, however.
The Commission believes that the references to the internal market carry most weight, and that therefore they should determine the legal basis of the directive.
In addition, the Commission is of the opinion that the text adopted by the Council contains a series of standards aimed at bringing a degree of harmonisation to a competitive European internal natural gas market.
The MemberÂ States are charged with defining a policy to ensure the security of gas supply.
It is also for the MemberÂ States to define the functions and responsibilities of the participants in the gas market regarding the security of supply.
In addition, the MemberÂ States are responsible for introducing certain minimum standards.
Each country will define its own standards.
Nonetheless, a degree of harmonisation will exist, as the standards relate to certain specific criteria for gas.
By contrast, the provisions aimed entirely at security of supply are designed mainly to deal with situations we hope will never arise.
I have in mind situations such as a serious political crisis or long-term uncertainty surrounding gas supply.
In the light of all this, the Commission remains convinced that ArticleÂ 95 is the correct legal basis.
The Commission therefore regrets that the Council saw fit to come to a different conclusion, and that it now appears Parliament will do likewise.
MrÂ President, I should like to conclude by thanking MrÂ SeppÃ€nen and MrÂ Mombaur for all the work and effort they have put into these two reports.
Following on from the various amendments and speeches, I shall say more on a key issue, namely access to the networks.
In the Commissionâs view, there can be no question of threatening the profitability and future investment in a most crucial element for the development of the market in gas.
I refer to the construction and maintenance of gas networks across the Community.
This is borne out by the proposal for trans-European energy networks.
A number of the main projects for the future already adopted relate to gas networks.
In the context of the first proposal being discussed in the run up to enlargement, the Commission endorses and supports several projects involving major interconnections between gas networks.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the proposal for a regulation on access to gas transmission networks.
It is important to have reliable rules for access to networks.
We found that with the gas directive last year.
My group believes the proposal should be further discussed together with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Commissioner, there are four points I would like to recommend you consider in greater detail in the Council debate.
Firstly, investment incentives.
We can talk about markets here for a long time. If we have no investors, then in the end we have no market either.
The Commission has often referred to the great risks carried by investors in the gas sector â exploration, pipeline construction.
There is competition in pipelines; there already was when the monopolies existed.
That is how the market came into being and it must remain clear that tariffs based on costs alone may deter investments.
My second remark is please will you consider whether more weight can be given to cross-border gas transport.
Thirdly, comitology.
The problem is not comitology itself, but the question is whether Article 9 is in a correct relationship to Articles 3 to 8, that is whether the most important points really are in Articles 3 to 8.
This can perhaps be improved when it is discussed in the Council.
My fourth comment, Commissioner de Palacio, is that of course everyone who has anything to say about the market is important, regulators, network operators and above all investors, and it is absolutely clear that you talk to them before you make proposals to Parliament and Council; you always have done.
Now they would all like to be mentioned in the legislation.
Personally, I do not see why they should be, because I believe the Commission knows how to do its job, but if it would give those I have just named pleasure to be mentioned in a recital, then I do not really mind.
Then I would like to say something about the other report on security of natural gas supply.
It is correct that we depend very much on imports.
It is therefore right that we should be concerned with this and oblige the Member States to introduce a suitable policy.
Now Parliament has adopted at first reading a different text than the one the Commission presented and the Council has backed Parliament in the matter.
We are therefore now speaking about a different text than the Commission originally presented and in our view this text no longer contains any rules for the internal market.
This means that the European Union has only one way of justifying it at all, namely Article 100 of the Treaty, and, on the basis of the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the committee therefore recommends that Parliament follow the Councilâs lead on this.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Commission has made a draft Regulation on the codecision procedure for Parliament and the Council, the aim of which is to guarantee free access to the gas transmission networks throughout the EU.
Some Member States have had problems implementing earlier decisions, and the Commission has therefore used a strategic weapon, which is to say a regulation, to guarantee access to gas networks in all countries, especially when transporting gas across borders from one country to another, but also within countries.
The draft Regulation is mainly based on the work of the Madrid Forum, which was attended by different market participants.
They thought they were drafting a recommendation there that would guarantee access to the gas transmission markets on a voluntary basis.
Some of those that participated might feel let down, as a voluntary commitment was altered to a compulsory regulation in the Commissionâs reading.
There was not enough time at the Madrid Forum to discuss all the details regarding access to the networks, and new laws are to be drafted in the future under the comitology procedure without any consultation procedure involving the participants at the Madrid Forum.
It is therefore understandable if some market participants are worried about how their interests are to be taken into account in the future.
During the committee discussions the Commission representatives said it was the Commissionâs intention that the participants at the Madrid Forum would also be heard in the future when the detailed regulations for implementing the Regulation were being drafted.
As the Madrid Forum is not a legal body, it is the opinion of the Commission that consultations with it cannot be recorded in the text of the Regulation.
As rapporteur, however, I think it would be appropriate if this undertaking to consult the various parties were also recorded in the minutes of Parliamentâs plenary session.
I would expect this to be done when the Commissioner makes her next speech or before the final votes.
After a number of votes on the matter our committee adopted the position that there are good arguments in favour of establishing the Regulation and that the Commission proposal should furthermore be adopted in principle by this Parliament.
In the votes more than 40 amendments were accepted as a basis for first reading, and Parliament wishes to hold talks on them with representatives of the Commission and the Council some time in the future when the draft Regulation is being finally agreed.
I wish to thank everyone for their excellent levels of cooperation whilst the item for debate was being prepared.
Although we were in disagreement with one another and had our different interests to consider, I think we managed to work very objectively and achieve an excellent end result.
I await the Commissionerâs speech, which will hopefully reconfirm the Commissionâs commitment to include consultation with the participants of the Madrid Forum in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on bringing together into his report the different strands of opinion that were expressed in the debate.
It is significant that after much debate in committee only one additional amendment has been tabled over and above those adopted in committee.
I am one of those who accepted the argument for the need for a regulation to give effect to and make binding the voluntary code on guidelines for good practice agreed at the Madrid forum, and I and my Group therefore support this proposal for a regulation.
The rapporteur states the case very well in his explanatory statement and I can do no more than commend his analysis to colleagues and make a recommendation to adopt.
We must recognise that the industry was not of one view on this matter, with the incumbent network or transmission system operators resisting change, while most of the other operators, be they upstream or downstream, strongly endorsed the underlying principle embodied in the Commission proposal.
This measure should assist new entrants.
In order for competition to flourish and for benefits to flow from it in terms of better service to consumers, greater efficiency as regards both energy and market forces, enhanced security of supply, greater flexibility and increased innovation, there must be a clear regulatory framework.
This measure takes us a long way towards genuine and full liberalisation and I congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner on their efforts in this regard.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin where Mr Chichester left off, that is that we cannot proceed fast enough with opening the energy markets.
I believe we in this Parliament have been united on that for quite some time.
May I remind you that last year, after more than two yearsâ intensive work, we adopted directives to accelerate the opening of both the electricity and the gas markets in Europe.
I must say, however, that I and a few others, too, were then rather surprised at how quickly this follow-up proposal for a regulation concerning gas transmission networks has come.
We are surprised because the time allowed for the Member States to implement the directive has not yet expired â it will do so in a few weeksâ time â and also because we have set a very ambitious timetable for the Commission to submit an evaluation report on the application and implementation of the directive; it was to happen in 2006.
So much for the background.
I want to raise three points which, I fully admit, have left me rather sceptical.
Firstly, the compatibility between this regulation and the directive we adopted.
Secondly, the justification the Commission has given, which I have not exactly found in the text, namely that the emphasis should be placed on cross-border trade.
The third point that has made me rather sceptical was the proposal for a very wide-ranging comitology procedure.
Now, after a long discussion, as the rapporteur said, we have agreed to continue working on the Commissionâs approach.
We have therefore proposed a number of amendments in the three areas I have just mentioned.
So far as my group is concerned, the outcome is that we support the package as a whole.
That is not the end of my groupâs work, however.
We are waiting to see what the Council does and then there will be the second reading, but we shall continue to back here in plenary these 42 amendments that were adopted in committee, and we hope that this will bring us a little further forwards in the opening of the energy markets.
Â Â  Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Mombaur for his work as rapporteur on this difficult issue.
When the legal basis of a proposal is unreliable, when the rights of the Member States are infringed in the process, and where the actual text leaves something to be desired, it is not easy to draft a sound report.
It is gratifying to note that the Council has reached a political agreement after all, in which Parliamentâs reservations have been duly incorporated.
Last year, during the discussion of the issue of safeguard security of gas supplies, I was the draftsman of the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I then indicated why the Commission proposal was unsatisfactory on a number of scores.
It is satisfying to see that the Council has adopted the most important recommendations to have been made during the debates.
A first recommendation concerned the legal basis of the Commission proposal.
The Commission took Article 95 â internal market â as its basis.
At the time, we talked about the fact that it would be preferable to use ArticleÂ 100, which deals with crisis measures.
I think the Commission is wrong in its view that Article 100 applies only to economic and monetary policy; in a wider context, economic policy can also include energy policy.
You stated, Commissioner, that the Commission fails to see eye to eye with the Council and Parliament.
Do you intend to go to the Court of Justice again?
My second recommendation is this.
In the Council, Commission and Parliament, the gas directive, in respect of which the Councilâs common position was determined, was circulated last year.
The proposal concerning security of supply does not appear to be in keeping with this.
On the contrary, the proposal seems to contravene the gas directive.
It was surprising that pending the procedure with the gas directive, a proposal was submitted to Parliament on safeguarding security of gas supplies.
I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether the amended proposal on safeguarding security of gas supplies has been based on the gas directive.
If so, in what way was that done?
Â Â  â Madam President, you have to consider two things where natural gas is concerned.
The first is availability and the second is price.
In my opinion, we are right to take Article 100 as the basis now, even if Mr Blokland is right in saying we will have to take a very broad interpretation of it.
Whenever security of supply is discussed, there is always the temptation really to mean that it is an opportunity to introduce indirect price controls.
I believe that on the whole we will fail in that, because it will not work and the perspective taken is far too short-term.
Basically, we must not forget, either, that gas is dependent on price, which is in turn tied to the price of oil, and that we may perhaps be greatly deceiving ourselves about its availability.
The best form of security of supply is surely to have our own supplies, and we must therefore welcome the fact that work is gradually being done (a) to produce high-quality gas ourselves inside the European Union and (b) to feed that gas into our own available networks.
Â Â  Madam President, after almost 25 years in this Parliament I am standing down at the elections.
This may well be my last speech in the Chamber.
As a former mining engineer, energy policy has been one of my prime interests, so I am happy to be making my swan-song on an energy subject.
I hope that Parliament will strongly support this proposal because it will play an important role in the completion of the internal energy market.
Its purpose is to ensure fair access to networks for all market players and a genuinely competitive market for traded gas in the EU.
The third-party access guidelines in the Annex have been agreed by Member States, regulators, TSOs and system users.
It is therefore appropriate that the text of the regulation agreed in committee should be as close as possible to the guidelines agreed at the Madrid Forum.
Consultation with all actors in the industry is vital if the regulation is to be effective.
That is why they must all be consulted on the establishment of further guidelines.
National regulators will have a vital role to play in enforcing the guidelines at Member State level, as envisaged by the Gas Directive.
This proposed gas regulation deals with similar issues to the electricity regulation agreed by the Council and Parliament last year.
It is appropriate that the same institutional arrangements and procedures should apply.
I very much urge the House to approve this measure.
Â Â  Madam President, CommissionerÂ DeÂ Palacio, MrÂ Mombaur, MrÂ SeppÃ€nen, last June the European Union adopted, with difficulty and well behind time in relation to consumersâ and European companiesâ needs, Directive 2003/55/EC which takes decisive steps towards the completion of the liberalisation of the gas market.
In order to overcome the remaining obstacles to the completion of the internal market, the Member States established a system of informal coordination between, on the one hand, Community and national institutions, and on the other, companies and regulatory authorities in the gas sector, seeking to lay down guidelines on third party access to transmission networks.
Nevertheless, this informal coordination has proved to be inadequate to address the severe delays which have built up until now; indeed, the interests in undertakings of various countries and the privileges of position which many gas supply undertakings continue to gain from, have seriously jeopardised the possibility of completing a single market in the gas supply sector.
We should therefore welcome the Commissionâs initiative proposing the regulation which we must debate today, which makes the operating rules clearer and binding and responds to consumersâ and companiesâ needs for certainty and rapidity.
The text put forward by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy further strengthens this proposal and I therefore believe that it should be supported as it stands.
It is in the interest of certain countries â Italy in particular â with a high consumption of natural gas, insufficient national production and a strong, growing dependence on imports, which require several countries to be crossed, to have certain rules which signify, in operational terms, a real opportunity to have a market and, consequently, a system of liberalised networks which make gas available to companies and consumers in the required amounts, with freedom of choice.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would be interested to know how we, or those who come after us, will speak about this problem in ten yearsâ time, whether we will have become wiser or not.
I cannot answer that question today.
One thing is certain: security of supply will be improved by more competition; we have always been clear about that.
Even competition cannot do that without supply, however, which means, I believe, that security of supply, of natural gas in particular, will depend very much on a European foreign policy for energy, in other words diversification and security of supply through access to gas.
Like many others, too, I also advocate proceeding gradually.
I believe that, as with oil, the responsibility rests in the first instance with the companies.
I imagine that in two yearsâ time there may be a review and we may be rethinking the present situation.
I do not believe we are under any pressure of time.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, competition will of course be distorted if, for example, there is access to the electricity market but not to the gas market.
And it will be distorted still more if we protect monopolies that then buy smaller companies elsewhere in other countries.
We need common rules and the barriers to competition have to be eliminated, which obviously applies to all Member States.
I also support MrÂ SeppÃ€nenâs request that the participants at Madrid should be consulted.
I also think that the correct legal basis is indeed ArticleÂ 95, as stated in the Commissionâs proposal.
I am astonished at this switch to Article 100, which I consider to be just an extra problem, and I hope we will go back to Article 95.
Â Â  . Â MadamÂ President, I stand by my earlier statement regarding the legal basis.
Consequently, I shall focus on the various views expressed and on the amendments to MrÂ SeppÃ€nenâs report.
I should like to begin by thanking the House for the discussion that evolved on a matter of such vital importance, and for the calibre of the 43 amendments.
This does not mean that we will be able to endorse all 43, however.
In particular, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
Thanks are also due to MrÂ Mombaur, who has already left the House.
I do not share his views on changing the legal basis, but he certainly has worked in a most constructive manner also.
I have to say that the Commission cannot support the amendments restricting the scope of the draft regulation to cross-border trade only.
That would amount to scaling down the aim of this proposal significantly.
The same would be true of its possibilities.
There would be no difficulty in trading gas from one country to another, but internal competition would definitely be restricted.
In a number of States, including several new MemberÂ States, gas flows along many networks.
Some of the latter do not link into a specific point of importation.
Consequently, they do not link into a cross-border point either.
All these transport networks and the relevant companies would be excluded from the scope of implementation of the proposed regulation.
This would hinder and prejudice the smooth operation of the internal market.
In addition, the scope of implementation is that envisaged in the transit directive and in the second directive relating to the internal market in gas.
What is at issue is facilitating competition, not only competition between the various countries but also within them.
Restricting the scope of implementation of this regulation would entail limiting its aim significantly and also limiting the possibility of actually achieving a competitive European gas market.
It must also be taken into account, however, that several speakers, and in particular MrÂ Mombaur, have raised the issue of guaranteeing a degree of profitability that would make the allocation of funds to the creation, construction and maintenance of the gas networks an attractive proposition.
In this connection, I can say that we are able to accept AmendmentÂ NoÂ 12.
We believe it clarifies our text and improves its quality.
We feel the amendment takes account of competition between the various networks.
There was no specific provision for this in our text.
We are therefore of the opinion that the amendment helps to allay the fears of those concerned about the lack of profitability.
Consequently it also allays concerns about future difficulties relating to new investment.
I must point out that the minimum standards for access to transport networks are absolutely crucial.
They are essential in order to facilitate access to new competitors, and therefore also to creating a genuine internal market in gas.
I cannot emphasise this enough.
The subject of the MadridÂ Forum has also been raised.
It has been suggested that we should move somewhat further ahead.
Furthermore, concern has been expressed as to whether, in future, the comitology procedure will result in sidelining the Forum, or sidelining the sector, that is, its protagonists.
The House must be aware that over the years I have always stressed the need to listen to the main stakeholders on a regular basis and we are, therefore, prepared to consider a solution guaranteeing that the sector will be consulted at the MadridÂ Forum, together with all other interested parties.
AmendmentÂ NoÂ 3 could prove helpful in this regard.
However things eventually turn out, we have no intention of excluding the sector.
On the contrary, we hope it will remain involved.
Looking to the future, we intend to support the MadridÂ Forum.
The Commission does not wish to go beyond the ground covered by the MadridÂ Forum.
Nonetheless, we do believe that one of the proposals put to the Forum by Eurogas, relating to the âuse it or lose itâ principle, is essential in the field of contracts.
Otherwise, contracts could result in outright prevention of genuine access to third parties.
This would mean restricting competition.
Future user contracts must therefore be based also on the âuse it or lose itâprinciple.
This is the only way of ensuring they are genuine contracts and not contracts aimed solely at using or saturating available capacity.
By creating artificial congestion in the networks such contracts would prevent access by third parties.
In general, the draft regulation is in line with the MadridÂ Forum guidelines, as you have pointed out and recognised, ladies and gentlemen.
The amendments that clarify or support the provisions of this draft regulation are acceptable, at least in part or if their text is adjusted.
This is true of AmendmentsÂ NosÂ 1Â andÂ 22, and of many others I shall not mention individually.
A detailed list will be provided.
Concerning certain technical issues such as those dealt with in Amendments Nos 14 and 16, these are matters dealt with by the European Association for Gas Exchange.
The latter was set up at the request of the MadridÂ Forum.
I have to say that given the very specific, complex and technical nature of these issues, we shall continue to leave them to the aforementioned organisation to deal with.
It has already made significant progress, and is reporting regularly to the MadridÂ Forum.
We believe this is the best way to deal with such matters.
There are practical and legal reasons why amendments such as Amendments Nos 8, 17, 22, 27, 30, 35, 37 or 42 are not acceptable.
Finally, we cannot agree to the presentation of new guidelines on the remaining issues dealt with in the draft regulation in a predetermined time period.
Some of these issues may require studies to be undertaken.
Discussions and negotiations on others may take longer than anticipated.
Consequently, AmendmentÂ NoÂ 31 is not acceptable.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the last debate on fundamental issues concerning energy to take place in this Parliament.
There will of course be a debate on Eco-design later.
To some extent, however, that is a side issue, bringing together industry and energy.
It tends to be always the same people taking part in these debates, and we have come to know each other fairly well.
I should like to congratulate MrÂ SeppÃ€nen, the rapporteur, and also to thank all the honourableÂ Members present for their input and support over the years.
Their contributions were most welcome and have been incorporated into many of the proposals drafted during this period.
I feel Parliamentâs constructive attitude and the helpful interchange of ideas have resulted in considerable improvement to most of the proposals brought before the House.
Personally, I have valued your help, ladies and gentlemen, and also the Commissionâs constant support.
It is worth remembering that, thanks to this constructive attitude, it has been possible to make spectacular progress during these last years.
The Commissionâs adoption of the GreenÂ Paper marked a turning point.
Parliamentâs report on the GreenÂ Paper was of the utmost importance too, as were the conclusions it led to.
I could mention the gas and electricity liberalisation packages. There were also the crucial accompanying measures, such as access to the networks.
Work on the latter is just drawing to a close.
As MrÂ Linkohr, MrÂ Rapkay and several other speakers have mentioned, we would have liked to wrap up earlier on this.
Nevertheless, our goal is in sight and we are moving slowly but surely towards it.
Along with the liberalisation of gas and electricity, the proposal concerning trans-European networks is essential in order for the European internal market in energy to become a reality as far as infrastructures are concerned.
The relevant measures dealing with the current Union have been adopted already.
Work on similar arrangements for the enlarged Union is well advanced.
We have worked as never before to debate and promote matters relating to energy and the environment.
In the past, in other parliaments, the tendency had been simply to set goals for this key area.
Many good intentions were expressed, but there was a lack of specific proposals aimed at attaining the objectives.
We have succeeded in translating those pious statements and good intentions into texts, obligations and responsibilities.
By way of example, I could mention the promotion of renewable energies, energy efficiency in buildings, issues related to biofuels, the creation of intelligent energy, Eco-design and energy efficiency.
Community policy has come into play too.
This has been most important.
Good progress has been made concerning Community policy on nuclear safety.
The work is not yet complete, but much has been achieved.
A further issue related to the European energy market on which substantial progress has been made concerns the adoption of a European objective with regard to the security of energy supply.
MrÂ Linkohr referred to this when he took the floor.
Furthermore, the importance of ensuring security of internal supply within the Union has been recognised also.
Good progress has been made.
We have worked well together.
MadamÂ President, I am bound to thank the House once again for its cooperation, for all the effort it has made and for its valuable contributions.
In particular, honourableÂ Members are to be commended on the intellectual skills and depth of knowledge they displayed in tackling the texts, which have sometimes been extremely complicated and technical.
They demonstrated an excellent grasp of the issues, and I believe congratulations are in order.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
You were kind enough to say how much you appreciated the excellent collaboration with the European Parliament and especially with the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I think I can say, on behalf of the members of that committee and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, how much we too have appreciated being able to work with you in the field of energy and in other fields.
Your feelings, I believe, are reciprocated by the Members of this House.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0171/2004) by MrsÂ Thors, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a framework for the setting of Eco-design requirements for Energy-Using Products and amending Council Directive 92/42/EEC.
Â Â  . Â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft directive establishing a framework for setting out the environmentally-friendly requirements applicable to energy-using products is somewhat innovative.
I should like to thank MrsÂ Thors and MrÂ Turmes for their excellent work within their respective committees, the Committee on theÂ Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Committee on Industry External Trade, Research and Energy.
The aim is to find the right balance between two elements. On the one hand, there is competitiveness, environmental protection and consumer protection, within the context of sustainable development.
On the other, the various environmental issues related to products.
It is important to guard against passing problems from one area to the other. There must be an integrated approach to the issue.
All the Community institutions must work together too. That is the way to ensure the co-legislators can agree to mandating the Commission with regard to the adoption of measures to be applied to specific products.
I should like to highlight the main features of this proposal.
As its title indicates, the proposal is aimed at improving the environmental behaviour, what could be termed the Eco-design, of energy-using products.
The free movement of products meeting the requirements, the protection of the interests of consumers and the competitiveness of our economy are essential, however.
We appreciate that the correct implementation of these proposals could prove extremely beneficial to all parties.
There are a number of reasons why this could be the case.
Industry will be motivated to improve the environmental characteristics of products with a significant capacity for self-regulation.
Thanks to the large market in investment and design improvement, fragmentation of the market will be avoided and investment will pay off.
Further, the measures will be aimed at swift compensation for the consumers and will take account of the nature of the market in the enlarged Union.
This is probably the first time that a proposal provides a consistent global legislative framework thus avoiding thematic legislation. The latter can sometimes prove contradictory.
Integrated product policy aims to avoid risks of this kind.
Energy consumption is one of the main ways in which products interact with the environment.
I am glad this has been emphasised in the discussions in the various committees charged with considering the proposal.
Regarding the institutional dimension of this issue, we propose moving from codecision to comitology to deal with specific products.
This is because we feel it is a flexible way of handling technical matters.
I have in mind for example rapidly-changing technologies and arrangements for consulting stakeholders.
I could also mention the development of self-regulatory alternatives for a range of products that is, in our view, too wide to be dealt with through codecision.
It would be too slow and therefore less efficient to attempt to do so.
I shall comment in detail later on the amendments the House is to table.
At this point, however, I should like to say how very constructive I feel the debates in the CommitteeÂ onÂ theÂ Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the CommitteeÂ onÂ Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proved.
Particular congratulations are due to Mrs Thors, to MrÂ Turmes and to all the rapporteurs, for trying to reach agreement at first reading.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioners, it seems to be ladiesâ night here this evening.
The aim of eco-design is to integrate technical possibilities when they are at their greatest.
More than 80% of environmental damage is determined at the manufacturing stage of a product.
We learnt this whilst considering this Directive.
We also know that the EU has adopted many rules to eradicate dangerous substances.
We have rules on waste management with quantitative targets for recovery and reuse.
It was a relatively natural course of action, then, for the committee to lay a certain emphasis on energy consumption, in particular, in its consideration of the proposal.
I should like to make a point of this, as strong criticism seems to have been levelled at our work, stressing the energy aspect.
This is against a background in which energy consumption has continued to increase substantially in most parts of Europe, and many Member States are having difficulty meeting the Kyoto objectives.
New tools for saving energy are important, therefore.
Latest reports in my home country indicate that it is set to exceed the CO2 emissions quota for the 2005-2007 period by 14%.
Criticism has also been levelled at the âtop-runnerâ approach that we have used here.
I believe, however, that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about what we mean by this.
We want the leading and best technology as a yardstick for future implementing measures.
This forms a framework for decisions, but does not exclude anyone from the market.
On the contrary, I think that we have a system that leaves scope for continuous improvement.
The report is also criticised for not having heeded the three pillars of sustainable development.
It is said that we have given priority to the environment at the expense of social and economic issues.
That criticism is wrong, and I think that this is self-evident if one studies what we say about the life-cycle approach and our support for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
We are aware of the economic issues, the social issues and the possibilities, but also the risks.
When all is said and done, early attention to environmental issues, as the Commissioner also said, is more economical than many other methods of environmental governance, for instance subsidies, and also labelling, unfortunately.
It has become apparent that we obtain very little value for money from subsidies at the intervention stage.
I should also like to point out that, just as we did when we were considering the Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy, we have given our support here to measures applicable to SMEs.
We also call on the Commission to establish a database in order to facilitate the incorporation of the life-cycle approach and eco-design into the activities of all enterprises.
This is an innovative concept.
The scope is broad, but in actual fact what we have here is an organised regulatory framework for how to proceed, how to choose what is important and how to set requirements in the future: the prototype for good governance, in other words.
There have been no objections here in Parliament to the fact that the European Parliament will not in future be determining how much energy a product should consume.
On the contrary, we are saying that this will be determined where there is the expertise.
In my opinion, what we are proposing is an important simplification.
Self-regulation also has a role to play, in Parliamentâs view, but only if it produces better, faster results than would the regulated procedure.
Unfortunately, although I did not quite catch what the Commissioner said at the end, I do not think that this Parliament will at any rate be able to reach agreement with the Council at this reading, and that means we lose a fair amount of time.
We had wanted to make faster progress, and we want the Directive to define a work plan, including for the products that are responsible for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions.
We want to proceed quickly, as it is our opinion that much time has been lost.
I wish to thank my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation on the preparation of this report.
I should like to express my thanks for your understanding when I took over from MrsÂ Ries, who became Belgian State Secretary for European Affairs.
I should also like to thank the Commission for its goodwill in wishing to reach a speedy agreement with the Council.
I also think that we have been very united, and that has been a great strength.
Our views still differ on a number of small points, for instance with regard to the legal basis and conformity assessment, but we shall not let the details obscure the fact that we have been united.
Parliament wants rapid progress and wants to implement the necessary measures promptly.
I hope that the Council, and Parliament with the new Members elected after us, will be able to reach swift agreement on this so that there is no further delay to these important measures.
Â Â  . Madam President, the design of appliances, IT systems and industrial motors is crucial not only for climate change and security of supply but also for the overall economy in Europe.
This offers the single largest potential in respect of climate change, and also the most immediate potential because turnover times for such appliances are sometimes two to three years and at most ten to fifteen years, which is much quicker than for energy infrastructures.
It also represents the cheapest potential, because the additional money spent on upgrading a design is more than compensated for by reduced electricity costs during its life cycle.
Unfortunately, the European Union is lagging behind other economies, such as Australia, the US and Japan.
Even China now performs better on standard-setting than the EU.
We are pleased, therefore, that the EU Commission has come forward with this proposal and that Parliament was able to strengthen the proposal.
A good eco-design directive is important not only for Europe but also for the world.
There will soon be between 500 and 700 million new middle-class citizens in India, China and other such countries, so the single biggest challenge for the world economy is to be able to offer efficient demand-side products, such as appliances and computers.
Otherwise we can simply forget about climate change.
This also constitutes a huge opportunity for European industry because it will open up an enormous market.
Unfortunately, sections of European industry have been lobbying for a weak directive.
Why?
These are the same industries that want to delocalise production to India, China and similar countries.
This shows that the same industrialists who do not care about the global environment also do not care about creating added value and jobs in Europe.
I hope the Council will not give in to these lobbyists.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, cutting the amount of energy used by appliances is to everyoneâs benefit. It benefits the environment, enabling us to meet our Kyoto targets faster and more cheaply, and it benefits the consumer, because he saves on his electricity and energy bills.
It is also an opportunity for industry to put innovative products on the market, especially if we have uniform standards here all across Europe.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore greatly welcomes the European Commissionâs proposal and we expressly thank Commissioner de Palacio, for her commitment.
Like the other groups, however, we would like a few changes to the Commissionâs proposal.
We want greater clarity about what the Commission will actually do with these powers in the next few years.
For that reason, we would like a list of products that will be subject to implementing measures in the first few years if there are no voluntary agreements to achieve the same objective faster.
We want the text to contain fewer vague legal terms, and above all we want very strict supervision of the market; that is a priority for the PPE-DE Group.
We cannot have a situation, with this or other matters, where honest people eventually lose out, where a person who only applies the EC mark when he really keeps to the rules is punished because others stick the mark on without complying with anything.
That is why there must be extremely severe penalties.
We must have better controls and the requirements must be such that they actually can be controlled.
We must be ambitious, because only then will there be no motivation for individual Member States to go beyond the minimum standards.
That is why we are being flexible in the matter in voting for the two legal bases tomorrow if the aim is ambitious, and the Councilâs reaction discourages me a little here.
I am very disappointed that the Irish Presidency and the Council as a whole are being so hesitant.
It will encourage individual countries to go it alone. I do not think that is a good thing.
We need common European standards, and I must personally say that in my ten yearsâ work in the European Parliament I have seldom seen the Council behave so destructively or a presidency handle a matter so badly.
I appeal to the Council and above all to the Irish presidency, which unfortunately is not represented here today, but perhaps someone can pass the message on, to be guided by Parliamentâs amendments, at least when working on the common position in June.
If they do not do that, if the Council simply ignores these amendments, then we will have a rag bag of national rules, we will miss the Kyoto targets and consumers will continue to waste money unnecessarily on power and energy.
Then the Irish presidency will have failed on this point.
Its last chance is to really follow Parliament and I strongly appeal to it to do so.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer the rapporteur my most sincere congratulations and also my thanks.
She has taken on a very difficult and highly complex dossier at relatively short notice.
Coordination in the European Parliament has not suffered at all as a result.
We have already heard a large number of good arguments this evening for why it is so important for our environment and for the creation of incentives for industry that we should adopt this directive quickly.
I therefore share my fellow Membersâ disappointment that no agreement was reached with the Council at first reading.
I understand that it is of course a very difficult dossier for the Member States, too, but we in the European Parliament have shown that, despite starting from very different positions, it is possible to come closer on very important issues.
One point on which we have not been able to agree and where tomorrowâs vote will show what the European Parliamentâs position is, is the question of the legal basis.
For me, it is quite clear from the title of this directive that environmental protection is one of its priorities.
That is why I do not find it satisfactory to take only Article 95, the internal market article, as the legal basis.
If we want a good environment and energy policy, it makes no sense to put Member States that are more advanced or have stricter requirements in a particular matter on a leash and shackle them.
I know that the debate between those present has already been closed, but I would like to underline once again here that I and my group think it is very important to have two legal bases if there is to be a better environment and energy policy in the Member States.
Â Â  Madam President, industry complains about regulation and interference from Brussels.
I can hardly think of legislation more likely to cause concern to some manufacturers than that which indicates in such detail how they will make their products and what minimum standards of energy they must achieve, with lots of detailed specifications still to come, appliance-by-appliance, determined by the comitology procedure and very much out of the public gaze.
How do we justify interference in the private market on such a scale â interference and the setting of standards that go far beyond health and safety requirements?
I believe that the potential benefits of energy-saving, of making more efficient products and of reducing carbon dioxide emissions speak for themselves.
I am concerned that in an attempt to reconcile the different requirements of Member States â between hot countries and cold countries â the Commission may come up with compromises that set standards well below the best that can be achieved.
I urge the Commission to be ambitious.
This is a positive move.
In selling it to citizens and consumers alike, there is a simple message: by cutting energy use we can help them save money and we can all contribute to do our bit to save the planet.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to focus on one specific issue.
We have talked in broad terms of the importance of this report and the importance of the global effects it might have.
But let us look at one small issue and how this report could affect it: let us take a look at ink-jet printer cartridges, probably one of the most widely used products in the world.
The reality is that all the large manufacturers are using every trick in the book to prevent consumers getting a fair deal, at the same time undermining the need to improve energy efficiency, which is a crucial element in protecting the environment.
The manufacturers need this legislation to make them do the right thing.
There is big money at stake here.
On average a refill cartridge can be sold for about half the price of a new product, and the consumer should have the change to reap the benefits.
We need amendments in this report to ensure that those cartridges are refilled.
Research carried out by organisations such as the Consumers' Association has highlighted the kinds of tactics adopted by some of these big-name companies.
For example, the installation of microchips which suggest that cartridges are empty and even in some cases stop printers working, when in fact they have plenty of ink left.
This is a waste of resources and a waste of energy.
Surveys demonstrate quite clearly a variety of different costs of different printer operating systems, all brought about by operators using these methods which oblige the consumer to buy printer cartridges over and over again, instead of reusing and refilling.
If we can build into the new eco-design legislation a requirement that cartridges must be refillable and recyclable, it will be a major step forward in both protecting the rights of the consumer and benefiting the environment.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate my congratulations to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Thors.
Congratulations are also due to MrÂ Turmes, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I should like to thank both honourable Members for their work and contributions to the debate.
I certainly believe that what we are concerned with here is a major initiative.
It could have a real impact on the aim of decoupling growth from increased energy consumption.
Significant savings in energy consumption can be made.
I agree with the honourableÂ Members who pointed out that presenting an overview of the whole process is the best way to avoid deluding ourselves.
After all, there is no point in economising in part of the process of creating a product or in part of its useful life if the end result is a negative overall balance.
A detailed list of the Commissionâs position on the various amendments will be forwarded to the Presidency(1).
Nonetheless, I should like to say a few words on some of the issues raised and discussed in the course of the debate.
I shall deal first with the question of Council approval.
I would like to make it clear to the House that I had hoped this text would be agreed with the Council, and I did my best to ensure agreement, as this would have enabled the text to be adopted at first reading.
The fact is that when it came down to it, the IrishÂ Presidency encountered serious obstacles to achieving our objective the first time round.
Nonetheless, I feel it is very likely that this text will be adopted at second reading, should it prove impossible to adopt it at first reading.
As many honourableÂ Members have pointed out, the matter is urgent.
It is essential to put this new Community regulation in place once and for all.
In addition, comitology procedure must be launched.
The procedure needs to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to subsequent change and technological development.
It must also be able to provide an appropriate response on more specific matters.
On the subject of comitology and lack of control by Parliament, I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are party to global generic agreements concerning good legislation and the institutionsâ capacity to forge links between themselves.
I believe these agreements provide sufficient assurance that there will be no deviation or real difficulties regarding the implementation of these measures.
As to the legal basis, Parliamentâs Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has confirmed that ArticleÂ 95 of the Treaty is the only appropriate legal basis for this proposal.
I endorse this view, and hope you will too.
These are the key issues I wished to mention.
I must emphasise the urgency of adopting this measure.
I very much hope that by the time we meet again in June, the Councilâs common position will be as close as possible to the proposal put forward by Parliament itself.
Adoption of the text at second reading should then be fairly straightforward, always supposing it is not adopted at first reading.
I hope adoption will be possible as soon as the new Parliament assembles.
The text certainly needs to be adopted before the end of this year.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.(2)
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0154/2004) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending the Directive establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community, in respect of the Kyoto Protocol's project mechanisms.
Â Â  . Madam President, first I should like to thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, for the work on the report and, in particular, the very constructive attitude in the negotiations on the compromise package, which should allow us to reach a first-reading agreement on this important proposal.
A first-reading agreement on what is termed a 'linking' directive will have been reached within a mere 10 months, confirming the European Union's strong continuing commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its flexible mechanisms.
A first-reading agreement reaffirms the high priority that the European Union gives to taking concrete action to tackle climate change.
It will provide an important signal to our partners, in particular developing countries and economies in transition, including Russia, of our continuing support for the Kyoto Protocol and our firm intention to tackle climate change multilaterally.
It will assist our partners in their sustainable development through the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how.
The compromise package before Parliament will give an important boost to the Kyoto Protocol and its project mechanisms: Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism.
It will create a demand for credits from JI and CDM projects by allowing around 12Â 000 companies across Europe to use Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism credits for compliance with their obligations under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
By doing so it will enhance the cost-efficiency of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in a way that also benefits developing countries and economies in transition.
I want to emphasise that the agreement being discussed today is fully consistent with the Kyoto Protocol's implementing provisions, which are usually referred to as the Marrakech Accords.
As you know, the Kyoto Protocol contains no provisions on how companies can use JI and CDM credits.
This directive now clarifies how this will be implemented by the European Union.
The compromise package before you is very delicately balanced.
It addresses Parliament's concerns by providing a careful balance between the quality and quantity of the Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism credits to be used in the EU trading scheme while at the same time keeping it robust and simple.
The Commission would now ask you to support this compromise package and, in doing so, take another determined step in strengthening the European Union's response to the challenge of climate change.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to start by thanking my fellow shadow rapporteurs: Mr Davies of the Liberals, Mr Bowe of the Socialists, Mrs Garcia-Orcoyen Tormo of the Christian Democrats and Mr Blokland of the EDD Group.
I am indebted to them for the unanimity and support.
I would thank the Irish Presidency for its constructive way of negotiating.
I also wish to thank the Commission, which has cooperated well, although it is not formally obliged to do so.
I am also indebted to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
We have reached an agreement at first reading.
I will list nine points.
In my view, the result is sound.
Point 1: this linking directive enters into effect as soon as 2005.
Companies can start now; they are given legal certainty now.
Point 2: this linking directive is independent of the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol, as is the law on emission trading.
For us in Europe, Kyoto is starting to take effect now.
We will not wait until Russia ratifies Kyoto.
One hundred and twenty countries, two-thirds of the world population, have already ratified Kyoto.
Point 3: energy companies and large firms can now earn emission allowance by investing in the switch from Chinese coal-fired power stations to gas, in making coal-fired power stations more effective, in solar power stations in Indonesia, in wind farms on the coastlines of developing countries or in retrieving spent gas from rubbish tips.
There are many more possible ways to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
Point 4: we have followed the Kyoto Protocol in deciding that the construction of nuclear power stations is not permitted.
Point 5: carbon sinks are out of the question because â or so this House sees it â growing trees are only an interim solution.
Trees fall over or burn down.
Even if trees die a natural death, they expel all the carbon absorbed.
Biomass or bio-fuels, however, are very much an option.
Governments can also gain experience with sinks.
Point 6: large hydro-electric power stations are only possible if the criteria of the World Commission on Dams are observed.
Although hydropower actually helps in the fight against climate change, ecological and social criteria should also be taken into consideration.
On this score too, we are stricter than the Kyoto Protocol.
Point 7: the agreement that the Member States have to make half of their Kyoto efforts in their own countries and half abroad, has been re-confirmed.
Agreements only to commit industry to the ceiling make no sense, because this leads to governments, at least some governments, making 50% of their investments abroad, with industry making a further 25% of the countries' investments abroad.
Ultimately, only 25% will be invested at home and 75% abroad.
By acting in this way, we would put our ecological credibility on the line.
Point 8: outside Europe, there is a great deal of interest in our system of emission trading and in this linking directive.
Fifteen states in the United States and four provinces in Australia intend to set up comparable emission trading systems.
The Commission will be examining whether they can plug into our European system.
The same applies to Canada and, hopefully in future, also to Japan.
In that way, a start is being made on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol before it enters into effect officially.
Point 9: we will need to extend the scope of the emission trading system to include aviation and subsequently also road transport.
This is preferable to opting in favour of domestic Joint Implementation Projects, as is being suggested by some.
Finally, the French Government and French industry have no faith in this linking directive. Neither has Greenpeace.
This is old-fashioned dogmatism.
I am pleased that all political groups, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have more insight and are prepared to support this compromise.
Climate change is deteriorating by the day; we must act in unison.
For climate change, it makes no difference where the greenhouse gas is produced.
Armed with this linking directive, we will now enter upon the worldwide struggle to solve the climate issue.
Â Â  Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and I hope that one reading will suffice.
I would like to concentrate on just one thing, namely sinks. I disagree on this point.
I have just returned from a trip to South America as part of an official delegation.
Surprisingly enough, they have been looking very closely at this Linking Directive, at any rate in some of the ministries, and I was repeatedly told how important it is for them that sinks, in other words forestry, should be included.
I can see why.
If we included forestry, it would be an extraordinarily great help not least in fighting poverty in those countries, or in creating alternatives to drugs in places where they are cultivated.
I would also like to mention that just under a year ago France concluded an agreement with Colombia which did include forestry; there is therefore a conflict between Parliament and the Council of Ministers that we will not survive in the long term.
Â Â  Â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now some two years since the EmissionsÂ TradingÂ Directive opened up a new way forward for the most polluting sectors of industry.
These sectors were to become involved in the struggle to reduce emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere.
This represented a complex first step that was only taken recently.
It was certainly necessary if the EuropeanÂ Union is to make progress towards meeting its commitments on climate change.
It is true, however, that a climate of fear and misgiving developed with regard to practical implementation.
This is why the changes contained in this linking directive are so significant.
The present linking directive allows the implementation of clean development projects.
It also provides for the recognition of emission reduction certificates.
The linking directive sends out an important political signal from the EuropeanÂ Union to the developing countries, indicating that, by way of these projects, developing countries are likely to obtain far more substantial aid than they probably do at present for environmentally friendly development.
A message is also being sent to the sectors concerned making it clear that the EuropeanÂ Union really does intend to implement the means to facilitate involvement in trading in emissions rights.
I believe MrÂ deÂ Roo, the rapporteur, fully appreciated the need to ensure the linking directive was very flexible.
He therefore worked admirably with all the political groups.
In addition, he conducted excellent negotiations with the Council.
I trust all this will bear fruit tomorrow and that a majority of the House will vote in favour at first reading.
Nonetheless, it seems some opportunities were not seized or perceived as such.
Further, some of the progress has been too faltering.
Consequently, the flexible mechanism is not as flexible as it ought to be.
The rapporteur is aware of this, as we have discussed it together.
I have in mind firstly domestic or national projects, implementation of which has been restricted to rail networks.
I feel it could have been possible to accept a far wider range of situations without detriment to the spirit of this directive.
I also feel excessive caution was exercised when deliberating on the admissibility and implementation of hydro-electric projects.
I believe such projects are needed in these countries, and that they are adequately provided for in the Marrakesh agreements.
Further, I agree with MrÂ Linkohr that sinks are called for in these countries too, and that excessive caution has been exercised in this regard also.
Nonetheless, there are some very positive developments worthy of note.
One of these is the solution of the problem of supplementarity.
I could also mention the capacity of the MemberÂ States to organise themselves, share common objectives and determine the best mix of appropriate policies in order to achieve them.
I believe this is an excellent result, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again.
Â Â  Madam President, I welcome this agreement.
It is absolutely essential to ensure the workability of the emissions trading system when it starts in January 2005.
I want to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done.
I have seen a lot of rapporteurs and he really has done a very good job.
He has secured an agreement with the Council which is a practical compromise and which will reap considerable environmental rewards whilst providing for industry a great deal more certainty than the original proposal.
I am happy that we have been able to retain the cap on the number of credits issued.
It is a sensible solution allowing Member States to monitor and control the market and make sure it is not flooded.
On specific issues, I believe we have been able to persuade the Council of the need for greater reflection on whether to include domestic projects.
The guidelines we have laid down there are useful.
As regards 'sinks' I feel we have the best possible deal: a prohibition on companies using credits from land-use projects and carbon forest sinks until at least 2008.
We will find this is a very difficult thing to calculate and we need time to look at it more closely.
Concerning big hydro and nuclear projects, it seems disappointing if we wanted the allowances for such projects excluded permanently from the scheme, but in reality Parliament has been able to ensure that the projects and the take-up within the European scheme are at least in line with Kyoto and the World Commission on Dams and the Marrakech Accords.
It is not really a bad result.
Our message to EU governments is clear: real, environmental improvement through emissions reductions must be brought about by long-term, sustainable effort at home and not by cheap, ill-advised and potentially detrimental projects in the poorer countries.
Member States: we will be watching you!
Â Â  Madam President, no sooner had agreement been reached with the Council, than Greenpeace, the WWF and the RSPB were denouncing it as inadequate and calling on Members to throw it out.
Some Members may vote against it when the time comes, but they will probably come from amongst those who tend to put the interests of industry before those of the environment.
I am not really sure whether WWF counts them amongst its friends.
I took a certain malevolent delight, especially with the election approaching, in our Green rapporteur having been denounced by Greenpeace for his work, but personally I congratulate him.
He has done a great job in keeping all sides of this House together.
Of course the agreement is weak, but we have to start somewhere.
The reality is that we know there was resistance, even amongst some Member States, towards the implementation of these measures.
I am glad that the EU is still trying to lead the world on the whole issue of climate change.
However, the real issue is, firstly, that we have to get some sort of agreement up and running and, secondly, that we have to move forward.
I am concerned about what will happen if the Kyoto Protocol does not come into force.
That is the key question that the Commissioner is seeking to address this week with colleagues.
Can we persuade Russia â the crucial element in the equation â to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol and bring it into force?
I do not like having to give in to ransom demands. However, for once, it might be a price worth paying.
Â Â  Madam President, last year, Mr Moreira da Silva, who was at the time a Member of this House, concluded an agreement with the Council on the trade in greenhouse gases.
That was not easy, because the agreements that had already been reached in a number of countries with industry to reduce greenhouse gases had to be incorporated in European policy.
Today, or in actual fact, tomorrow after the vote, what I see as a fresh agreement will have been reached and new arrangements will be in place by means of which emission trading will be extended to include third countries.
I am proud that we, the European Union, have demonstrated that we are serious about Kyoto and that we not only conclude agreements but also live by them.
We, in Europe, have adopted defensive policy in the environmental field for too long.
With the new CDM â Clean Development Mechanism â instrument and joint implementation, we can once again take the lead on the world stage.
Thanks to the development and export of clean technology, we are creating a new market for cleaner production processes.
Our European industry stands to benefit from this.
However, I expect the transfer of environmentally-friendly techniques also to help developing countries to introduce sustainability and it will also bring them more prosperity.
The exchange projects that can now be implemented with the developed countries or with countries in the process of moving towards a market economy, expand the market on which emission is being traded and thus reduce the costs per reduced tonne of greenhouse gas â a high environmental yield at the lowest possible costs.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also in discussions involving the rapporteur, much has been said about the risks which placing the reductions outside of oneâs own Member State can entail.
Since we have now agreed at European level that joint implementation and CDM are all too supplementary, we have to settle for the review that has been arranged.
What matters now is that industry takes what is now available.
Mr de Roo has done his level best, on which I should like to congratulate him warmly.
He has made sound negotiations possible, for which I should like to thank him.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, before turning to the de Roo report I would like to say a word about emissions trading in general, about the Moreira da Silva report, which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten also mentioned.
In the Moreira da Silva report, Parliament proposed introducing an upper limit, a cap, for the national allocation plan, and we wanted every countryâs national allocation plans to set the same limits.
Unfortunately, the Council rejected the amendment at the time.
That is one of the reasons why we are now faced with a situation where we have a hotchpotch of national allocation plans which are not really compatible with each other.
Many Member States had still not notified a plan by 31 March at all, and some have submitted plans that are far from ambitious.
I would like to expressly support you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, in your commitment to encourage the Member States to implement the spirit and content of this directive, and if necessary bring proceedings before the European Court of Justice to oblige them to do so.
Even though Parliamentâs amendment was not adopted verbatim, the requirements of Annex III do not in fact allow industry to be granted generous increases in emissions.
It is therefore very important that you keep your eyes open here.
We have also written a letter to that effect to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.
We cannot allow industry in those Member States that are relatively ambitious to suffer because a few Member States continue to believe they need not do anything at all; something must also be done at home, important as Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism are.
This brings me to the de Roo report.
I believe the de Roo report is an important step forward in international climate policy.
We are strengthening the Kyoto process and we have also shown that there are certain limits here.
Unlike Mr Linkohr, however, I believe we were right to stick to the position of not including sinks.
You are almost always right, Mr Linkohr, but I believe you have miscalculated here, even if you are a physicist.
In emissions trading itself we have an emission factor of zero for biomass, which means you do not need certificates at all if you burn biomass.
Biomass burning gains a great deal from that.
If we now also pay money for planting trees, we have deceived ourselves and are not protecting the climate.
Â Â  . Madam President, firstly â and you have heard me say this before â we will have to live with the issue of climate change for a very long time â maybe for generations.
It will pose a challenge to humanity for generations to come.
It is important that the European Union should continue to show leadership on this issue.
We should continue to demonstrate that we are willing to take action at home and internationally, that we believe that a truly global problem also requires a global solution.
We will also have to be cost-efficient.
To be credible, we will have to look at the most cost-efficient solutions; this is part of that process, and in doing so we will be able to mobilise all the various groups of stakeholders.
This will help us to do so.
My thanks for this again go both to the rapporteur and to the whole European Parliament.
I would like to comment on two points mentioned during the debate.
First of all, Russia.
As has been mentioned, a team of Commissioners will be going to Russia later this week in order to discuss a number of issues, including many areas of cooperation with Russia.
We should not wait for Russia â that is true â but the 120 countries that have ratified are not waiting; they are actually carrying out actions on the issue of climate change already.
However, we should of course keep up the pressure on Russia and make it clear to the Russians that they hold the key to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, that what they do is important, and that we are counting on them.
Therefore we will continue to work on that.
The other issue is an important one: the argument about sinks and our position on sinks.
Again, I am satisfied that our position on sinks is consistent, since in all the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol we have remained rather sceptical on sinks â at least until such time as we can monitor and control sinks and count them reliably.
That is one of the arguments, the other being the temporary nature of sinks and emission reductions from them.
We have also pursued our line in this proposal and I welcome that.
These are the arguments.
We still have too many uncertainties, and we have to clarify those; but of course they are in the Kyoto Protocol, and one day I hope that this will also be another opportunity for Brazil and other countries.
However, as long as we do not have full knowledge, we should be careful.
This will be another effective instrument within our climate change policy.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, there are more than 63 of us who, as Members of the European Parliament, have tabled a motion of censure on the Commission, not because we lack confidence in all the Commissioners but because it is the only means we have of attributing responsibility for the Eurostat scandal.
We ask the Commission to attribute responsibility itself and, if it will not do so, we are obliged to table our motion of censure covering everyone.
There are 67 signatures, 60 of which were verified a couple of hours ago.
There are two further signatures verified by the services, and there are two that the services are declining to verify and in connection with which we have delivered written confirmations.
There should now, therefore, in any case be 64 signatures with the services, and the Bureau thus has no other choice than to note that a motion of censure has been tabled with 63 signatures, in other words the necessary number of signatures.
It must therefore be placed on the agenda within 24 hours, and there must be a vote within 48 hours.
I hope that the President is in a position to note that the 63 signatures have now been obtained and that the services are not interpreting the Rules of Procedure properly by trying to get people to withdraw their signatures.
Â Â  We have noted what you say.
We shall of course look more closely at the issue, check the names and come back to the matter tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is a report (A5-0265/2004) by MrÂ Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on batteries and accumulators and spent batteries and accumulators.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in particular the rapporteur, MrÂ Blokland, for his report.
The Commission proposal for a new battery directive seeks to extend the scope of the existing Community legislation on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances to all batteries and accumulators placed on the Community market.
Today the existing legislation covers only 7% of all the portable batteries sold each year in the European Union.
This has hindered the setting up of efficient national collection and recycling schemes.
Consumers have also been confused as to what is to be collected, and what not, and have therefore not participated effectively in the national collection schemes.
Consequently, today many batteries still end up in the environment.
In 2002, for example, approximately 45% of the total volume of portable batteries sold in the 15-member EU was landfilled or incinerated.
The current proposal aims to achieve a high level of environmental protection while at the same time contributing to proper functioning of the internal market for batteries.
In this respect the Commission's proposal has two main goals: creating a closed loop system for all batteries and accumulators, and introducing a producer responsibility scheme.
The proposed closed loop system requires Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent final disposal of spent batteries and achieve a high level of battery collection and recycling.
I am confident that the proposed collection targets for portable batteries, in combination with the proposed high recycling targets, will protect our environment against the risks involved in the disposal of those batteries.
Moreover, the proposal addresses the issue of the uncontrolled disposal of hazardous batteries containing mercury, cadmium or lead.
In this respect, in addition to the existing restrictions on the use of those substances, established by the end-of-life vehicles directive, the following additional measures would be introduced: a ban on landfilling and incineration of all industrial and automotive batteries, which covers most batteries containing lead or cadmium, and an additional collection target for portable nickel-cadmium batteries, which requires monitoring of the waste stream to determine the volume of discarded portable NiCad batteries.
The extended impact assessment has identified the proposed policy options as the most sustainable from an economic, social and environmental viewpoint.
I turn now to the introduction of a producer responsibility scheme.
The application of the producer responsibility principle is an important step towards incorporating the external environmental costs into the production phase and, at the same time, towards encouraging producers to market more environmentally friendly products.
All batteries and accumulators should be diverted from the waste stream and recycled in order to avoid environmental damage and recover the various metals they contain.
To achieve this goal, we need to create a closed-loop system and make battery producers responsible for the products they make.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I should like to elucidate my report on batteries and accumulators.
At the European Parliamentâs emphatic insistence, there is at long last a proposal by the European Commission.
A number of points of the Commission proposal can be seen in a positive light.
First of all, all batteries fall within the scope of the directive.
Secondly, there are binding collection targets.
Thirdly, recycling percentages and recycling efficiencies are binding, and fourthly, producer responsibility plays a major role in the financing mechanisms.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we have held an extensive debate on batteries.
More specifically, we discussed the avoidance of the use of heavy metals and collection targets.
Agreement has been reached with all groups on most points in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Even about the collection targets for batteries, we have reached a broadly supported compromise.
Since the sales figures for batteries differ quite considerably from one Member State to another, certainly after 1 May, a decision has been made in favour of proposing a percentage of the sales as the collection target.
As far as the avoidance of the use of heavy metals is concerned, developments have been underway for years.
EU legislation now stipulates that the heavy metals mercury, lead and cadmium are prohibited in materials and parts of vehicles which are brought onto the market after 1 July 2003, as well as in new electrical and electronic appliances which are brought onto the market after 1 July 2006.
The key problem involving batteries and accumulators is precisely the presence of mercury, lead and cadmium, which are heavy metals.
On pages 9 to 12 of the explanatory note to the Commissionâs proposal, the harmful environmental and health effects of mercury, cadmium and lead are clearly described.
For that reason, most batteries containing mercury were already banned in 1998.
The guiding principle underlying drafts of the Commissionâs revised battery directive has always been a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries.
Surprisingly, the present Commission proposal has not opted for a ban on these, but for a so-called closed-loop system for cadmium.
However, there does not appear to be a closed-loop system since only 80% of portable nickel-cadmium batteries need to be collected.
Consequently, 20% of portable nickel-cadmium batteries end up as landfill or in an incinerator.
Since cadmium is a volatile metal, it will, in the case of waste incineration, inevitably end up in the atmosphere.
That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has introduced a ban on mercury, cadmium and lead.
In addition, we have included an extensive list with exceptions for cases in which no effective substitutes are available.
This includes batteries for hearing aids, emergency lighting, industrial batteries, lead accumulators and cordless power tools.
Although I personally do not think the last exception to be necessary, I have added it nonetheless in order to accommodate objections from a number of Members.
The substitute for nickel-cadmium batteries, namely nickel-metal-hydride batteries, operate at a temperature of -20Â° Celsius to +60Â° Celsius. As such, I can assume that these batteries can be used across the entire European Union.
Finally, I should like to react to the comic strip of the European Portable Battery Association, in which it is suggested incorrectly that all kinds of applications would no longer be permitted if the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy were to be adopted.
I have an old â four and a half years old â mobile telephone.
This old telephone contains a lithium-ion battery.
I am almost certain that the batteries in all your mobile telephones are nickel-metal-hydride or lithium-ion.
In short, if nickel-cadmium batteries are prohibited for these applications, there is no problem whatsoever.
Another example from the comic strip is that of lead accumulators in cars, which are not prohibited in the directive on end-of-life vehicles.
Neither are they prohibited in the framework of the battery directive, because, as you heard a moment ago, they are included in the list of exceptions.
The same applies to button cells in hearing aids and watches, cordless power tools, emergency lighting and all industrial applications.
Even the European consumersâ organisation BEUC is in favour of a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries for consumer applications.
Although, as you are aware, there are plenty of alternatives, I noticed that industry is, in principle, against a ban, to such an extent that they are opposed to it to this day, even though all the exceptions they required have been made.
I take the view that such arguments should not play a role in the decision-making.
I suspect there is a dangerous tactic behind this.
In this respect, it is worthy of note that industry, which is so very much resistant to a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries, is promoting alternatives for these on their own websites.
We should therefore also promote these alternatives, namely by excluding harmful heavy metals from batteries as much as possible.
Â Â  â Madam President, I have to admit that before I entered the European Parliament I was involved with nickel-cadmium batteries for ten years.
We even built a factory and I took out a number of patents, which have now expired.
I therefore have no economic interests to register.
I also have to admit that at the time we did not give much thought to what was to be done with the things later.
I therefore believe we are right to be looking at how such batteries can be recycled.
I would advise you not to ban things, however, but to introduce alternatives more quickly, and such alternatives exist in theory.
Small fuel cells may easily come on the market this year or next and they contain no heavy metals.
They also come from the same firms as make nickel-cadmium batteries, at any rate many have experience with them, and that would be my recommendation, instead of rushing straight to a ban.
Â Â  Madam President, batteries form part of our everyday lives.
In fact it is fair to say that the development of portable electric power, particularly rechargeable electric power, has revolutionised our lives.
Each one of us is probably carrying two or three batteries â in our phones, in our watches, in our car key fobs and maybe there are even one or two heart pacemakers in this Chamber.
Batteries have made a contribution to safety.
Cordless power tools have made building sites much safer and often in the case of power failure we rely on batteries for back-up lighting or emergency power.
Recently I was at a nuclear power station where they have a battery the size of a building which provides the back-up power in the event of a power cut.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal which is balanced and in proportion to the problem.
In particular, I congratulate the Commission on the way it addresses the problem of waste.
Some countries like Belgium have successfully removed batteries from the waste stream.
We should take care to look at the cost of this.
In Belgium it costs at least twice as much to collect the batteries as the actual value of the batteries themselves.
We need to have a market-led solution so that we do not find we are collecting things just for the sake of it.
As with most waste issues in my country, the United Kingdom's record is pathetic.
When adopted, I hope that the targets set by the Commission will be met and we do not repeat the situation we had with old fridges when the directive gathered dust on the shelf until it was too late to implement it in time.
I also hope that the UK government will correctly fund the local authorities which are charged with the task of collecting these batteries.
I support some of the amendments.
In particular, my Group supports the move not to set recovery targets based on an arbitrary number of grams â 160 grams for every country.
Such a one-size-fits-all policy would be bizarre in countries such as the Baltic States where the battery market is not even half of 160 grams.
To set the recovery targets based on a percentage is a much more sensible approach.
However, my Group will not support the amendments to Article 4 with regard to the bans on heavy metal.
Firstly, the alternatives are not developed in every single sector.
In the case of power tools in particular the alternative batteries have not performed as well and we would see tools having a much shorter life and being thrown away sooner than at present.
Secondly, in the United Kingdom we have had a number of studies on pollution looking at landfill and incineration.
Although we have cadmium in the environment, the source of cadmium from batteries is not significant.
If we wanted to cut back we would need to look at fossil fuels, fertilisers and the metallurgical industries.
Lastly, the timescale.
Batteries which are sold now will not come into the waste stream for more than 16 years.
Therefore the heavy metal ban does not solve the problem in the short term.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, we are indeed using more batteries, and that is causing us problems.
Firstly, we want to make batteries environmentally friendly to use, and secondly we do not want them to make our waste problem worse than it is.
This in fact means that we need a strategy that ensures that as few batteries as possible are landfilled, and secondly we must see to it that innovations are made in battery production.
I therefore also support the Commissionâs approach of including all batteries in the legislation and of ensuring there is producer responsibility in battery production.
I also agree with the many compromises we have reached together with the aim of making the collection and recycling of batteries better organised so that our waste problem will actually be reduced.
There are a variety of opinions in the House about how to encourage innovation and avoid heavy metals.
The important thing is that we send the signal that we want batteries that do not harm the environment, do not contain heavy metals and are easy to recycle.
Parliament must send this signal clearly so that the battery industry will innovate.
That can of course also be done using various deposit schemes, with a higher deposit charged on hazardous battery systems than on the others.
In the end, however, the consumer must also play his part.
Â Â  Madam President, despite the threat of a no-confidence motion, I hope that the Commissioner will not cancel her airline tickets to Moscow.
Lobbying has been intensive and persuasive over this issue.
I must admit that my views on points of detail have changed many times, but I have come to the conclusion that, while backing a closed-loop recycling system for cadmium batteries in the medium term, we should be looking in the long term for the replacement of such batteries because of their toxicity.
