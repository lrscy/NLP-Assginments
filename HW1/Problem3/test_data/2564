If we became a perfect pupil now in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, we would still suffer from past pollution, but the longer we wait to tackle greenhouse gas emissions in a serious manner, the more entrenched the commitment is.
Temperature rises have already been noted.
The half-a-degree temperature rise is similar to that observed at the end to the twentieth century.
However, what is more alarming is the projected sea-level rise, which is more than twice the three-inch rise that occurred during the latter part of the previous century.
Those numbers do not take into account the fresh water from melting ice sheets and glaciers, which could at least double the sea-level rise caused by thermal expansion alone.
Scientists have claimed that water temperatures in the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico have been as much as 3.6 degrees higher than normal this year.
That has helped to feed the hurricanes that have devastated the US Gulf coast and the Caribbean.
It has also helped to generate the warmer-than-normal air currents that have poured into the Amazon basin and prevented rain clouds from forming.
Greenpeace has warned that this yearâs experience could be a sign of things to come if practices such as deforestation and emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere do not stop.
By tackling climate change in a serious manner, we not only help to preserve our planet for our grandchildren and future generations, but we would also save them and ourselves monetary cost, given that the climate change costs incurred as we aim to protect disappearing species and habitats are very high.
Evolving players such as South Asia, Latin America and Africa require emission reduction policies that will not harm their economic development.
Climate change policies thus need to be designed to contribute to economic growth in the developing countries.
As I travel to Montreal next month as part of the European delegation, I look forward to seeing the global players face the reality of this year and work together as partners in tackling this extremely important global problem.
Â Â  Europe was among the first regions in the world to record the climatic changes that are the consequence of dangerous global climatic shifts.
Summers have become warmer, winters have become rainy, river flows have dwindled, soil humidity has diminished and we have recorded more floods, as well as extreme droughts and hurricanes.
There is no doubt that these changes spring directly from human activity, mainly in the developed countries that are mostly responsible for high emissions of greenhouse gases.
The largest polluters include the European Union.
Each year, disasters cause significant economic loss, loss of life and an increased incidence of the many diseases linked to environmental pollution.
Joint action by the biggest polluters â China, the United States, the European Union and India â in the fight against climatic changes is essential.
It is unrealistic to expect that mankind will give up the conveniences of modern life such as automobiles and other means of transport, in favour of bicycles.
What we need is therefore innovation in respect of existing technologies and the development of more environmentally friendly sources of power.
It is necessary to use more solar, water and wind power, and to boost research into these new forms of energy.
In Europe, we are witnessing the exodus of our young scientists to the United States, because Europe does not offer them adequate resources for carrying out effective research to a high standard in this area.
In addition, there are some fields of research that are not even covered in Europe.
Climatic change will have an impact on the health of Europeans.
As a result of climatic changes, Europe will be exposed to diseases that are not indigenous to this continent, being more typical of geographical zones lying further to the south.
Global warming may increase the incidence of infectious diseases transmitted by arthropods, such as mosquitoes spreading malaria or certain viral inflammations of the brain.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by making the observation that the Council Presidency left us waiting some 10 to 15 minutes for the beginning of this debate.
I would welcome at least an explanation and an apology; perhaps we will get one.
I wish to express my gratitude to Mr Wijkman for his dedication and hard work.
His was no easy task, and it is surely no secret that there have been debates within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, although we have been able to satisfactorily resolve these issues.
The report we have in front of us is a good one, and there is one particular aspect of it that I would like to highlight.
In Germany, there has been since Monday an agreement on a new Great Coalition, aspects of which agreement have come in for justified criticism: there are some compromises that not everyone can go along with.
The chapters on the environment, energy and climate change are, however, perfectly respectable, and I believe that they will enable Europe, too, to make progress.
Much in the coalition agreement is identical with what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has proposed in the Wijkman report, and that is an encouragement to the Commission to redouble its commitment to pursuing its objectives in such areas as air travel.
Where renewable energies are concerned, we â not only in the German Great Coalition but also in the amendments we have tabled to the Wijkman report â want a new priority to be given to heating, an area in which, for little expense, we can save a great deal of CO2, and it is for that reason that the Commission wanted to table a proposal for a directive on the subject.
There is, I think, one issue that neither the Great Coalition in Germany nor the Environment Committee have satisfactorily resolved, and that is nuclear energy.
I agree with Mrs GutiÃ©rrez that nuclear energy is indispensable if we are to solve the climate problem.
I would, nevertheless, like to see the report gain a large and convincing majority, and let me conclude by emphasising what Mr Wijkman said about there being a security problem as well.
According to one study by the Pentagon, climate change will, in the long term, represent a greater danger to the human race than international terrorism.
That should make it clear to one and all, that now is the time for action.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Wijkman for his excellent and hard-hitting report.
I would also like to congratulate Mrs Beckett on her commitment to climate policy.
Today, this House is once again calling for an ambitious climate policy and Commissioner Dimas has explained why it has every reason to do so.
In Montreal, we have to lay the foundations for a new climate policy.
We are faced with the enormous challenge of providing clean energy and cleaner transport, whilst at the same time reducing energy consumption.
So far, Europe has played a leading role, which has really paid off.
We certainly have something to celebrate in Montreal.
Europeâs key task is now to ensure that the largest CO2 emitter, the United States, will also accept obligations and that the involvement of such countries as China and India in the entire process will be honest.
That can only be done if the EU addresses the problems itself and demonstrates that the European economy will, in fact, be given an enormous shot in the arm by innovation, by being more energy efficient, by more efficient production and by bringing sustainable products onto the market.
Unfortunately, though, except for Great Britain, most countries do not meet the obligations themselves and sadly, the cleanest and most economical cars do not originate in Europe but in Japan.
We need to do better and do more!
That is only possible if we involve the public in climate policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I heartily endorse the comments of my group colleague, Dr Lucas, on the UK Governmentâs fairly patchy record on seriously tackling climate change.
However, if the Council is looking for some ambition, then it could do worse than to carefully examine and adopt MrÂ Wijkmanâs report.
The fact is that we need a step change in the way we debate climate change, particularly among the public.
We must start with our own actions, because those are the actions we can control best.
We need to realise that if we embrace the challenge, we can profit by our own example.
Renewable energy is the key plank of the solution.
My own country, Scotland, could lead the world in clean, green renewable energy.
We have waves, a long coastline, windswept hills, biomass and geothermal power, and the raw material for hydroelectric power falls from the sky on a regular basis, and yet we are not nearly investing sufficiently in renewable technologies in Scotland or in Europe.
In the case of Scotland, this is because the United Kingdom controls energy policy and remains wedded to a nuclear agenda, which I believe offers no long-term solution.
We in this House can play our part in this step change on renewable energy and the debate on climate change, and we must unite around Mr Wijkmanâs report.
The Commission can play its part by prioritising renewable energy in the FP7 Programmes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the greenhouse effect is the greatest problem that we have to face, because it involves a structural change in the conditions needed for life.
Our ability to address this problem has to be an essential element in what we do.
To that end, we must accept the Kyoto strategy and its implementation as overriding factors in all our decisions, as a legal basis and a basis for planning, and as a key factor in Europeâs internal and international policies from Montreal onwards.
The main thrusts of the Kyoto Protocol, namely convergence and contraction, show that our development and economic models need to change radically and to be geared towards a fairer, more rational way of managing resources.
I think we can achieve a figure of one tonne-of-oil equivalent per person.
Such a commitment should encourage us to save energy and to use alternative, renewable, democratically managed sources.
Any idea of resorting to nuclear energy â which is a finite and extremely hazardous source that entails unsolvable problems such as nuclear waste, and is not democratic â to meet this target and this need would be utterly unacceptable.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I find it hard to lend my approval to a report which contains so few constructive suggestions regarding practical steps that can be taken to prevent climate change, and which also includes no financial analysis.
In addition, the Millennium Development Goals and compliance with the recommendations contained in the Kyoto Protocol are insufficient on their own.
The latter commits individual governments and companies to a policy of implementing programmes aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and at putting in place emissions trading systems and energy saving regulations.
The main responsibility for environmental destruction lies with the industrialised countries.
The liberal lifestyles they enjoy and the consumer behaviour they promote lie at the root of this disaster, which has unimaginable consequences for health and for the future of the earth in general.
Above and beyond the measures to which previous speakers have already referred, equal importance should therefore be attached to changing peopleâs mindsets and to ensuring that they develop as individuals.
This has rightly been described as the move towards a culture of satisfaction, and it reverses the trend towards possession at any price and the unchecked accumulation of goods.
Â Â  MrÂ President, although global warming today appears to be an obvious fact, it is still a good idea to verify the analyses that attribute it almost exclusively to greenhouse gases, something that certain scientists dispute on the grounds that there might be other causes.
That being said, if it is proven that greenhouse gases are almost exclusively the cause, environmentalists should ask themselves whether they might not have gone too far in their relentless fight against any form of nuclear power, which undoubtedly presents risks, but which does not emit any greenhouse gases.
As the Wijkman report proposes, alternative energy sources must be encouraged, particularly solar and geothermal energy.
Such heavy restrictions cannot, however, be imposed on European countries alone, when China, the United States and a good many other countries are hugely increasing their CO2 emissions.
As for the storage of carbon dioxide, allow me to recommend a natural, efficient and beneficial method, namely reforestation, all the more so because systematic reforestation could be the subject of a wide-ranging international cooperation programme.
Â Â  Mr President, the debate is just about over and the scientific jury is largely agreed on the impact of greenhouse gases on our climate.
Economic losses due to weather-related natural catastrophes have increased six-fold since the 1960s.
The earthâs temperature is rising at an alarming rate.
The EUÂ 15 will not meet their current Kyoto targets on CO2 emissions reduction and nothing will be done about that.
At the COP 11/MOP 1 meeting in Montreal next month, the focus will be on post-Kyoto and on what happens beyond 2012.
Without genuine global cooperation, particularly from the worldâs largest producer of greenhouse gases, the US, any agreement will be meaningless.
It is a huge challenge.
We await the Commissionâs review of the operation of the emissions trading regime next June to keep the cynics and the âI told you soâsâ at bay and to maintain the credibility of the emissions trading scheme.
It is essential that we broaden its scope and set horizontal sectoral targets.
Too many sectors are excluded, which creates gaps and inefficiencies in the market, which risk pushing up the cost of doing business.
We are still only paying lip service to the whole area of energy efficiency, which has an enormous contribution to make.
We also need to focus on the development of substitute fuels and alternative technologies.
Public transport vehicles and captive fleets should use clean and alternative fuels to provide a stimulus for the market, for the private sector, and to kick start the process of installing a network of forecourt outlets.
We need excise regimes that favour bio-fuels and bio-flexi-fuels.
Why not legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources, for example 5% bio-ethanol mix in petrol, 2% bio-diesel mix in diesel vehicles, without any alteration necessary to the vehicles?
We need some radical thinking and radical action.
If we are convinced that CO2 emissions need to be reduced dramatically, then we have to stop tinkering at the margins of renewable energy and to achieve genuine liberalisation for electricity markets.
Let us put our money where our mouth is, look at FP7 and invest in this area.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Wijkmanâs report deserves our full attention.
This text must be considered as our road map to enable us to fight more effectively against climate change in the years to come.
The paths laid out are realistic, so it is up to us to adhere to them as rigorously as possible by relying on all the partners involved in implementing the report, from the Member States to the people, and by changing our production and consumption methods.
If there is, however, one crucial area in which we must have a far greater involvement by providing ourselves with financial resources equal to what is at stake, it is that of research policy, for there can be no new technologies or innovations without research.
Our researchersâ grey matter constitutes a resource for the European Union that we must optimise in order to rise to the challenge of sustainable development and climate change, without overlooking, of course, our responsibility towards the poorest countries.
Thus, in the future, we will need to have a research budget that is equal to our ambitions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it was gratifying to hear Commissioner Dimas express his support at the Beijing International Energy Conference the other day for Parliamentâs ambition of having 25% renewable energy by 2020, just as it was also gratifying to hear the Commissioner say that renewable energy is crucial to overcoming problems such as climate change and poverty and promoting general economic development.
If we are to create a market for renewable energy, the costs of todayâs unsustainable dependence on fossil-based energy sources must, however, be clearly shown.
It is not just a question of showing the effects on the environment and public health of sky-high emission levels.
Rather, the effects must also be expressed in terms of euros and cents.
Europe has already introduced a market-governed system of emissions trading.
Certainly, the part played by aviation in the system is the subject of discussion, but I also want to see marine transport and, above all, land-based traffic included.
It will only be once we clearly see the costs entailed in carbon dioxide emissions from this sector that we shall seriously boost the demand for, and the supply of, renewable energy sources.
My first question, then, is about whether â and, if so, when â the Commission intends to include the transport sector in European emission rights trading.
My second question is about the proportion of renewable energy sources.
We wish to increase these, but they do, of course, need also to be used.
When does the Commission intend proposing that the Auto Oil Directive, as it is called, be replaced by a minimum 10% admixture of ethanol in vehicle fuel?
Mr Wijkmanâs report makes it clear that living up to the Kyoto requirements is the first priority of the EU.
Whilst Kyoto is only a small step in the fight against climate change, we must throw our support behind it and urge those who have not signed up to do so immediately.
This morning I was glad to hear the Commission and the Council stress the importance of the next phase, because the real challenge is to set ambitious targets for the post-2012 period and to get all the major world actors involved.
I also want to support the amendments made by my colleagues in the GUE/NGL Group, particularly the assertion that the promotion of an unbridled free market has led to excess consumption, which in turn leads to increased emissions of greenhouse gases.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wanted us to talk about a very serious issue.
I wonder how many women this morning did not spray lacquer on their hair and which of us did not use an underarm spray.
In this way, we are helping to create the greenhouse effect.
They are simple things which even we overlook.
You are labouring in vain in your efforts, Mr Dimas, if you do not bring the Americans into the rules.
Let me quote you two statistics: the United States emits more pollutants than three-quarters of the members of the UN and the state of New York emits the same pollutants as the whole of Africa.
Consequently, whatever we do in Europe, unless we persuade the usual wayward party, by which I mean the United States, to take its responsibility, we shall fail.
This is a tragic truth.
We also need to see what is going to be done by China, as the most highly populated country in the world which alone has one quarter of the world's population.
Whatever we do in Europe, we will not achieve results.
We have the huge problem of the climate, which knows no borders.
We cannot put up barbed wire fences.
So we need to convince the Americans if we want to avoid disastrous results.
The course which is being traced with mathematical precision is that we shall suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs.
We all need to understand that the threat from Bin Laden and terrorism is much smaller than the environmental threat hanging over the Americans.
Consequently, if we want to achieve results, we need to bring the Americans into the rules.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Dimas, MrsÂ Beckett, only a few years ago, when climate change was being discussed, some people would smile dubiously.
Today, no one questions the obvious fact that these changes are taking place.
There is even a sense of urgency.
We must act immediately in order to respond to this threat, which is undoubtedly one of the most serious in the history of humankind, with a growing number of floods, droughts and hurricanes, a melting ice cap, our melting glaciers and perhaps, one day, the development of certain diseases.
In the face of this threat, therefore, we have an unprecedented opportunity to launch a real technological programme, enabling us to foster the innovation that we desperately require in order to create new jobs in Europe.
Europe and the world have held a great many debates, but acts are not enough.
The time has therefore come to have the political courage to give new impetus to the Kyoto Protocol.
Biofuels, solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, hydrogen, energy efficiency efforts: these technologies exist.
It is up to us to speed up their use in our urban planning policies and our construction methods.
We need to make use of all the possibilities offered to us.
There is no one ideal solution. Rather, we must combine the use of these different sources.
There are still too many restrictions on the implementation and marketing of technological innovations such as hybrid and electric vehicles.
Our fellow citizens are ready to assume their share of responsibility for this kind of energy control.
The United States, India and China are already taking initiatives, particularly in the field of nuclear energy.
It will be impossible for us to overlook nuclear energy, which does not emit any greenhouse gases.
What is Europe waiting for, moreover, to really open the debate - a serious debate, devoid of passion - on nuclear energy?
I call on you not to hold it up.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to be credible in the eyes of Europeans, the European Union has to leave its good intentions to one side and act practically by providing itself with ambitions linked to investments.
How much money will be allocated to road-rail transport?
When will we have trans-European networks, which we are still waiting for?
When will we have CAP appropriations for biofuels?
When will we see an increase in the research budgets designed to meet the great energy challenges, such as those relating to the hydrogen sector?
When will we see the Structural Funds and grants adjusted with a view to energy efficiency and energy saving?
I am thinking of the urban environment, housing and social housing.
When will we see ecotaxes levied on the carriage of goods, particularly in relation to sea transport?
When will we see a regulation of trade from the perspective of the fight against the greenhouse effect?
We are waiting for practical and operational responses, laying the ground for immediate action.
The European Union must act here and now in order to convince people, in order to serve as an example and in order to form new partnerships with the countries of the South.
We are still only at the stage of intentions.
Let us move on to actions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ Wijkman for a balanced report on an important issue.
I should like to emphasise that it is at present difficult to see Europe achieving the Kyoto objectives, for they are very demanding and the policy now being conducted does not look as if it will lead to our being able to fulfil these objectives at the first stage.
One reason for this is that the demands made by a modern environmental policy on energy policy are largely ignored.
If we consider the conditions as they stand, we shall not be able to fulfil the Kyoto objectives in terms of expectations concerning renewable fuels.
Such fuels will be developed and will play a larger role, but they will not solve the problems.
We cannot achieve the Kyoto objectives by regulating the economy or making savings, because such measures would interfere with the aim of creating basic conditions for a better economy that does more to meet environmental requirements.
We cannot solve the problems by causing the economy to grow more slowly.
Instead, we must conduct an environmental policy compatible with a consistent and credible energy policy, in which case we must also look at the basis of our energy supply.
Oil and gas are not the way of the future, yet we see how it is, above all, the use of oil and gas that increases when nuclear power is phased out, the consequence being growing carbon dioxide emissions.
With the present energy mix, nuclear power production in Europe accounts for 50% of carbon dioxide emissions and leads to reduced carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to those from private cars.
This shows the kind of figures we are talking about.
That being the case, nuclear power cannot be dismissed.
Nuclear power will not solve our environmental problems, but those problems cannot be solved and the Kyoto objectives achieved by ignoring nuclear power.
It is therefore an important task for this Parliament and also for the Member States to conduct a credible energy policy not aimed at phasing out nuclear power and replacing it by oil and gas.
Instead, we should ensure that nuclear power can play a significant role in the balanced energy policy that is needed.
Â Â  I would like to welcome Mr Anders Wijkman and others who share the belief that saving the planet is our own concern, not somebody elseâs.
The European Union must exercise all the influence it can to urge countries that still have not joined the Kyoto Protocol, even the most powerful ones, to do so.
It would be naÃ¯ve to claim that had the USA fulfilled the Kyoto Protocol requirements it would not have been devastated by the Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma.
But Nature did strike back at precisely the state that harms it most.
Unless the international community takes urgent and drastic measures to stop the further spread of global warming, our planet will turn into a hurricane bearing, fire and water- spitting monster.
The present report rightly offers to make the EU an even more prominent leader in terms of the use of renewable energy sources.
I also express my full support of the proposal with respect to increasing the awareness of EU citizens and involving them in environmental preservation.
We need to devote further energy to the development of a tax, sanctioning and promotion system that would encourage companies to operate in an efficient and environmentally friendly way.
Even more important is the lifestyle.
Each citizen of the EU should realise that living with the least possible pollution and tampering with the climate of the planet is not only noble and beautiful, but also a worthwhile undertaking.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, at the end of this month and the beginning of the next, the European Parliament will once again present its position on climate change at a UN conference.
Before this position is submitted to the international community for debate, it is crucial to ensure that it reflects the best interests of all EU Member States.
As MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and MrÂ HÃ¶kmark rightly noted, the role of nuclear energy should also be given due consideration.
Greenhouse gas emissions are still on the increase in many Member States.
Individual citizens will therefore have to play a greater part in joint efforts to limit emissions and to find a more sustainable lifestyle if the UN Convention and the Kyoto Protocol are to be fully implemented.
In this connection, an important aspect of the fight to reduce CO2 emissions is the integrated approach, which involves politicians, industry and society.
Adopting this integrated approach would be a more effective and less expensive way of reducing CO2 emissions.
It is based on the assumption that the responsibility for reducing emissions lies not only with car manufacturers and fuel suppliers, but also with vehicle users.
Other factors that warrant our attention include road infrastructure conditions and road traffic management systems, as indicated in the European Climate Change Programme II launched in October 2005.
Although the shift from a fossil fuel-based economy presents us with an historic business opportunity, it should not be forgotten that many countries with abundant renewable energy resources do not currently have the technologies needed to harness these latter.
This is particularly true in the case of developing countries.
The issue of energy subsidies is therefore very relevant to negotiations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Many methods have already been found to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Energy-saving and low-emission technologies are an effective tool in the fight against environmental pollution, but they should not be combined with the reduction in fossil fuel subsidies proposed by the rapporteur as a for the use of modern environmental protection solutions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, as a great Indian leader once said, the earth does not belong to us, we borrowed it from our children.
If we lose the battle against climate change, what kind of earth are we going to leave our children?
The diagnosis has been made.
All that is missing is the courage to put into practice more ambitious and effective policies.
Mr Wijkmanâs report is a step in the right direction.
Actions speak louder than words and, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, new technology must be adopted, and the international community must strive to honour the obligations of the Kyoto Convention.
The United States must assume its responsibilities.
I welcome EU dialogue with China and India, but it is also necessary to involve countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Russia, Japan and Indonesia and to remove contradictions such as fossil fuel subsidies.
Mr Dimas said that the Montreal Conference will not produce all of the solutions we are looking for.
Some solutions, however, are expected to come out of it.
Our children and future generations expect nothing less.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Beckett, I am glad that the Council Presidency is following our debate, and, before I say anything else, I would like to thank my good friend MrÂ Wijkman for the very ambitious report that he has put together on this subject.
The need for action is simply illustrated by the natural phenomena going on all around us, be it the fires raging through Southern Europe, the hurricanes in America or, indeed, the floods in the Austrian Tyrol, from which I come.
There is one mistake, though, that we cannot allow ourselves: we must be careful not to attribute everything to worldwide climate change or to say that such change is caused only by man-made CO2 emissions and is in some sense our own fault.
It is an unfortunate fact that effects occurring in nature are overlapping with those attributable to human agency; greater efforts must be made to research this area if it is to be possible in future to deliver reliable prognoses of climate development and, above all, to assess the effect of human activity.
It is also important, though, that long-term strategies should be in place to enable us to respond, and in order to give us the security to plan ahead.
It quite simply has to be brought home to business and industry where this road leads and what options will be available to them in the future.
That is of immense importance for Europe as a business location.
Let us also bear in mind the fact that the Community is currently responsible for only 14% of CO2 emissions, and so it is vitally important that not only the developing countries, but also, of course the USA â which is the principal source of emissions â should be brought on board.
The point in the report that needs to be underlined several times over is the one that says: âwe need a global strategyâ.
I have to say that I am not in agreement with my colleagues as regards nuclear energy, which I do not regard as an alternative to those technologies that produce CO2, since its long-term effects are too negative.
Most of all, we must not offer it to the developing countries as an alternative, quite simply because it cannot be safely used in them.
It is also important that we give more attention to transport and attempt in that area simply to make full use of the potential for CO2 reduction.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall use this opportunity to carry on where the previous speaker left off.
I have to say, following my visit to the United Kingdom last week, that I find it very irritating that Tony Blair and others are steering the climate change debate towards the idea that climate protection targets might be achieved by the greater use of nuclear power, which would produce energy that is alleged to be cleaner.
I would like to take this opportunity to disabuse you of a misconception, and to ask what you, in England, currently mean when you talk about cleaner nuclear energy.
Are you talking about the extraction of uranium, which is a peculiarly filthy business?
Are you talking about fuel enrichment, which is particularly dirty?
Are you talking about the conversion of uranium hexafluoride, which is a very difficult process involving high levels of environmental pollution?
When you talk about clean atomic energy, do you mean the manufacture of fuel rods in Russia?
Have you, in England, ever discussed how much waste you will have to dispose of, and when and at what cost you will do that?
How do you assess the dangers and risks involved in reprocessing?
Windscale is an example of the great experience you have had with the real damage reprocessing does to the environment and to people.
I am quite astonished that it is the British of all people, who in fact abandoned nuclear energy on economic grounds, who are pushing forward this crazy debate on âclimate protection through increased use of nuclear energyâ.
Let us just consider the global picture: if we want to be really efficient in making a contribution through nuclear energy to protecting the climate, we will have to build hundreds, thousands more nuclear reactors.
That would, in fact, involve the massive expansion of a new generation of fast breeders, which have already proved such a devastating failure in Europe.
It would involve the operation of reprocessing facilities throughout the world, because the stocks of uranium available would be nowhere near sufficient for such an expansion of nuclear energy.
To engage in such expansion at a time when we are debating terrorism and the risks of proliferation is irresponsible.
Even though it is far more difficult to address the problems of energy by means of maximising energy efficiency, cutting back our use of it, or some other approach, let us now, at last, start doing so and keep on doing so, rather than returning to the use of a technology that is actually already consigned to the past century and the pollution and waste from which we have not yet even begun to get to grips with.
Â Â  . Mr President, this has been an interesting and stimulating debate, marked by almost total welcome â quite correctly â for Mr Wijkmanâs report and for its contents, and by very real agreement on the nature and scale of the challenge.
It has also been marked by a strong emphasis from many speakers on renewable resources, with various examples of this being cited, and also by strong differences of opinion over nuclear power.
I would say to the last speaker, Mrs Harms, that if the only aspect of the climate change debate she heard in the UK was that of nuclear power, then she must have moved in very restricted circles, because there is a great deal being discussed in the UK, which has not actually made a fresh commitment to nuclear power, despite a commitment to discussing it.
In fact, energy efficiency is top of the UKâs list of policies for tackling climate change, just as she would wish.
There has been much emphasis on what are usually known in the jargon as âco-benefitsâ.
Some speakers emphasised the damage caused by air pollution by the same gases that are contributing to climate change, while others emphasised that, as we tackle climate change, we will derive other potential health benefits from the reduction in the use of those gases.
Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines asked about the role of agriculture.
As she may know, in countries such as New Zealand, livestock are the source of almost all greenhouse gas emissions, making this a particularly difficult problem to solve.
There is therefore no doubt that agriculture can, in certain circumstances, be part of the problem.
However, as a number of speakers mentioned with regard to biomass and biofuels, it also could also be part of the solution.
That is an issue that will come under increasing scrutiny.
I am sorry Mr Hegyi is opposed to carbon capture and storage.
The sad and blunt fact is that countries like India and China, which need to grow and develop in order to tackle poverty â and this was another issue referred to, again quite correctly, in the debate â have huge coal reserves and will use them, because they feel they have no choice.
It is surely better for us to try to find ways of helping them to do that sustainably, through technologies like carbon capture and storage, rather than simply telling them not to use those power sources, which I fear would be fruitless.
All the references made to the most vulnerable states and to the most vulnerable within other countries heighten the need for the actions the EU must take on adaptation, and support for adaptation, to impacts that we cannot avoid.
Strong emphasis has been placed on the role of the many other countries involved and on the need for a global dialogue â with which the Council wholeheartedly agrees â and there is clear agreement both that the EU should continue to take the lead internationally and that we should continue to place strong emphasis on delivering on our own programmes.
Mrs Doyle and Mr HÃ¶kmark both suggested that the EU is unlikely to meet its Kyoto targets.
That is not my understanding of the latest position as assessed by the Commission.
However, that is a report that we will be publishing as we approach Montreal, and it certainly remains the case that we must continue to maintain and indeed step up our own activity.
That brings me to the comments by both Mrs Lucas and Mr Smith, who quite rightly praised the ambition of the Wijkman report in setting a target of a 60% reduction in emissions by 2050, without apparently being aware that this is the target the UK Government set in its own Energy White Paper in 2003.
Perhaps, though, this should come as no a surprise, since Mrs Lucas had nothing good to say about the UKâs approach.
However, I must put it firmly on the record for her and on behalf of this Council that it is a waste of everybodyâs time to demand that the EU deliver a formal mandate and a formal timetable in Montreal.
This body above all should recognise that the world of imperialism is at an end.
We cannot just march into Montreal and dictate to the rest of the world how they should conduct themselves and go about their business, not least when we are talking to some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world whose priority, quite rightly, is development and feeding their populations.
We will not act in this manner.
If we are able to kindle a dialogue and spark a process in Montreal, it will be a real and substantial achievement, just as it was a real and substantial achievement to elicit the language and secure the programme of action agreed at Gleneagles.
We all agree that we ought to be moving faster, but let us at least recognise the fact that we are making some progress.
Â Â  . I should like to thank everyone who has participated in this rich and important debate.
The need to act urgently to tackle climate change was underlined by Mr Wijkman and others.
I believe that the action taken and the series of new initiatives put forward by the Commission since the adoption of its communication in February clearly demonstrate its determination to act in this area.
The European Union's first priority in Montreal is to build broad international support for further action and obtain agreement on starting a formal process to discuss the shape of a future multilateral climate change regime.
Once the discussions get going, the European Union will need to consider the right moment for putting forward its views on targets under such a future regime.
Targets have proven to be a very useful tool in environmental policy making.
They provide our guidance to decision-makers in society.
They are particularly useful for industry and the private sector when they have to take long-term investment decisions.
Targets will therefore remain a core element of any future climate change architecture.
We need targets.
As you will be aware, the European Council of last March set down a pathway target of 15% to 30% of emissions reductions by 2020.
However, the Commission believes that the time has not yet come to set concrete targets for developed countries in Montreal in December.
That would only be done when we have more clarity on the progress of the negotiations on the post-2012 period.
MrÂ Seeber has underlined that any future climate change regime will have to build on broad participation on all major emitters and that is of key importance if our cooperation is to be truly efficient.
The Commission and Member States are working hard to promote deeper dialogue with the United States and developing countries.
We have engaged in policy dialogue with the United States administration within the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change and within other fora and meetings, such as the Joint Climate Change Science and Technology Workshop.
That covers concrete topics such as renewable energy, energy efficiency and carbon sequestration.
The United States claims that is has a different approach to fighting climate change, based mainly on the research and development of new technologies.
The difference between their approach and our approach is that they have seen an approximate 15% increase in carbon dioxide emissions while the European Union of 25 has seen a considerable reduction compared with 1990 levels, and the 15 member countries under the Kyoto regime obligations are 1.7% under the 1990 level.
That is not enough, but we are sure that, by the end of our commitment period, we will be in compliance with our Kyoto target.
This is the difference between the two approaches.
As regards developing countries, the European Union has an open mind on how they should participate in future multilateral climate cooperation.
It is clear that we cannot expect the same mandatory requirements as we do from developed countries.
Any commitment they take on will be based on the principle of common, but differentiated, responsibilities.
China and other developing countries have contributed to the formation of the greenhouse phenomenon by a much smaller percentage than the developed countries, and per capita emissions in China are currently less than one tenth of the levels in the developed world, so we should follow that example.
Where capita income is much lower and development needs greater we have to follow what the United Nations Convention wisely prescribes as a common but differentiated policy.
Mr Verges mentioned that we should take particular care of developing countries and their increasing needs arising from global warming.
We really should prepare for that impact.
The Commission is already providing funding and welcomes Canada's intention to prepare a five-year work programme on adaptation at the Conference in Montreal.
In addition, the European Union is the major contributor to the 2001 Bonn Political Declaration which pledges USDÂ 410Â million per year in climate change funding for developing countries, starting this year.
At the October Environment Council, Ministers committed themselves to communicating at Montreal the progress being made towards delivery on this target.
Also, to support developing countries, we have to make sure that the clean development mechanisms actually work.
The key issue is the efficiency of the executive board in Bonn, and the European Union is already providing funding, but more support is clearly necessary.
The European Union is still the main contributor of funds to the executive board.
There have been certain concerns about bilateral cooperation outside the United Nations context, and especially in the Asia-Pacific Partnership.
Let me stress that this can in no way be viewed as an alternative to the United Nations process.
However, this Partnership can support our efforts under the Climate Change Convention and the Kyoto Protocol through closer bilateral cooperation that includes both a stronger political dialogue and a focus on technology.
This is also how one should see the European Union-China and European Union-India partnerships.
This translates into very concrete actions: we have recently held two workshops in India and China on the Clean Development Mechanism and market-based mechanisms.
In relation to China, we also see an important focus on the development and demonstration of near-zero emissions power generation, and I agree with MrsÂ Beckett that carbon capture and storage is one of the means of tackling the problem of climate change.
It is not a cure-all, but it is one of the many means that we can use.
These partnerships will have the positive and immediate effect of supporting the discussions on a multilateral climate change regime post-2012.
MrÂ Blokland asked about the efficiency of the European Union's current measures.
If we implement all the measures in full, this will lead to a 4%Â reduction compared with 1990, which obviously is not sufficient to meet the target of -8% that we have set for ourselves.
That is why we included additional measures in the climate change programme that we launched a month ago.
This implies that we should make greater emission cuts, allowing us to reach the Kyoto target and make further progress for the period after 2012.
It is important to know that, for the European Union of 25, the result with the existing measures will be -7%.
MrsÂ Doyle, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and others asked about emissions from cars.
I fully agree that this is a vital issue and that is why, in 2006, the Commission will review the agreement with the car industry in order to assess the possibility of reaching the Community objective of 120 g/km by a certain point, having made sure, of course, that we reach the target, voluntarily agreed with the car industry in Europe, Japan and Korea, of 140 mg.
MrsÂ Ek referred to the inclusion of transport in European Union emissions trading.
The Commission has already made a proposal with regard to aviation, as you know.
The Commission will assess this for the other transport sectors as part of the 2006 review.
On renewable energy, the Commission will put forward, in the weeks to come, a new report assessing a target for renewable energy by 2020.
Regarding nuclear energy and the remarks made by Mr HÃ¶kmark, some Member States expect nuclear energy to be a part of their future energy.
However, we have to ensure that we have a broad range of energy sources that are low in carbon.
Nuclear power will not be able to meet the increased energy demands and we should also be aware that nuclear power faces problems concerning nuclear waste and public opinion.
With regard to what Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines said about agriculture, the Commission agrees that synergies can be found between climate change and agriculture.
We had an extremely interesting meeting in London, organised by Mrs Beckett and the UK Presidency, on climate change and agriculture and very important conclusions were reached there.
The Commission will be putting forward a plan in support of biofuels.
Finally, winning the battle against climate change requires determined action, starting now.
It requires action, as Mr Smith said, from all actors and sectors of society.
We should not underestimate the size of the challenge.
Winning the battle against climate change will take time, of which we have precious little, and efforts that some will argue we cannot afford.
With your continued support, we are determined to reassert the European Union's leadership in this key challenge for mankind.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, the report on Iraq, on which we are currently engaged in voting, is perhaps one that would otherwise appear among the also-rans, but it is important in that in it, Parliament, the Council and the Commission together are demonstrating that the European institutions are capable of responding quickly and in the public interest.
It was late last night â just before midnight â that this report was debated.
While every moment in this House is an important one, I do believe that we â that is, the services and we Members â should all ensure that such important legislative reports, the adoption of which is in the public interest, are debated at better hours of the day, so as to send a clear message to the outside world.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on a point of order under RuleÂ 132 about Commission Question Time last night.
Last night we had 90Â minutes of questions but only 11Â questions were answered, mainly because all the Commissioners gave long, rambling replies.
That was started by Commissioner Mandelson, who then overran, so that in the end there was only the opportunity for Commissioner Å pidla to answer two questions.
When I raised this before, President Borrell wrote a letter to the Commission asking Commissioners to be crisper in their answers.
Nothing so far has happened.
I should like to ask you to send a further letter, with much more ferocity, saying that what we look for as Members are short answers, not long rambling speeches.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to raise the fact that this House is set to debate the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis only next month.
It is a UN summit on the freedom of information.
The delegations attending that summit have had their internet access and e-mail filtered in their hotels.
They see demonstrators being arrested and journalists being harassed and beaten.
Tapes on human rights infringements have been confiscated by the Tunisian police.
There is no freedom of information in Tunisia.
European Union delegations are in Tunis right now.
I do not think we can wait another month to condemn these events.
Â Â  Mr President, although it is now a bit late, I did indicate earlier.
It appears that the previous adoption of Amendment 5 makes this amendment superfluous.
Although I would very much like to know what the rapporteur thinks about this, I am assuming that this vote was unnecessary.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to make a statement on this vote.
Now that this House has voted by a large majority to make out, without any money behind it, a cheque for EURÂ 400 million, which may well, without reliable calculations, find its way into the coffers of the Italian energy conglomerates, I now urge you to vote against my report.
I regard that decision that this House has taken today as utterly irresponsible.
In the belief it would be more right to follow the Commissionâs line, I ask you to vote against my own report, from which I will, in any event, be withdrawing my signature, believing as I do that cheques with nothing to back them up are of no use in gaining acceptance for European policy or in buying safety for atomic energy.
I am sorry to have to say this, but I do believe that the House is extremely ill-advised if a majority in it can vote to accept these false promises.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to add âeutrophicationâ â probably the most serious ecological problem in the Baltic Sea â to the text distributed to you.
The text should be amended to read: âStressing the further need to enhance cooperation between EU Member States and in particular to reduce eutrophicationâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to add the following text to the end of paragraph 24 after the words âblending ratiosâ: âexamining the environmental effectiveness of requiring 10% biofuel blends in transport fuelsâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I find there are problems with the versions in different languages.
In the German version, there is reference to ââ â two seats or bases, but that is nonsense, as, according to the Treaty, Parliament is based only in Strasbourg.
That was decided long ago.
The English version makes reference to âdouble locationâ, with Brussels as the second âlocationâ; it is one we can happily do away with, but then the translation has to be right.
I therefore ask you to compare the two language versions with one another.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  We have voted against the report as a whole because we believe that the Commissionâs proposal is better.
It is only fair that airline passengers be informed as to which carrier is operating a particular flight so that they are able to take carefully considered decisions from, for example, a safety perspective.
We support the Commissionâs proposal that the Member States gather security information with a view to passing it on to the Commission and other Member States, but we object to Parliamentâs proposal to introduce instead a Community list and, in that way, centralise the administration of the data.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac on her important and timely report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the information of air transport passengers on the identity of the operating carrier and on communication of safety information by Member States.
I support the report, and wish to highlight the proposal to broaden the competence of the European Aviation Safety Agency and to give it a central role in publishing safety measures relating to aircraft of third-country carriers.
The blacklist should be published not only by the Commission but also by each Member State, ticket sellers, national civil aviation authorities and airports in Member States, in order to ensure that passengers are kept properly informed and that the objectives of this proposal are properly met.
Â Â  .
This is a very timely proposal initially in reaction to concerns raised after the Sharm-el-Sheikh air accident (which killed 148 people) and after the spate of air disasters in August this year.
Many of the passengers who died at Sharm-el-Sheikh did not know they were going to be flying an Egyptian airline called Flash Air nor that this carrier had temporarily, in 2002, been subject to restrictions by Switzerland because of safety concerns.
Passengers have a right to be informed of the airline operating their flight regardless of where in the Community the service starts.
Air travellers should be well informed prior to travel about their prospective flight, particularly if the actual carrier is not the one originally indicated at the time of reservation.
This proposal takes us in that direction.
Â Â  .
I fully support the De Veyrac report calling for an EU-wide blacklist of air carriers which do not meet international aircraft safety standards.
These carriers should be named and shamed under the principal of zero tolerance throughout the Community.Â At the end of the day all EU citizens want safe flights when travelling inside and outside the Community and we cannot compromise on this objective.
I also firmly believe that the information contained on the blacklist needs to be easily accessible and widely available to all stakeholders (national civil aviation authorities, all EU airports and of course passengers).
As a member of the transport committee I believe it is the role of the European Parliament, as co-legislator, to do everything possible to have such a list quickly established.
I believe it is equally vital that the blacklist should also cover aircraft chartered from companies in non-EU countries and Member States should provide the European Commission with a list of carriers banned from their airspace.
Co-operation and co-ordination is the key.
In this respect the role of the European Safety Agency needs to be increased in checking international standards and issuing certificates of approval.
I reiterate the point that we cannot compromise in any respect the safety of our EU citizens.
Â Â  .I voted, of course, in favour of this proposal for legislation aimed at implementing a blacklist of unsafe airlines.
What is the spirit of this proposal?
To enable passengers to choose their carrier with full knowledge as regards the safety conditions, and to be informed in the event of a last-minute change of carrier.
This task forms part of a broader strategy aimed at enhancing the safety of the booming air transport sector.
In 2003, there were 1.7Â billion air passengers worldwide, and it is predicted that there will be 2.5Â billion in 2015.
In Europe alone, the number of air passengers increased by an average 5.5% per year between 1990 and 2003.
This work must be done at European level, in collaboration with the Member States, in order to lay down common inspection criteria.
There are still too many disparities, particularly in relation to the controls.
Without taking the place of sky marshals, the Commission must demonstrate ambition, draw attention to the worst performers, unearth any weaknesses and harmonise European legislation regarding air safety.
This is a prerequisite in order for air transport to remain what it is: the safest mode of transport.
Â Â  As a Slovak MEP and member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I naturally voted in favour of the proposal to increase support for decommissioning the two reactors at the JaslovskÃ© Bohunice nuclear power plant.
The Slovak Government, whose representatives made the difficult decision on decommissioning in the accession negotiations, would have had some tough explaining to do if the vote in the European Parliament had turned out differently.
Left to its own devices, Slovakia would not be able to cope with a 19% drop in power generation, coupled with the high direct and indirect costs resulting from output reduction at the Bohunice plant.
I would therefore like to thank all of my colleagues in the European Parliament, who saw that the Slovak problem was a European problem, and who voted to provide financial assistance for the decommissioning of the Bohunice installation.
Â Â  I am pleased with the result of the vote on financial support for the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 plant.
The reason for this is as follows: In the 1990s, the Bohunice V1 installation underwent full-scale reconstruction under the watchful eye of an international agency, at a cost of nearly EUR 300 million.
The plant is therefore clearly being decommissioned before time, as it is now capable of safely producing electricity at least until 2015.
The 1999 decision was political, dictated not by good sense but by biased reasoning.
The direct costs will amount to more than EUR 1.3 billion.
Fortunately, the plenary session at least agreed on a contribution of 400 million, but this represents only one-third of the amount needed.
Overall costs will be as high as EUR 5 billion, including critical elements such as the safe storage of radioactive waste, substantial losses in electricity generation, and so on.
Nuclear power plants produce around 57% of the electricity in Slovakia.
The decommissioning of the V1 plant will result in a shortfall of about seven terawatt-hours of electricity per year. This is the equivalent of unscrewing every second light bulb in the country.
I thank everybody for their support.
Â Â  Mr President, record oil and petrol prices are now making us aware, in a very uncomfortable way, of the likelihood of a new energy crisis.
Worldwide energy consumption has virtually trebled since 1960, and, while the USA leads the field in this respect with its consumption of a quarter of the worldâs energy, the real cause is the ongoing modernisation of former developing countries and newly industrialising economies.
It is still the case that 80% of the worldâs energy output is derived from fossil sources such as oil, gas and coal, the extraction of which is becoming more and more laborious and hence more and more expensive, and the use of which is detrimental to our environment.
When we are as far off track as we are, the renewed demand for nuclear power amounts to choosing plague rather than cholera.
Nuclear fission does, admittedly, have the advantage of not discharging carbon dioxide, and of not, therefore, contributing to global warming, but, until such time as the besetting problems of reactor security and the final storage of nuclear waste are resolved, new nuclear power stations should not be built, nor should the life of existing ones be extended.
If we are to cope with demand and further improve the efficiency with which we use energy and existing technologies, our only option is to further develop the renewable energy sector, which offers the only plausible long-term alternative.
Â Â  We chose to vote against Amendments 5 and 12 concerning an increase in the amount allocated for decommissioning the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant, since we believe that the budgetary framework for 2007 to 2013 should not be exceeded.
Naturally, nuclear power plants must be decommissioned in the light of environmental and security considerations.
Â Â  .
The purpose of the proposed regulation is to provide finances for the decommissioning of the Bohunice VI nuclear power plant in Slovakia.
Slovakia has committed to the closure of Units 1 and 2 of the plant by 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2008 respectively.
The decommissioning process of the plant is an expensive one as it will last beyond 2006 and after the next financial perspective 2007-2013.
In light of this, the EU has agreed to extend pre-accession aid by providing financial support for decommissioning up until 2006.
Subsequently, an amendment was adopted to raise the budget from EURO 237 million to EURO 400 million.
Despite being largely in favour of raising the budget, I believe the new amount of EUR 400 million proposed by the amendment to be excessive and I welcome the alternative of seeking non-EU funding in order to raise the amount of money necessary for decommissioning to take place.
Â Â  . The nuclear option, which I feel is justified in certain circumstances, is only workable if accompanied by a stringent safety policy governing its use.
When safety becomes an issue, these plants must be closed down and decommissioned.
In this particular situation, however, I do not believe that the case has been made for releasing far greater financial resources than those proposed by the rapporteur.
I therefore opted to abstain from the vote on the proposal before us.
Â Â  We support the EUâs Nordic cooperation, known as the Northern Dimension, but believe that the cooperation should be basically intergovernmental, strictly limited and focused on practical results.
Among the issues to which priority should be given are the environment, safety where nuclear power is concerned and the fight against international crime.
We support the proposal according to which the EU should develop its cooperation with regional organisations, including the Nordic Council.
Nordic cooperation can operate as a model for the EU, because it shows how freedom of movement can be promoted and encouraged without a comprehensive supranational bureaucracy.
In the light of the above, we choose to vote in favour of the report.
Â Â  . The geography of âour Europeâ â the European Community â changed dramatically in May of last year.
These changes are widely acknowledged to have been a great success, but, having changed its neighbours from one day to the next, with all that that entails for a number of policy areas, the EU faces fresh challenges.
The EU already has extensive experience of regional policies adapted to specific geographical characteristics, albeit not always with the desired success.
I welcome the guidelines put forward in this resolution, as they represent a positive step towards effective political action of this nature.
To my mind, policy should not simply be applied with a broad brush, but should be adapted to different situations and specific characteristics.
Â Â  .
I was pleased that this joint motion for resolution gained a sufficiently broad support across the Chamber as this is a particularly important policy area.
My own country, Scotland, as a Northern European country should be playing a more active role in this policy, though sadly even with our own Scottish Parliament we have yet to make our voice heard in this topic, so far.
Â Â  .Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, on 1Â MayÂ 2004 the European Unionâs border moved eastward and northward.
This has entailed a great many new challenges, which is why actions and projects like the Northern Dimension of the European Union are crucial in this context.
The aim of multilateral regional cooperation between the EU Member States in the Baltic region is to create conditions that are conducive to social and economic development and to political stability in this region.
The European Union now has an internal sea for the first time in its history.
I should like to take this opportunity to draw the Houseâs attention to the particular political significance of this initiative.
After all, the Northern Dimension countries are located at the point where the European Union meets the East, by which I mean that they share borders with such key partners as Russia and Belarus.
The region could therefore play a crucial role in implementing a project of special value, namely close and multifaceted cooperation between the EU and Russia.
The Northern Dimension will have a favourable impact on economic cooperation and infrastructure building, and the stepping up of cooperation in the field of home affairs and justice is likely to increase security where cross-border issues are concerned.
Attention should also be paid to the environmental benefits to be gained from the Northern Dimension, which covers a valuable and sensitive ecosystem.
In view of this fact, cooperation should therefore be promoted in the spheres of environmental protection and sustainable development.
The Baltic or North European gas pipeline project has been the source of much controversy, and it remains a key issue to be resolved.
None of the governments of the Baltic Sea countries were consulted in any way on the decision to construct this pipeline, and this decision poses a major threat to the energy security of many countries.
We must not allow weaker countries to be discriminated against, and we must not allow actions to be taken that damage their interests.
If we fail to do so, the Northern Dimension will remain pure theory and bear no relation to reality.
The Baltic gas pipeline project also represents a huge threat to the environment in the Baltic Sea region.
Â Â  . The benefits of the EU are sometimes at the root of its troubles.
This is certainly true of technological challenges, regarding which the sheer size of a Union of 25 Member States naturally makes it difficult to reach agreement.
When it comes to technological development and to adopting new technologies, it is crucial that we think quickly and take action decisively.
These considerations come into play as regards the significant technological change that the switchover to digital represents.
I welcome the guidelines contained in the Common Resolution, although I feel priority should be given to ensuring that the market in this field can function freely.
Supporting technological development must not mean jeopardising the natural freedom required by markets in general, and by this market in particular.
Â Â  .
Although I support this report, there needs to be parity when such a switchover takes place.
Citizens need to be informed and prepared.
Â Â  . The way we voted on this report took account of the Czech perspective on these proposals, in light of the pressure that they were under to decommission the nuclear power plants.
Adequate financial resources have therefore been made available to cover all of the costs of decommissioning and the final processing and storage of the radioactive waste.
There are currently 14 Member States with nuclear plants, which corresponds to 149 reactors, and the working reactors are on average more than 20 years old.
In the new accession countries faced with these decommissioning requirements, as in the case before us, we feel it is right that they should receive the support they need to carry this out in the proper manner, from the point of view of human and environmental safety.
Â Â  .
This report is a step in the right direction towards improving financial and technical aspects of decommissioning nuclear power plants.
As we know from experience at Dounreay in Scotland, there is considerable improvement required in the handling of this dangerous, but necessary, process.
Safety must be the number one priority, and the unsatisfactory state of preparations for decommissioning in most EU member states justifies the view that no new nuclear power plans should be built.
Â Â  .
I voted for this report.
Decommissioning is an important issues as there are some 50-60 nuclear power plants in the EU that will be decommissioned by 2025.
It goes without saying that nuclear power plants need to be shut down safely to protect people and the environment.
A lack of finance for this process could cause delay and potential safety risks.
All nuclear undertakings should have sufficient funds for decommissioning.
The Commission is anxious to come up with a common framework, and in the longer term, to harmonise the methods by which decommissioning is financed in the EU.
This report makes a contribution to that goal.
Â Â  .
No more must the EU promote nuclear power, as the Euratom Treaty specifies that it must.
When the EU, exceptionally, calls for the decommissioning of nuclear power station in order to protect human life and the environment, as it did in the case of the Slovak Bohunice V1 reactor, such demands are deserving of support, even if the distinction drawn by the Commission between the âgoodâ reactors in the West and the âdangerousâ ones in Eastern Europe is an untenable one.
The initially high level of support is appropriate to a purposeful start to the decommissioning process, as the Slovak Republic has accumulated funds amounting to only EURÂ 320 million.
The support is in line with undertakings given at the time of Slovakiaâs accession to the EU.
Were it not for support from the EU, there would be cause for concern that the reactors at Bohunice V1 would continue in operation, which would entail serious security risks.
Without EU funding, it might well also not be possible to ensure that decommissioning measures would be taken promptly in order to protect human life and the environment.
The use of EU funds should, however, be limited to the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 reactors and to the measures accompanying it.
An addition should be made to this effect to Article 2 of the Commission proposal, which should also specify the EUâs priorities for the use of such funds, including, , the maintenance of safety standards in the course of decommissioning and the achievement of the climate change goals through the promotion of renewable energies.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report on the use of financial resources earmarked for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants.
I welcome the principles put forward in the report, not only because I feel that all possible safety measures should be taken when it comes to nuclear power, but also because, to my mind, adequate financial resources must be made available to cover such measures during the useful lifetime of these plants.
I believe that the conditions for using the financial resources for decommissioning set out in this report are both responsible and effective, among which I wish to highlight the setting up of a decommissioning fund that will take account of the management of funds generated by energy production.
I would note that it is crucial, whenever we talk about nuclear matters, to provide for the necessary environmental safety and protection measures throughout the useful lifetime of a nuclear power plant.
In this context, the proposed measures aimed at the safe, effective and environmentally-friendly decommissioning of such plants should be included.
Â Â  .
I was pleased to back my group colleagues in supporting this important report as it underlines concerns about the long term viability of the nuclear industry when it comes to decommissioning.
With so many alternative technologies available, I believe that we must invest in renewables, which will leave no ecological legacy.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make a statement of vote in respect of the Wijkman report, which, in essence, I very much welcome.
It is unfortunate that the adoption of Mr Vidal-Quadras Rocaâs amendment means that the derogation for nuclear energy is now deleted.
That I regard as false, since I do not regard nuclear energy as a realistic alternative for the future and believe that the risks associated with it are not yet manageable.
It is for that reason that I, along with my colleagues as a whole, have voted against the report.
We have nothing against it as such, but it could have been more clear in coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is no alternative.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that MrÂ Wijkmanâs report â and I hope he will not hold this against me â is wrong, starting with its very title.
Human beings have never won the battle against climate change and never will, because their influence on it is limited and not yet scientifically demonstrated.
In my view, the most that can be endorsed are the hopes for a cut in harmful and potentially climate-altering emissions, but there is a great difference between that and approving a document of doubtful scientific value, which is even presumptuous in its aims.
One need only look at items 2 and 3 after recital M, which propose limiting the average temperature increase of the planet to two degrees above pre-industrial levels, even though there are no reliable records or data for that time.
Furthermore, I do not agree with the statements that the European Union should commit itself to giving financial aid to China, India, Brazil and South Africa so that these countries can develop sustainable energy strategies.
It would be better, instead, to impose sanctions and trade restrictions on industrialised countries, including the United States, and the developing countries I have just mentioned if their industries continued to harm the environment or, more generally, if they showed very little social consideration.
Therefore, in view of everything I have just said, I voted against the report.
Â Â  . Ahead of the forthcoming Conference of Parties in Montreal between 28Â November and 9Â December, Parliament is emphasising the need to give the highest priority to talks on emission reduction commitments for the period after 2012 arising from the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force on 16Â FebruaryÂ 2005, having been ratified by 152 countries and regional organisations.
It would appear that the targets that have been set are rather too ambitious, given that little is known regarding the actual consequences of human interference in climate change, which is even more problematic while the USA remains outside the Kyoto Protocol.
We do welcome all of the measures intended to reduce the amount of energy consumption and waste, to achieve greater energy efficiency, to develop a new, more environmentally-friendly transport policy, and to promote rail transport, along with public transport as a whole.
On the other hand, we take a diametrically opposed view on the issue of emissions trading, given that, by all accounts, it solves nothing and only serves to exacerbate environmental inequalities and imbalances.
The wealthiest countries will be able to go on polluting by buying emissions rights from others, and that is unacceptable.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  Global climate change constitutes a significant problem, which we believe there are good reasons for dealing with at an international level.
The Wijkman report has a lot going for it.
However, the June List restates its position that the European Parliament should not take over the Member Statesâ foreign policies by calling on third countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so.
It is also regrettable that the report calls on the Member States to deal with a number of matters that should be handled at national level.
For example, it includes proposals for EU-wide speed limits, traffic charges and tax incentives and for the development of rail transport and public transport in general.
We are also critical of EU initiatives to make people aware of the ways in which unrestrained consumption and production affect the climate.
This is a dimension that can, of course, be dealt with at national level.
We have chosen to vote against the report as a whole, but have supported individual amendments in order, in our view, to improve the report.
Â Â  .I abstained from voting on this text.
As I made clear in my speech in todayâs plenary session, this is a matter of urgency.
We must act immediately in order to respond to this threat of climate change, which is undoubtedly one of the most serious threats in the history of humankind.
I support the actions recommended in this report â while rejecting the idea of ecotaxes â and the political resoluteness displayed.
I abstained to show my strong dissatisfaction regarding an amendment that challenges the existence of the Strasbourg Parliament.
It is unacceptable to use such an important text to include issues in it that bear no relation to the subject dealt with.
Â Â  We are in favour of a minimum level of carbon dioxide tax within the EU.
We believe, however, that any decision to levy such a tax must have the Councilâs unanimous backing and not just that of a majority.
In the future too, taxes must be deducted on a national basis and not by the EU.
Â Â  . MrÂ Wijkmanâs excellent report puts forward a number of measures to help solve the problem of climate change around the world.
The Conference of Parties is due to take place in Montreal, where it is hoped that European leaders will submit proposals for future arrangements on climate change.
These arrangements must be based on shared, but different responsibilities aimed at the continued reduction of emissions and the participation of more countries in these efforts.
More ambitious targets also need to be set.
The MarchÂ 2005 European Council stressed the need for developed countries to reduce emissions by 15 to 30% by 2020.
The rapporteur is proposing that longer-term targets be set to reduce emissions by 60 to 80% by 2050.
Lastly, a strategy must be developed to turn Europe into the most energy-efficient economy in the world.
Incentives must be introduced for increased use of âcleanâ technologies, and research and innovation to support sustainable energy and the sustainable management of soil use should be promoted at European level.
Â Â  . I welcomed the report outlining the need to fight the climate change battle.
Once a certain level of Green-house gas concentration has passed in the atmosphere, the whole system will undergo drastic changes.
Disasters such as annual material damages due to extreme weather conditions resulting in millions of people left homeless will occur.
Developing countries are likely to be the ones who suffer the most.
The EU has reduced its emissions by 3% below the 1990 level but more has to be done to reach the 8% target agreed in the Kyoto Protocol.
Although I agree that the EU needs to reduce its emissions to reach the target agreed in the Kyoto agreement, I find the report to be extremely optimistic considering the inclusion of more policy areas and the time limit and would like to see a greater sense of urgency.
Â Â  .The climate is changing.
Rock paintings illustrate mammals in the Sahara and ibex at Lascaux.
Well, as these animals have disappeared from these regions, this is indeed proof that the climate has changed.
What is more, if this change is taking place, it is undoubtedly because of human beings.
The fact that the earthâs axis is tilting relative to the ecliptic plane, which changes over a period of 10Â 000 years for example, and that, as Milankovitch demonstrated, this has an influence on the climate, matters little.
The fact that the great phenomenon of oceanic respiration, with vast rivers plunging in the North Atlantic only to resurface in the Pacific, has an influence on the climate, matters even less here.
Fear requires explanations, great and reassuring mythologies, cosmogonies, Good and Evil, and punishments.
We are therefore punished for our ingenuity, punished for our progress and punished for our inventions and our creations.
Man as Prometheus, who stole fire, must today receive his punishment in the shape of melting ice fields, rising sea levels, heatwaves and a lack of oxygen.
Just as, in the past, there were the plagues of Egypt.
All of that would be fine if this post-Medieval confusion were to lead to a change in the economic and social climate that causes the â very real â decline from which we suffer.
Â Â  . It is only natural that environmental issues, and climate change in particular, should be uppermost among our concerns.
I support many of the guidelines on environmental policy that Europe has been pursuing, reflected in both the report and the Commission communication.
I believe, however, that there are two points that we must bear in mind.
Firstly, environmental issues are obviously not at the forefront of the concerns of developing countries, and indeed they are not alone in that respect.
Secondly, developed societies are not prepared to accept a lower standard of living, and nor should this be our policy or our blueprint.
This is precisely why research and development needs to be our major priority, given that the aim should be to manage resources, thereby ensuring a better and more sustainable quality of life.
Â Â  Mr President, the minutes record a dispute between Mrs GrÃ¶ner and myself about Mr Giertychâs anti-abortion exhibition.
The acting President stated that there would be no censorship.
Since then, though, the exhibition has been removed, and so there has been.
I would like to point out that there is also, in the building, an anti-REACH exhibition, in which the President of the Commission is depicted poisoning a child.
I regard that as controversial in a way in which Mr Giertychâs exhibition is not.
If you are going to use âcontroversialâ as a justification for removing displays, then both of them ought to go.
I do believe, though, that nothing should be taken down, and that discussion, rather than censorship, should be the order of the day.
Â Â  Mr Posselt, the Quaestors are aware of what has happened and will provide the President with a report on it.
We will take the appropriate decisions on that basis.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Report of the European Council and the Commission Statement on the informal European Council at Hampton Court, to which Parliament was invited, as you know, represented by its President.
I would like to thank the British Presidency for the respect it showed the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a very great honour to address this Parliament again â a very high-quality group of parliamentarians are here I know.
In all parliaments sometimes you speak to a very large number and sometimes you do not.
I take this as full support for all the policies which have been followed both by the UK Presidency and by the United Kingdom on aspects like the budget, which I shall come to in a moment.
This is the 48th time that a British Government minister has appeared before Parliament since the beginning of the UKâs Presidency of the European Union and, with six weeks to go, I am happy to tell you there are still many more ministers on the way.
That is an indication of the seriousness with which we take Parliament.
Today, I want to report back on the informal summit at Hampton Court.
Much of this is now familiar to you, but what was achieved three weeks ago was important.
At the beginning of the summer, the people of Europe gave a clear signal that they were unhappy with the way in which Europe was heading.
They felt detached from European politics and politicians.
At Hampton Court, Europeâs leaders took a significant step towards providing a response to that concern by reaching broad agreement on a direction for Europeâs economic and social policy.
Much of the leg-work had, of course, already been done by the European Commission and published in its excellent paper âEuropean values in the globalised worldâ.
If I may say to President Barroso, I thought that paper was one of the best and most insightful papers that I have read on the future of Europe and its nations in the last three years.
With 20Â million people unemployed across Europe and youth employment running at 18%, the main task for all of us who believe in the social model for Europe is to get Europe back to work and to give our citizens the tools to compete in the global market.
The Hampton Court summit identified six key areas, backed up by a range of specific policies, in which the joint efforts of Member States and of the Commission can bolster Europeâs economic prosperity and collective security.
First, there is research and development.
We need a strong technological foundation if European companies are to stay ahead of the competition, particularly that posed by the Asian economies.
Second, there is investment in our universities.
We are lagging behind the United States and, in some key respects, China and India as well.
The third is facing up to demographic change within the European Union.
The EU currently has four people of working age for every elderly citizen, but over the coming decades this will fall from a ratio of four to one to just two to one.
At the informal summit EU leaders therefore agreed that we had to examine in much more detail the relationship between legal migration and the EUâs future economic needs.
The fourth concern was energy.
How do we handle soaring global energy demand while supply remains tight?
The summit recognised that the solution requires action on a number of tracks.
We have to diversify our sources of energy and approach our current major energy suppliers in a more coherent manner.
We have to use our market capacity and power as users with those who are the suppliers.
We also have to pursue energy efficiency and clean technologies and develop within Europe a much more genuinely open energy market.
It is open in some countries, but not in all countries.
I do not call that an open market.
Fifth is the European Unionâs work on global security.
On data retention this Parliament has an opportunity to join in the EUâs collective responsibility to shape legislation that will increase the security of our citizens and bring criminals to justice.
There is a counter-terrorism strategy that will indicate how we deal with radicalisation, how we protect our infrastructure and how we ensure better exchange of information.
We also have to combat illegal immigration and strengthen our borders, whilst ensuring that we harness the benefits of legal migration for the EU and for developing countries.
Finally, the summit agreed that Javier Solana, working with the Presidency, should take forward work on common foreign and security policy aspects of defence and security.
There are specific proposals for research and training in this area to fill gaps in our capability.
We also have to improve crisis management structures to respond to disasters and look to increase funding for CFSP.
In December, by the way, we will be publishing a comprehensive strategy for Africa.
In all areas there will be interim reports to the December European Council and final reports during the Austrian Presidency in the first half of next year.
I am confident that in drawing up these reports the Commission will give full consideration to the views of the relevant Parliamentary committees.
This, in some detail, is what was discussed at Hampton Court.
However, now that we have broad agreement on the direction of a modern Europe, we have to get the right budget deal to deliver these economic and social priorities.
The Presidency is committed to working for a budget deal in December. But we all know that it is going to be extremely difficult to reach one.
In June, five Member States rejected the proposed budget; next month we will need all 25 to agree.
So we have some hard negotiating ahead of us.
With that in mind, we aim to table comprehensive proposals in early December for discussion at a conclave of foreign ministers.
Changes will be needed in three main areas.
First, we have to chart a new direction for the European Union budget to ensure that it can respond to the challenges of the 21st century.
That requires establishing a clear timetable for a review covering all aspects of revenue and expenditure, a hard look at where the money comes from, how it is used and how we account for it.
Failure to sign off the European Unionâs accounts for the eleventh successive year â which is very poor â affects the climate of debate and of opinion about the whole of the European Union in every single Member State.
So this new direction requires the laying-down of clear objectives for future Union spending, for the accounting for that spending, without which there will not be taxpayer confidence in what this Union is doing, and setting clear pathways for the future reform of the Unionâs policies.
Second, we have to amend the structure of spending from 1Â January 2007 from that which was proposed in the last negotiating box in June, notably to take account of recent discussions by Member States of the proposals by Commission President Barroso, which he made on 20Â October.
Third, the consequences of any proposed changes to the own-resources decision â in other words to the amount which is paid by Member States to the EUâs budget â must be seen to be fair and balanced in all Member States.
For that to happen, significant changes will be needed to the arrangements affecting the United Kingdom â amongst other Member States â from those that were proposed in June.
I do not want anybody to be taken by surprise: when I talk about significant changes, I mean significant changes.
Without significant changes, I see little prospect of a deal.
However, with them, I believe that we can take negotiations forward and we are committed, as the Presidency, to trying to do a deal and we will make every effort to get there.
So far, I have talked about Europeâs response to the challenges of globalisation mainly in terms of what we will do â what policies we adopt and what budget we should agree.
However, globalisation also poses a challenge to Europe in terms not just of what we do but how we do things.
As I have indicated, there is a growing gap between the politics of Europe and the people of Europe.
It is exactly this question that will be the focus of a conference tomorrow in The Hague, jointly hosted by the Dutch and the British Governments.
The âSharing Power in Europeâ conference will look at how regional and national parliaments can work more effectively with European institutions, including the European Parliament, and how we can get the right balance between action at the regional, national and European levels to deliver the best results for our citizens.
I should like here to express great appreciation to Jan Peter Balkenende, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, for first proposing that such a conference be held â he did so at the June European Council â and to our colleague, Bernard Bot, the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, who has helped the British Presidency to take this idea forward and to host the conference tomorrow.
A part of all this effort has to be to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to make European Union legislation lighter and more relevant.
As globalisation has made it more difficult for the people of Europe to relate to its institutions, so too have those people, our citizens, become more critical about the nature of European Union legislation.
They are much more impatient of a regime and more strident in their belief that methods of regulation cannot, and should not, be a proxy for outcome.
Too often â it is true of all parliaments and unions but it is particularly true of the European Union â the method has been seen as the same as the outcome.
This is not the case.
Businesses, non-governmental organisations and Member States want new European rules, for example, to fight unfair competition, to protect the environment or to improve our legal systems.
However, they want action that makes our lives better, not more complicated.
Standardisation and harmonisation do not add value by themselves.
Thanks to the efforts of the Commission under President Barroso, there are many positive signs now.
For example, the Commission has listened to what businesses and people want and has proposed a lighter regulatory touch in financial services.
This will help promote a globally competitive European financial sector.
The Commissionâs three-year action programme for simplifying the is another very welcome step, as is the recognition that the European Union does not always need to get involved in those areas where it used to get involved.
Hence the decision to get rid of a 1968 directive which regulated the number and the size of knots in wood.
There may have been a reason 37Â years ago for the European Union to regulate the number and size of knots in wood. However, today we ought to leave that maybe to Member States or just to the judgement of those people who buy wood from a timber dealer.
Why not?
The proposal to see whether we can simplify the way in which employers have to give compliance reports on 20Â separate directives on health and safety at work should lessen the burden on employers, giving them more time to focus on workersâ needs â maybe on creating jobs â than on paperwork.
As a co-legislator, the European Parliament has a critical role to play in all this.
Let us take REACH â which was the subject of a little excitement outside as I came in and, I have heard, a little excitement in here.
It is controversial how far you regulate the European chemical industry to protect the consumer.
None of us wants to be poisoned by chemicals.
Nonetheless I believe that Europeâs record on this is exemplary and second to none in the whole of the universe.
Equally, none of us want to see, in a globalised world in which barriers have come down, Europeâs chemical industry brought to its knees so that the regulation, which is a very fine one, ends up regulating an industry that has disappeared, to be replaced by industries across the world in China, India and elsewhere, where the regulation is far less good than it is today.
That is the dilemma facing Parliament, as it faces all our peoples.
We have to recognise the difficult cases.
The proposed changes to the Working Time Directive are a good example of well-meaning legislation that will not achieve what those changes are set out to do, and where method and outcome have become grievously confused.
We are all agreed that European labour markets must embrace decent standards of protection for our workers.
Europeans must have rights at work, but they must also have jobs in which they can exercise those rights at work.
My Prime Minister said recently that we hoped to resolve the outstanding issues on this directive during our Presidency, and that remains our goal.
Let us be clear about the nature of the challenges we have to address.
The Working Time Directive is justified as being about health and safety, and in part, it is.
But rigid limits on total hours worked are not the answer.
The United Kingdom has one of the best health and safety records in the whole of the European Union.
Since you ask, we are second best in terms of days lost through injury and, I believe, third best in terms of deaths at work.
We have shown by our record that a strong health and safety record judged by outcomes is entirely compatible with flexible labour markets and flexible working hours.
Rigid pan-European limits on working hours will not deliver health and safety for our workforce, particularly where the rules are unevenly applied.
Some European partners have rightly, I believe, expressed great concern that there are other Member States in which working time limits are being applied per contract and not per worker.
Some of those countries are the same ones that say there have to be rigid limits; but when it comes to enforcement within their own countries, there is a dodge taking place and in the place of enforcement per worker â which has to be the basis for health and safety â it is per contract.
Therefore, if people have two contracts â two jobs, one person â then they can evade the limit, entirely unregulated and unprotected.
It does not make sense from a health and safety point of view.
It does not make sense from an employment practice perspective.
It does not make sense in terms of the reputation of the European Union of applying fair and sensible regulations across Europe.
We have to find ways to implement and enforce the directive which match the needs of all labour markets.
We must ensure that all workers enjoy proper employment rights and that none are forced by the rigidities of this directive into a grey economy, for that is what is happening.
The blunt truth about the directive is that in seeking to reset European limits and standards, we risk infringing individual workersâ freedom to work the hours they choose.
We will undeniably restrict employersâ flexibility to adapt to changing businesses and seasonal demands and, in doing so, will threaten the very jobs on which workersâ livelihoods depend.
That cannot be right.
It is vital that workers feel safe and appropriately protected in the workplace.
It is good business as much as it is good politics.
We need to judge how much of this should be fixed at European level and how much we should trust national governments, employers and trade unions to agree on an approach that reflects labour traditions and good practice within individual Member States and across Europe.
After all, the minimum wage, another aspect of labour regulation in which I happen to believe passionately, has always been left to Member States.
I believe that is quite right.
Now is the time to leave far more issues concerning working hours to Member States as well.
That seems to me to be an excellent example of an area where Europe, in addressing the challenges of seeking to engage more closely with our citizens, must go forward with a lighter touch.
When the United Kingdom took over the Presidency of the European Union we also inherited the need to conduct a wide debate on the future of Europe.
The Hampton Court summit was a vital element of that debate. But the debate is far from finished.
The process of constructing a modern, confident Europe will be an even longer one.
This is a journey which governments, politicians and parliaments, including this one, cannot take alone.
We have to bring the benefits of Europe to the people of Europe and take the people with us.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Straw, ladies and gentlemen, as MrÂ Straw pointed out, we can be satisfied with the results of this Informal Summit.
I am keen to share with you my delight that it was possible for the voice of the European Parliament to make itself heard at the Summit, thanks to MrÂ Borellâs participation in all of the discussions.
I can only congratulate MrÂ Blair on the way in which he contributed to creating a positive atmosphere and a climate of confidence.
I am particularly proud of the role played by the Commission in the success of this Summit.
Our debates at Hampton Court resulted in a consensus based on a fundamental idea and on five key areas.
The fundamental idea is as follows: in order to preserve our values, we have to modernise our policies.
There are no contradictions between a project of economic reform to modernise Europe and the commitment to a political Europe and a social Europe.
The five key areas are, briefly: first, a consensus on the analysis and the nature of the challenges confronting us, which follows on from the contribution made by the Commission â and, while we are on this subject, MrÂ Straw, I thank you for what you said about the quality of our document.
Secondly, the importance of practically implementing ambitious reforms that foster growth and employment.
All the Member States have applied themselves to this task, and the Commission will draft a report on the national programmes developed in order to implement the Lisbon conclusions at the very beginning of next year.
Thirdly, the development of the practical work done on the political responses to be provided in relation to globalisation and our ageing populations, focusing on specific areas such as research and development, universities, energy and demographics, including the issue of immigration.
Fourthly â and this specifically relates back to my last point - a new priority for immigration policy, simultaneously covering legal immigration, which undoubtedly meets the needs of our economy, the securing of our borders, which our people are waiting for, and effective integration policies, which are crucial in our multicultural societies.
Fifthly, new initiatives with a view to examining how our external action can be enhanced, so that we can respond more effectively to globalisation and to the new security threats that do not stop at national borders.
We must now move on with our work.
I hope that we will be able to do so in close cooperation with Parliament and with the current and forthcoming Presidencies of the Council.
In order to sustain the momentum for promoting long-term growth and employment, the Commission proposes to give new impetus to research and development and to present ways of reorganising the education systems in Europe and universities.
We will report back to the Council and to the European Parliament on these matters before the spring European Council.
Searching for the resources to better tackle the demographic challenge: as from the beginning of next year, we will present the results of the consultation launched at the beginning of the year by issuing a Green Paper on demographics.
Establishing a coherent energy policy: next year we will present a strategy for Europe.
All the options must remain open.
This fresh recognition of the fact that we must work together in an area which, until very recently, was considered as an area reserved for the Member States, is very important.
As regards migration, work is already under way.
Several proposals have already been submitted to Parliament and, before the end of the year, a document should enable us to enhance our thoughts and actions concerning legal and illegal immigration.
Finally, security confronts us with a two-fold challenge.
We have not only to work together more effectively in tackling the cross-border crime that we encounter in Europe, but also to make our commitment to combat international terrorism more resolute.
On that point too, important proposals by the Commission are on the table, and a strategy for combating terrorism is in the process of being completed.
Yet, we also need to make greater efforts to ensure that the European Union fully takes its place in the debate on the responses to be provided in relation to globalisation.
That is why the Commission will present a concept paper, examining the way in which we, the European Commission, together with the Council and Parliament, can contribute to strengthening the external coherence of the Union.
It is clear that we can do more to promote the coherence of our external action, not only in relation to foreign policy and common defence, but also in relation to the various internal policy instruments with an external dimension, as well as in areas in which the Commission has a special role to play, such as development aid, international trade and the neighbourhood policy, for instance.
Hampton Court showed once again why the European Union matters in a globalised world.
Never before has European integration been so much in question, but never before has it been so necessary.
Europe has the scale and the range of policies to maximise the benefits of globalisation for its citizens and to minimise the threats.
It is European legislation which enables a terrorist suspect to be transferred from Italy to London within 50Â days.
A process that once took years now takes weeks because we have an instrument at European level and because we have European legislation that enables us to do that.
It is Europe that can provide answers to the challenges of more expensive and scarcer energy.
It is also Europe which will help manage the border crossing in Gaza, a very important recent development.
It is Europe which is leading the world in aid for Africa.
So there is a need for this European dimension.
We agree â and we have done a great deal to achieve this with better regulation â on the need for sensible legislation to avoid bureaucratic measures.
However, that does not mean a minimalist Europe â and I want to be totally clear about that.
Not at all.
It means that Europe should do less in some areas and should make the lives of our citizens and businesses easier.
Nevertheless, at the same time, there are areas where we have to do more, not less.
It is a very important to avoid the idea of a minimalist Europe.
It is the responsibility of all of us European leaders â at Council level, Parliament level and Commission level â to explain this and to avoid the demagoguery and populism that is sometimes levelled against Europe.
Because, in this globalised world, we need a strong Europe more than ever.
But all these policies â from external relations, to security, to migration, to energy, to research, to universities â need money; they cost money.
When I was a child my mother told me never to speak about money because it is impolite. But now I have to speak about money.
Because without money, we cannot deliver on those policies, we need the resources to go ahead with our policies.
Distinguished members of the Council, you cannot ask the Commission and the other European institutions to deliver and not give them the means to deliver on those policies.
The positive atmosphere, the signs of a stronger European political will that we saw at Hampton Court, must now be turned into action, turned into an agreement on the financial perspective next month.
This is the defining issue of the British Presidency; it is the test of whether Europe is on the move, and we need Europe on the move.
In respect of prosperity, solidarity and security, all we can do is give our citizens the means to achieve them.
I know the British Presidency is working hard for a deal; the cost of failure would be high.
It is hard to see how our positions will converge within a few months.
So there is a real risk of no agreement next month, leading to delays in money coming on-stream for the new Member States, a risk that the Community will not be able to deliver on crucial international commitments, including commitments for the poorest.
Without the financial perspective, how can the European Union make medium-term commitments to global funds for HIV/AIDS?
How can we respect the commitments we made at the United Nations for the Millennium Development Goals?
How can we support the Caribbean countries in adjusting to the changes in the European Community banana regimes, for instance?
How can we keep our commitments to African peacekeeping?
How can we go ahead with the so-called new policies, the policies for the future?
Indeed, if there is no agreement we will keep the policies of the past; we will not have the means for the policies for the future.
I also think we all agree that an enlarged, more diverse European Union needs more investment.
I do not say âthe costs of enlargementâ because I do not like the word âcostsâ when we speak about enlargement.
But now that we are a much bigger Europe and we are a much more diverse Europe we need more investment for those new Members.
We have to share the burden of this investment.
We have a duty of solidarity to the new Member States who look to the European Union for support in their rapid and remarkable progress in modernisation and reform.
This is a win-win situation for all Member States.
This is not a zero-sum game and it is precisely because we have to bridge this gap that I came up with some proposals, including a proposal now being taken into consideration by the British Presidency â I thank the British Presidency for that â linking cohesion and competitiveness.
In our thinking there is no contradiction between cohesion on one side and competitiveness on the other, on the contrary.
The cohesion and support for the new Member States is also a way for them to improve their competitiveness and for Europe as a whole to be more competitive.
So I hope that those proposals will be taken into account in the final agreement so in the end it will also be clear that what we are proposing is not money for an old concept of Europe, it is money for a more competitive and more modern Europe, but a Europe that at the same time keeps its strong values in terms of cohesion.
We need a fair sharing of this burden.
No Member State can do enlargement on the cheap.
I trust in the common sense of the British Presidency to deliver a fair and balanced agreement next month.
I hope that we will achieve this by strengthening, and not reducing, the Commission and Parliamentâs ambition for an enlarged Europe. Because we have to say very frankly that the financial perspectives represent an agreement between the Council, Commission and the Parliament, and the position of Parliament and the Commission should be taken into consideration in the final agreement.
Hampton Court was indeed a success.
Hampton Court was the first very important step in a new consensus for a dynamic, modern Europe.
I hope that the positive spirit of dynamism and openness which everyone showed there can be turned into agreement on the budget now.
I give my full support to the Presidency in its efforts to achieve that and I wish the Presidency and all the Member States the very best.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Barroso, the Presidency wishes to point out that the debate was on the European Council at Hampton Court and it is turning into a preliminary debate on the financial perspective.
But the Presidency is not going to tell the participants in the debate what they must discuss.
They may insist on the issue of the financial perspective if they wish, although it does not specifically appear on the agenda.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of Hampton Court, the President of the European Council was present in this House, not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
He is, it is true to say, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom too, but it is in that capacity that he is President of the European Council.
Tony Blair being here the day before Hampton Court sent the right message.
In that, I think he got the order right: Parliament first, and then the Heads of State or Government.
I am also very glad that the President of this House was at Hampton Court for the duration.
I recommend to you, Mr President-in-Office, that you invite the President of Parliament to Brussels for the whole of the summit.
That could then be the beginning of good practice for the future, and the United Kingdom would always be remembered for having fully involved the President of the European Parliament in the European summits.
Your reference to the quality of the Members present today was a masterpiece of British understatement.
I think it is marvellous that you use that to express indirect but justified criticism of the fact that there could be more of us here, but it was our quality that you chose to highlight, and that shows what mastery of parliamentary skills is to be found in the UK.
It is at this point that I feel the need to sound a cautionary note.
You mentioned the visits by ministers and said that a minister had been to the European institutions on 48 occasions.
Tremendous though I think that is, and certain though I am that the number will rise to 60, because we still have six weeks left, it has to be said that, at the end of the day, what is crucial is that the quantity of ministers from the British Presidency should be matched by their quality, and we still harbour the hope that it will be by the end of December this year.
You said that Europe is very distant from its citizens; that is indeed the case, and we will have to give some thought to how we can, together, improve that, but the same can be said of politics at the national level too.
It follows that we have to make the same effort at national and at European level if people are to have confidence in the policy-making process.
When considered from an outsiderâs point of view â and I am sure this was one of the things Hampton Court achieved â I do think that there is new trust between the parties involved.
As Chairman of a Group with MEPs from all 25 Member States and from 45 national parties, I know from experience that, where there is such a problematic interplay of interests â such as is also to be found in the other political groups, in this Parliament as a whole, and in the national governments â problems can be resolved only if there is trust.
Where trust is absent, there are no political solutions either.
What we expect of the Heads of State or Government is that each and every one of them should play his part in fostering trust in the other members of the European Council.
I have no desire to repeat right now all the things that have been said about the future of Europe, about the Commissionâs paper, and about globalisation, but what is crucial is that we should accept what is at the heart of globalisation â the fact that we are one world and becoming more and more so; on the other hand, though, globalisation is not just something for us to endure, but rather something that we can shape, and by that I mean that we can, through political action, keep globalisationâs excesses, and its negative manifestations, under our control.
That is what I regard as being our task.
I would now like to say something about the most important decision that has to be taken, about which you have already had a debate, albeit in the margins.
I refer, as did the President of this House earlier on, to the Financial Perspective.
I hope you will not mind if I advise you â and even if you do, I will advise you anyway â that you should find a solution to the Financial Perspective, for the UK was always in favour of enlargement, thanks to which there are Members from the countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 in this House today, even if it has not always gone down the same road with us where institutional issues are concerned.
If you cannot get the Financial Perspective right, that will be disappointment for the formerly Communist countries in particular, who joined us on 1Â May 2004.
I therefore urge you to do everything possible to get a result.
It has to be said, though, that if you and the President of the European Council are to do that, you will need to have the courage to draw a clear line under the issue of the British rebate.
You spoke of fundamental change, and you probably had agricultural policy in mind when you did so, but we also need fundamental change in the contributions made by the individual Member States, and that is where the United Kingdom, during your presidency, can have a major part to play.
The agricultural policy has been laid down for the period ending in 2013, but, if a solution is found to the issue of the British rebate, and if we want to have a Financial Perspective, it must be ensured that we can, at some point, give serious thought to the further reform of agricultural policy, with the intention of producing at least a binding declaration of intent.
When you discuss the Financial Perspective and, I hope, come to some decisions on it, Mr President-in-Office â and I am also saying this to the Commission â I urge you to remember that you, in the Council, are not taking decisions on your own; the European Parliament is part of the budgetary authority, and it possesses equal rights of codecision, so you need to guarantee that it is fully involved.
Just as you do, of course, we represent the citizens of Europe, and if we, together, show goodwill, if we have trust in one another, our problems will not be insoluble.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Hampton Court was a Summit lacking any formal conclusions.
The promises made at the Summit are in danger of being just as short-lived as the marital commitments contracted by King Henry VIII in the very same palace.
The UK Presidency is right to call on the 25 to carry out reforms, to invest more in the technologies of the future and to create the conditions for increased employment.
Reforms are still needed but, for many Europeans, the word âreformâ has a negative connotation and is synonymous with job losses and the scaling down of society.
MrÂ Straw has just criticised Parliamentâs position with regard to the Working Time Directive.
I advise the minister to re-read the very first convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation at the time of the League of Nations, a convention that aimed at a 48-hour week without opt-out.
The reforms will be accepted if they allow general welfare to be improved.
In order to make this happen, Europe must change its overly pessimistic and despondent position.
Viewed from the outside, the Union serves as an example.
The President of Chile said so here last month.
To read the Commissionâs communications, though, Europe will to all intents and purposes have become a hospice by the year 2050.
Who among us will be able to check whether these alarmist forecasts have proved accurate in 2050?
Yes, Europe will be faced with an ageing population.
Yet, Japan and Russia will experience a declining population.
What can be said, furthermore, about China, with its one-child policy?
What can be said about India and the other countries that are unable to curb the spiralling growth of their populations?
Which country will experience the greatest demographic problems by the year 2020, without even daring to talk about 2050?
If there is one area in which Europe could imitate the United States, it is that of immigration policy, which could be more generous.
A large part of the United Statesâ surplus growth in the last decade comes from the contribution of the ten million Latin Americans and the hundreds of thousands of European and Asian scientists.
Two weeks ago, the US Senate decided to award 330Â 000 additional Green Cards each year to highly qualified immigrants.
Europeâs competitiveness is a constant concern.
Comparing Europe with others in terms of its hourly competitiveness and particularly its industrial competitiveness, it is clear that we are easily beating the United States in the majority of economic sectors.
The Commissionâs communication on industrial policy recognises this.
The European Union is still the first destination and the first source for international investments.
In 2003, the investments of the 15 were four times higher in the ten new countries than in China, which received only 3.8% of European investment.
Let us therefore stop being afraid of China.
It is only natural that a country with 1.3Â billion people should take a greater share in international trade but, in absolute figures, Europeâs share in international trade is increasing, even though some sectors are experiencing difficulties.
However, nine tenths of our trade is not done with low-salary countries but with developed countries.
Globalisation provides a great opportunity for reducing poverty in the world.
For 50 years, growth in international trade has been faster than growth in gross world product.
This demonstrates that foreign trade is not a no-stakes game, but has enabled millions of people to escape poverty while at the same time benefiting consumers in wealthy countries.
It is in fact our consumers who, by buying the cheapest products, force our manufacturers to become more competitive.
The Union remains the leading export power in the world, led by Germany, France and Italy.
These three countries are nevertheless at a standstill in terms of internal growth.
Their citizens are saving record amounts.
For their part, the Americans and the British are consuming and getting into dangerous amounts of debt.
In order to restart growth, we have to restore confidence among Europeans.
There is no alternative to the market, but the market is unable to create the solidarity that is the distinctive sign of the European model.
Political will is required in order to create more solidarity among our countries and within our countries.
Policy always boils down to a question of resources and, on this point, I agree with MrÂ Barroso. It is budgetary resources that Europe sorely lacks.
MrÂ Blair is right to encourage us to invest more in research and universities.
This means that the Unionâs budget should receive more in the way of resources than the paltry 1% of GDP that a few important countries, beginning with Great Britain, wish to grant.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will judge the Presidency on its ability to release a realistic, but more generous, financial perspective.
The December Summit must be the Summit of renewed solidarity.
A strong commitment from the 25 towards a coordinated reflationary policy, as well as greater national and trans-European infrastructure investment, will enable Europe to restart growth, which is a prerequisite for gaining acceptance of difficult structural reforms.
It is growth that will create stability, and not the other way round.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Goebbels.
The debate is heating up, and this is positive in terms of ensuring that more Members become involved in it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I can understand how the high-level relationship therapy at Hampton Court apparently proceeded as it should.
It took place, however, in duly romantic and exclusive surroundings, so the odds were all on your side.
Now that all the government leaders are home again after their therapy, we shall see for definite whether Tony Blairâs therapeutic efforts have borne fruit, for we all of course know that, when marriages begin to fall apart, couples often relapse into familiar bad habits.
I therefore have a practical request to make to the Presidency and the Commission.
In practice, there is really very little that the EU countries can do jointly to set in motion the necessary and desired process of reform aimed at modernising the European labour market so that it suits todayâs society.
We all know of course that this necessary work needs to be carried out by the individual Member States.
Efforts at reform are an exclusively national matter.
The EU can and must, however, complete the work on creating a fully-fledged internal market for capital and services.
While the effects of the relationship therapy can still be felt, I would therefore call on the Presidency and the Commission to work towards ensuring that the European services and capital markets are fully liberalised.
I am convinced that, if this process is a success, it will yield genuine labour market reforms on the basis of the motto, âThere is no alternativeâ.
The benefits to the people of such a reform would be huge, and that is of course what EU cooperation is all about: providing our fellow citizens with additional benefits.
I should also like to put a clear question to you, MrÂ Straw.
You mention the Court of Auditorsâ annual report.
Are you prepared to set a good example and ensure that you and the United Kingdom assume responsibility for administering an EU subsidy in your country, something that, unfortunately, your Chancellor last week refused to do?
I seek a clear answer from you.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . MrÂ Straw, MrÂ Barroso, I have three remarks to make in response to your speech, MrÂ Straw.
As regards the Hague Conference, which you mentioned, I will take the liberty of suggesting very modestly to you that you re-read the draft Constitution you signed which, in my opinion, includes solutions in relation both to the division of powers and to the role of national parliaments.
Why abandon this draft?
With regard to social policy and the Working Time Directive, I agree with you: we must be in favour of national diversity but, if we must draw inspiration from one model, I should very much like to draw my inspiration from the Scandinavian model.
On the subject of the single market, now: I hope that you will agree with me that competition also needs to be fair and balanced.
In other words, the single market is also built on common social standards, and thus forms part of the very spirit of the Treaties.
As regards the budget, lastly, I believe that we are encountering a real credibility problem in terms both of revenue and of spending â MrÂ Barroso and the European Parliament have sufficiently alluded to this.
For the European Union of 25 to succeed and for us to express our ongoing solidarity towards the new Member States and to carry out an external policy with sufficient resources â possibly more than 5% of the budget - presupposes an increase in the Community budget.
Above all â and this will be my final point â we must leave to one side a budgetary debate characterised by an increase in national self-interest.
In the mid-term review requested by the Commission and Parliament, the Presidency and the entire European Council must make the political commitment to propose a European mechanism providing the European Union with real independent resources for the future of the Unionâs policies.
Armed with such a commitment, it will perhaps be possible for us to convince our citizens of the usefulness of European policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we have the opportunity today, in the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, to make an appraisal of the informal European Council held at the end of last month.
Unfortunately, while the idea of convening the Council was not a bad idea, it suffered most in the execution.
Indeed, at a time when the European Union is on its last legs, given that we have twenty million unemployed, where we do not know how to address social problems, especially those which broke out recently in France, and where the citizens' confidence in governments is falling by geometrical progression, the idea of the leaders of the European Union meeting in London in order to discuss the European social model and the resistance to globalisation was, on the face of it, a very good one.
Unfortunately, instead of agreement prevailing, we again witnessed the customary quarrels break out about as important an issue to the future of Europe as the financial perspectives.
I would remind the House that Mr Blair, during his speech from this same tribune in the European Parliament on 23 June, stated that he had always been an enthusiastic champion of Europe.
I wonder, four and a half months later, how Mr Blair is translating these words into practice.
What is the appraisal of his country's Presidency so far, given that one month before it ends we have not reached agreement on the financial perspectives.
The social model has not progressed even one inch and the Council's response to globalisation is the creation of an ambiguous adjustment fund.
I truly wonder, Mr President of the Commission, if you have seriously thought about the reaction of the workers made redundant when you tell them that there is the panacea of the fund for all the ills of globalisation.
The British Presidency had the opportunity to write history at Hampton Court.
Instead, it demonstrated once again that this is a union of interests which wastes time and public money on talks of no substance and whose mistakes, unfortunately, have to be paid for by the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Hampton Court meeting was to be the âsocial modelâ summit.
Then Mr Blair socialised â the same Mr Blair who strode into Brussels in July promising root and branch reform, but then pruned it down to the most invisible square root of a branch of any EU Presidency in memory.
The comments after Hampton Court were from those amazed that nothing happened.
In fact it should be labelled the Hampton Court âaMazeâ.
The ARD TV station in Germany said that, after four months, nothing happened â absolutely nothing.
The Polish media called it one of the most bizarre EU summits.
In Italy, just called it âembarrassedâ and âembarrassingâ.
Mr Blair claimed it debated the things the public wanted it to debate, but the public does not want European policies for universities when the EU has no competence in education.
Nor does it want things like nine separate missions around the world as part of an EU defence policy.
If Hampton Court proved anything, it was that vacuums are dangerous when filled with hot air from politicians.
I propose that a blue metal plaque be placed on the wall at Hampton Court saying: âOn this spot on 27Â October 2005 nothing happenedâ or, as they say in Yorkshire: âEee, you must be jokinââ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, to paraphrase your introductory words, MrÂ Straw, I am here and I beg to differ.
Joking aside, despite MrÂ Blairâs and MrÂ Barrosoâs welcome good intentions, the practical outcome of the Hampton Court Summit was highly unsatisfactory.
First of all, the long-awaited platform on the Commissionâs European social model seemed rather disappointing.
No real strategy and no targets for a genuine revival of Europeâs economy were proposed; instead there was just a policy of damage limitation.
So far there has been nothing concrete behind high-sounding claims such as the âLisbonisationâ of resources and the globalisation fund.
As for MrÂ Blair, the balance of his political account is certainly not in the black.
Despite continual outward reassurances, there is in fact no agreement on the financial perspective, which is clearly the crux of the problem.
Finally, there is no real intention above all to renew the debate on the United Kingdomâs unfair rebate.
It is a privilege that has been paid for mainly by Italy and France, siphoning off precious resources from our two countries.
Â Â  Mr President, from the spin of today one would think that much had been achieved at Hampton Court, but as we have already heard, the verdict of the informed EU press was almost universally negative.
One press agency reported that many papers could not recall a more useless and shallow example of posturing with no outcome.
One paper talked of a bizarre show of relaxed leaders who dodged the most crucial issues facing Europe.
Another called it a summit of impasse with a facade of forced smiles.
The said in an article that the leaders attempted to answer the question of what impact globalisation would have on the European economy and concluded that we needed more research and development and, of course, more money.
In other words, they failed to answer the question.
The EU, the said, is the wrong institutional platform from which to deal with globalisation.
It has become too large and divided.
The appropriate political levels are national governments and the eurozone.
I suggest that the article in the comes close to the truth.
If individual Member States were to expend the same effort and energy addressing the issue of how, as nations, to compete in a global market as they did in preparing showcase summits, then I suspect we might all see much more product.
My biggest fear arising from the failure of the Hampton Court summit and a lacklustre British Presidency is that it will make my government over-eager to secure a face-saving deal on the budget in December and that, as a result, Mr Blair will concede far too much on the British rebate, just so it can be said that something was achieved by the British Presidency â that is to say something other than ensuring EU bankruptcy by opening the door to Turkish accession.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very sorry but I am afraid I have to be a little bit churlish as well.
The summit at Hampton Court was what I warned it would be: something of a talking shop â or even a talking palace.
And I think that Mr Strawâs speech was as Churchill once said âa pudding without a themeâ.
First the Prime Minister downgraded the Hampton Court meeting to one day.
He then constructed an agenda that was thin on specifics and avoided all the major and pressing issues facing the EU and finally, amazingly, he decided there would be no communiquÃ© at the end.
These are hardly the hallmarks of a Presidency and Prime Minister leading the agenda and shaping our future.
I am frankly surprised the Presidency has anything at all to report to us from the summit.
At least, however, this Parliament is receiving a report, something which the Prime Minister failed to give the British House of Commons in the aftermath of the event.
The Informal Council was a wasted opportunity.
Europe needs direction on economic reform.
Instead, the Presidency produced a couple of discussion papers written by academics and even these were not discussed.
Europe needs direction on reforming the so-called social model.
Again all we had were a few worthy but irrelevant discussion papers.
Europe needs direction on being more flexible and responsive.
However, the fundamental issue of what to do following the rejection of the Constitution was not even on the table for discussion.
Europe also needs direction on its future financing.
There are serious issues here, not least the question of the rebate. But the Presidency continues to avoid the matter and the drift continues.
I agree with Mr Barroso that the Presidency must make efforts to reach an outcome at the December Council.
We will be looking carefully to see precisely what is contained there and whether Mr Blair ditches his previous commitments in protecting the British rebate.
Transparency and openness is another issue for the Presidency.
Recently I called for meetings of the Council to be held in public when it is operating in a legislative capacity.
Mr Blair says he wants progress on this.
I challenge the Presidency to implement such a procedure before its term of office ends and I look forward to the Councilâs answer in this matter at Question Time following this debate.
What about the Court of Auditorsâ report on the EU accounts?
For the eleventh year in succession, the Court has been unable to give a statement of assurance on the accounts.
This really must be sorted out by the Presidency.
Drift and indecision have been a fundamental characteristic of the British Presidency.
Indeed, the Prime Minister of Slovakia speaking on it said âsilence reigns, we do not have informationâ.
I must agree with that analysis and, whilst enjoying Mr Strawâs speech today, I cannot see that it takes us anywhere useful at all.
Hampton Court provided no evidence that the Presidency and particularly that the Prime Minister had any strategy.
He gave every appearance of drifting from summit to summit unable or unwilling to provide the kind of leadership we British Conservatives called for in June.
Let us hope that the last chance saloon at the forthcoming Brussels Summit will demonstrate that my disappointment with the British Presidency is actually misplaced.
Â Â  Mr President, recently a terrorist suspect wanted by the British Government was arrested and extradited from Rome in a matter of weeks.
This was a direct result of the European arrest warrant; previously it could have taken years.
This is just one example of the positive benefits the European Union brings to its citizens.
Each citizen has benefited from the single market by some EURÂ 6Â 000 a head in increased output.
It is possible, if you wish, to swim in the sea off Blackpool in my region because of European Union laws that have improved the environment.
Those are positive benefits for our citizens.
We need to do more to shout those positive benefits.
I welcome the papers that were presented at Hampton Court, because they deal with how the European Union can bring added value to our citizens, particularly in the area of the energy markets where we have a crisis waiting to happen.
However, we have to ensure that there is follow-up on these matters.
One of the difficulties with the Lisbon Agenda in particular is that Member States themselves promise to deliver but do not.
I would hope that out of the Hampton Court discussions came a clarification of the role of Member States and the important role of the European Commission in ensuring that Member States carry out that which they have already agreed.
If that were to happen, the European Union could move much further forward without necessarily having any of the grand plans that some people have outlined in this debate.
Let us stick to delivering what we agreed to deliver.
That will be the key success of the European Union.
I congratulate the President-in-Office for the commitment made by this Presidency to Parliament.
We are delighted at the extent to which ministers have engaged Parliament and particularly the extent to which the British Home Secretary has ensured that Parliament is involved in taking forward that security agenda.
That is one of the most important dimensions of where the European Union is going in future to protect the interests of its citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a meeting with little or no purpose, held in pleasant surroundings, under a warm autumn sun: that is what the Informal Summit at Hampton Court was.
No practical outcome, no progress, no perspective.
In short, the Heads of State or Government did not even attempt to outline the beginnings of a response to Europeâs deep crisis, just as though finally they were more than happy to put up with this crisis.
Instead of formulating a response, they did what they usually do and trotted out the catalogue of proposals that have been repeated a thousand times over.
Yes, the European effort in relation to research and development obviously needs to increase.
Yes, centres of excellence at university level are obviously needed.
Yes, a common energy policy is obviously needed.
Yes, a real immigration policy is obviously needed too.
Finally, yes, Europe obviously needs a security policy.
We always come back to the same old problems, though.
If we want to do things together, we need political will, we need effective and democratic institutions and we need a common budget.
Well, it is clear that, in relation to these three points, nothing has been undertaken, or even attempted, by the UK Presidency.
The UK Presidency has not only failed to get the Union working again, but has also contributed to its decline.
