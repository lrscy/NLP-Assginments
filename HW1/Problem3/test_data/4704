They are, in fact, choosing the road of peace, away from occupation, away from terror and state terror, and towards the negotiating table and, hopefully, peace eventually.
I would be interested to hear from Messrs Solana and Patten whether they are prepared to express this support.
It is with considerable sadness, and with full sympathy for your frustration, High Representative Solana, that we have seen the ongoing deterioration of the situation in the Middle East over the past few months, especially when we were convinced, after 11 September, of the urgent need to find a political solution to the problem.
I should simply like to recall the closing statement of the special session of the Mediterranean Forum, held in Brussels in November, before the vote on 13 December on our recommendations preceding the formal declaration by the Laeken Council.
I would remind you that this statement called for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the Tenet plan and of the recommendations of the Mitchell committee, and reiterated our conviction, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that establishing an impartial monitoring mechanism would serve the interests of both parties.
It has to be said that all of this has come to nothing and that, in fact, recent events seem to have closed the door on any serious attempt to restart negotiations.
Although, like William of Orange, I believe that it is neither necessary to have hope in order to embark on a course of action nor is it necessary to succeed in order to persevere, I feel that we must welcome the fact, Mr Solana, that you are ceaseless, as you have just demonstrated, in making every possible effort to give renewed hope, which is so badly needed in that part of the world, to the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
We can only encourage you to pursue all initiatives for cooperation between the United Nations, the United States and the most directly involved Arab States, in order to put forward proposals, in conjunction with them, on actions that are crucial to restoring mutual trust and respect, without which the current downward spiral of violence can never be halted.
This is why I am not in favour of our Parliament today playing the role of excommunicator.
As Commissioner Patten said in his last speech to this House, 'What is past, is past' .
What we are interested in is the future and the immediate future.
I also feel that I am summing up the opinion of the majority of Members when I repeat that we in Parliament are ready and willing to fulfil our mandate to take the initiative by issuing another invitation - why not President Cox? - to the representatives of the two States at the highest level, perhaps even Mr Arafat himself, to come and explain their intentions to us, as the speakers of the Palestinian Legislative Council and the Knesset did in September 2000.
By the same token, we would like to encourage you to give positive consideration, in conjunction with the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, to the possibility of holding an ambitious peace conference along the lines of the conference held in Madrid, in which, Mr Solana, you played such an important part, as you reminded us.
In our own interests and for the sake of coherence with the spirit of our unreserved commitment to the fight against terrorism, we must play as active a role as possible in saving the peace process, while respecting the legitimate rights of the region' s peoples.
Mr President, the European reaction, which has been somewhat more coherent than usual, has come at the right time.
It has now become quite clear that Mr Sharon' s policy is leading nowhere.
When there are no political prospects on the horizon, the Old Testament prescription of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' leads directly to horror and to chaos.
Bloodshed leads to further bloodshed.
This is a return to the Middle Ages, even to prehistoric times.
It is therefore high time that the Council of the European Union, the Commission and all our governments spoke up, loudly and clearly, whatever the President of the United States might think.
It is Mr Sharon, and not Mr Arafat, who has the power to end the conflict.
How can he do this?
Simply by complying with international law, by ending the repressive occupation of Palestine and by withdrawing behind Israel' s internationally recognised borders.
The best way to protect both Israeli and Palestinian citizens is to re-establish a proper border between the two peoples.
The way out of the deadlock of hatred does not lie in the humiliation and the destabilisation of Mr Arafat.
It lies in land distribution and in acknowledging Palestinian nationhood, not in the medium term, but immediately.
Mr Solana, Mr Patten, you must state this quite clearly.
This is the urgent message that all of Europe' s representatives should be conveying.
Mr President, I too congratulate the High Representative, Mr Solana, and Commissioner Patten for their untiring work.
We share your frustration at the lack of outcomes.
Has the time come now for us to move on from dialogue and move into shared partnerships, overcoming perceived religious differences to tackle common human evils of poverty, ill health and illiteracy?
Surely the place today for dialogue is within Islam, between Muslim and Muslim, to work out ways of discarding false jihads, rejecting distorted interpretations of the Koran that lead inevitably to misguided martyrdoms and terrorist assaults.
Islam is a faith that promotes peace, equality and a secure life.
Meanwhile we should tackle the lack of democracy in the oil-rich states.
Here we can assist through building civil society and use means such as our association agreement with Egypt to exert undoubted influence.
High Representative Solana mentioned the Islamic Republic of Iran.
My view is his as well.
I believe we should open a Commission office in Tehran as soon as possible.
This is an Islamic state, and yet a democracy; it has Sharia law, and yet a parliament.
Surely Iran is part of the solution rather than part of the problem - a peaceful society in a violent region.
I thank our Commissioner and our High Representative and their staff for all their work.
Mr President, Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon's recent remark that he regrets not having killed Yasser Arafat in Lebanon in 1982 is unforgivable.
But I suppose we should not be surprised: Mr Sharon's own terrorist behaviour in Lebanon, when he permitted the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, was subsequently condemned by Israel's Kahane Commission of Inquiry.
Given this fact, it is regrettable that he was subsequently elected as Prime Minster of Israel, this being the root of many of the current problems.
Current Israeli policy is ludicrous and counterproductive.
How can they make demands on Arafat to behave as if he was the leader of a normal state, while at one and the same time they make him a virtual prisoner in his own home, destroy his airport and his broadcasting station and humiliate him?
Who do they want to replace him with?
In the post-11 September situation, the European Union has been oversensitive in its approach to the Middle East. We are indeed an honest broker and we should be vigorous in that approach.
The fact that the Americans are indebted to us for the solidarity and the support that we provided when they needed it should mean that we are entitled to a reciprocal response from them.
And instead of being the puppet of Israel, they should join with us in an even-handed policy approach to the tragedy in the Middle East.
If that is not forthcoming, then we should act on our own.
It is frustrating that the United States through its present stance is becoming much more part of the problem than part of the solution.
Mr President, I thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for continuing, in spite of everything, with their already excessively longstanding efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East.
We are clearly facing a frustrating, cruel and, if I may say so, surreal, situation.
It is surreal because we are facing a situation in which the Prime Minister of Israel does not support the constructive conclusions of his Foreign Affairs Minister.
It is also surreal because Mr Sharon - who regrets not having destroyed Mr Arafat, who he describes as irrelevant, in Beirut in 1982, and who calls the Palestinian Authority a terrorist organisation - is meeting with three notable members of this so-called terrorist organisation.
It is surreal because Mr Arafat is under great pressure to combat terrorism but, at the same time, Israel - and we are allowing it - is bombing and thereby destroying the resources available to the Palestinian Authority for combating that terrorism.
This surrealism, however, is welcome if it can bring us closer to peace and development in the region, not only for Palestine.
I would like to say however - and I hope I am wrong - that I hope these talks by Mr Sharon with these supposed terrorists from a supposed terrorist organisation, are not simply another attempt to gain time before his meeting with President Bush in Washington tomorrow.
I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, a question relating to the famous seized vessel, the Karim-A: it appears that the people who are trying to ascertain whether the evidence of Iran' s involvement is reliable are working on the basis of stronger evidence than the appearance of arms which are 'made in Iran' , because we all know that the fact that arms are manufactured in a particular country does not necessarily mean that they are supplied by the government of that country.
Mr President, I say this - and I will end here - because, in this era of trilateral evil, and the demonisation of the situation and the desire to spread suspicions all over the place, it could be a fatal error to encourage suspicions of this type in relation to those invisible enemies which Mr Bush is currently dealing with.
Mr President, this debate has focused largely on the situation in the Middle East.
I am not sure that the largely one-sided tone of this Chamber is at all helpful.
I endorse Mr Brok's call for a more balanced approach but as requested I also want to take the opportunity briefly to touch on another area of crisis which is of increasing concern at the moment and where the European Union has the capacity to exert some influence.
I am referring to Zimbabwe.
Even if electoral observers are allowed in, we must maintain the pressure on Mr Mugabe to deliver free and fair elections.
We do not want to be in a position of merely recording that the election was fixed and standing back and wringing our hands afterwards.
We want the presence of observers to deter violence and electoral fraud so that the Zimbabwean people can make a genuinely free choice.
Many of us continue to be alarmed by reports from inside Zimbabwe about the situation on the ground.
I am referring to the fact that five MDC supporters have been killed in the past week, that MDC demonstrations and rallies have been disrupted by the police, that the independent press is restricted, the Independent correspondent, Basildon Peta, was earlier today arrested under the Public Order and Security Act and the Australian journalist Sally Sara has been refused admission.
Taken together one might think that these matters already constitute a breach of EU conditions.
I have some questions for Mr Solana.
What representations are being made to the Government of South Africa to apply greater regional pressure on the Mugabe government?
Are the measures for the implementation of smart sanctions now in place?
What level of deterioration in the situation will trigger these sanctions?
Is the European Union's response being fully coordinated with that of the United States?
Thank you, Mr President, talking about the conflict in the Middle East means being faced with the substantial dilemma of striking a balance between Israel' s right to safe borders and a viable Palestinian state.
We are further from this goal than ever before, or so it seems.
Nobody feels safe anymore, either in Israel or in the Palestinian state.
Nobody appears to be able to play an objective role in getting the peace process back on track.
The extremists set the agenda, and the Americans seem to tolerate the tough stance adopted by Prime Minister Sharon.
Whichever way one defines the position of President Arafat, it seems to me that, without him, chaos would descend on the Palestinian Regions.
What can the European Union do?
In my view, we should mainly keep the channels of communication open.
I back those fellow MEPs who say that we must continue talks with both parties and exert pressure on Israel to accept the Palestinian Authority as the only significant interlocutor, and so find the way back to consultation.
However, we must also continue to ask Mr Arafat to tackle the terrorists on his own home turf.
The European Union should be prepared to postpone a certain form of cooperation with Israel in this context, but not to rule such postponement out in respect of the Palestinian Authority either, should it transpire that the fight against terrorism is not being taken seriously.
This brings me to yet another point which I should like to put to Mr Solana.
The conflict in the Middle East is also tied in with the relationship between the EU and the United States, and this issue is also important in the fight against terrorism.
In addition, I should like to find out his reaction to the statements by President Bush who talks about the axis of evil and the three countries he refers to by this.
What is the EU' s reaction to this?
Is he driving a new wedge between the European Union and the United States?
I would particularly like to know what implications these statements by President Bush have for the policy of the European Union, particularly with regard to Iran.
I am interested to know how the Council assesses Iran, but also the other countries which are being accused by the Americans of state support for terrorism.
In my opinion, this will be an important issue in the time to come, also in connection with the fresh debate on the military superiority of the United States and the military weakness of the European Union.
Mr President, as the last Member to speak in today's debate, it appears to me that there has been an unusual degree of unanimity, accompanied both by concern and a determination to bring about some sort of happy ending.
Are we really in the worst stage of the Palestinian crisis or has the tragedy risen to its climax, to be followed by catharsis and a way out?
Without wishing to judge, we must admit that Sharon's policy has even made victims of the Israelis: he has painted himself into a corner with a no-win policy.
Perhaps Sharon dreams of a final solution to the Palestine problem, to complete the circle of one of the darkest periods in the history of Europe.
But America must take its share of the blame for failing to understand that supporting no-win policies basically undermines its own policy and role.
Are we Europeans merely bystanders here?
No, we are not.
I believe that the proposals made by both Commissioner Pattern and the High Representative, Mr Solana, and everything else said during the debate, are very serious proposals with the potential to become practical policy.
Nor do I think that we, the European Union, are mere bystanders doomed, like Sisyphus, to roll the boulder to the top of the mountain and then watch others toss it back over the edge.
We must, however, also turn our attention to other matters because now we have a crisis in the Middle East and tension on the borders of the European Union.
And then we have another crisis within Europe.
The Balkan crisis.
In this sense, Mr Solana was right to comment on the state of flux around Albania, around Kosovo, around Montenegro and the area in general, where there is not so much a fragile equilibrium as an unstable equilibrium, which is far worse.
The success of any endeavour which, in the Balkans in particular, has been undertaken mainly by the European Union, must be based on - and we must insist on - a fundamentally political solution, because that is where, in the final analysis, we shall be judged on our ability to manage crises peaceably and bring about political results.
I should just like to place on record our gratitude to the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council, Mr RamÃ³n de Miguel, for being here for the entire afternoon to listen to this debate.
Frequently that is not the case in these debates.
Mr President, I will try to be brief and to start by thanking you all - those who are here, those who have left - very much for your support for our efforts to bring peace to an area which, as I said at the very beginning, is geographically close to us and also very close to our hearts, minds and values.
I would stress once again that the difficulty of the problem is not the absence of a mechanism to provide a solution to the crisis.
We already have the Mitchell report, which contains the steps to be followed, and it has been accepted by both sides.
The problem is not that we do not have rails on which the train should be travelling but that we have not been able to get the train out of the station.
The train cannot leave the station until the requirement of a seven-day period of complete calm has been fulfilled.
But what happens?
When you set seven days of complete calm as a precondition, you can always find somebody who is not for the peace process and who, at the last minute, can engineer a catastrophe.
Therefore, you are back to square one.
That has happened on a couple of occasions.
This manner of doing things hands the initiative to the most radical people and takes it away from the moderates.
That is the problem we have at this point in time.
Let us hope that the modest beginnings of conversations - I would not call them negotiations between the two sides - held right now, yesterday, tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, maybe at the beginning of the week, will produce at least a change in the way they handle the crisis, by not placing the solution in the hands of those who do not want the process to move forward.
I have not received many questions. Therefore I am not going to respond to the very interesting remarks you have made.
At least 90% of your statements have been supportive.
Two questions have been put very clearly and I would like to answer them before I make my final remarks.
On the question by Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle regarding Karine-A, I do not have the intelligence on which several countries have based their statements.
Several countries - some are members of the European Union - state that their intelligence has established a link.
Whether it is a state-to-state or state-group-to-state-group link is an open question.
But there is no doubt that some kind of link exists between the Iranian people and some Palestinians.
The second question I would like to answer is from Mr Brok, although he is not here.
This joint effort is being carried out every day on the ground by representatives of the European Union, of the United States, of the Secretary-General of the UN and of the Russian Federation.
They work together every day.
I would remind you also that we - that is, I, Mr Powell, Mr Ivanov, Mr Koffi Annan - meet regularly to deal with this issue collectively.
We need to be tenacious and persevering.
We also need a change in both societies, and not only in the authorities that lead the countries.
Those societies have indeed changed very profoundly in the last few years.
Israel has changed.
The strong, broad-based peace camp there has not disappeared, but it has been reduced.
The same thing has happened on the other side.
Frustration has created a sentiment that the peace camp cannot bring about peace in a reasonable period of time.
That lack of trust and of confidence between both sides was not present before.
I remember very well the relative friendship in Oslo between Arafat and Peres and between Rabin and Arafat.
That has disappeared.
We have to do something to reconstruct society vis-Ã -vis society and we, as Europeans, have a tremendous amount of work to do there, to bring these societies together, because they will have to live together.
Whatever we can do through this Parliament, through the institutions, through the NGOs, we must do.
I would like to tell you two little anecdotes, one from a very good friend of mine who was in the peace camp in Jerusalem.
The other day he told me that he would not dare send his daughter and his son to school in the same bus.
That is a dramatic and profound change in the heart and in the mind of somebody who would otherwise be a fighter for peace.
On the other side, on the Palestinian side, you go to a hospital, you talk to a paediatrician and he tells you how a little boy has been killed.
This is a terrible blow to trust and confidence among people.
Therefore we have to work also with societies.
We have to engage societies, universities, schools, doctors, etc. to impress upon them that they have to live together and that Europe will be behind that sentiment of reconciliation.
That is something we have to do.
I will conclude by recalling a beautiful phrase from Yitzhak Rabin who, without any doubt, was the architect of the Oslo process, together with Shimon Peres.
He used to say something that is still valid.
We have to fight against terrorism, as if there were no negotiations, and we have to negotiate as if there were no terrorism.
That is the approach we have to rally around today.
It is necessary to continue the negotiations, to continue talking, to continue moving the political scene - the centre of gravity has to be politics.
Until they put politics at the centre of gravity, it will be very difficult to move the process forwards.
We can be proud of what we as Europeans are doing.
We do not have the capacity to solve the problem, but we can move in the right direction as soon as possible and aim for peace.
This is not a question only of values.
It is part of our history, no doubt about that, but it is also part of our future, the future of this European Union, of the countries in an enlarged European Union and of the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, which are part of our family.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2) I have received seven motions for resolution to wind up the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Several colleagues - Mr Cohn-Bendit, General Morillon and some others - made a number of suggestions as to initiatives Parliament might take.
I am very open to working with the Conference of Presidents and colleagues on those.
Last week I had a very productive private meeting with Ambassador Moratinos to seek his advice as to how best to move some of these ideas forward.
We will talk about that in the appropriate forum.
Vertical agreements and concerted practices in the automobile industry
The next item is the Commission communication on vertical agreements and concerted practices in the automobile industry.
Mr President, it is my pleasure to make this - albeit brief - presentation of the draft motor vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, which the Commission adopted this morning.
Parliament is aware of the relatively severe practical limitations of the current Block Exemption Regulation, which is due to expire next September.
It is not sufficiently beneficial for consumers, particularly where they wish to exercise their right to a single market.
Moreover, the rules currently in force hinder the development of new methods, including Internet distribution; lastly, access to technical information for independent repairers needs to be improved too.
We have therefore put together this Block Exemption Regulation, which the Commission has adopted today, and I would like briefly to outline its main points.
The basic line underpinning the regulation is that the new system must be more stringent than the existing regulations and must allow greater competition on the sales and after-sales markets.
What are the main characteristics?
Firstly, as regards the sale of new vehicles, flexibility and freedom to choose are the draft' s key points.
When they select their distributors, vehicle manufacturers can choose between a selective distribution system and a distribution based on territorial exclusivity, but they can no longer combine the two systems.
Both systems allow a vehicle manufacturer to guarantee that the members of its distribution network are qualified and that its distribution network covers all the areas of Europe, thus ensuring total coverage of the territory.
In both cases, the rights linked to the single market will be much, much better safeguarded than at present.
In an exclusive distribution system, distributors will be assigned to a specific geographical area such as a city, within which no other distributor will be permitted to open a showroom or carry out sales activities.
An exclusive dealership may, however, sell to any potential buyer that approaches its showroom.
This also applies to independent resellers, to those known as grey resellers.
These resellers could be supermarkets, for example, and they would exploit the price differentials to buy vehicles in countries where the prices are lower and then sell them in Member States where prices are higher, thus helping to create a genuine single market.
If, on the other hand, manufacturers opt for selective distribution, the distributors can advertise and send out customised mail shots and e-mails to consumers throughout Europe, even visiting them in person.
Consumers could, however, still encounter difficulties in dealing with a dealership from another Member State, particularly as regards simple, direct contact with the foreign dealership, payment of invoices and agreements regarding the delivery of the vehicle.
We therefore deemed it necessary to adopt a more radical approach in order to bring about greater integration of the markets, making it genuinely possible for consumers to buy vehicles abroad.
A vehicle distributor must be able to open sales or delivery outlets closer to consumers' places of residence, including in other Member States.
On a practical level, this means, for example, that an Amsterdam Volkswagen dealer could open a showroom in the United Kingdom and sell Volkswagen Golfs there at the Dutch retail price, which is 23% lower than the British price.
This, of course, would create the necessary market conditions for reducing the currently considerable price differentials of motor vehicles in the European Union.
Then consumers are demanding multi-brand dealerships.
The draft regulation makes multi-brand selling much more simple.
The only permissible constraint is that the different brand models are displayed in different areas of a showroom so as to avoid confusion between brands.
This display method is already used in car showrooms and has proved universally satisfactory.
Moreover, the draft regulation seeks to reorganise the existing relationship between sales and after-sales services, allowing specialisation.
Distributors will be able to opt to provide after-sales services themselves, as dealerships currently do, or they will be able to subcontract to one or more authorised repairers.
These repairers must observe all the quality requirements set by the vehicle manufacturers.
In addition, block exemption makes intermediaries' work much easier: one example is that of Virgin Cars, which buys vehicles on behalf of consumers and will now be able to find the best deal for consumers more easily.
All these factors give distributors more room for manoeuvre to organise their activities on the basis of market conditions, exploiting new sales opportunities and thus consolidating their independence from manufacturers.
Another way to reduce dealers' dependence on manufacturers is by laying down the obligation for manufacturers to give sufficient grounds for deciding to cancel distribution contracts.
If the distributor does not agree with the grounds given, it can have recourse to a mediator or a court.
Moreover, the Commission has decreed, through this draft regulation, that a reasonable period of notice must be given before the cancellation of a contract, in most cases two years.
All these measures ensure that distributors can make full use of the new opportunities offered to them by this draft regulation.
I would now like to say a few words on after-sales services, which are also extremely important.
The new draft regulation seeks to ensure that consumers have a genuine choice and that they can have recourse to both authorised repairers and independent operators.
In the interests of the safety and reliability of all vehicles - we have placed great emphasis on this objective - we have to ensure that all operators can compete with each other in all sectors without this affecting the quality of the service provided, which must continue to be of the highest level.
The new regulation allows all vehicle manufacturers to set quality requirements which must be respected by all repairers who wish to be authorised repairers.
Manufacturers can therefore guarantee that the members of their network comply with high quality standards.
This avoids foreclosure of these markets as new operators could now be designated authorised repairers, provided, of course, that they are prepared to observe the requirements set by the vehicle manufacturers.
The proposal also lays down the benefit for dealerships whose contract has come to an end of being able to continue to operate as official dealerships of their brand for as long as they satisfy the quality requirements.
The general level of technical skill on the market is thus increased and a substantial Europe-wide network of official repairers is maintained. This will help to bring higher quality of service and greater road safety.
Moreover, we can expect the proposal to have a positive impact on employment and small and medium-sized businesses.
The proposal seeks to make it easier for independent operators on the after-sales market to compete.
In view of the increasing complexity of motor vehicles, it is important for independent repairers to have better access to all the necessary technical information, including diagnosis devices, equipment and training.
Any discrimination between official repairers which are part of the network and independent repairers is therefore unacceptable.
The proposed changes also encourage the use of spare parts which are cheaper but of equivalent quality, making repair work less costly.
I would like to end, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by focusing on the procedure.
The next stage in the procedure is consultation with the European Parliament and the Member States and the publication of the draft regulation in the Official Journal.
This will allow the Commission to receive comments from all the interested parties before adopting the final regulation.
The whole process should be concluded before next summer.
I am especially looking forward to giving a more detailed presentation of the draft regulation to the Parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 19 February and to continuing the fruitful dialogue already underway between the Commission and Members of Parliament, particularly Mr Konrad, who is your rapporteur for the subject, and the Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
Mr President, we have addressed a complex subject: a subject which is also extremely important, practical in nature and has wider significance.
If we want the European citizens genuinely to identify with European integration, we cannot afford to let such a key element of the single market as that in motor vehicles to continue not to be a single market, for it would be unfair to the consumer.
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to you first of all, Mr Monti, for setting this proposal before Parliament.
We very much welcome the fact that this proposal's first outing has brought you to Strasbourg, and this is much appreciated.
As became clear during discussions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I welcome many points of this proposal, including those on the sale of more than one make of car, original spare parts, access to technical information, and liberalisation as regards the separation of service and sales, but I have a query about how freedom of establishment within the internal market is to be regulated.
We in Germany have a regulation entitled the Group Exemption Regulation, which states that a regulatory framework should continue to exist, subject to a time limit.
That is something I welcome.
The content, though, amounts to liberalisation if all it says is that individual dealers may be restricted at national level but entitled to set up as many subsidiaries as they like within the EU internal market.
This modifies these rules and makes a nonsense of them.
It will create problems for us and we must discuss this.
Such is my first important question in this context.
Mr President, there is much to be welcomed in the Commissioner's statement, in particular its acknowledgement of the role of the grey market in bringing prices down, the use of the Internet, car supermarkets in the proper trade in spare parts and servicing.
There is one question I have to ask.
It looks as if in different national markets exclusivity can be maintained in a position which could be anti-competitive.
How wide, in a given national market, could these exclusive deals with the dealer networks remain?
Mr President, I should also like to thank Mr Monti for coming to Parliament today and making a very clear statement on a very complex issue.
It would have been very helpful if we could have had the text in advance, but I understand and hope it will be available very quickly.
I should like to raise two points with him.
What concerns British consumers - and much of it is addressed in his proposal - is clearly the question of price.
Does the Commissioner see a role for putting price bans and price guarantees in the regulation so it is reviewed after a certain period to ensure that prices are converging?
That would give a clear signal about the direction he wants to go.
The second issue concerns freedom of dealers and their ability to invest.
He has moved substantially in the right direction but I am concerned, in the example he gave, about the ability of a dealer to Holland to go and invest and set up a dealership in the UK.
How is that going to protect dealers who already have a substantial investment?
Would it not be much better for them to be able to go and buy cars in Holland and sell them to consumers there, rather than have what could be a random solution which would actually dissipate the impact of the dealers' independence that he wants to give them?
I hope there will be further occasions, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for example, to go more into the detail.
What seems to me links the first two speeches is a concern that indeed would be there if a location clause could exist.
One distinctive feature of today's Commission decision on the draft regulation is that the location clause is not there at any percentage level.
This should go a long way towards alleviating those concerns.
As regards making sure that prices converge, this is one of the objectives of the overall proposal.
As you know, we keep regular track of the convergence or non-convergence of prices.
We produce a report twice a year on the price of different models in the different Member States.
That will be a powerful means of gauging the consequences, among other things, of this new regulation.
We have resisted the temptation to become price regulators and to link specific competition arrangements for distribution to the size of the price differentials.
It is not for us to say that this price differential is acceptable, but that this plus one is not.
We are working on the roots of the phenomena, so that price convergence should develop.
As for the Anglo-Dutch example, my answer briefly is that both modalities would be allowed, namely the setting up of dealers' outlets in the other countries and unrestricted trade without changing the location of the dealers.
Mr President, on a point of order: before you ask the first speaker to make a contribution, I indicated that I wished to be added to the list.
Mr President, I have a short question for the Commissioner.
I was the rapporteur seven and a half years ago when we first discussed this project.
I am pleased to see that the Commission has moved so far, but I still have a question.
Maybe I am too cynical and too liberal, but why do we need to have rules?
Why cannot we just use the Treaty as it is?
Why do we need to have special rules for car dealers and for car sales?
So far as I am concerned we could use the normal competition rules.
Mr President, I support Commissioner Monti's initiative and I am pleased that his Commission colleagues are also supporting him.
Certainly the current rules benefit car manufacturers and dealers and disadvantage consumers.
I see this particular proposal as upholding the principles of the single market, and I am convinced that it will lead to cheaper cars for EU citizens.
I have one major concern and that concerns my own country.
Is the Commissioner aware that the vehicle registration tax in Ireland will add anything between 50% and 100% to the price of cars?
So an initiative like this will be virtually meaningless unless the Commission is able to persuade the Irish authorities to reduce the vehicle registration tax.
I know tax is a national competence, but we are moving towards harmonisation of tax and I would therefore humbly request that the Commissioner approach the Irish authorities to seek a reduction in the vehicle registration tax, so that Irish citizens can enjoy the same benefit as their continental counterparts.
I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on steering this package, which was not entirely unanimous, through the Commission so skilfully.
The same problems exist in the UK: 52 models examined in the UK are still more expensive.
My question is the same as Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen's.
If we have the partial reforms that the Commissioner is proposing here today, and we carry those out in opening up the market to grey trade supermarkets, in particular Internet sales, is it not the case that the block exemption becomes obsolete, and when will the day be when we actually get rid of these rules?
Finally, Commissioner, in 1999 I asked you a question in response to which you told me that cars in Britain would be cheaper if Britain joined the euro.
Is that still your position, and what difference do you think that would make in terms of price differentials?
I realise, not without relief, that I am not the Commissioner responsible either for taxation or for monetary union, but merely the Commissioner for humble competition policy which, nevertheless, has a role to play and tries to play it vigorously - with the support of Parliament, which is apparent once again today.
On competition proper, why not be even more liberal and refrain from applying sector-specific rules?
Well, we have looked into this and a detailed analysis has brought us to the following conclusion.
If we did not have specific rules for this industry competition-wise, the industry would fall under the application of the block-exemption regulation on vertical restrictions.
That would have two main drawbacks.
It would allow the industry to use very similar distribution agreements to those permitted at present, on which our evaluation report was pretty negative.
Also applying the general regime would not be a satisfactory means of improving competition on the after-sales market.
Independent repairers could be foreclosed from the market as a result.
This is clearly something which could not be accepted.
Furthermore, all motor vehicles would most likely continue to be distributed through the same type of selective and exclusive distribution systems if no new regulatory regime was introduced.
Last, but not least, the general regime does not offer provisions which are crucial in the car sector to ensure benefits for the consumer.
This is the case with the so-called availability clause, which allows, for instance, a British consumer to buy a right-hand-drive car in a left-hand-drive country.
So, although we are in principle against sector-specific rules, as you have seen with the telecom package with my colleague, Mr Liikanen, we have moved some way towards the adoption of general competition rules.
But here the particular nature of the situation has led us to firmly believe that a sector-specific rule would be more appropriate.
As for supermarkets, for example, I can only say that, during the lengthy consultation process undertaken by the Commission, no supermarket or association speaking on its behalf directly expressed a desire to sell cars on a regular basis.
On the other hand, it would not be true to suggest that the draft regulation adopted today gives no business opportunities to supermarkets.
A supermarket could become a mono- or multi-brand sales dealer if it satisfied the criteria laid down by the manufacturer.
Similarly, it may act as an intermediary for consumers.
Finally, on the two issues which do not relate to competition but have a bearing on prices, tax and the euro, I will not go beyond the answer I gave on the issue of the UK, cars and the euro.
As for taxation, the honourable Member underlined that this is a national responsibility and it is tempting, but perhaps not entirely consistent, to argue that this is to be jealously guarded as a national prerogative and yet ask the Commissioner to lobby actively for harmonisation.
I will, however, pass this message on to my colleague, Mr Bolkestein.
Mr President, Commissioner, everyone knows today that cars are complex and highly sophisticated products.
If you now allow dealers to subcontract maintenance and repairs, an entire continuous chain of responsibility will be broken.
This should cause us to be concerned for the consumer.
How, in your opinion, Commissioner, will car manufacturers be able to honour their guarantees, ensure compliance with quality standards and, if necessary, recall vehicles if they now have only an indirect link with subcontractors?
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the debate does not concern either the Commission' s final objectives or its principles in relation to this proposal, but rather the possible unwanted consequences which may result from the application of the future regulation of the sector.
Therefore, given the removal of the localisation clause, I would ask you, Commissioner, whether you think there should be a transitional period for small distribution companies, bearing in mind the investments made or under way in this sector, which have a great influence on the level of employment.
Commissioner, I congratulate you on the presentation of this document which is the last of the raft of rules relating to vertical restrictions.
I would like to make some comments.
You have given the example of the distributor in Amsterdam who could open a branch in London.
Let us bear in mind that distributors are dependent - as always, but even more in this case, given the quantity of the investments to be made - on manufacturers, and that contracts do not extend for very long periods.
It is true that, in the event of a resolution, they could go to tribunals, but I believe that, in the majority of EU countries - at least, Commissioner, in yours and in mine - the indefinite extension of cases would lead to the bankruptcy of distributors.
Therefore, given that selective distribution is allowed, I would ask you whether, in order to achieve equality of prices between the different countries, it would not be more sensible, for example, to restrict this prohibition of the selective vendor selling exclusively to the final consumer or to other members of the network.
That would favour parallel importers who would contribute to lowering prices.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for the clear account, and I am of the opinion that what is being proposed can optimise and improve the internal market principles.
To that extent, I am in support of the proposals.
The Anglo-Dutch example which the Commissioner quoted is related, inter alia, to the additional taxes which are being levied in each Member State.
I know that taxes fall within the national competences, but I believe that the Commission is entitled to intervene if competition and internal market regulation are hindered.
You state that you yourself are not responsible for taxation, but it is always the Commission that does the talking.
If I therefore address the Commissioner, I assume that, formally, I am addressing the Commission and not specifically the Commissioner.
I thus assume that you can take this message with you, as my Irish fellow MEP pointed out.
In addition, I should like to ask why it is not possible to take a registered car from another Member State to the country where you live.
In this way, far better use could, in fact, be made of the internal market.
Commissioner, you have already heard many Members who believe that the approximation of prices must also be achieved by means of fiscal harmonisation, possibly more than by means of this regulation.
The current regulation affects 100% of the distribution contracts.
Nevertheless, you are establishing very tough limitation clauses in relation to the definition of a retailer.
Do you not believe, Commissioner, that this new regulation could create legal uncertainty amongst dealers, which may also endanger the continuity of the investments they are making and, also, to a certain degree, the employment of these dealers throughout the European Union, who number more than one million people?
Are you not rather afraid that, with this policy of opening up competition, the large-scale distributors may benefit to the detriment of the small dealerships?
I will be brief.
I want to welcome the announcement by the Commissioner.
We will have to wait and see how it actually works in practice.
The companies we are dealing with here are quite powerful.
Does the Commissioner have an understanding with Member States that they will not top up their vehicle taxation as a means of recovering income lost as a result of lower prices, thereby wiping out the economic benefit to consumers?
In addition, would it be possible to make displaying or advertising pre-tax prices along with post-tax prices obligatory?
Generally we have post-tax prices advertised.
Finally, what impact, if any, would this have on guaranteeing on a Europe-wide basis the car which may be bought in another state?
Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy considers it an important question as to what effects this will have on technical legislation, specifically with regard to on-board-diagnostics or the various interfaces.
How, too, are we to ensure actual adherence to working standards and norms?
Is it envisaged that there will be some sort of third-party certification, with neutral third parties checking that the standards have actually been kept to?
In this area some action concerning taxation is important.
The Commission has a role to play in this.
I would remind you that the Commission's position for the Nice IGC was that there should be a shift to qualified-majority voting in those areas of taxation which are crucial for the functioning of the single market.
I would not expect Member States to top up with higher taxes.
They would face constraints in doing so.
Will the new system bring about legal uncertainty for dealers?
I believe not - on the contrary.
We are also confident of avoiding the sometimes-feared economic consequences for dealers and employment.
The draft regulation offers former dealers the opportunity to become official repayers within the manufacturers' network and to locate where they wish.
At any rate we already know that, this draft regulation aside, several manufacturers are planning to restructure and reduce the number of official network dealers in their systems.
As to the European warranty, it remains in the proposal.
Networks have to provide warranty, irrespective of where a car is bought.
Thank you very much for your dedication and brevity, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Question No 39 by (H-0030/02):
Subject: Nuclear safety: Bulgaria's failure to comply with EU partnership agreement and agreements to decommission reactors at Kozloduy With regard to the decommissioning of units 1 and 2 of the nuclear plant at Kozloduy by the end of 2002, Mr Kovachev, the Bulgarian Energy Minister said on 8 January 2002 that his country will not be honouring its commitments to close down and dismantle the dangerous, old-style reactors, as provided by the revised partnership agreement between the European Union (EU) and Bulgaria, and the Sofia Memorandum, which Bulgaria signed with the Commission in 1999.
How will the Commission ensure that the commitments contained in the partnership agreement to decommission units 3 and 4 will be honoured, and what stage has been reached in the decommissioning of units 1 and 2, given that all four units are unsafe and cannot be upgraded at reasonable cost?
Can Bulgaria ask for the opening of negotiations on the energy chapter under the pre-accession process when it refuses to honour its commitments to the EU on nuclear safety and has not drawn up a new energy strategy to bring it into line with free market rules (production and pricing) and the opening of the market to competition?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is unable to confirm the information according to which the Bulgarian government has announced its intention not to abide by the agreements entered into in respect of the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear power station, nor can we attribute such a statement to the Bulgarian Energy Minister, Mr Kovatchiev.
Differing opinions have in fact been expressed in political circles in Bulgaria during the current public debate on the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station - specifically of its units 1 to 4.
Information available to the Commission indicates that, in a statement on 10 January 2002 on the early decommissioning of the four reactor blocks at Kozloduy, the Bulgarian Energy Minister mentioned 2008 or 2010 as possible dates for the closure of Blocks 3 and 4.
The Bulgarian Energy Minister's statement did not refer to Blocks 1 and 2.
The situation is that, in the agreement I reached with the Bulgarian government in 1999, we agreed on the decommissioning of Blocks 1 and 2 by 2002, that is this year, and that we would have discussions with the Bulgarian government on the decommissioning of Blocks 3 and 4 in connection with the revision of that country's energy strategy and that a decision on this would be reached before the date originally envisaged.
The Commission made it clear that it understood this to mean that 3 and 4 would be decommissioned by 2006 at the latest.
I must, though, say quite clearly that Bulgaria has not yet come to a formal decision on this matter.
This means that we cannot, of course, complete the energy chapter of negotiations with Bulgaria as long as we do not have a definite decommissioning date set down for Blocks 3 and 4.
The agreement I reached with the Bulgarian government at that time constitutes part of the European Union's common negotiating position in the energy chapter with regard to Kozloduy.
It is clear, therefore, that this chapter cannot be completed without compliance with the content of this agreement.
The matter is clear to that extent, and, on the Commission's behalf, I now repeat that the decommissioning of Blocks 1 to 4 of the nuclear power station at Kozloduy in accordance with the agreement entered into is an absolutely indispensable requirement for the conclusion of accession negotiations with the Republic of Bulgaria.
Work has begun on the decommissioning of Blocks 1 and 2 and the right administrative and technical conditions are in place.
As an international fund stands ready to finance these operations, I am working on the assumption that everything will go according to plan.
I do not share the concern expressed by some that the decommissioning of reactor Blocks 1 to 4 will result in major economic difficulties, particularly as regards competitiveness.
The Commission has calculated that Bulgaria has considerable over-capacity in energy production, and, as a new nuclear power station of modern design is being built, any loss to Bulgaria will be compensated for, and any problems are, in our view, perfectly capable of being surmounted.
To sum up, we have not the least indication that Bulgaria will pull out of the commitment it has made.
I would also like to expressly underline that the Bulgarian Prime Minister, at my most recent meeting with him, quite expressly confirmed to me that his government stands by the undertaking given by its predecessor.
Commissioner, thank you for your reply confirming that reactors 1 and 2 will be shut down this year, in 2002, that work has in fact already started, and that reactors 3 and 4 will be shut down by 2006 at the latest, as originally agreed, as the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has assured me in writing and as you have stressed repeatedly.
I should like to ask you to keep up the pressure here because there will always be uncertainty about the security of supply.
I should like to know exactly what the Commission has done about the single, interconnected operating system which could be used to exchange energy so that we do not have countries wondering what will happen now that reactors 1 to 4 at Kozloduy are to be shut down and whether or not they will be short of energy?
My second question concerns the loan granted to Bulgaria to bring reactors 5 and 6 up to Western safety standards.
What has been done about reactors 5 and 6?
In order to avoid misunderstandings, I have to again tell you, Mr Trakatellis, in the clearest terms that there is as yet no binding promise by the Bulgarian government that Blocks 3 and 4 will be decommissioned by 2006; there is, rather, an agreement that the decision on decommissioning these blocks will be taken earlier than the Bulgarian government originally planned.
The Commission stated in this communiquÃ© that it understands that closure will take place by no later than 2006.
Formal notification by the Bulgarian government is still required, but it is certain that that is on its way.
Moreover, Mr Trakatellis, I have to tell you that energy provision in Bulgaria is a matter for the Bulgarian government.
Nor is the issue of energy efficiency in the Balkans and Bulgaria's position in the energy market a matter within the immediate remit of the Commission.
I can only reiterate our estimation that the decommissioning of Blocks 1 to 4 will not result in an energy shortage in Bulgaria, where there is, on the contrary, substantial overcapacity.
I entirely agree with you that it is a matter of absolute necessity to inform the Bulgarian public in precise terms of the need for decommissioning and the measures that are to accompany this, as in fact - as you are no doubt well aware - the people of Bulgaria do not, as a whole, understand this requirement by the international community.
We always behave as if these things were self-evident, and so I am grateful to you for addressing this point.
The overwhelming majority of Bulgaria's population does not see it as at all self-evident that the country's largest and most important power station should be decommissioned under pressure from the international community.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would be interested to know to which technical norms and standards the Commission actually refers when deciding which blocks are dangerous and have to be closed down.
Mr RÃŒbig, the Commission did nothing of the sort, and indeed it cannot.
This was a political condition for the opening of negotiations with Bulgaria, one that was laid upon us by the Member States.
This political condition was formulated by the Member States in consequence of an assessment carried out by the industrialised States as early as the beginning of the 1990s, in the course of which the safety of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe was subjected to examination.
This determined which of the nuclear power stations were seen by the Western industrialised States as incapable of being retrofitted at reasonable cost.
I am, at the moment, unaware of what standards the States applied at the time.
If you are interested, though, I would be happy to initiate the relevant research on your behalf.
The Commission did not set any enquiries in motion, but performed its political function of achieving a result with the Bulgarian government as regards compliance with a political condition for the beginning of negotiations.
I congratulate you, Commissioner, on always being allowed to make statements on such scintillating subjects, first Temelin and now Kozloduy.
You must be a very happy man.
May I ask how much a decommissioning of this sort costs?
What happens to the contaminated materials?
Who pays for it all?
How long does such decommissioning take?
What actually happens if there is some sort of mishap before 2006?
Who pays then?
Who bears the costs?
Following on from your answer to Mr RÃŒbig's question, do you not also believe that we are yet again seeing how urgently necessary it is that we should have common European standards rather than always arriving at decommissioning dates by a process of rough estimation?
Blocks 3 and 4 in 2006 - that is what we have said now.
Should we perhaps not make that 2004 or 2003?
What happens then if something goes wrong in 2005?
Madam, much as I regret it, the Commission bears no responsibility for the safety standards at nuclear power stations anywhere in the world, not even in Bulgaria.
Even if I were able to answer your technical question, I would not be permitted to.
Responsibility for the operation of the Kozloduy nuclear power station, for any safety problems connected with it and also for any accidents that might occur, is borne exclusively by the operator, that is, in this instance, the Republic of Bulgaria.
I must also make it clear that the Commission is not in a position to take on any responsibility as we are not in a position either to have any influence on how this nuclear power station is operated.
I have no personal view on how safe or dangerous this nuclear power station is.
I am quite happy to give you detailed information on the technical processes involved as soon as such information is available to me.
We have to work on the assumption that the time required to complete a project like the decommissioning of a nuclear power station, is to be reckoned in decades rather than years.
That means that we are dealing here with a very long-term operation, which may, under certain circumstances, also involve long-term commitments or burdens on the Community budget.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.

Part II Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
Question No 41 by (H-0054/02):
Subject: Improving the regulatory environment for SMEs The internal market is an ideal environment in which European undertakings can conduct business.
However, some important obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services continue to hamper their operations.
Given the need highlighted at the Lisbon Summit and in the European Charter for Small Enterprises for an improvement in the regulatory environment, further action in this regard is required.
What steps is the Commission taking to that end?
Mr President, the internal market has been of huge benefit to companies, but still more can be done.
Progress in this area is being watched within the framework of the Commission' s Internal Market Strategy for Services, approved in November 1999.
The Commission examines the Internal Market Strategy each year to evaluate the results achieved and suggest improvements.
The evaluation was last carried out in April.
One of the aims is to improve the operational environment for companies and special attention is paid to helping small enterprises in much of the action that is taken in association with this aim.
The Commission also monitors developments in the business climate for small enterprises with reference to the yearly report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises. The report for 2002 will be coming out in the next few days and will assess the action to help small businesses that the Member States and the Commission have said they are taking.
The Conference of European Ministers responsible for SME policies to be held on 23 February in Aranjuez, in Spain, will be reporting on the conclusions of the report for 2002, and they will be submitted to the European Council when it convenes in Barcelona.
At this stage I might say that there has been progress.
Progress has been made, for example, in such areas as access to finance and the exchange of good practice.
In addition, in December, an SME envoy was appointed whose task it will be to step up exchanges with small and medium-sized enterprises and their representative bodies.
He will work in the Enterprise Directorate-General and his job will be to act as liaison officer on issues such as opportunities for SMEs to acquire funding and exploit innovation as well as matters to do with competitiveness, better regulation, implementation of the internal market process, participation in EU programmes and how best to enhance consultation procedures.
Last year the Commission launched an initiative called 'Helping SMEs to go digital' .
The aim is to make SMEs aware of the opportunities offered by information networks.
Six events have been planned for this year in different Member States and there is to be a large-scale conference in Brussels.
The Commission' s work to improve regulation is also making headway.
There have been a number of proposals to improve the situation, both in a White Paper on Governance in the European Union and in the Laeken communication on improving and simplifying the regulatory environment.
The proposals relate to the whole lifecycle of Community acts.
Under discussion are, for example, the need for more effective consultation with interest groups and civil society, an evaluation of Community action and costs, and a simplification of current laws.
By no later than June the Commission will have put forward a proposal for a straightforward action plan to simplify and improve the regulatory environment, after the Community' s institutions and other interest groups have been heard.
The Enterprise Directorate-General will be actively involved in drawing up this plan and drawing on the experience gained from the business impact assessment system and the test project connected with it.
The conclusions drawn, as a result of this project, will be ready this month.
Commissioner, you have given me such a complete answer that I have few remaining doubts to ask you about.
Nevertheless, I would like to insist that the measures he says are going to be adopted, above all in relation to the simplification of the regulations, be genuinely implemented and applied as quickly as possible.
Great declarations, great words and great policies are all very well for existing undertakings, but it is essential that those who - inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit which we are so keen to promote - decide to create a new undertaking, are not faced with obstacles and difficulties which prevent them from going ahead.
Furthermore, and in order that this policy may be truly effective, information on actions implemented by the Commission must reach the smaller entrepreneurs, a sector which very much needs it.
Mr President, I agree with the honourable Member that words are words and only actions are important.
When our report appears this week on the SME Charter it will present a picture of what has been done in Member States.
It is very important for the Commission that we are able to present this year a thorough impact analysis of all new legislative proposals and that we know what the genuine costs to companies are, and that we always consider what the most simple solution might be.
I am prepared to go back over this matter with the honourable Member in minute detail.
But I agree: deeds are what is most important, whereas words are only good for a very short while.
I would like to pick up on the Commissioner's last reply and I am delighted that he is talking about thorough impact assessment.
I would like to put it to him that at the moment impact assessments that we receive attached to Commission proposals in many cases are not thoroughly done, they are not looking at the full implications, they are not necessarily independent.
Would he agree with me that it is vital to have an interinstitutional arrangement for independent impact assessment so that when proposals come through this House and colleagues add burdens on business they are properly costed?
Also, when the Council adds provisions to Commission proposals in common position, they should be properly costed too?
Would he not share my view that this is the sort of bold proposal we want to see?
I have to say that the proposals we have seen so far from the Commission on regulatory assessment are far too timid.
I share Mr Harbour's view that there is a lot to improve in the impact assessment.
For that reason, when I took office I launched a project to create more solid methodologies for business impact assessment.
The results of this work are ready now in February.
Alongside this, the Commission proposed at the GÃ¶teborg Summit the need for sustainable impact assessments, which means impact assessments that include economic, social and environmental factors.
This work is now proceeding inside the Commission and is led by the Secretary-General.
I fully agree that we must have predictable accepted methodologies so that anybody can assess how we have come to these conclusions.
The Commission is ready to open the debate on these issues and to appear before the respective committees, for instance, to discuss what we have learned in our business impact assessments.
The Commission appreciates the importance of both business and sustainable impact assessments and the need to achieve them quickly.
Secondly, of course it does not mean that measures will not be taken if costs are incurred but we should at least try to assess the costs honestly and then an informed decision can be taken.
Mr Crowley arrived immediately before I gave him the floor.
If you wish to ask your question, the Commissioner will reply.
Question No 40 by Brian Crowley (H-0025/02):
Subject: Improving the business environment in 2002 and creating an inclusive eSociety
Will the Commission outline its proposals for 2002 aimed at improving the business environment, including for small and very small businesses, and will it indicate its time-scale for bringing forward the promised new initiatives aimed at consolidating the move towards an inclusive 'eSociety' ?
The European Commission will publish within a week the annual report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises.
Through the annual report we monitor progress on the environment for small businesses.
The 2002 report evaluates actions reported by the Member States and the Commission in favour of small businesses.
The conclusions of the report will be presented to the Conference of European Ministers responsible for SME policies on 23 February and submitted to the European Council.
As I have already said, the report shows signs of increasing political commitment and major progress has been made in the field of access to finance.
Progress has also been made in exchanges of good practice such as cutting red tape in company creation.
As regards the efforts of SMEs to adapt their business practices to the global knowledge-based economy, the Commission launched last year the GoDigital initiative for SMEs as part of the eEurope Action Plan.
In some countries this report has received a very positive welcome.
We are organising campaigns throughout the European countries at the moment.
Before the end of 2002 a portal to provide SMEs with legal information, guidance and advice will be set up.
The Commission has also just today adopted a Communication on eEurope Benchmarking, where you can follow how SMEs are being connected and how broadly they use eCommerce.
This Commission communication highlights new challenges in relation to Internet usage: broadband is needed to stimulate new services; schools are connected but the Internet is not yet sufficiently part of the pedagogical process; governments online have to move towards full electronic transactions.
The indicators include amongst others Internet penetration in business and the percentage of companies selling online.
While good progress has been made, the take-up of eCommerce is not as fast as expected.
This confirms the relevance of actions such as GoDigital, but also indicates the urgent need to identify obstacles to eCommerce amongst especially small companies as well as consumers. eEurope should be continued beyond 2002 and shift its focus towards effective usage and availability of the Internet for all citizens and businesses.
The communication on the impact of the e-Economy on European enterprises contains proposals to deepen cooperation between all relevant stakeholders to develop a policy agenda for maximising the benefits of the e-Economy for European enterprises, taking into account the needs of SMEs.
The Industry Council endorsed this proposal in December 2001 and invited the Commission and the Member States to intensify the debate on the e-Economy.
The Spanish Presidency has decided to launch a policy debate with Member States to agree future priorities for the promotion of the e-Economy in Europe and to address this topic at the Industry Council meeting in early June.
To this end it will be necessary to identify policy changes at national and European level to adapt to the needs of the e-Economy.
These activities will be developed in close cooperation with the reflections and the preparatory work relating to the future of the eEurope Action Plan.
Mr President, Commissioner, this electronic Europe project met with enormous difficulties when spectrum auctions started to be held.
It resulted in bankruptcies, which are still continuing, and unemployment.
What do you intend to do to prevent this from happening in the future, with certain Member States collecting charges against the general intentions of the e-Europe project - at the same time leading the sector into a wild downward spiral - and others not?
Mr President, last December - thanks to the European Parliament' s swift action - new legislation was passed on all electronic communication.
For the first time it also contains a legal basis for spectra.
It allows for the creation of what are now new bodies: a committee, to discuss long-term questions, and a working party, to consider the current administration.
Now that we have a common legal basis and joint bodies, it will be possible to discuss common aims beforehand and coordinate action.
This is obviously no guarantee that everyone in the end will choose the same approach, but I hope that we can at least agree together policies in an open and transparent way and that before the first State starts dividing up the spectra the rules will be known to all.
The market will be able to act more wisely when it is known at least how things are moving in different regions of Europe.
I believe that the sort of bedlam we experienced last time will not repeat itself, but it cannot always be guaranteed that common sense will prevail at all times.
Question No 43 by (H-0042/02):
Subject: eEurope 2002 initiative The Spanish Presidency, in its published work programme, notes that the 'eEurope 2002 initiative will have to be relaunched with new objectives'.
Can the Commission explain why a strategy launched only two years ago is now in need of a 'relaunch', indicate the reasons for the failure of the original strategy and outline the objectives that the new strategy seeks to achieve?
I should first of all like to thank Mr Harbour for keeping e-Europe high on the European agenda.
When we look back at the year 2000 we can see that the e-Europe action plan really rewrote the European political agenda.
The idea was to set clear targets for the EU and Member States, clear deadlines and follow it up.
Has this idea worked?
I think it has.
To give you a few examples: the telecoms package and unbundling the local loop.
We would never have been able to imagine these rapid procedures without high priority being given to information society.
Internet penetration has increased.
It was 18% in March 2000 and 38% in December 2001 - more than double.
Nearly 90% of schools are now connected to the Internet.
Today 90% of European enterprises have Internet access.
We now have the fastest research network in the world.
The start of progress in getting government on-line is well under way.
A comprehensive overview is now available.
It was accepted today in the Commission.
I am happy to pass it on to Members of Parliament.
What are the new challenges?
First of all, Internet penetration has risen sharply but is still very unevenly distributed across Europe.
Schools are massively connected but still the number of pupils per on-line PC varies enormously.
We must have more PCs at school per student.
Even though businesses are more and more connected the reorganisation of business procedures is only starting.
Business consumer e-commerce is still rather small.
Governments have started enthusiastically to go on-line.
Normally there is a question about presenting activities on their website.
Real interactivity is still rare.
All the interactivities give better services to citizens and increase the productivity of the public sector.
The Commission has not come to the end of its actions because technology moves quickly.
Broadband Internet is now a real option.
Broadband is the essential physical infrastructure of the knowledge society.
Without broadband we will not deliver fully Lisbon.
Other nations have already made their choices for broadband.
The Commission's report to the Barcelona Summit said: "Broadband Internet access will be a key factor for improving the performance of the economy.
Broadband networks will form the backbone of an increasingly interconnected and integrated society.
E-Europe should be continued beyond 2002 and shift its focus more towards effective usage and availability of the Internet."
The Commission is particularly happy that the Spanish Presidency shares this analysis and has put the launch of e-Europe 2005 action plan on its agenda.
The first discussion on a possible new action plan will take place at the informal telecoms council in Vitoria in Spain on 22 and 23 February 2002.
The Commission is ready to go into pro-dialogue also with the relevant committees in the European Parliament.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for a wide-ranging reply and I note that two of the central achievements are those which Parliament has pushed through very strongly.
However, my concern is not the work that he has done - for which I commend him very much - but rather, for example, the delays and problems that Member States are experiencing in transposing the electronic commerce directive, passed by this House with great speed.
Similarly, I see that as regards copyright in the Information Society - another fundamental plank in the legislation that he does not mention - discussion is continuing on ideas for new levies on computer disks and other issues that will fundamentally hold back the development of the e-society.
Does he share my considerable concern that Member States do not appear to be taking anything like seriously enough the fundamental principles that he has enunciated and would he give us some indication that he will give positive vent to them at the forthcoming meetings?
Will the Commission publish evaluation reports on both of these issues so that we in this House can put some political pressure on Member States to get on with it?
The two directives on electronic commerce and copyright are extremely important.
It is the Commission's duty to ensure that Member States transpose them into their law.
They are both within the remit of my colleague, Mr Bolkestein, but we are cooperating here and I am ready to contact him after Question Time.
On the matter of copyright, the Commission is organising a workshop in the next few weeks on digital rights management technologies.
When content is sold on line it is very important to guarantee a system where the copyright holder can receive proper royalties for his production.
New technologies like digital rights management are helpful there.
My personal wish is that this technology could result in more targeted methods to get proper revenue for copyright holders so that Member States would not need to go for these very broad untargeted solutions such as copyright levy.
Finally, on the follow-up of the Member States, there is often a problem that progress is piecemeal and there is not sufficiently strong coordination in Member States to guarantee that progress will take place in all areas.
That will be one of the issues we will raise at the next informal Council and we will pass this challenge to European Council in Barcelona.
Mr President, Commissioner, what does the Commission intend to do about the threat that the digital divide will increase, because it affects people who are also financially badly off?
Secondly, the usage rate of Internet connections amongst us in Europe is low.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
Thirdly, the development of content here in Europe is also slow.
It is nevertheless the key to greater action in the spirit of e-Europe.
How do you intend to tackle this?
All these issues are extremely important.
I have just a few remarks.
Schools are well placed to bridge the digital divide.
Through them we can guarantee education for all.
In Europe comprehensive school systems still work.
We can guarantee skills for everybody.
When the Internet comes to homes via children we can avoid the divide from the start.
But we must also look to the older age groups.
Here, the combined efforts of the public sector in training, public access points which can be run by local communities, post offices and the private sector provide extremely important backup.
Here I hope all Member States will take active measures.
As regards usage, we are now discussing flat rates in general.
In America, higher usage is often explained by the fact that there are more flat-rate offers on the market, not only for broadband but also for narrow bands.
We have not reached a final conclusion on this, but this question is being raised now, as we have seen a tail-off in demand for broadband in the form of ADSL and cable.
Should that be a solution?
I will reply to that after we have done some more internal work.
As for content, if the Internet is not in your own mother tongue it will be not the Internet for all.
The Commission is now implementing its programme, eContent, which concentrates on multilingual and multicultural platforms in the content area.
It brings together different operators from different Member States.
There has been huge interest and it is doing fine.
The Information Society Technologies Programme is shifting attention towards applications.
In the future the user will be at the centre.
We have often put technology at the centre, but we must now put the user at the centre instead.
Users are not looking for technology, but rather for content, services and applications.
For that reason the attention of research is moving in that direction.
The Commission supports these efforts.
Mr President, the UMTS licences were auctioned for very large sums.
What effect will that have on digital television licences?
I believe that new jobs have been created precisely by these initiatives, which also involve very substantial investments.
What view do you take of the development of risk capital in this field?
To be honest, Mr RÃŒbig, last year was not an easy one for the risk capital market.
The venture capital market developed very rapidly in 2000, then we saw the difficulties and it went down.
At EU level, the European Investment Funds invested in venture capital funds in various Member States.
These investments were well-timed because of the lack of venture financing.
We have also been using Community budget funds, with part of the multiannual programme credits transferred into the investment funds.
Through these efforts the public sector has been playing its role.
At the same time it is very important to complete the legislation on a genuine internal market for financial services and risk capital.
In this regard we hope that the solutions resulting from the Lamfalussy report will be very useful.
Today on the Internet I saw some good news: some new venture rounds for wireless applications have been completed.
Perhaps the worst is over, but the market is still very tight compared to the situation in the past.
So all such measures, an active financial market and public support measures, if there is market failure, will be needed.
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
Question No 44 by (H-0951/01):
Subject: Commission recommendations on Greek employment policy The Commission's recommendations to Greece concerning the implementation of employment policies have remained almost unchanged since 1998.
Greece is criticised for low employment rates, high youth and female unemployment, and the Commission's recommendations continue along the same lines for 2002 (COM(2001)0512/final).
In addition, the Greek Minister for Labour recently stated that Greece cannot attain the Lisbon and Stockholm employment targets.
Can the Commission say whether the Lisbon and Stockholm targets are binding on the Member States, and whether the targets Greece has set for funding from the 2nd Community Support Framework for measures to combat unemployment have been met and, if not, why not?
Mr Alavanos's question concerns the Lisbon targets and whether or not Greece will be able to attain them.
First, the target of full employment set in Lisbon was a political commitment by leaders of the Member States, not a binding legal commitment.
Except that the political commitment was also highly significant and all the national action plans for employment have been drawn up and submitted on the basis of that commitment.
In Greece, the second Community Support Framework applied over the last five years was completed in December 2001, so it is difficult to make an overall evaluation of it.
Naturally, the job market was reformed and training and proactive employment policy structures and mechanisms were created during the course of the second Community Support Framework.
The problem lies with the employment services which Greece started to reform at the end of the second Community Support Framework.
As far as the third Community Support Framework is concerned, Greece is one of the few Member States which has set quantitative national targets under its national action plan, having announced a target of 61.5% for 2005.
The third Community Support Framework includes a hefty 2.9 trillion drachmas to fund pro-active employment policies and reforms.
The implementation of the third Community Support Framework is a huge challenge if Greece is to introduce the mechanisms needed for employment policy, such as an individualised approach, because the Greek national employment agencies need to be completely overhauled and training mechanisms need to work more efficiently and be geared to regional development objectives.
The Commission is working closely with all the Member States and, as you know, it repeats the guidelines every year so that the Member States can take account of European agreements on the application of employment policies.
Commissioner, I know you are a supporter of English as our official language, so I shall put my question in English.
By chance, I have before me Eurostat's statistics on the economy labour market.
Total unemployment in the European Union in 1990 was 7.7%; in 2000 it was 8.4%.
In 1990 unemployment in Greece stood at 6.3%, less than in the Community.
In 2000 it was 11.1%, the second highest rate after Spain.
In Ireland, unemployment in 1990 was 13.1%; in 2000 it was 4.4%.
Ireland and Greece are both cohesion countries.
How do you explain that, and what critical view would you take of the Greek Government's actions during the second Community support framework?
First, may I thank you for your support.
I knew that a progressive person of your experience would agree that English - and our mastering it in Greece - are very important.
As far as the statistics which you quoted are concerned, we need to analyse the structure of unemployment in Greece.
The rate of employment for men is exactly the same as the European average, but there is a huge difference in the rate of employment for women, which is 40% in Greece, compared with a Community average of 56%.
Similarly, there is a very serious youth unemployment problem.
Here too, in comparison with other countries, unemployment is very high among the young in Greece, 29%, mainly because the various types of part-time employment found in numerous countries, including the country you referred to, are counted as full-time jobs.
According to the Commission's recommendations, what the Greek government needs to do is to focus more on policies for women and young people and on policies for older workers, because here again very few older workers are actually in employment.
These are the three main employment policy problems and, according to the national action plan which it has submitted, this is where the Greek government has focused its efforts.
Of course, the Commission will continue to make recommendations where policies have not progressed as the Greek government promised, as it did in September this year and will again next September.
Question No 45 by (H-0008/02):
Subject: Employment in Greece According to the Recommendation for a Council Recommendation on the Implementation of Member States' Employment Policies (COM(2001)0512/final), Greece continues to have one of the lowest employment rates in the European Union, and unemployment in Greece has stabilised at 11%, which is considerably above the EU average.
These data show that the labour market suffers from structural problems, a finding borne out by the Commission Communication on structural indicators.
According to this Communication, Greek indicators concerning entrepreneurial expenditure on R&D, access to the internet, lifelong learning and public spending on education are the lowest of all the Member States.
Will the Commission say whether, following the Council Recommendation and the Commission Communication, Greece has taken any specific additional measures or initiatives concerning the above sectors with a view to promoting employability and improving its position?
I should like to start, Mr President, with the tables of indicators announced by the Commission in its most recent communication, which will be sent to Barcelona.
It is true, as the honourable Member says in his question, that Greece's indicators on matters such as entrepreneurial expenditure on research and development, access to the Internet, lifelong learning and public spending on education are lower than those of other Member States.
However, I should like to point out that the Commission's philosophy behind these annual indicators is not just to compare the situation between Member States which do not always have the same points of reference; it is to look at the progress made by Member States from one year to the next.
If we take the indicator for Internet access, Greece has progressed from 4.5% last year to 11% this year.
These are the main objectives for the operational programmes for 2000 to 2006.
In other words, there are operational programmes for education, vocational training, lifelong learning, the information society and the dissemination of the information society in both the public administration and the business sector.
This is one of the major challenges of the Greek government's national action plan and the Community Support Framework.
Of course, we must not forget that these programmes have substantial Community funds, but that alone is not enough.
Very substantial national funds are needed, together with efficient, urgent policies, especially for the information society, if these indicators are to improve significantly by next year.
Thank you, Commissioner, you are of course quite right.
What counts is the progress made from one year to the next and that is precisely why I should like to ask you if any indicators apart from the Internet, which you referred to, have improved?
And secondly, as regards the third Community Support Framework, which makes provision for all the major budget items which you mentioned, has Greece actually started spending any money?
We are already more or less at the end of the second year.
Thirdly, I should like to ask a question which I have been asking repeatedly for several years now, Commissioner, because I have been unable to obtain a reply.
Has anyone ever - not last year or the year before, because that would be impossible - but let us say five years ago; has anyone ever actually counted how many jobs have been created over a period of time from funds budgeted for job creation, just to give us a snapshot of exactly how efficient it is.
I referred to this specific indicator because it shows such a huge difference, with growth in the order of 150%.
Spending on education and research and technology has risen, while other indicators have remained stable and have not changed.
In reply to your questions on the third Community Support Framework, the first prepayments have been signed, accounting, if I am not mistaken, for approximately 10%, and as for counting jobs for the second Community Support Framework, I do not think we could supply actual figures, because they would probably be fictitious, by which I mean that there are the direct jobs created under the Greek programmes, the stages, and the indirect jobs created by training and the impact of local development funds, either in the public sector or in the private sector following training.
These jobs are not counted because the national employment agencies are unable to quantify the results of training but they are some of the important statistics which are required by the third Community Support Framework if we are to be able to monitor progress.
Question No 46 by (H-0035/02):
Subject: Undeclared work in Greece In 1998, the Commission published a communication aimed at launching a dialogue among the Member States with a view to combating undeclared work which, according to data at the time, accounted for some 15% of the Union's GDP, while in Greece and Italy the figure exceeded 20% of GDP.
Recent investigations by the Greek authorities, together with other available data, reveal that 10.5% of businesses are not registered with the Social Security Institution and that the percentage of non-registered workers fluctuates between 21% and 30%, resulting in a loss of billions of euro from the public purse and, in particular, the social insurance funds.
What commitments did the Member States make as a result of the dialogue launched in 1998?
What progress has been made?
What are Greece's commitments and what recommendations have been made to that country?
What measures will the Commission take to combat undeclared work, in the context of the qualitative employment policy and the open coordination method, to ensure that pension schemes remain viable?
Mr President, may I assure the honourable Member that the European Commission shares her concerns about the impact of undeclared work, the impact of losses on the public purse, the impact on the job market and the impact on the pension system.
The guidelines issued by the Commission in 2001 for 2002 call on the Member States to take measures to combat undeclared work and to encourage registration using a variety of means, such as regulatory measures, incentives, reforms of the tax system, allowances, collaboration with the social partners and special plans for relations between the social partners, between employers and employees.
Greece's response does, I think, bode well for the future.
By which I mean that the Greek authorities have introduced a series of measures dealing mainly with work inspectors, controls carried out by inspectors and the auditing agencies of the various insurance funds have been tightened up and, according to our information, a further 120 work inspectors are to be deployed.
The commitments made by the Greek government in its national action plan also include a series of other measures dealing with allowances, that is, incentives to register low-paid workers, the results of which will not transpire until a later date, once they have been applied.
On 26 February, the Commission is due to present the study started following the 1998 communication to which you refer. Experts from all the Member States will attend this conference and the presentation of the study to discuss efficient practices for dealing with undeclared work which have brought in significant results in certain countries.
As far as the impact on pension schemes is concerned, I should point out that one of the parameters for combating the problem of the viability of pension funds is to increase employment.
Not to increase employment generally any old how, but to increase employment which pays statutory tax and insurance contributions.
This is the only way of boosting the funds and helping them to stabilise their finances.
The open method of coordination established between the Member States does not, I repeat, involve any legal commitment vis-Ã -vis the Member States.
Political commitments have been made and the Member States are due to submit pension reform plans, together with their economic and social implications, in September 2002.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
I do not share your optimism about progress because, as we can see in Greece and Italy - and I refer here to Greece in particular because it is my own country - there has been no progress.
Twenty-five percent of unregistered workers alone are foreigners, in which case there is hardly any justification for the mass influx of unskilled foreign workers into Greece.
Do you really believe, with this situation, that the ambitious targets set by the European Commission can be achieved, or should you be calling for means over and above political commitment, the means which countries need to have if they are to make progress?
Because undeclared work impacts not just on pension schemes, it also impacts on free competition and, of course, protection for workers, because we are hardly talking high-powered jobs here.
I ask you in all honesty, do you feel that the means which you have at your disposal right now are sufficient to stamp out this phenomenon and its many and varied implications?
I must stress, Mr President, that the Commission is not a superstate and it cannot judge policies which are purely national policies and for which each Member State takes the specific measures which it feels it needs to take.
What takes place at European level on this particular issue is collaboration between the Member States, through the guidelines, in which undeclared work is a priority and, naturally, steps have also been taken in countries such as Italy which have serious problems.
Steps have been taken within an institutional framework to increase incentives to register workers and integrate immigrants.
My evaluation of the measures taken by the Greek government, which is why I was cautious, is that its reaction bodes well in that it has introduced a series of institutional measures which are now under way, such as integrating immigrants and paying companies incentives for low-paid workers and, once they have been implemented, these institutional reforms should bring in positive results.
As you know, the measures taken by government are evaluated every year and the guidelines contain the Commission's input.
As you know, Commissioner, where there is undeclared work there are usually undeclared businesses.
So I think we should be discussing not how many people have not been registered with social security agencies but how many businesses have not been registered at all, either with the Ministry of Trade or the police.
Nowhere.
There are sectors in Greece in which this is the rule rather than the exception.
And their economic raison d'Ãªtre is that no one knows about them.
Of course, the Commission does not interfere in internal affairs in the Member States and rightly so.
But I do still wonder if companies in general can get away without registering from the point of view of Community legislation?
Is there nothing the Commission can do about this during the course of its duties?
As you said, this is a matter in which it is very difficult for the European Commission to intervene.
The registration of companies, which is the top priority for a country as far as its tax system, that is, its revenue is concerned, and as far as its social security system, that is, pensions are concerned, is obviously a priority for the Member States and I do not think that any recommendations are needed along these lines.
I can only hope, from the information at our disposal, that the computerisation of the Social Security Institution, the law on regional companies and certain reforms along these lines will bring in results.
Question No 47 by (H-0015/02):
Subject: Transfer of unemployment entitlements Under the provisions of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, employees who are nationals of EU Member States may acquire unemployment benefit entitlements in any Member State.
Immigrant workers, from non-Community countries, who wish to receive unemployment benefits in an EU Member State other than their country of residence are not entitled to do so under the terms of the Regulation, which does not allow them to transfer their entitlements.
How can you justify the fact that employees from non-EEC countries are not entitled to unemployment benefits if they change their country of residence despite having paid contributions like other employees?
Why are they not allowed to make use of forms E301 and E303 to transfer unemployment entitlements?
Regulation 1408/71 and Regulation 574/72 protect the social security rights of workers by coordinating the different national social security systems of Member States.
There are two main rights that workers have through these regulations.
Firstly they have the right to unemployment benefit; secondly, to look for employment in another Member State and to continue to receive unemployment benefit for a maximum period of three months.
However, this regulation applies to workers who are Community nationals.
In 1997 the Commission presented a proposal to the Council to extend the scope of this regulation to workers who are third-country nationals.
The same extension had been included in the larger frame of the Commission proposal of 1998 to modernise and simplify Regulation 1408/71.
There were many discussions over many years.
There was a very complicated discussion in the Council of Ministers.
There were many disagreements between the Member States.
The main obstacles to progress in this regard had been the lack of agreement on the legal base.
It is not a legalistic or technical problem, it is a political one.
But the difference in the legal base concerned first the Commission's proposal, which was based on the implementation of Articles 42 and 308, and certain Member States which considered that the basis of this proposal could be Article 63.
The political difference is that under the last article there are some Member States that have the right to opt out of the regulation.
Under the Belgian Presidency the Council of 3 December 2001 unanimously agreed that the basis which must be used is Article 63.
So the Commission will very shortly present a new proposal to extend Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals using this new basis of Article 63.
As far as the substance is concerned, I must highlight the Commission's agreement with your concept.
I should just like to make one comment: it is the employers, the bosses, who are forcing these workers to move into other national territories.
Workers are good for paying taxes, they are good for having profit sweated out of them, but there is no need for them to understand their minimum rights.
This is totally unacceptable.
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 48, 49 and 50, by Mr Fitzsimons, Mr Korakas and Mrs Thors respectively, will be replied to in writing.
Questions to Commissioner Patten
Question No 52 by (H-0960/01):
Subject: Reconstruction of Afghanistan and improving the subhuman situation of women What specific action or programmes is the Commission preparing in order to improve the situation of women in Afghanistan? How will it ensure that women actually receive the aid and benefits intended for them?
The Commission is very much aware of the need to improve the situation of women in post-Taliban Afghanistan.
Our initial EUR 57 m commitment to reconstruction in Afghanistan includes specific provision for this.
The Commission services are currently finalising contracts with NGOs and UN aid agencies to implement 18 projects worth EUR 25 m and programmes to support internally displaced Afghan people and refugees.
Gender is a cross-cutting issue in all projects funded from the Aid to Uprooted People budget.
In 2001 more than 50% of the projects directed at health, education and refugee care had specific and significant gender components.
The Commission is currently assessing project proposals for the 2002 budget for uprooted people.
The amount envisaged is EUR 24 m.
In the new political situation in Afghanistan the Commission is planning to open an office in Kabul in February or March this year.
This office will further enhance the Commission's ability to oversee the performance and delivery of its aid to Afghanistan.
ECHO reopened its office at the beginning of last month.
Regarding the humanitarian aid provided by ECHO, women are involved in various types of projects; all medical and nutritional projects funded by ECHO aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age, as well as to monitor the health status of women, in particular lactating and pregnant women.
NGOs generally organise elementary hygiene education for women.
NGOs have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medically related programmes.
Medical NGOs play a great role in the training of women.
Commissioner, I would like to ask a supplementary question which focuses on two aspects.
Firstly, will women manage some of this economic aid?
Secondly, since there are specific risks for women - just today a girl of seven has been sold into marriage by her family in order to deal with hunger and meet their needs - I would like to know whether the Commission intends to create specific funds to prevent this type of violation of women' s rights.
Given the situation I have described, which will no doubt be repeated tomorrow and the next day, I would like a concrete reply from the Commission.
It is also very important to know whether women will manage these funds.
The fact that there are many armed men very much hinders progress in the improvement of the situation of women.
The simple answer to the very important first question that the honourable Member asked is an unequivocal yes.
Not least do we hope that women will be centrally involved in a great deal of our development activity, but there are women in the interim administration.
I hope there will be in the transitional administration.
Women played a crucial role, let us not forget, in the success of the Bonn talks in December and we will be doing what we can to support the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs which will, I hope, be a good example of women managing programmes to help develop society and to help protect the role of women in a society which has abused them for far too long.
The honourable Member asked a question about the specific security of women and young girls.
In the light of recent well-publicised events, I wholly understand that.
I hope that the overall improvement in the security situation and the increasing grip of the interim authority with our support will help to prevent things like that happening.
But after the ferocious talibanisation of Afghan society over the last few years, and given the position of the country where warlordism is still rife, it is going to be some time before we can promote the sort of strong gender policies we would like to see.
However, we will do all that we can.
I am greatly encouraged by what the honourable Member has said.
Question No 54 by (H-0965/01):
Subject: Reform of the Stability Pact In light of the joint statement made by Patten and Solana on the reform of the Stability Pact, what is the Commission doing to ensure that the programme becomes more effective in the delivery of its services and in streamlining its personnel?
The High Representative and I wrote to ministers in November setting out proposals for the future work of the Stability Pact.
Our main aim was to take the opportunity, two and a half years into the work of the pact, and with the arrival of a new special coordinator, to build on its achievements by enhancing the complementarity between the work of the Stability Pact and the EU stabilisation and association process, by focusing the pact's activities as tightly as possible and by putting a particular emphasis on encouraging regional cooperation.
The General Affairs Council approved the recommendations in our letter on 19 November and asked the new Special Coordinator, Dr Buseck, who took up the reins on 1 January, to assess the current activities and working methods of the pact and to identify five or six objectives to be achieved by the end of this year.
The Council asked him to report back to its meeting on 11 March.
The Commission is now working closely with the Special Coordinator in the preparation of this report.
Detailed consultations are taking place within the informal consultative committee which was established following the High Representative's and my own recommendations in order to improve coordination between the pact and the stabilisation and association process.
Two meetings have already taken place: on 11 and 31 January.
In conclusion, work is well in hand.
The Stability Pact and the Commission are working very closely together to deliver the improvements the honourable Member refers to.
I have every confidence that the report which Dr Buseck gives to the Council on 11 March will set out a number of practical proposals to that end.
I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I am slightly perturbed that it seems to be taking so long to get this matter addressed.
As we have just heard, it is not going to be until 11 March that we get further developments.
I should like to ask the Commissioner, first, what measures are going to be recommended which will increase ownership by local people on the ground in the Stability Pact.
It has been seen as remote and, unless we have proper ownership, quite frankly it will continue to be remote.
Secondly, one of the areas of concern has been the quality of implementation in the Stability Pact.
Is he happy that we are moving in the right direction in terms of implementation?
Thirdly, there is a view that there was a chronic lack of information on the ground about the Stability Pact.
Is a strategy being put in place to deal with that?
As regards the first point, Dr Buseck is well aware of the problem to which the honourable Member referred.
The proposals he brings forward on 11 March will reflect that awareness of his.
The honourable Member will know that he is extremely experienced in dealing with the problems of the region and in particular in mobilising private sector support.
I am looking forward very keenly to working with him.
He will do an excellent job and he will want to engage with others who are working alongside him in an enthusiastic and transparent way.
On implementation, it is fair to say that overall we have established an impressive record as far as the Commission is concerned in implementing what we have promised to do in the western Balkans and in south-east Europe as a whole.
What we have been able to achieve in Serbia, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and in other countries, is impressive.
I hope that we will be able to ensure that where there have been any bottlenecks affecting infrastructure projects with the Stability Pact - and sometimes those bottlenecks are the result of problems in the beneficiary countries - we will be able to resolve them.
Dr Buseck and I are trying to focus on those problem projects and get them moving as rapidly as possible.
As for information about what is happening on the ground, that is an issue which Dr Buseck is well aware of.
We will help him to address it, trying to ensure that the publicity for the achievements of the Stability Pact goes to the pact, rather than to individuals.
It is a pleasure to work with Dr Buseck.
I think he will do outstandingly well and he can certainly count on our understanding and support and, I am sure, the understanding and support of Parliament, in the efforts he makes in the future.
Question No 55 by (H-0002/02):
Subject: Aid to Asia and Latin America Given the European Parliament's amendment to the 2002 budget that 35 per cent of EU external assistance is allocated to social infrastructure, mainly basic education and health; and given Commissioner Patten's letter to the President of the Committee on Development and Cooperation of December 2001, that 'the Commission is willing to implement the budget on this basis. . . understand(ing) that the Parliament's focus is on the overall picture for EC assistance rather than the global performance of all donors'; what precise measures will the Commission take to operationalise this decision in relation to the regional budget lines providing aid to Asia and to Latin America?
Can the Commission reply with respect to communication with its delegations, the mechanism for agreement of Country Strategy Papers, the operation of its Quality Support Group, dialogue with partners, as well as in any other respects?
In the context of the 2002 budget, the Commission has supported a benchmark that 35% of spending in Development Assistance Committee Group 1 countries, including macroeconomic assistance with social sector conditionality, is allocated to social infrastructure, mainly education and health.
This recognises that the Community contribution must be seen as part of the overall donor support in a given country and that a degree of flexibility must be the norm.
The Commission is committed to work towards meeting this benchmark in assistance to the social sectors in all its programmes, including Asia and Latin America.
With a view to honouring this commitment, a number of initiatives will be undertaken.
In particular, these will include, first, improved emphasis on the social sector in all Commission programmes, in line with the priorities in the Community's development strategy.
Second, the establishment during 2002 - and I know this is a point on which the honourable Member has himself laid great emphasis - of a solid statistical basis allowing DAC sectoral classification of programmes and projects from 2002.
A reclassification exercise of all 2001 commitments will be undertaken with a view to enabling comparison to be made.
Third, we want to make available to Parliament all approved country strategy papers, including multiannual programmes and associated financial envelopes.
Finally, the continuation during 2002 of work on the definition of internationally agreed performance indicators and implementation of sector-wide programmes in the social sector.
The Commission is in contact, as the honourable Member knows, with Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the organisation of a seminar in the spring of this year, where the Commission will report on progress made in these areas and, I hope, continue to gain from the experience and enthusiasm and commitment of the members of the Development Committee, including, of course, the honourable Member.
The last time I debated with Mr Patten on this subject in committee he accused me of having an overdose of testosterone.
I am glad he has not repeated that tonight.
Stamina is what we need in dealing with this issue.
He is right in saying that there are a number of areas of agreement between the Commission and Parliament, not least in the DAC reporting where progress is such that we very much welcome it.
We welcome too their cooperation in relation to the seminar.
I am concerned that the emphasis in his answer was on definitions, about reporting, about statistics - i.e. analysis - rather than the tougher decisions that are equally required to shift resources.
It is important that we do not simply talk about the process in terms of information being available - important as that is, and agreed as we are on that issue - but that the Commissioner actually tells us, as those country strategy papers are passed, as the Quality Support Group evaluates new programmes, as delegations (and he did not answer the point about the role of delegations in this) take their decisions, as new staff are recruited, how will he ensure that real resources are allocated in greater number to basic health and basic education?
We need to see some shift of resources during the course of this year.
Give us some hope that it will happen.
First of all I am not against testosterone in trying to achieve some progress in this area.
We need to show a great deal of energy and commitment.
Secondly, as far as the role of delegations is concerned, as the honourable Member knows, I place particular emphasis, on the deconcentration exercise, which is a particularly ill-starred, euro-gabble way of referring to trying to manage our programmes in the field and as closely as possible to the people whom we want to see benefit from them.
The delegations will play a key role in drawing up the country strategy papers, which will have to reflect the priorities of our development philosophy and development strategy.
The honourable Member asks us to give him hope that we will be seeing a real shift.
The purpose of providing a better statistical basis for analysing and planning what we are doing is to demonstrate that we are making an effort to achieve the objectives which the honourable Member and I have in common and which are also the objectives of my distinguished colleague, Commissioner Nielsen.
So there would be no point for example in the CRIS exercise in which we are engaged if we were not intending it to have an impact on policy.
I think the honourable Member accepts that one is looking for steady trends, rather than being too nailed down to specific figures in specific years in specific countries.
One wants to see a shift of emphasis and a clear indication that the Commission's programmes are as associated as other peoples' with the objectives of poverty alleviation.
I will make one additional point, which I attempted to make yesterday morning in the parliament of the country I know best.
There is still a tendency when people look at what we are doing to compare apples with oranges.
It is very often the case that other countries or Member States appear to have a far higher proportion of development assistance committed to poverty alleviation than we do because they look at what we are doing in the Balkans, in Russia, in the NIS, in parts of the Mediterranean, and compare it as though it was exactly the same as our more straightforward development assistance programmes.
Because we are carrying the burden in those areas, admittedly with Member States' money, they are not having to do as much there as they would presumably have to do for political reasons, and therefore the figures sometimes flatter them at our expense.
That is part of the price we pay for having an external actions budget which has development assistance at its core but has other priorities as well.
Could the Commissioner tell me if what he said adds up to a guarantee that there will be a better balance between commitments and payments in Asia and Latin America and that we will have better utilisation of the funds voted for in the budget?
I could also - if I was not as cautious a man as I am - point to progress already in increasing the percentage of payments in relation to commitments.
The figure last year in the Mediterranean was 56% to 57%, much higher than any figure we have achieved before but lower than I want to see.
If you look at the achievements of Europe Aid - all of whose staff I addressed yesterday - they are starting to be able to demonstrate an improvement in relation to commitments.
They have demonstrated a considerable success in reducing dormant commitments and sleeping commitments so that the reste Ã  liquider has fallen quite substantially.
So we are making progress.
It will take some time before we achieve the sort of figures that all of us want to see, but we are headed in the right direction.
I very much hope that before I make my swan-song in this packed Hemicycle I will be able to point to even greater achievements by the excellent staff in Europe Aid.
We are going to put the last question to the Commissioner.
Question No 56 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0007/02):
Subject: International Criminal Court
For several years now the establishment of the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity has been a priority of EU foreign policy.
Only recently, the EU, through the Belgian Presidency, reaffirmed its commitment to working to secure, as rapidly as possible, the 60 ratifications required for the Criminal Court to be brought into operation.
To date, 48 countries have already ratified the Rome Statute, including all the EU Member States apart from Portugal (which has, however, already completed the relevant domestic procedures), Greece and Ireland.
Three candidate countries - Poland, Hungary and Slovenia - have already ratified the Statute and Estonia has announced that it will shortly deposit its instruments of ratification.
Given the fundamental importance which the EU attaches to the speedy introduction of this first stage of an international justice system and in view of the tragic events which have occurred around the world over the last few months and years, would the Commission not agree that the ratification of the Rome Statute should be explicitly established as forming part of the 'acquis communautaire' and as a new 'Copenhagen criterion' to be met by any future candidate for accession to the EU?
Does the Commission agree that ratification should serve as a precondition for the signing and ratification of any association or cooperation agreement between the Union and third countries?
First of all I would like to apologise to the honourable Member for not being present earlier to hear his, I am sure, eloquent - though I am not sure, supportive - speech in the excellent debate on the Middle East.
He knows that was not meant as a discourtesy, it was for democratic reasons upstairs.
I am sure we will be able to lock horns about some of those extremely important issues on other occasions.
As for his question, the European Union attaches a great deal of importance to the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.
The adoption of the common position of 11 June 2001, which aims to promote early ratification of the Statute and the swift establishment of the ICC, and the ratification of the Statute by 13 Member States underline our commitment to this objective.
Ratification preparations by the remaining two Member States are at an advanced stage.
The European Union's commitment to this issue is also reflected in the level of Community funding given to NGOs working for ratification.
Since 1995, this has reached almost EUR 7m under the European initiative for democratisation and human rights.
With respect to the enlargement process, the European Union position on support to the ICC is part of the common foreign and security policy acquis, which candidates are asked to subscribe to.
In addition, in line with the common position, the European Union regularly raises the question of ratification in the framework of political dialogues with accession countries.
Moreover, the Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta aligned themselves with the EU declaration at the Sixth Committee of the UN General Assembly in November 2001, which sought to encourage a swift start to the ICC.
In January 2002, they also declared that they shared the objectives of the EU common position on the International Criminal Court and undertook to ensure that their national policies conform to that common position.
The Council of Europe has also called on all its members to ratify or adhere to the ICC's Statute as soon as possible.
Mr President, I too have no desire to go into the ins and outs of the matter, which was on this afternoon' s agenda.
I simply wish to say to Commissioner Patten that I knew he had informed us that he would miss some of the debate.
I am, therefore, very sorry, as I said a short while ago in plenary, that he was not able to join us.
Having said that, politically, we are at odds on the matter, but I believe we will have the opportunity to discuss this again later.
With regard to his answer to this specific question, I am quite satisfied with the Commission' s position.
I would say that making this issue, as Commissioner Patten said, part of the acquis communautaire is a crucial point and this will certainly help the candidate countries to speed up their ratification procedures.
I certainly do not want to detract from the acquis which the Member concerned and I have discovered together, but I would only add my wish that some of our other partners in international affairs were also committed to establishing the international criminal court.
It continues to be an issue that we raise with our transatlantic friends with considerable vigour.
We did so with the last administration and we are doing so with this one.
It is not a question of the administration having changed its policy.
I would have thought that recent events - including those related to Afghanistan - would have bolstered the case for an international criminal court.
Maybe it will take a little longer for that message to get home.
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 57 to 83 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
VAT - Direct and indirect taxation
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is a widespread problem in the European Union, which is unfortunately becoming more common all the time.
According to reliable estimates, during the first half of 1998, for example, Member States detected 250 cases of so-called Carousel fraud, worth more than 500 million euros in all.
To this must of course be added other types of fraud, and all the fraudulent transactions that remained undetected.
We can therefore estimate that VAT fraud costs the EU and its Member States hundreds of millions of euros every year.
Generally it is a matter of Carousel Fraud.
Carousel Fraud means the acquisition of goods without paying the VAT as required under the rules of the internal market.
It is characterised by a chain of invoices, with or without goods, extending across one or more borders.
The essential feature of this type of fraud is that one or more links in the chain do not pay invoiced VAT to the tax authority, while other parties in the chain receive VAT refunds based on these very invoices.
Carousel Fraud generally concerns small items of value, such as computers and mobile phones.
The most effective way of preventing this type of fraud is through close, administrative cooperation between the Member States.
It is generally known, however, that the current legal framework is not up to the task.
In order to streamline the current legislative framework, the Commission has now put forward a proposal for a regulation that would considerably enhance and improve current forms of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT.
I also support the Commission' s proposal for a directive, in addition to which I propose measures in my report to make direct cooperation between the authorities still more effective and practical.
The main point of the proposal is to allow for direct contact between local and regional authorities responsible for the fight against fraud.
At present, all communication must go through central liaison offices, meaning that all requests pass through one country' s administrative machinery from a local office to a national liaison office and down the same path in the other country.
This means that requests for assistance often arrive too late at their proper destination.
The tax evaders may well have disappeared by the time the local officials in the country that received the request for help look into the matter.
I agree with the Commission that cooperation at local level would improve mutual understanding regarding requests for information, would increase the motivation of tax inspectors, and would avoid wasting the few resources that exist.
I therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission proposal, which should be seen as a major step forward in the fight against fraud.
All too often, criminals can take immediate advantage of the most up-to-date and advanced means of communication, while the authorities are weighed down by bureaucratic, cumbersome rules, which slows down the work involved in tracking down the criminals and uses up far too many of the administration' s resources.
The Commission, however, could have gone still further to speed up cooperation and increase flexibility.
I support the Commission' s proposal for sending communications in electronic form wherever possible.
I would also propose that, to speed up the flow of information, electronic communication should be made the rule, and traditional correspondence on paper the exception.
For the same reason, to speed up the exchange of information, that is, more room for manoeuvre should be given to the local authorities with regard to language policy.
The obligation to translate requests for assistance between authorities must be made more flexible.
Why should it be a requirement to translate a request for assistance into the official language of the second country if, for example, a Finn and a Greek come to an understanding that they will deal with one another in French?
There is one point, however, where the Commission proposal goes too far.
The Commission is proposing that the Member States would be under an obligation to restrict many of the rights contained in the Data Protection directive if they thought this necessary in order to safeguard important economic or financial interests.
It should be noted that there is no such obligation contained in the said directive but that it is simply a possibility that Member States can resort to.
This aspect of the matter would therefore be better addressed by an amendment to the Data Protection directive and at this stage it should be left to the Member States to consider whether or not to pursue this line of action.
Finally, something should be said about the legal basis.
The Commission bases its proposal on Article 95 of the Treaty, which means the co-decision procedure for Parliament.
I agree with the Commission' s view that this proposal should concern administrative cooperation only and must be dealt with according to the procedure laid down in Article 95.
The Council has always rejected this view, formerly, and changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94, which only require Parliament to be consulted.
Now, however, the Commission has decided to take the Council to the European Court of Justice over another proposal for a directive concerning the recovery of claims.
The legal situation will thus be cleared up soon.
I would also like to hear comments from the Commissioner in connection with this choice of legal basis and any new information he might have for Parliament regarding how the case regarding the legal basis for the proposal for a directive on the recovery of claims is proceeding in the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Kauppi, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, my colleague Mrs Piia-Noora Kauppi, for this report, which met with very broad support in the competent committee.
That means that there was excellent communication between all the parties involved.
The report constitutes yet further evidence of the competence for which our young colleague has, in a short time, acquired a reputation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as also for the industriousness shown by the quality of her work.
Many thanks for that.
The report is, secondly, evidence of our need, in many instances, for 'more of Europe' .
It is only together that we can combat fraud more efficiently and thus more successfully.
In this connection, we need, on the one hand, better coordination in order to move towards cooperation and exchange of information, and, on the other hand, an improved and more professional legal framework to facilitate this process of information and coordination more readily.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats says 'yes' to improved cooperation by the authorities against VAT fraud, although we of course emphasise that we are not only opposed to VAT fraud but also every form of fraud.
In any case, 250 instances of it were uncovered in the first half of 1998, with losses amounting to over EUR 500 million.
I can do no other than associate myself with the rapporteur in saying that we do not need obligatory translations in cross-border requests for information, but rather more flexibility as regards the data protection directive, deregulation to make things simpler, rationalisation and flexibility to get the work processed more quickly, so that we can get on the fraudsters' trails and so create greater security in Europe.
Madam President, I would like to express my total support for the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi' s suggestion, and, consequently, for the Commission proposal, to which the Kauppi report gives its almost unreserved support.
We Socialists also wholeheartedly support this Commission proposal.
The proposal deals with two very important matters.
The first is the issue of tax fraud in a specific area, that of VAT in intra Community and triangular operations.
The second issue, which is related to the first, as an instrument in combating fraud - is that of cooperation between public authorities to find a solution to, or at least, to reduce, the level of fraud previously mentioned.
Mrs Kauppi gave a perfect explanation of the proposals in her speech and I fully share her sentiments.
Having said this, I would like to make two additional comments with regard to the content of this report.
The first refers to the validity, today, of the 'provisional VAT system' , a system which was implemented in 1993 on the completion of the single market, of a strictly provisional nature, even with an expiry date, that has been spun out and which has not been respected, as you are all well aware.
I would like to draw your attention to this because the reason we are having to discuss this report and the fraud it deals with today is that, to a large extent, we continue to maintain this provisional VAT system - set up by intra Community operations - which places a burden on a series of operations in the country of destination without having those border controls that were maintained by the system in place before the entry into force of the single market.
Clearly, in a definitive VAT system, which is appropriate to the single market, with taxation at source, we would probably not be discussing this issue, because much of this fraud would be prevented at source.
This is the first observation that I would like to make with regard to this report.
My second observation concerns a very important point, which Mrs Kauppi referred to: the legal base chosen by the Commission to present this proposal for a directive.
In my opinion, the Commission' s interpretation of the Treaty has to be applauded, for considering that the base applicable in this case was Article 95, that is to say, for deciding that tax matters can be reduced to matters of substantial, substantive tax law, but not to those of adjective law, to those matters - such as those we are dealing with at the moment - that deal with the management of taxes and the exchange of information between public institutions in the management of taxes.
In these cases, it is not really a matter of fiscal law or tax law itself, in the strict sense of the word, reserved for national parliaments and, as a consequence, for unanimity, but of an issue that can be dealt with, as is happening now, by the codecision procedure.
I would like to conclude, Madam President, with a piece of advice that stems from my last comment; it would be a good idea if, in the next Convention and reform of the Treaty, the field of tax matters could be defined once and for all and that a precise framework for harmonisation can be established.
Naturally, not all tax matters can be harmonised; there are certain areas, such as income tax, that will never be completely harmonised, but there are others - and here I am essentially thinking about the basis for calculating tax on company profits - which should be set up as something that can be harmonised and exempted from the unanimity rule, which would give Parliament the leading role in areas as important as those we are dealing with.
Madam President, the EU is continuing to be taken for a ride by professional fraudsters, a situation which is, regrettably, a beneficiary of the excessively complex VAT system.
It is through our tax regulations, which are in part difficult to understand, that we are laying ourselves open to fraudsters and indirectly promoting tax fraud.
What we need in order to raise the level of taxpayer honesty and increase tax revenue is not only efficient monitoring and effective cooperation by the tax authorities, but also comprehensible and simpler legal texts as a fundamental precondition for this.
The taxpayer very often refuses to pay taxes he regards as unfair.
Incomprehensible tax laws and the tax burdens arising from them are, though, always or automatically seen by the taxpayer as unfair.
We are therefore in urgent need of a reform of the VAT system, which is far too expensive and complex to the point of being incomprehensible even by experts.
It is not acceptable for transactions to be tax-exempt within the business chain between the Member States but taxable at national level.
It is advance deduction of tax within the business chain that facilitates this evasion of tax in the first place and that should therefore be abolished.
By taking this step, we would be cutting the ground from under the fraudsters' feet, simplifying the system and avoiding needless controls, with all their vexations, which are a further burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises.
We should, therefore, be thinking, first of all, not only in terms of how we get the different authorities to work together better, but also about how we can simplify the system that makes fraud possible in the first place.
That would be a step in the right direction, but we will, nonetheless, support Mrs Kauppi's report, as we share her view that it is self-evident that cooperation should be improved and that the effort must be made to make Europe less bureaucratic.
Madam President, I have no doubt that the existing arrangements for cooperation in the area of VAT fraud are inadequate in the context of the evolved single market.
VAT fraud costs the EU and its Member States several hundred million euro each year.
Although measures have been taken over the last few years to come to terms with it, VAT fraud is still a considerable problem today.
I agree that the best way to tackle this ever-increasing fraud is to have close administrative cooperation between Member States.
By allowing direct contacts between local offices, the fight against fraud will become less bureaucratic and more effective.
However, let me sound a note of caution in relation to the efforts inherent in this Commission proposal to base this measure on Article 95 of the Treaty.
Article 95 specifically states that it may not be used for fiscal provisions.
The Commission's view is that this proposal is merely about administrative cooperation and that it does not relate to actual tax collection or tax measures.
With respect, I do not agree - my country does not agree - that by stealth the present position should be eroded.
I do not think that SCAC - the existing administrative committee in the tax area - should have more of these functions assigned to it.
It is the thin end of the wedge.
This proposal relates to fiscal instruments which Member States use and it should certainly be adopted, but it should be adopted with the correct legal basis, which is Article 93, providing for unanimity of voting at Council level.
The regulation that this proposal aims to replace is based upon Article 93, and quite simply this proposal should be also.
Mrs Kauppi has referred to the concerns regarding the legal basis in her attached explanatory memorandum.
In the past where conflicts have arisen in relation to the legal basis, the Council has always rejected the Commission's view and has changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94.
As pointed out by my colleague, it did this most recently on the proposal for a directive on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims.
The Commission has decided to take the Council to the Court of Justice in this matter and Ireland will be joining the action on the side of the Council.
While I welcome the substance of what this proposal aims to do, for the reasons I have outlined in relation to the legal basis, I and my Irish colleagues will be voting against the report.
Madam President, they say that 'noblesse oblige' and I should, therefore, start my speech by congratulating Commissioner Bolkestein, on the skill with which he was able, this morning, to resolve the conflict that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been facing for such a long time, preventing us from progressing towards a single market in financial services.
I would also like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi on her report, which has managed, as has already been said, to achieve the support of most of the political groups in this House.
I would like to make just a few specific observations.
In a recent appearance to prepare for the monetary dialogue with Wim Duisenberg, the President of the European Central Bank, we were given a report which demonstrated that the introduction of the euro will make price differences between the various countries in Europe more evident, as a result, amongst other things, of differences in taxation.
This leads us to call for the harmonisation of VAT and for it to be applied at source, as Mr PÃ©rez Royo suggested, but, until this happens, it is clear that these price differences will encourage fraud.
For this reason, 'more Europe' , or more decentralised cooperation within the European Union, is always welcome.
I was a tax inspector and I know how the obligation to refer to higher public authorities can paralyse an idea.
We need to eliminate formal requirements.
I see no need for a translation: nobody would ask for a translation of information that would permit the arrest of Jack the Ripper and I do not see why things should be different in the field of taxation.
With regard to the legal base, I disagree with the last speaker but I agree with Mr PÃ©rez Royo, given that the difference between substantive law, which characterises the essential elements of the tax system, and formal law, which was set up in order to guarantee that these obligations are met, is well known.
Whereas the rules of substantive law have their base in Article 93 and, therefore, unanimity, those concerning formal law, administrative law and application law have their base in Article 95 because, amongst other things, this allows us to avoid unanimity and also paves the way, as we saw this morning in the field of financial services, for what the Spanish Presidency calls 'more Europe' .
May I begin by saying that it gives me a great deal of pleasure to be able to discuss with Parliament today a proposal for a regulation to strengthen administrative cooperation between Member States in order to enhance VAT control.
I thank Mrs Kauppi very much for her report. It is extremely constructive.
I can only echo what was said by Mr Karas who referred to Mrs Kauppi as his "young and effective colleague".
She is not my colleague but I should like to echo the appreciative words of Mr Karas.
Mrs Kauppi, along with other Members of Parliament, spoke about the legal basis of this proposal.
It is about administrative cooperation.
It is not about changing the VAT regime.
I wish the Commission could do that.
We have wanted to do so for many years but we are not able to do so.
But no, it is about administrative cooperation.
It is not designed to change in any way the obligations of taxpayers or the rules governing the application of that legislation, but rather to gear administrative cooperation to the challenges of the internal market.
That is why the Commission is submitting this proposal under Article 95 of the Treaty.
In taking that article as the legal basis the Commission is consistent with its proposal for Regulation No 218/92 as well as with its proposal to modify the recovery directive.
The Commission is correct in choosing Article 95 as the basis of this proposal.
