Alongside these immediate measures and these policies, I wonder whether it would not be useful if we were to start giving thought to what I shall refer to as supported migration.
I am not talking about quotas, which is an old idea, and one that I am not very keen on for the moment.
I am thinking instead, for example, that funding could be allocated to migration agencies in the migrants' countries of origin. These agencies could provide potential migrants with information and could also work with the Western European countries that offer job opportunities, without for all that encouraging a brain drain, which is another of my concerns.
These agencies could, as it were, play the role of regulator in the two ways mentioned.
There is in fact one thing about which I will not be convinced: it is not by closing the borders, it is not by taking coercive measures, and it is not by repatriating people en masse that we will settle this issue concerning migrants.
We are going to have to live with this phenomenon for many years yet.
Immigration is not a new phenomenon.
There have always been migrations.
We, in Europe, have the impression that we have suddenly unearthed a phenomenon that did not previously exist.
For as long as the Earth has existed, there have been migrations.
I am sorry to have to point that out.
That being said, I understand that this phenomenon is difficult to manage and I understand that measures must be taken, and sometimes taken immediately, but I wonder whether, precisely because we are Europeans and because we uphold European values, we ought not to start giving thought to what I will call a third way, which I feel is more realistic.
These migration agencies could easily provide training so as to enable young people from the countries concerned to become, for example, small business owners, traders and small craftsmen, because what is lacking most in these poor countries is a significant middle class.
It is also lacking in both the economic and political spheres, since there is generally more political stability in countries in which there is a significant middle class.
There you have the small digression that I wanted to make, Madam President.
I believe that it is important to be a little bolder in our thinking.
(ES) Thank you, Commissioner, because it seems to me that you are attaching the appropriate degree of importance to the issue of immigration and I agree with almost all of your comments.
Nevertheless, masses of immigrants are currently arriving illegally, particularly on the shores of Southern Europe, causing not just a social and economic problem but also a political one.
The mass arrival of immigrants at small islands in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic causes a political problem.
I agree with the Commissioner that we cannot 'stimulate' immigration, but perhaps we should look at the phenomenon of immigration as evidence that something is going wrong in terms of development aid.
This would lead to a policy that complements the policies we currently have.
Member of the Commission. (FR) I have already answered that question.
Let us imagine, for example, that we could devote ten times more resources to our development policies.
The fact remains that, if you carry out development projects in developing countries in which, for example, there is no State capacity, not even any State sovereign capacity, that is to say, where the State is incapable of providing equal access to education for all children, access to the authorities, access to the judiciary and access to health care, then your development policy will not be truly effective.
It will not be truly effective until you have States that are capable of providing their citizens with basic services and of organising society along social lines.
That is why the philosophy that I try to propound in the tenth European Development Fund is all about saying that we absolutely must make these States more able to provide.
That is what the debate on governance is all about.
As you know, I recently presented a communication on governance, which was fairly well received by our Member States and which was well received, too, within the context of the meeting of the World Bank, in Singapore, in which we explained what made Europe different.
Major development days on the issue of governance, together with numerous round tables, are due to take place in Brussels tomorrow, on Thursday and on Friday.
The President of the World Bank will take part in these.
Seventeen African Heads of State or Government, countless ministers, experts, Mark Malloch Brown from the UNDP and others will also be present. They will all gather together in order to hold a genuine debate on governance.
How can we make States more able to provide?
The experience that I have acquired in this area leads me to conclude that we will never manage to make a success of development if we do not simultaneously consolidate the States concerned.
What applies to Europe - what has applied to Europe, what has applied to our countries - also applies to these countries.
I believe, in fact, that if everything that is poured into our development policies is poured into failing States, the consequences will only be negative: a great deal of waste, heavy losses and heavy efficiency losses.
I have one final thought with which to conclude.
As regards development, 75% of the resources that we devote to development are not used in order to bolster States' budgets.
Only 25% of our development expenditure is going to help States, and thus to consolidate them or to give them a chance to consolidate.
The remaining 75% goes to parties with an indirect involvement.
Admittedly, these parties are useful and important.
They need to become partners.
However, I find it difficult to hope that developing countries will be endowed with this ability to provide if they are only given a quarter of the development budgets.
I recognise that this issue warrants a far-reaching, open debate, but, as everyone knows, I am in favour of a substantial increase in the quantity of budgetary aid.
Thank you Commissioner.
You have answered part of my supplementary question already.
However, does the Commission not feel that rather than pay illegal immigrants to return home, thus encouraging higher levels of migration, it would be better to alleviate the conditions that forced them to leave their homeland in the first place?
That, of course, would require much higher levels of development spending than we currently enjoy in the EU.
Member of the Commission. (FR) I have already answered that question.
It is very complex.
Indeed, if the idea is to say that a sum of money will be given to all those who want to leave behind their countries so as to make them stay, that amounts to implementing a widespread intervention system targeted at individuals.
That has nothing to do with development.
That is extremely dangerous.
On the other hand, I support your idea - since it is also mine - that huge sums must obviously be invested in development projects that, for example, create jobs or work; I am thinking of labour intensive work, which we are, moreover, funding.
If you take Rwanda, we are funding road building projects, which are directly carried out by the unemployed, by people who have been put to work, who admittedly earn just one and a half dollars a day, but who have a status, who work and who therefore provide for their families.
Yes, I totally agree with you: maximum investment is obviously required for development, but on the conditions that I mentioned.
I believe that to merely pour out resources without having a State that can govern, that can orchestrate all of that, will not amount to very much.
(DE) May I start by remarking that I found the Commissioner's views very refreshing.
To move on to my specific question: migration and asylum policies in the EU create the impression that the majority of Member States have a policy of doing as they please, not doing what they are supposed to, and everyone joining in, even though we already know that a single European migration and asylum policy is probably the only sensible course of action.
For this reason, I should like to ask what efforts the Commission is making towards a single migration policy, and how much longer it will be, in his opinion, before migration policy falls within the powers and responsibilities of the EU.
Member of the Commission. (FR) Madam President, I am going to be extremely brief.
I can only wholeheartedly agree with your remarks.
Every time it makes proposals to unify, to align, the various laws and approaches of our Member States, the Commission - it really must be said - comes up against sharp divisions between our Member States.
I therefore believe that things are moving forward, that progress is being made, but I also see the difficulties that exist when it comes to convincing the Member States to take concrete measures.
Let us take the example of the efforts made by my colleague, Mr Frattini, to encourage the Member States to adopt a far more consistent and unifying policy.
You are therefore absolutely right.
The Commission is doing everything it can, but unfortunately it cannot force the Member States' hand.
Council Question Time
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council that met last June asked the Finnish Presidency to work closely with the Commission to look into ways of improving decision-making and action in the area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of the current Treaties.
The Commission has put forward several proposals for this in its communication 'Implementing the Hague Programme: the way forward'.
The proposals are being considered by the European Council, which is expected to return to them at its meeting in December.
The main proposal by the Commission for improving the decision-making process relates to the use of the passerelle clause under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union.
That would bring police cooperation and criminal justice within the framework of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
The proposal was discussed at the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs this September, although it did not obtain the unanimous support it needed under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union. The Presidency will be giving a report on this to the European Council in December.
I would also ask the honourable Member to note that the Council gave a decision on 22 December 2004 on applying the codecision procedure in certain areas under Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which are measures referred to in Article 62(1), (2)(a), and (3) and Article 63(2)(b) and 3(b), which concern, for example, the lifting of checks at internal borders, checks at external borders, conditions relating to travel, sharing the burden of responsibility in matters to do with refugees, illegal immigration and illegal residence.
(ES) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that you have given me the information you have at the moment.
I simply wished to stress one point. immigration.
At the moment we want to create a great Union market, a great area of freedom, security and justice.
Theoretically there are external borders and then internal borders, but the external borders differ from State to State and, therefore, if decisions cannot be adopted in the Council in this area enabling immigration to be regulated in a uniform manner throughout the European Union, it will be impossible to create a great Union market.
Do you think it will be possible to make progress at the December Council, at least on this point, in order to ensure that decisions relating to European immigration policy are not subject to unanimity, but to majority, in accordance with the 'passarelle clauses' that you have just referred to?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is the Presidency's aim specifically to strengthen the Union's consistent and comprehensive immigration policy, which covers both legal and illegal immigration.
It is also worth pointing out that the second point in Article 67(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community allows the Council, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, to take a decision for the codecision procedure to be applied to legal immigration.
Can the President-in-Office confirm that these are subject matters which, for the United Kingdom and Ireland, are covered by the special protocol annexed to the Treaty, which allows those two countries to opt in or opt out of any measures adopted?
Having regard to that fact, President-in-Office, do you agree that it is quite unreasonable for some people in those countries to object to switching to qualified majority voting on the grounds that national sovereignty would be lost, because, in any case, it is an area that those countries can opt in and opt out of, and it would be quite unreasonable to block such a decision on those grounds?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, representing the Council as I do, I do not want to adopt a position on debates going on within the Member States.
Let me just say that the use of the passerelle requires the unanimous decision of the Member States of the Council, but hitherto no such unanimity has been found.
This matter will continue to be looked into, however, as cooperation on justice and home affairs is just the sort of cooperation where Europeans expect and hope for effective action on the part of the Union.
- (LT) Madam Minister, I have a question concerning migration.
The European Commission has presented its Green Paper on an EU approach to managing economic migration.
We all know that this is primarily economic migration.
The Paper states that entry to a Member State is a question that falls within the competence of the Member State.
Therefore, I would like to determine whether the discussion concerning the transition to qualified majority voting does not violate the subsidiarity principle in this case?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in September the Finnish Presidency proposed some Council draft conclusions on decent work.
The proposal has now been debated by three Council preparatory bodies, where the discussions have been on social issues, questions relating to trade and questions relating to development cooperation, because decent work is a vital factor in all these three areas of policy.
The Council is expected to adopt its conclusions in December.
The Presidency's draft conclusions consider several matters with reference to the Commission communication on decent work, which the honourable Member mentions.
Apart from proposing Council draft conclusions on decent work, the Council, during the Finnish presidential term, has spent a good deal of time and done a lot of work on the proposal for a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, something that has been examined by the European Parliament.
Finland hopes that this will reach a conclusion as soon as possible so that the fund can be used to help employees who are likely to feel the negative impact of globalisation.
At the informal Council meeting of Employment, Social and Health Ministers in Helsinki on 6-8 July, the ministers present discussed how productivity might be improved by developing the quality of working life.
They stressed the importance, for example, of the spiral of growth of decent work and labour productivity.
At the sixth ASEM Summit in Helsinki on 10 and 11 September, the Heads of State or Government acknowledged the need to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation and emphasised that productive employment, decent work, the rights of all employees, social welfare and dialogue in the labour market are decisively important for sustainable socio-economic development.
'Decent work for all' was also the main theme of the high-level segment of the meeting of the UN's Economic and Social Council on 3-5 July 2006.
The Commission is, moreover, organising a conference on decent work in Brussels on 4-5 December.
The Action Programme for Decent Work covers freely chosen productive employment and a respect for rights at work, as well as labour standards, dialogue between the Social Partners, social security and gender equality.
The Programme's scope is an opportunity for the EU's institutions, especially the European Council and the Council, as legislators, to examine, and encourage various bodies to examine, the notion of decent work in its entirety, both inside Europe and also in the context of Europe's trade and development cooperation relations with third countries.
The social dimension of globalisation and decent work are the EU's priority themes in its efforts to achieve consistency in development policy.
When the cash in the European Development Fund is allocated, special attention needs to be paid to several issues, including that of decent work.
Considerations relating to certain challenges posed by globalisation were also on the agenda at the Informal Tripartite Social Summit in Lahti in October.
(EL) Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her reply.
I wanted to also ask if provision has been made for funding the decent work agenda and if there is agreement on such funding in the Council.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, no decisions have yet been taken on this funding, as far as I understand, and obviously Parliament, as an important budgetary authority, can also influence where common funds are channelled.
Since today we are discussing the challenges of globalisation, my question is about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, our new annual fund, our new financial instrument to meet the challenges of globalisation.
Is the Council in a position to enforce this fund as soon as possible, and by that I mean in 2007?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has noted the European Parliament's resolution on trade and economic relations between the EU and India.
The Seventh EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October examined trade and economic relations between the parties.
In particular, a report by the EU-India High Level Trade Group was examined.
The Group was set up at the 2005 summit to look into how bilateral trade and investment relations could be developed and expanded.
The Group recommended that a large-scale trade partnership be developed through talks on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.
It was also the Group's view that a major, comprehensive agreement would also be of significant benefit to both the EU and India.
The Group recommended that future talks should cover the areas set forth in the report, such as trade in goods and services, investment, the promotion of trade, public procurement, technical regulations, intellectual property and geographical indications, competition policy, and the settlement of disputes.
Discussions on this at the Summit were constructive and reflected support for the work of the Group.
The EU-India Summit took a positive view of the Group's work and backed its proposal for a future, comprehensive trade and investment agreement.
The view was taken at the Summit that both parties should promote the start of negotiations on an agreement of this sort.
Both parties are now holding internal discussions on this.
The Summit was also confirmation of the undertaking and commitment on the part of both parties to achieve a strategic partnership and close cooperation, which has helped strengthen relations between the EU and India.
President-in-Office, only last week I was informed by Kamal Nath that he found the report I had prepared on behalf of the Committee on International Trade to be very helpful and that he was able to quote it in the negotiations.
The notion of a free trade agreement with India is clearly a key element of Commissioner Mandelson's external review strategy Global Europe, which sets out a clear strategy for building bilateral trade arrangements with emerging economies, notably in Asia.
What is the Council's view of this new strategy and does it believe such bilateral arrangements are the best mechanism for advancing Europe's growth and competitiveness, and how does this stand in relation to our commitment to the multilateral Doha round?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council discussed the matter of CIA secret detention centres at a meeting held on 15 September.
EU ministers repeated that they were committed to the effective fight against terrorism using all the ways and means available.
Terrorism in itself is a threat to the system of values that is based on the rule of law.
The Council repeated its insistence that human rights must be respected and humanitarian standards complied with in the fight against terrorism.
Representatives of the Member States therefore welcomed the statement by the US Administration that all prisoners would be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and its assurances that the International Committee of the Red Cross would have access to the prisoners in question.
The existence of secret detention centres, where imprisoned persons are held in a legal vacuum, is against international humanitarian law and international criminal justice.
The EU ministers said that they would continue the dialogue with the United States of America which focuses on the notion that a respect for human rights should be guaranteed even in the fight against terrorism.
This dialogue has been continued.
These views, which were strongly expressed at the meeting, will appear in the bulletin on the meeting.
deputising for the author. - President-in-Office, I am reassured by some of what you say, but great concern remains about so much that may or may not have actually taken place, and we need to establish the facts.
According to an article in the Italian newspaper l'UnitÃ , on 7 December 2005 Condoleezza Rice had frank discussions with EU ministers at a dinner at which the issue of extraordinary renditions was discussed.
I should like to know whether this dinner took place.
If so, who was there?
Were extraordinary renditions discussed?
If so, what was said?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, the dinner to which the honourable Member refers was not organised by the EU Presidency, at least.
We know nothing about the dinners the Member States of the European Union organise within the context of their own foreign relations, and we cannot possibly comment.
Excuse me, it may be a matter of the interpretation but I am quite surprised to hear what you say, because I do not think that you have responded to either of the questions.
You have not responded to the first question that was put to you in writing.
You refer to the dinner on 7 December of last year as concerning bilateral relations between Member States and the US.
If I understand correctly, that was a meeting where all the Member State governments and the US were represented, and if I am not mistaken Mr Solana and Mr de Vries were there as well.
I think, President-in-Office, that a great deal has come out in the meantime about the existence of secret prisons and the rendition flights that took place in Europe.
Can you confirm that the dinner took place and that the matter was discussed?
When will the Council start its own investigation and recognise what the rest of the world already knows?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, accession negotiations with Turkey began when it was considered that that country met the Copenhagen political criteria.
This means that Turkey is assumed to be complying with the reform process and endeavouring to bring in new reforms.
As the negotiating framework adopted by the Council in October 2005 states, progress in the negotiations depends on Turkey's progress in the implementation of reforms.
The Council of the European Union will not adopt an opinion on the alleged genocide of Armenians in Turkey.
Making historical judgments is the job of historians.
The Union takes a positive view of certain initiatives, such as the conference in Turkey on the Armenian Question and Prime Minister Erdogan's proposal to set up a joint Turkish-Armenian commission of historians to research the tragic events of 1915.
The Union is enthusiastically encouraging Turkey to do all it can to improve relations with its neighbour Armenia, especially with regard to opening the border between the countries, which would be a very propitious move for the entire region.
It was this summer that the European Council last reconfirmed that it would adhere to its commitments on enlargement.
No new criteria should be set midway though the negotiations process.
(SV) Mr President, it is not clear to me whether the Minister believes that Turkey must acknowledge the genocide or whether this is something that is to be left up to Turkey and Armenia to settle.
What is the Minister's view on this?
Like the rest of the Swedish June List, I am in favour of Turkish membership, provided that Turkey meets the conditions of membership.
Is it not a cause of concern that modern Turkey, which is a nation state founded, in fact, in the early 1920s, should refuse to acknowledge an action committed by the Ottoman empire many years before?
What does the Minister have to say about that?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, as I said in my previous answer, the Council of the European Union will not adopt a position on the alleged genocide of Armenians in Turkey.
Making historical judgments is the job of historians.
The Union, takes a positive view of certain initiatives, however, to shed new light on the tragic events of 1915.
The Finnish Presidency and the Commission too have stated that an admission regarding the Armenian genocide is not a criterion for Turkey's membership of the EU.
- (LT) Madam Minister, I fully agree that historians are the ones charged with evaluating history; however, they have different attitudes.
A democratic state, which is unable to assess its own past, cannot be called democratic.
I doubt that Turkey complies with the first Copenhagen criterion.
Turkey also fails to meet other requirements, such as the specification of the Ankara Protocol to open Turkish ports to Member States of the European Union.
It seems that Turkey is dictating EU membership terms; therefore, I am concerned about possible severe outcomes if Turkey starts dictating further terms.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, the Union itself dictates and imposes the conditions of membership for new Member States, but it is important that no new conditions or new criteria are set midway through the accession process.
The last time that the Commission made an evaluation of the extent to which conditions for membership were being met was in its report out on 8 November.
Ultimately, an analysis of the scope for continued talks with Turkey will also be undertaken at the December European Council.
(FI) Mr President, Minister LehtomÃ€ki, you have now twice stated the Finnish Presidency's view that recognition of the Armenian genocide cannot be a new condition for Turkey's membership.
The Commission is of the same opinion.
Is this the Council's common position, by which I mean has the legislative process on the Armenian genocide now under way in France been discussed and common conclusions adopted?
I would also like to ask how the Council intends to deal with the report on integration capacity adopted yesterday by Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs and which is to be adopted in December's plenary part-session.
President-on-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has unfortunately not discussed this issue, as it does not fall within its competence.
The promotion of human rights, however, is one of the European Union's main priorities.
Commitment on the part of the Member States of the Union to a respect for fundamental rights is also written into the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Member States of the EU are also members of the Council of the Europe and thus committed to compliance with their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Presumably, when the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights is set up and in operation, it will strengthen the Union's monitoring and information facilities, thereby promoting the implementation of fundamental rights to the greatest possible degree.
It still needs to be said once and for all that it is for the Commission, not the Council, to monitor implementation of the Union's Treaties.
(FI) Mr President, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, we nevertheless have precedents for the Council including in its agenda supposed or impending human rights violations on the part of one Member State.
When Austria's new government was elected, certain Member States pushed through sanctions against Austria in the light of its government programme.
This is now, however, a matter of concrete decisions which official bodies in Poland have taken, which is to say that they have completely rejected the perfectly reasonable application for YOUTH programme funding for no good reason whatsoever.
Does the Council not think that this would be at least as important an issue as the Austrian government programme was, though that did not lead to any tangible human rights violations?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, following the case which I believe the honourable Member is referring to, the status of fundamental rights in the work of the Union was in fact reconfirmed in the Union Treaties.
There is now no plan, however, to act on the basis of any sort of precedent, and the implementation of this Community programme and matters relating to its criteria are of course the responsibility of the Commission.
As the author is not present, Question No 8 lapses.
Subject: UN Human Rights Council
The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has concluded its second round of sittings without adopting any of the resolutions put before it.
The debates were dominated by those countries which have a history of human rights abuse, and no leadership was given by those states which are deemed to be the defenders of human rights.
Furthermore, although the reform seeks to confer powers to enable rapid action to be taken in the event of serious violations of human rights, the UNHRC failed to deliver an opinion on the situation in Darfur, the attacks on civilians in Sri Lanka, or the consequences of the violence in Lebanon and the occupied territories.
What is the Council's opinion of the outcome of the second sitting of the UNHRC?
What role is the Council prepared to play in the UNHRC's deliberations?
What measures are planned in order to tackle the challenges it faces if it wants to be an effective body?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union took an active role in the first and second session of the Human Rights Council.
The Human Rights Council should live up to the high expectations which the international community has set for it, and needs to employ effective and fruitful mechanisms to be able to fulfil all its tasks.
The European Union believes that it is too early to judge the work of the Human Rights Council properly.
We are establishing a new body with new working methods and processes, and this will take time, patience and creativity.
The Human Rights Council's broad mandate covers the prevention of violations and the building of cooperation and resources, but urgent human rights situations also have a major role.
Crucial to the new body's role are cooperation and dialogue, which are contained in the UN General Assembly resolution, on the basis of which the Human Rights Council was established.
The EU thus intends to continue to work steadfastly with other countries in the same spirit, and hopes that the other players involved are equally committed.
The EU's view of the second session of the Human Rights Council is that it was a very positive achievement to hold discussions on situations on both certain matters and country situations, within the context of the Special Procedures, and with the UN's human rights body.
Allowing extra time for the Special Procedures was a major improvement in Human Rights Council practices.
The quality of the dialogue and the large attendance figures were a tribute to the important role that the Special Procedures and the human rights body play within the human rights machinery, in that, for example, they bring the discussions closer to practical realities and act as an early warning system.
This work needs to be developed in future sessions.
The EU welcomes the active participation of NGOs in the debate both on particular subjects and on national situations.
The EU continues to support their active participation in all the work of the Human Rights Council.
The EU supported the efforts made by Mr de Alba, President of the Human Rights Council, to draft a concrete 'omnibus' resolution, based on a consensus on Human Rights Council results, and relating to certain matters and urgent human rights situations.
The EU regrets that the talks on the text did not lead to consensus.
The EU is in favour of an approach based on consensus whenever possible, and worked very hard for this at the second session of the Human Rights Council.
We will continue along this path in the future too.
It was a disappointment for the EU that no tangible results were achieved regarding the very serious human rights violations that have taken place in Darfur.
Action on the part of the Council is also needed in other urgent situations, such as that in Sri Lanka.
The EU intends to continue to be active so that the Human Rights Council can fulfil all the tasks within its mandate at future sessions.
deputising for the author. - (ES) Thank you very much for your reply, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
We currently have the problem that the United Nations Human Rights Council is suffering from the same defects as the Commission on Human Rights, that is, its inability to adopt resolutions.
The European Union and its Member States, particularly those that are members of the Human Rights Council, can help to overcome this situation.
Specifically, tomorrow, 15 November, a special meeting is taking place on Israel's violations of human rights in the occupied territories, and from 27 November to 8 December the Council will consider its decisions.
Does the Presidency-in-Office of the Council believe that the States of the European Union can help to achieve results in these two coming meetings?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, the Union has an important role to play in the work of the Human Rights Council, and preparations are now under way for the Council's third session.
This will mainly focus on formulating the Council's working practices.
The Union is now very actively participating in the preparatory work that is taking place in Geneva.
The Council's future agenda is also being discussed.
The EU aims to push its own objectives through in these talks, for example, to ensure that the special mechanism system is preserved and reinforced.
In addition, the Union will be involved in discussions on the establishment of a new periodic review.
- (LT) Madam Minister, as a member of the delegation of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European Parliament, I have participated in the session of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations and have seen the Member States of the European Union negotiating their positions and trying to speak with one voice.
My question is as follows: what issues were initiated by the European Union to be discussed in the Human Rights Council during the Presidency of Finland?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council regularly evaluates the situation in the Middle East, and last did so at its sessions on 17 October and 13 November.
It was then that the Council adopted its conclusions on these matters.
These explored the Council's position with regard to various issues.
Furthermore, contained in them was an expression of concern about Israel, and matters on which it would like Israel to take various forms of action.
The Council raises these matters with Israel within the context of the EU-Israel Association Agreement at meetings held regularly with Israel.
An opportunity for this last presented itself at the EU-Israel Association Agreement meeting held on 13 June 2006.
A meeting of the Working Party on Human Rights on 7 June 2006 was an opportunity for a more in-depth debate on the EU's particular worries about Israel.
Furthermore, the Sub-Committee on Political Dialogue and Cooperation, at its second meeting on 9 November, held a discussion largely devoted to these issues.
Mr President, what is going in Gaza amounts to nothing less than sheer bloody slaughter.
Just how many Palestinians have to die before the Council recognises that Israel might be in breach of the human rights requirements of the Association Agreement?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, Gaza and the Middle East situation was last discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council held yesterday.
At that meeting, conclusions on this situation were adopted.
The Union has been especially worried about the appalling humanitarian situation in Gaza.
The Union has provided its own humanitarian aid and has also regularly raised with Israel, in many different contexts, the matter of the measures which are needed to improve the humanitarian situation.
As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses.
Subject: EU-Balkan relations
Can the European Council state what tangible measures have been made this year in terms of building closer economic and political relations between the European Union and the Balkan States?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, the Council has worked continuously to ensure that the Union is committed in the future to closer relations between the Western Balkan countries and Europe.
It confirmed its complete support in the Salzburg Declaration of March 2006 for the agenda set out at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 and for furthering the Stabilisation and Association Process.
One of the major challenges this term has been how to ensure support for the current talks on the status of Kosovo, headed by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
The talks have also featured a plan for the EU's future position and presence, especially in the areas of policing, the rule of law and the economy.
Since the referendum in Montenegro and the Republic of Montenegro's declaration of independence, the European Union and its Member States have agreed to develop relations with Montenegro as a sovereign, independent country and have urged both Serbia and Montenegro to continue with their frank and constructive dialogue on future relations.
The Council welcomed the fact that the elections in the Republic of Montenegro went peacefully and without problems, and the recommencement of talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
The Council stressed that the speed of progress of the talks and their conclusion depended in particular on Montenegro's progress in implementing the necessary reforms.
Work has continued on bringing to conclusion the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After the elections in early October, the Council emphasised that recently elected political institutions needed to accelerate the implementation of all the reforms that were required for concluding the Agreement.
The Council also welcomed the report by Javier Solana and Olli Rehn on a reinforced EU presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The purpose of reinforcing its presence is to prepare for, and put into effect, the move away from the current arrangement towards greater local responsibility.
Talks with Serbia will continue once it is seen to be cooperating fully with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The Council repeated that a peaceful, prosperous Serbia, one that is a full ally of the European nations, is very important for the stability of the entire region.
In accordance with the commitments made at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 and the Salzburg meeting in 2006, the Council has endeavoured to make closer ties to the EU more tangible, by, for example, increasing contact between people by means of agreements that facilitate the issue of visas concluded with all the countries in the Western Balkans.
The mandate for negotiations for such agreements was adopted yesterday by the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
Similarly, the mandate for negotiations was adopted for readmission agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia in the former Yugoslavia, Montenegro and Serbia.
Albania already has a readmission agreement with the EU.
Negotiations with all the Western Balkan countries are to start on 30 November in Brussels.
The purpose is to bring the talks to conclusion as soon as possible.
The Council, moreover, supported regional cooperation and the local responsibility of various regional forums, not least the reform of the Central European Free Trade Agreement and its expansion to include all the Balkan countries.
The Council welcomed the initialling of the Central European Free Trade Agreement on 9 November in all the countries in the Balkan region, excluding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.
The Council anticipates that the Free Trade Agreement will be signed according to plan on 19 December during the CEFTA Summit in Bucharest.
President-in-Office, thank you for that very comprehensive answer.
I should like to focus on two other areas you spoke about in your response.
Firstly, with regard to the role of Martti Ahtisaari in Kosovo and how that links in with the commitments from the European Union under the common foreign and security policy, what kind of money is being given for the rejuvenation of the police force and the judiciary within that area?
Secondly, has there been any further discussion of an idea that originally came from Croatia concerning the creation of a new semi-single market within the former republics of the Yugoslav Republic in order to try and create economic regeneration within that area itself, and has the EU been asked to participate or to advise with regard to any parts of that?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, we do have to remember that the job being done by Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari to find a solution to Kosovo's status is under the auspices of the UN.
The Union, however, strongly supports Mr Ahtisaari's efforts and hopes that a solution to the question of status will be found.
It is very important that stability in the region can be maintained and that long-term preconditions for development can be established.
The European Union is preparing for a diverse presence and support in Kosovo even after a decision on its status has been reached.
With regard to the honourable Member's second question, I would refer to my analysis of the Free Trade Agreement in my original answer.
Projects connected with the Free Trade Agreement are well along the way, and we are expecting it to be signed this December.
(DE) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to what extent are the local authorities in the countries of the Western Balkans and also in the countries the President-in-Office mentioned really prepared to work together with the EU on a common foreign and security policy, and particularly on combating organised crime?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community's energy policy is based on the third pillar: security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability.
Energy efficiency is a way to promote the achievement of these three main objectives of the Community's energy policy.
This we are aiming to bring about by, for example, improving security of supply by reducing our dependence on outside sources.
In the same way, it is important to boost competitiveness in the European Union, so that new energy efficiency technologies can be developed, the position of industry in the Union in the field of energy-efficient products and services reinforced, and energy costs for companies and the authorities cut.
To achieve these goals we also need to promote environmental sustainability, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the other adverse effects on the environment which result from the use of some forms of energy.
Energy efficiency and energy saving may be regarded as both the cornerstone of the Community's energy policy and a priority goal, which the Council has been committed to for a long time now.
This commitment is clearly reflected in the legislative measures and other measures which have recently been adopted or which are to be adopted in the Council's conclusions on energy efficiency and energy saving and in the conclusions by the Presidency adopted at the March and June 2006 European Council meetings.
Regarding research and development, the Council would like to refer the honourable Member to the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme, about which there have been intensive discussions between the European Parliament and the Council.
Energy efficiency is one of the objectives in the field of energy that we intend to promote.
Special attention is to be paid to coordination of the views on the reasonable and efficient use of energy in the framework programme and in other Community policies and programmes.
As you will certainly know, the Council for its own part has already approved the results of the tripartite negotiations held on 26 October, meaning that efforts to reach agreement on the Seventh Framework Programme will be made at second reading.
I believe that the Council and Parliament will continue to cooperate successfully and that it will be possible to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme by the end of this year.
You will also certainly be aware of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme for the period 2007-2013, which was recently adopted and will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the very near future.
The budget for the 'Intelligent Energy - Europe' programme under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme is bigger than before, so it will help to make it easier to implement concrete action in the field of energy efficiency.
Among the legislative measures and other measures which have recently been adopted or which are to be adopted soon, it is worth mentioning in particular the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2005 for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products and the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services.
These two ambitious legal instruments, combined with the measures contained in the Action Plan on energy efficiency adopted by the Commission, will promote the realisation of the potential energy saving figure of 20% proposed by the Commission by the year 2020.
At its meeting of 23 November, the Council will hold a general discussion on the Commission document 'Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the potential' and adopt its conclusions on it.
These conclusions will help serve as the basis for the Council's instructions to the Commission, the Member States and other stakeholders for implementing the measures contained in the Commission's Action Plan.
Implementation of many of the measures proposed in the Commission's Action Plan is one of the Council's priority areas over the next few years.
deputising for the author. - President-in-Office, thank you for the response to the question.
I have two very brief supplementaries in regard to that.
President Barroso said here today in Parliament that climate change and energy are some of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next ten years.
One of the elements relating to energy efficiency is that if you turn off your television properly instead of leaving it on standby, you can save 25% of the electricity that is normally used for a television.
Maybe, when we speak about design and energy-efficient design, those kinds of design features should be taken out of televisions and radios and computers, so that there is no standby.
Secondly, concerning the Stern report on economic environmental matters, I know you cannot speak on behalf of Finland but I also know it has one of the best records on alternative energy use and recovery of energy.
The Stern report is quite explicit on the economic savings that can be made with regard to energy efficiency.
Can we see legislative programmes directed towards that?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community's programme of development cooperation with Mozambique, as with the other African, Caribbean and Pacific States, is accomplished via the European Development Fund.
The Fund's deployment is the responsibility of the Commission, which is the proper body to answer this question.
I can nevertheless say that Mozambique is one of the largest EU development cooperation recipient countries among the ACP countries, and its share of EDF funding is also one of the biggest in Africa.
According to the information that we have received, appropriations for Mozambique this year will be approximately EUR 165 million.
The proper body to provide information on EDF payments is the Commission, so I suggest that the honourable Member consults the competent body on this matter also.
deputising for the author. - I just wish to say that I understand that there is a cross-over here between the different rules.
However, Mozambique is Ireland's biggest destination for development aid money and the reason is that the Irish Government works very closely with the Clinton Foundation in tackling disease, including AIDS, as well as giving education on the ground.
Would the Council consider giving more support to foundations like the Clinton Foundation, which has proven to be so successful in individual countries?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, Mozambique's significant position as a recipient of development cooperation is obviously a clear reflection of the peaceful development that has taken place there and the successful transition which the country has gone through in the last 15 years since the conflict.
With regard to the honourable Member's mention of additional funding from the EDF or the Community budget for the Clinton Foundation, this is naturally the responsibility of the Commission.
I might say, however, that, to the best of my belief, several Member States also support work of this nature within the context of their national development cooperation programme, and, as the honourable Member referred to the example of Ireland, as minister responsible for development cooperation in Finland, I might add that Mozambique also plays an important role in Finland's programme of bilateral development cooperation.
The presence of the European Union in Mozambique, in the shape of the Community and the Member States, is therefore important on the whole, because, as I have said, appropriations for Mozambique in the Community budget will be EUR 165 million this year, and the national presence of the Member States and the contribution they make are also undoubtedly considerable.
Question No 15 has been withdrawn.
Subject: Iceland
What negotiations has the Council had with the Republic of Iceland regarding the slaughter of whales?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is aware that Iceland has said it is recommencing commercial whaling despite the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on whaling, in effect since 1984.
This issue was discussed at the meeting of the Environment Council on 23 October under 'any other business'.
On 10 October 2002 Iceland rejoined the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling of 1946, although it expressed reservations with respect to the whaling moratorium.
As the honourable Member knows, membership of the International Whaling Commission is open to every country officially aligned to the 1946 Convention.
Each Member State can decide itself whether to join an international convention devoted to matters that do not fall within the exclusive competence of the Community.
Up till now 18 Member States of the European Union have joined the Convention, and they are also members of the International Whaling Commission.
The Commission has pledged to protect whales, as endorsed in the Habitats Directive.
The Directive provides for high levels of protection for whales, at the same time banning any deliberate hunting and killing of whales in Community waters.
In addition, the import of whale meat and other whale-derived products into the Community for primarily commercial purposes is tightly restricted under Council Regulation (EC) No 338 of 1977.
When Iceland declared that it would recommence commercial whaling, 15 EU Member States that belong to the International Whaling Commission and the European Commission, together with Australia, the United States of America and eight other like-minded countries, made official contact with Reykjavik, urging Iceland to comply with the moratorium and end its commercial whaling activities.
I thank the President-in-Office for her answer.
It was perhaps more than I expected and I am very grateful.
Iceland, as she and everyone here knows, is not a member of the European Union; it is, however, a member of EFTA and a member of Schengen - although that is obviously not related to this.
However, it really proves the point that Iceland has close connections with the EU.
I would urge the President-in-Office, in the time that she and her successors have left, to do everything they can to urge Iceland to not continue with the unnecessary and, I would say, cruel slaughter of one of the world's great mammals for unproven reasons.
I applaud what the President-in-Office has said about not allowing whaling in Community waters and banning the import of whale products.
Keep up the good work and push the Icelandic authorities even further.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, the question is actually not so much a question as a comment, and you have my sincerest thanks for that.
I would nevertheless still like to mention some forthcoming measures that are presently being discussed with regard to this matter, in particular by the International Whaling Commission.
Its next yearly meeting is in the United States of America next May, and we can be absolutely certain that at least the countries that share the Union's strongly adverse view of this will want to see a debate on Icelandic fishing, so this issue will be very much on the agenda.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Gambling and sports betting in the Internal Market (debate)
The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on gambling and sports betting in the internal market - B6-0443/2006).
author. - Mr President, I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members.
I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets.
The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what future steps are planned in this area.
Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling?
As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive, we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article 49 as regards the free movement of services.
The Commissioner will be aware of the committee's decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive, not least because of the complexity of the gambling market.
However, the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States, which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the cross-border supply of online betting and gambling services.
We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article 49, while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest, as long as the rules are necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory, i.e. not discriminating against other EU operators.
It is hypocritical, on public interest grounds, for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market, while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules.
That is the issue we hope the Commission will address.
I would like to take the debate in a different direction.
I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market.
This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR 20 billion by 2010.
In 2003, in the EU-25 commercial gaming industries, lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR 51.5 billion and there are some 2300 worldwide online casino sites.
In the UK, for example, during the World Cup football matches, 30% of those making online bets on UK services were women.
It crosses all classes and all generations.
The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries.
However, let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the 2006 Bush legislation - the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites.
This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the so-called protection of consumers against gambling excesses.
In reality, it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market, while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services.
I believe it would be good if the Commissioner, on behalf of the 25 Member States, would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling.
This is one way to minimise the differences between not only the international community but also the EU Member States, to ensure in the end that all states opt in to high standards both for operators and consumers.
The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers, in particular young adults and minors, to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities.
The internet genie is out of the bottle: some 3.3 million EU citizens are regular online gamblers.
This is a market that will grow.
The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards.
We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling.
The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate.
I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonight's debate to continue with infringement proceedings.
However, in reality, it is a thankless task, which takes years to resolve, often not with a satisfactory conclusion, and I believe the best way forward is for the EU now to be a leader, driving good and high common international standards that can help minimise the differences, protect consumers and force the operators to be socially responsible.
Member of the Commission.
Mr President, gambling services are clearly services within the scope of the Treaty, and Treaty principles, including those on the freedom of establishment and the freedom of services, apply to gambling.
The Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States' legislation is fully compatible with the Treaty.
Therefore the Commission decided in April to ask seven Member States for more information on their legislation that restricts the supply of sports betting services.
The Commission has responded to a number of complaints from operators in the sports betting area.
Having met with the authorities of all seven Member States, my services are now examining the formal replies received from each.
At this stage I cannot pre-empt the outcome of that examination.
I should like to inform Parliament that I expect that to be completed in the next few weeks.
Based on that examination I would put forward a proposal to the college of Commissioners on how to proceed.
It would then be a matter for them to decide on the next steps.
In addition to the seven cases opened in April, the Commission decided, on 12 October, to send formal requests for information related to the gambling sector to three other Member States.
Complaints from operators, to which the Commission is responding, relate mainly to sports betting services.
That is why nine of the ten cases opened so far related to the provision of sports betting services, some of them online.
However, in October the Commission also enquired about national legislation in Austria, which prohibits advertisements from casinos licensed and operating in other Member States.
We also have concerns that Austrian legislation requires national casinos to protect only nationals from excessive losses, without having similar protection for foreign players.
As guardian of the Treaty, the Commission will examine all complaints that it receives.
However, at the same time I do not underestimate the sensitivities that exist in many Member States on the question of gambling.
Member States are fully entitled to protect general interest objectives, such as the protection of consumers.
However those measures must be necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory.
In particular, they must be applied to national and non-national operators in a systematic and consistent way.
The Commission does not seek to liberalise the market in any way, but rather to be assured that whatever measures Member States have in place are fully compatible with existing EU law.
Member States are well aware of the case law of the European Court of Justice, which I expect will develop further.
The Commission accepted Parliament's request to exclude all gambling services from the scope of the draft Services Directive.
It was made quite clear to me at that time that the regulation of gambling should be left to the Member States.
I fully agree, provided that such national legislation is compatible with the Treaty.
In the context of the infringement proceedings I am willing to work in close cooperation with the Member States to ensure compatibility of national legislation with Community requirements and allow for appropriate and effective protection to be put in place, for example to safeguard consumers and to protect minors.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, would you allow me to make a point first, before you start the clock.
According to the agenda, this debate was scheduled to start at 10.30.
That was quite clear and I notice that a number of my colleagues made an effort to be here at 10.30.
So I am disturbed to find that I missed most of the speech of my colleague Mrs McCarthy, because the debate appears to have started at least ten minutes early.
I do not think that is acceptable, if I may say so, and I am sorry that your predecessor in the Chair has gone away.
If the schedule for the day says a debate starts at 10.30, I submit to you that it should start at 10.30, even if there has to be a short adjournment.
Perhaps I could now move on and if you will restart the clock, please, I shall make my substantive points.
I very much welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy is here to address this issue and I am pleased that, under the leadership of Mrs McCarthy, we have taken an initiative that I hope will shed some light on this issue.
As the Commissioner made clear, this is a highly sensitive issue and it involves many aspects of public interest.
But nevertheless, from the point of view of the operation of the Single Market, which is also of overriding interest to us, the situation is, as you suggested, deeply unsatisfactory.
Clearly we await the results of your investigations but I suggest that, at the very least, it would be appropriate for you to issue some form of guidelines to Member States on their attitude to receiving applications from reputable and well-established gambling operators who simply want to be able to operate in other EU countries under the law of those countries, which they are perfectly entitled to do.
One of the things you did not mention, but which seems to me to be rather extraordinary in terms of discriminatory practice, is that some Member States have tried to restrict access to those markets on the grounds that they do not want to encourage gambling.
Yet at the same time those Member States are promoting participation in their national lotteries with billions of euros across Europe.
Clearly that is entirely inconsistent.
I believe it is sensible and good that the European Court of Justice has struck down some of the restrictions, but I think those guidelines will be important.
As Mrs McCarthy said, in terms of operation and protecting the public interest respectable operations are extremely important.
The big issue that we have to face is online gambling.
Whether Member States want to preserve a monopoly or not, the fact is that consumers are taking advantage of online gambling.
I believe it is much better, in the public interest, that we have well-regulated online gambling services than uncontrolled services which come into Europe from other countries outside the remit of the European Union.
Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I am going to respond to a procedural motion.
You are absolutely right; the debate was indeed scheduled for the time that you indicated.
However, it was explained on the European Parliament's website, at the start of the afternoon, that the debate could start slightly earlier if question time finished earlier than scheduled, which was the case.
Furthermore, the services tried to contact all of the speakers.
They managed to contact all of them, except you, Mr Harbour, but I think that your presence in the Chamber this evening shows that you have not missed a great deal of the debate.
That being said, I felt it my duty to explain the situation to you.

on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'Rien ne va plus' ['No more bets'] is the curious opening of the recent opinion delivered by the Advocate General DÃ¡maso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer to the European Court of Justice, which had been asked to rule for the third time on Italian legislation on gambling, following the Zenatti ruling and the Gambelli ruling, the latter rightly referred to in the recitals of the oral question under discussion.
It is truly important to be familiar not only with the Commission's findings, but also with the recent measures by the Member States against whom infringement proceedings have been opened, and, specifically, the steps that the Commission intends to take.
I believe that it is also important for there to be moderate but definite rules in this sector, also involving the European Parliament directly.
That is the only way to help Member States exposed to the risk of appeals and negative judgments in what remains a worthy attempt to protect individuals, in particular minors and the most vulnerable, as has already been said.
The explosion of gambling, lotteries and online betting is a problem that cannot be left to market liberalisation, even if the difficulty concerning the non-discrimination principle is obvious.
I must just point out that the 'Services Directive', which has already been referred to here, excludes gambling precisely for reasons of public order and consumer protection.
on behalf of the ALDE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I thank the Commissioners and my fellow Members for taking the trouble to discuss this topic, which is, after all, an exciting one.
We have left gambling and Internet gambling outside of the Services Directive because we do not dare take a decision on it.
It still falls within the scope of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty and at the moment - as is also evident from the 11 infringement procedures - there is enormous legal uncertainty among the Member States and businesses.
How should we tackle it?
I am pleased that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has put this oral question, for the problems are, after all, real.
There is the problem that on the one hand, it is very lucrative for the Member States in terms of tax revenue, but on other hand, it also brings with it social problems.
The main problem, though, is that, if there is no sound legal framework in place within a market where serious money can be made, this opens the floodgates to a huge number of illegal practices in which criminal organisations reign supreme.
I therefore believe that the politicians, and I hope that the Commissioner will agree with me on this, must take up the gauntlet and dare take decisions.
We must not surrender ourselves to the very wise judges in Luxembourg who then have the onerous task of biting the bullet.
I fear that many more judgments from the European Court of Justice will follow as long as we as politicians do not take the right decisions.
I hope that the Commission and the Council will get there in the end.
If not, I hope that Parliament itself will produce an own-initiative report in order to guarantee legal certainty, which is desperately needed given the many problems that exist, including addiction, public health problems, illicit funds, money laundering, and the list goes on.
We must solve this with a firm, clear directive on gambling and Internet gambling.
I hope that the Commissioner will advise us as to how Parliament should tackle this.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner's statement that we must protect minors.
To do that it is imperative to take a long hard look at Ireland's policy of having no age limit on gambling with the state-run tote.
Children in Ireland are permitted to place bets at greyhound tracks and horse tracks if these are part of that tote.
Other forms of gambling are limited to over-18s.
Video evidence exists of Irish children as young as four years of age legally placing bets with the state-run tote.
It is not uncommon for birthday, Christmas and first communion money to wind up in the Irish state tote and, ultimately, with the Irish Exchequer.
The Chief Executive of Horse Racing Ireland, when asked his opinion of child gambling in Ireland, said that it was no problem and that he wanted to develop the customer of the future.
For years you, Commissioner McCreevy, as Irish Minister for Finance, refused to amend the Tote Act and outlaw child betting in Ireland.
As Commissioner, will you now change your attitude and, at this late date, support restrictions on child online betting, at race tracks, in bookmakers, on airplanes and anywhere else that this insidious practice persists?
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from the very first vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we decided to leave gambling activities, including lotteries and bets, outside of the scope of the Services Directive.
It may be that some, as Mr Manders said a moment ago, were frightened of taking a decision.
I am convinced that many felt that the Member States could be given quite a bit of freedom to handle this complex issue in their own way, in tune with the sensitivities and the situations in their countries, according to their own traditions.
It goes without saying that, in this respect, the Member States should respect the Treaty, and we already know the answer of the Court to a number of prejudicial questions that have previously been asked.
I hope, Commissioner, that the questions that are yet to be asked will not immediately prompt you to advise the Commission to start issuing rules and regulations.
Whilst the Commission is, of course, the guardian of the Treaties, and we expect it to take its role seriously, this can also be done with some restraint.
Getting the internal market to operate is necessary and positive in every respect, but this need not be at the expense of the effective protection of law and order, security and the consumer's mental health.
I hope there will also be room for the Member States which, via state monopolies or not, as the case may be, commit to channelling the passion for gambling, monitor the fairness of the game and to donate the financial gain, as and when they can, for cultural, social and sports goals.
Clear legal rules can certainly help, but legislation is not always the answer.
I am certainly not talking on behalf of the whole of the group, but on behalf of a number of group colleagues who were unable to take the floor this evening.
(ES) Mr President, gambling is not just another service, it is a dangerous activity.
It is dangerous because people's innocence and ignorance is being exploited.
In the majority of our Member States, gambling is currently subject to regulation.
I do not understand how it can be possible for supranational bodies now to be planning to impose a liberalisation of gambling services on the Member States, when the majority of our societies do not accept it.
The United States Congress recently banned on-line gambling, and it seems to me that, at the moment, we should follow the US example in the European Union, on the one hand, in order to protect our consumers from mafia organisations and, secondly, in order to protect all those social institutions in each of the Member States that currently rely on legal forms of gambling permitted by national authorities.
I therefore believe that the Commission is right to look into the issue of gambling, but it must deal with it from the point of view of consumer protection and the protection of the institutions currently benefiting from legal gambling in the majority of our Member States.
(DE) Commissioner McCreevy has also had an extremely tiring day today, and so he will understand our desire to present the matter to him with the necessary clarity and brevity.
In my personal opinion, gambling and the abundance of lotteries have two different elements.
On the one hand, there is the truly cross-border market for online providers that can only be regulated at European level.
As Mr Medina-Ortega pointed out, the US has already managed to regulate its market.
Europe, too, can resolve the issue of the online market only by joining with the Member States and introducing Europe-wide regulation.
On the other hand, there is the market in traditional games of chance and traditional sports betting, which tend to take place in written form.
In contrast to the infringement proceedings opened by the Commission - Commissioner McCreevy, in other words - we should proceed according to the principle that, if the Member States are succeeding in preventing addiction effectively by orienting their national monopolies towards a range of services that is as limited as possible and offers the greatest possible consumer protection, they should be given the chance to retain these monopolies in future - under the control and auspices of European law and the European Commission.
It must be ensured, however, that the monopolies that the Member States already have truly pursue just one objective, namely the prevention of addiction, and that Member States do not use them to pursue other objectives, such as aiding the recovery of public finances or promoting sport.
In this context, I would be delighted if Parliament and the Commission together could agree on a regime that, on the one hand, establishes European regulation of the online market and, on the other, maintains the national regulations in the field of monopolies for traditional sports betting, provided these are compatible with the internal market.
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the exclusion of gambling, including lotteries, from the Services Directive appeared to have introduced a measure of clarity to the sector, but we need to go further.
We are aware of a number of complicated aspects involving certain types of gambling and betting.
It is therefore necessary to guarantee consumer protection and to ensure effective monitoring of the financial circuits relating to such activities in order to prevent or combat money laundering.
Naturally, we must not confuse the appropriate protection of the consumer with the undue protectionism that any particular Member State may want or may employ.
In any event, however, it should be pointed out that every Member State has the right to regulate the phenomenon of betting for money on its territory until such time as another, European-level legal instrument appears.
In this regard, online gambling deserves special attention from the Commission and immediately from Parliament, as previous speakers have mentioned and as is clear from the debate.
Lastly, I welcome the fact that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection raised this issue, with the result that we have made some progress in clarifying it this evening.
(FR) Mr President, I am going to try to be both quick and slow.
This report is timely, and I might add that I consider the remarks made just now to be positive.
Everyone would like the European Union to intervene using methods other than simple case-law.
This issue does, in fact, involve a range of businesses and services: casinos, lotteries and other games of chance via traditional means or via the Internet.
Therefore, this goes far beyond simple online sporting bets, which is the subject of Mrs McCarthy's question.
While it is normal for these services to apply the principles of the internal market, Commissioner, freedom should not go hand in hand with the law of the jungle!
For reasons to do with the general interest, health, morality and security, these services need to be regulated and controlled.
The Member States must be able to authorise and control public and private operators in the context of fair competition.
The importance of 'cross-border' games does, however, require us to go beyond the national framework.
In this regard, the recent decision taken by the United States is the demonstration that, if those who play and who make others play cannot be controlled, then it is better to take too many precautions than not enough.
That is why, Commissioner, I consider the Commission's current approach, which is based exclusively on the Treaties and on the Court of Justice, to be inadequate and dangerous.
It is clear today that the idea that the national laws are compatible with the Treaties is an unsatisfactory one.
Commissioner, you must work alongside Parliament to establish complementary legislation that can organise this extremely important sector, both politically and economically, in a sound and rational manner.
Let this sector develop, but let it do so in complete safety for the people and for the Member States!
(EL) Mr President, over recent years the system of the state monopoly in the gambling sector, which prevails in the majority of the Member States of the European Union, has been on the receiving end of more and more attacks from mainly private interests.
At the European Union summit in Edinburgh in December 1992, the European Council decided, given the principle of subsidiarity, not to regulate gambling and to leave it under the sole jurisdiction of the Member States.
The directive adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2000 makes provision for the express exemption of gambling from its scope.
The draft 2006 directive on services makes precisely the same provision.
Given the peculiarities of the gambling sector, the Court of Justice of the European Communities acknowledges the competence of the Member States to regulate the gambling market in what they consider to be the best way possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most important reasons for these decisions is the fact that there is a high degree of risk of addition inherent in the gambling sector, especially of young people, and of crimes being committed, such as fraud, money laundering and so on, and I personally believe that only the state can create the control, guarantee, reliability and transparency mechanisms needed in order to protect consumers.
Finally, I am of the opinion that, once the gambling market is liberalised, the system of support for sports in Europe will collapse, taking cultural and social actions and subsidies with it, such as the fight against drugs, education and support for people with disabilities or special needs who mainly have financial support from the state gambling organisation.
We believe in the free market, but do not occasionally ignore the risks inherent in uncontrolled gambling.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, for regulatory reasons, we have exempted games of chance and casinos from the Services Directive.
I say this despite being a firm supporter of strengthening the internal market.
We did not want to throw the baby out with the bath water, however.
Secondly, there are many risks associated with games of chance, and so the argument regarding competition law and the internal market should not be the only one used by the Commission in support of infringement proceedings.
Thirdly, a clear definition is needed.
When we talk about 'games of chance', what is covered by the term?
Given the differences in the treatment of online markets, sports betting, machines, casinos and lotteries, a single definition is needed to ensure these are dealt with the same way everywhere, and a single legal framework is probably also required.
Fourthly, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that there are other important fields, too, to be taken into consideration, such as consumer protection, health, taxation, international trade, the problem of money laundering, the prevention of addiction and the fight against crime, including organised crime.
Fifthly, almost all Member States regulate the field of games of chance.
Eleven have special legislative models, and four use the limited-licence model.
Sixthly, in 2004, state lotteries achieved sales of EUR 63 billion, which is an average per capita net expenditure of EUR 140.
Seventhly, that means that approximately 33% of all takings go on good causes and tax.
In the event of liberalisation of the private sector this would be just 3%.
Eighthly, it is estimated that the industry generates approximately 13 billion jobs in the EU.
Ninthly, the sale of lottery tickets accounts for 195 000 jobs within the EU.
I would ask the Commissioner to consider these arguments when making his assessment.
Mr President, I should like to make one point.
Much attention has been paid in this debate to young people and the effects of gambling addiction on them, and yet more people under the age of 12 are trafficked or forced into prostitution because of drug or alcohol addiction and abuse than the gambling addiction that is the subject of our debate tonight.
Member of the Commission. There is no specific Community legislation governing gambling.
If and how Member States wish to regulate gambling services at national, regional or local level is therefore a matter for each Member State to decide for itself.
But the general principles of Community law and the Treaty continue to apply and any national legislation must respect those principles.
The diversity of national approaches can lead to legal uncertainty for service providers and their customers, especially where national legislation fails to respect Community law.
Tonight's debate helps to illustrate once more the diversity of opinion with regard to gambling services.
I am, of course, aware of calls for a specific Community regulatory framework for gambling services.
There are equally strong views opposing such Community intervention.
In my experience, the first requirement in trying to find a solution is to have a clear understanding of the problem and of the policy options available.
The Commission recently published a study carried out on its behalf by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law.
The study illustrates the complexity and diversity of national regulatory approaches.
Should Parliament believe that, over and above our efforts to ensure the application of fundamental Treaty principles, more should be done to ensure legal clarity, I look forward to hearing Parliament's detailed views on what precisely the issues are that warrant Community intervention and what policy options would command a sufficient degree of consensus for a meaningful solution at Community level.
In the absence of such a political consensus, legal certainty may ultimately only be provided by the European Court of Justice.
I should like to add just a few more words to this debate.
Mr Harbour put it fairly succinctly when he made the point that there was a great deal of inconsistency amongst many of the Member States, against whom we are now taking some action.
We shall probably be taking action against some more.
If Member States, their governments and their legislatures want to have very restrictive laws on gambling, etc., they may do so on public policy grounds.
But they cannot do the things that Mr Harbour has referred to.
They cannot spend millions and millions advertising gambling services for their own national operators or their own national, publicly-owned operators.
They cannot allow their own national operators and bar everybody else.
If Member States feel, as some Members of this House obviously do, that gambling is a greater scourge than alcohol addiction, tobacco addiction and all these other addictions put together, then they should ban it for everybody and allow no gambling at all in their Member State.
That is one option.
Then nobody would complain.
The Commission would not take action against them and no one would worry about it at all.
But it is a bit hypocritical for Member States to allow millions to be spent promoting gambling and at the same time allow nobody else to play the game.
In all Member States gambling is regulated to some extent.
The point made by Mrs McCarthy about international standards for online gambling is quite a good idea in itself, but first some form of consensus would be needed among the 25 Member States.
We can start by getting consensus in this Parliament, but I do not think we will.
I am certain that we will not get it in the Council of Ministers.
I have about the same chance of getting consensus in the Council of Ministers and Parliament as I have of winning the lottery this weekend.
Those would be the odds against it.
So there is much to commend what Mrs McCarthy says, and if there was a consensus I would like to go in that direction, but my experience tells me that it would be very difficult.
If you read the executive summary in the recent study, which, if I am correct, comes to 51 pages, and save yourself reading the other couple of hundred pages, it does not come down heavily on one side or the other.
(comments off-microphone from Mr Toubon)
Well, I do not think my honourable friend Mr Toubon has read the report, but you can see from that how complex this problem is and the many different ways it is regulated.
It will show you what a gargantuan task it would be to head down that road.
In my political life I have not been afraid to take on impossible causes and tilt at windmills and run into brick walls, but I think that if we did attempt some kind of harmonisation of this area, what we would end up with, if anything, would be the most illiberal piece of legislation ever to go through any House anywhere in the world, because it is not possible.
I have recognised for a long time that there are great differences of opinion here, long before I came to this conclusion.
I recognise that throughout Europe, and even in my home country, there would be very different views about this.
Some people, I know, think that it is worse than drinking addiction, worse than tobacco addiction, worse than anything possible, but others do not.
I know which category I fit into, but I think trying to get some harmonisation in this area is going to be a long, long process.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(MT) Some Member States have unilaterally decided to introduce legislation preventing Europeans from using Internet gambling sites run by companies registered in other European Union countries.
This violates the principle of unrestricted movement of services between Member States, as well as Directive 98/34 EC which stipulates that, prior to introducing regulations concerning information technology services, a state must inform all other Member States and the Commission.
Last June, in response to a parliamentary question, I was informed that the matter was the subject of an investigation by the Commission.
May we know the stage this investigation has reached, and whether any measures have been taken?
I agree that it is time this rapidly developing sector were governed by a legal structure that contained standards and regulations governing this service in a serious manner.
These regulations would protect consumers and minors while, at the same time, permitting serious operators to work freely in all Member States of the European Union.
A new framework strategy for multilingualism (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Joan i MarÃ­, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on a new framework strategy for multilingualism.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the colleagues who helped me draw up this report, and especially the members of the Committee on Culture and Education.
I also wish to thank Commissioner FigeÄŸ, who has kept in contact with us, for his positions on plurality and on the issues related to minority languages, etc. Thanks are also due to all the other colleagues, from several groups, and other people involved in the report, especially the members of the various NGOs for the normalisation of languages who were in contact with us during the preparation of the report.
I would like to mention in particular Vicent SantalÃ³, a member of the legal staff at the Catalan Parliament, who worked with us until his death last summer.
The main aim of this report is to move forward the concept of plurality in languages.
Plurality and diversity are common values of the European Union.
There should be unity among all Europeans in this area, which should have plurality as one of its main aims, because a non-plural Europe is a false and devalued Europe.
This is reflected in a certain manner in languages.
As you know, in sociolinguistic terms there are 'normalised' languages, which are the fully official languages used in all walks of our lives.
There are also 'minorised' languages, which are not fully official and cannot be used for every purpose, despite the fact they are the main languages in specific language communities.
There is also a third group, which is that of minority languages.
All these groups must be respected and preserved, and the preservation of language diversity is one of the aims of the European Institutions.
Europeans are not as multilingual as we think.
Unfortunately, many European citizens have only one language - usually their mother tongue - and one of the main goals of the European Union is to have a citizenship able to speak several languages.
In order to achieve that, it is very important for there to be a change in mentality.
Our society was formed under the influence of Jacobinist states.
Most European states are unilingual officially, and this is a remnant of Jacobinism.
However, this is not a true reflection of the facts.
The aim of the European Union is not to maintain this point of view, but to preserve genuine plurality and work towards citizens being able to speak several languages.
We need a European language policy.
That policy should promote multilingualism, improve the language skills of European citizens across the European Union and preserve all languages, whether or not they are official EU languages.
To this end, the budget and European programmes must support not just the main languages, but all languages, in order to improve diversity.
In this way we must make a special effort to support endangered languages.
Every language is good for mankind, and if a language is lost we have all lost something because each language has its own unique expressions.
It is for this reason that we must preserve genuine plurality and true diversity.
In this sense, it is necessary to draw up a full report on the actions still to be developed.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Joan i MarÃ­ for his excellent report on the Commission communication relating to a new framework strategy for multilingualism.
Not only the framework strategy, but also the report has been drawn up in the spirit of diversity and unity.
That should be the leading line in our implementation of policies in this area.
I am sure we would all like to see a multilingual European society in which the rate of individual multilingualism steadily increases until every citizen has practical skills and at least two languages in addition to their mother tongue.
That is the famous 'Mother tongue plus two' formula agreed by EU leaders in Barcelona in 2002.
I recently set up the internal multilingualism network in the European Commission and established the High Level Group on Multilingualism.
These are both implementation initiatives under the new framework strategy for multilingualism.
Another priority is to develop early language learning.
If we want to build a multilingual society we have to start as soon as possible.
We have to ensure that language learning in pre-school and primary school is effective, for that is where key attitudes towards languages and cultures are formed.
The new lifelong learning programme will offer a wide range of funding possibilities for projects promoting language awareness, for access to language learning resources, as well as for networks contributing to the development of language policies.
For the first time the education and training programme has, as a specific objective, the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity.
For the first time also, a transversal action will support multilateral projects and networks in that field.
These are new opportunities open to all the languages spoken in the European Union.
Let me now say a few words on the European indicator for language competence.
That was one of the subjects in another recent communication from the Commission.
The first meeting of the advisory board took place just two weeks ago, at the end of October.
The experts attending the meeting, representing 22 countries, showed much interest and consensus on taking forward the establishment of that indicator.
I am pleased to note that the report by Mr Joan i MarÃ­ recognises the Commission's efforts to promote language learning and linguistic diversity in the European Union.
The report contains a thorough analysis of our framework strategy to create a multilingual society and acknowledges our commitment to achieving the objectives stated in our communication.
I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his inspiring report, and would stress that the Commission is determined to pursue the ideas and actions set out in this new strategy for multilingualism in our Union.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the debates on multilingualism and on the protection of regional and minority languages and the use of languages in the European institutions always lead people to adopt firm positions, which are sustained by underlying political conflicts.
This own initiative report, which, let us remember, is aimed at implementing a new framework strategy for multilingualism, has the virtue of extending the debate that was already begun with the Ebner and Bayona report in 2003 and the Portas report in 2005, on regional and minority languages and on the learning of languages by immigrants.
Parliament is thus called upon to confirm its previous positions or to amend them in view of the changing situation, for fear of contradicting itself.
We tried hard, during the course of our work, to strike a balance that was acceptable to all parties, as was reflected by the outcome of the votes in committee, and, in doing so, we took account of the acquis, and also put the issue of multilingualism into perspective.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to act wisely and not to fight the wrong battle.
Languages must be the link between the citizens of Europe, not the weapon used to create divisions and to sow discord.
My country, Luxembourg, is the only Member State, the only founder country, whose national language is not recognised as an official European language.
Yet, the government of Luxembourg has decided not to request official language status, as it believes that multilingualism is our future.
We were given language and intelligence in order to listen to each other, not to fight each other.
Sixty-five years ago, on 10 October 1941, the people of Luxembourg had to take part in a referendum organised by the Nazi occupiers, for which they were asked to specify their race, ethnicity and language.
Their response to the three questions was: Luxemburgish.
As punishment, they were forced to enrol in the occupying army and deported to the concentration camps.
The fact remains that, after the war, the generation of victims accepted the fact that German, together with French, was the main language taught at school.
Luxemburgish has successfully developed and is doing well.
As for our future, I hope that Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which requires the Union to respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity, protects us from any arbitrariness.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased that a framework strategy has been put in place for multilingualism in the European Union.
Our motto, 'United in diversity' is a testament to the importance of the diversity of cultures, of customs, of beliefs and also of languages, to the construction of the Union.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights has made respect for linguistic diversity one of our fundamental values.
This principle does not just apply to the official languages, but also to the many regional and minority languages spoken within the Union, including those of immigrant communities.
This rich co-existence of different linguistic communities in Europe sometimes leads to extreme difficulties within the day-to-day working practices of the Community institutions.
Despite the fact that all languages are of equal importance from a cultural point of view, it makes no sense to take the view that the European Union's institutions could operate if it were using all of them at the same level.
I believe that progress on the promotion, defence and knowledge of this linguistic diversity must be supported by the Member States by means of active policies for promoting and defending languages in education and in the more social realm, including in the media, and the promotion of the learning of at least two foreign languages, with a view to facilitating knowledge of other cultures, promoting mobility and increasing awareness amongst the European citizens.
Finally, within the Community institutions, it must be possible for communication between the citizens and the Union to be carried out in their mother tongues.
Furthermore, in order to make the use of mother tongues compatible with the day-to-day work of the institutions, we must establish different uses for the different languages and it is in this area that we must work towards agreeing on the basic criteria to use in order to reach a consensus on these working languages, without forgetting any element, either cultural, the number of speakers or the status of the languages in their respective States.
I hope that the new Commissioner responsible for multilingualism, Mr Leonard Orban, agrees with this idea and will work in that direction.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome the Commission's first communication dealing with multilingualism and setting major objectives for the European Union's linguistic diversity: to promote language learning and a beneficial multilingual economy, as well as to provide all EU nationals with the opportunity to familiarise with the Community laws and other information in their mother tongue.
Today, the European Union represents 450 million people from various ethnic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds.
Therefore, the benefits of foreign language knowledge are obvious.
Language helps to understand different lifestyles and opens a door to cultural tolerance.
Moreover, language competence helps in work, study, travel and communication anywhere in the world.
Foreign language learning should start at a very early age, when the human brain is most receptive to taking in new information.
This is my firm opinion as a medical doctor.
Thus far, various surveys show that almost half of respondents admit to knowing only their native language.
Thus, we have a long-term objective that cannot be postponed.
At least 84% of Europeans agree that each EU national should know at least one foreign language.
Consequently, we have great support from the society, the importance of which is increasingly acknowledged when adopting laws in the European Union.
On the other hand, we must not forget the old European languages, of which my native Lithuanian language is one of the oldest.
I would like to emphasise the importance of preserving such languages in the context of European linguistic diversity.
We should not only learn foreign languages, but also keep in mind another challenge - preserving and cherishing the old European languages by legally ensuring their rights.
I see the multilingual European as an educated person, who is able to live in a country other than his or her native land and who speaks foreign languages for professional reasons, and is willing to undertake further study.
Sadly, quite a large part of the European society still fails to benefit from multilingualism, and the motivation of citizens to learn foreign languages is not very strong.
We should promote that by any and all available means.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to use my one minute of speaking time to express my full and explicit support for the report presented by Mr Joan i MarÃ­.
If the Union wants to be true to its slogan 'United in diversity', it must give multilingualism pride of place, going beyond just the official languages.
Just as protecting biodiversity is and must be a central value in our current societies, the protection of linguistic diversity must be seen as a central element of progress, the promotion of peace and development.
Given that many of today's armed conflicts are the results of violations of cultural rights, linguistic rights and identities, it is urgent that we look upon promoting multilingualism as a tool for promoting dialogue, understanding and peace.
Though this is important in the world in general, it is particularly important in a European Union which aspires one day to move on from being a Union of values to being a political Union.
Promoting multilingualism in Europe therefore means wealth and progress.
Opting for monolingualism, however, will make us poorer.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the draft resolution on the new framework strategy on multilingualism deserves particular attention, as language is the basis of a nation's culture and a resource that we must make use of.
That is the reason why we pay close attention to all attempts to interfere in multilingualism in the European Union and react to all attempts to restrict it.
It is with satisfaction that we accept the initiative to set up a European language competence index, but on condition that this initiative covers all official EU languages, and will not be restricted in undertakings and in studies to five languages only.
For these reasons, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I tabled an amendment to Article 6 deleting those sections that detract from the idea of multilingualism and which allow the possibility of restricting studies just to five particular languages.
I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, because otherwise this document which is so important and so essential for multilingualism, will not reflect the full intentions and tendencies that inspire us.
(ES) Mr President, one year ago, in its first Communication on multilingualism, the European Commission set three entirely reasonable objectives: to promote language learning and linguistic diversity, to promote a multilingual economy, with the resulting improvement in work mobility and the competitiveness of the European economy, and to provide all of the citizens with access to information on the Union in their own languages.
Everybody is aware of the close relationship between this Communication and the general European objective that we set at the Barcelona Council in 2002 of ensuring that children learn at least two foreign languages in addition to their mother tongue.
It is precisely this that the report that this Parliament will vote on tomorrow must deal with; offering the 450 million European citizens a wide range of tools to allow them to learn languages and hence to enjoy the immense social, economic and cultural advantages of participating in our great integration project, a project rich in national histories, languages and cultures, which today represents a dream of unity in diversity, benefiting all of the citizens.
The rapporteur's opportunistic attempt to use the report to make nationalistic proposals in his own personal interest is entirely inappropriate and entirely undermines the purpose of the Communication.
In this regard, we should welcome the result of the work carried out by the Committee on Culture and Education, which has shown responsibility and good sense by using its amendments to redirect the initial text and its ideologically biased approach.
The rapporteur's radical intentions are demonstrated by the fact that he has ended up voting against his own report in committee.
Respect for diversity is one of the Union's principles, but using languages to split up States along ethnic and linguistic lines is an outrage that we in the Group of the European Peoples Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats will always vigorously oppose.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, in the Middle Ages, my home city of PÃ€rnu, like the other Hanseatic cities, traded with Russia, Germany and the Scandinavian countries.
Every merchant had to know the four local languages.
I concur with the idea that pervades this report - Europeans should know two other languages in addition to their native tongue.
Language proficiency considerably accelerated the Estonians' reintegration into Europe after the Soviet occupation.
The ability to understand one another's language and culture will help Europe's sense of cohesion to overcome problems caused by the expansion of the European Union and by immigration.
There is an Estonian saying - the more languages, the more lives.
In the European Union, many people live many lives.
People go to other Member States either to work temporarily or to live permanently.
Many of the Member States' significant national minorities became established in the post-World War II era of reconstruction.
My mother tongue is one of those European languages that are spoken by one million people.
The report emphasises that small languages must be protected.
I would like to add that they must be protected not only from the major languages of the European Union, but also from major languages from beyond Europe.
Here I refer to Russian.
By offering the motivation to learn in addition to language learning, we would alleviate the problems that have been very clearly identified by second- and third-generation immigrants in Germany, France and the Baltic States.
They are far from the land of their birth, and they are also unable to participate sufficiently in the culture and life of their new homeland due to their poor linguistic proficiency.
In such conditions, the costly efforts to enable official business to be conducted in major languages from beyond Europe are counter-productive, even detrimental.
While language learning is the most important means of integration, it is also time-consuming, and must be embarked on as early as possible.
(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the new framework strategy for multilingualism, I welcome the conclusions aimed at supporting and respecting linguistic diversity, which is a founding principle of the EU, especially in view of the shortsighted tendency to cut the number of working languages on the foolish grounds of wanting to reduce the amount of money spent on interpreting and translation services.
Yes, support for multilingualism is an important factor in cultural, economic and social integration, but is not, and has never been, the major factor in solving the social differences and problems that unfortunately continue to exist.
I should also like to emphasise and lend my backing to the view that in its language policy the EU must adhere strictly to the principle of solidarity, as it should in other areas.
We cannot allow language policy to become a source of conflict among the EU Member States or the general public, which is indeed a genuine possibility.
. - (LV) I doubt whether adding another 60 languages to the 21 European Union official languages will achieve the goal of true multilingualism espoused by the rapporteur, since it is not possible to give equal weight to the role of the Welsh and the Russian languages.
Experience shows that languages which are used more widely and in a more economically active way 'devour' small ones.
Just let us imagine that Russian were to become an EU official language.
I am almost certain that we would not have long to wait before Latvian and Estonian would no longer be used in general, not only in the European Union, but even in Latvia and Estonia.
Before we tackle multilingualism throughout Europe, we ought to set an example in Parliament itself.
How much motivation do interpreters have to learn the languages of small Member States?
How long will we have to wait before, when you arrive at Strasbourg, the heart of Europe, the border guard speaks to you in a language other than French?
I am convinced that we need to begin by strengthening the official languages of the small EU Member States, leaving minority languages policies to the Member States to deal with.
In the future, the European Union will continue to be a union of states and not of ethnic groups.
Thank you.
(PT) Mr President, leaving aside a number of proposed amendments, which I shall be voting against tomorrow, this report in its current form broadly enshrines appropriate principles, which have been acquired over the years, and in particular since 2000, which was named European Year of Languages.
Yet the application of some of these principles is dependent on what the subsidiarity rule will allow.
Whilst it is true that everyone has the right to their mother tongue, it remains true that in practical terms applying this principle to the letter, over and above the official languages, would hamper the entire running of the Union's institutions.
Moreover, we must prevent the use of what are referred to as minority languages for the purposes of nationalist extremism.
The issue of extending the European indicator of language competence is also addressed.
In its current form, it is only for measuring competence in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.
This system must not mislead us into fostering the widespread learning only of these five languages.
I say this not only on the grounds of the necessary balance and legitimacy but also because the projection of European languages outside Europe is a highly important factor in an era of globalisation, not to mention the historical, human and cultural dimensions of these languages.
The Portuguese language - and you will appreciate why I give this example - is, of all the EU languages, the third most widely spoken around the world behind English and Spanish, and ahead of German, French and Italian.
Consequently, as in Written Statement 58, to which I was a signatory, I welcome the principle introduced in this report of ensuring that the European indicator of linguistic competence covers all of the Union's official languages, and, should it prove feasible, all the remaining languages spoken in Europe.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Joan i MarÃ­, on his report and its contents.
I am very much in favour of supporting multilingualism and, in particular, the lesser-used languages.
I will not speak in my native language, Irish, this evening.
However, at the beginning of next year, in two part-sessions from now, I will be able to do that with the support of Parliament's services.
I welcome that and look forward to it.
It gives meaning to the phrase 'unity in diversity', which has been used so much here this evening.
The lesser-used languages of Europe are as important, if not more so, than those which are widely spoken because we must support and strengthen them.
That is why I believe we can look forward to unity and cooperation through a common strengthening of our languages.
I would like to express my thanks for this discussion in support of multilingualism in European institutions, an issue that is significant both for individual countries and for our Community as well.
There are several important principles that always define what we are.
As part of our culture, languages are not only a technical instrument, but are also important bearers of our heritage, and as a cultural phenomenon they deserve respect and recognition.
This is a very important responsibility of the Member States in particular.
Therefore, it is essential to take a proactive approach to the teaching and use of languages.
Through the programme, the European Commission has created opportunities for the continued support of multilingualism, including minority or regional languages.
The European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (EBLUL) has been a partner, offering opportunities for other activities within the framework of the new programme.
The same applies to the language research network, MERCATOR.
Let me remind you that the first piece of secondary EU legislation adopted in 1958 concerned languages.
This was just the beginning, and it is extremely important that languages play their crucial role at this stage of European integration as well, a role that is not only political, but also cultural and, of course, economic and social as well.
In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to observe that I am to be the first Commissioner in the history of the EU to be responsible for multilingualism as a separate policy and that shortly, subject to your consent, the entire sector will become autonomous, in collaboration, of course, with other sectors.
Moreover, another colleague, the designated Commissioner from Romania, Mr Leonard Orban, will be joining us.
He can be of help not only in promoting this policy but also in ensuring a strong commitment to the development of multilingualism.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(FR) There was a time when all humankind spoke one language and used the same words.
However, according to the biblical account of the Tower of Babel, people tried to build a tower that could reach the sky and put them on an equal footing with God.
To thwart this plan, God multiplied the number of languages so that people would no longer understand each other and would disperse across the Earth.
With this report on multilingualism, Europe is implementing an 'anti-Tower of Babel' project, insofar as it intends to promote and develop minority languages.
In order to gauge the importance of multilingualism, we really must understand what it is all about.
Cultural and linguistic diversity means showing respect for cultural identity, traditions and religions.
By promoting the integration of a European society in which there are many different types of knowledge, Europe is implicitly acknowledging that language learning is a crucial factor in people's ability to communicate amongst themselves.
Multilingualism is also an opportunity for the future, and it has become Europe's duty to safeguard it for its citizens.
Faced with globalisation, which encourages monolingualism, the more linguistic diversity is recognised, the less we will be able to fall back on our identities.
(PT) Today is a very special day for those European languages, like Portuguese, that are spoken around the world, because the European Parliament is acknowledging the significant role that they play.
Recitals E and F and paragraph 3, which I proposed, enshrine the major strategic importance that we should attribute to languages like Portuguese within the framework of European multilingual policy, since they have the particular quality of facilitating direct communication with other parts of the world.
This resolution recognises the fact that Europe cannot close in upon itself, but has to deal with the rest of the world and needs to address its ability to communicate globally.
Certain languages are invaluable tools for it to do so.
By recognising the true value of languages like Portuguese that are widely used around the world, the resolution has provided a better balance and greater strategic value.
It paves the way for demands that the teaching and learning of languages with this potential should be more actively promoted; indeed, they should be promoted as the second, third or fourth languages for people in the EU to learn.
I am grateful to my fellow Members for their support, to the rapporteur for her openness, and particularly to our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, for her willingness: her help was crucial in completing this initiative so successfully.
The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the European Union's generalised system of preferences.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I am happy to share with you further reflections on the GSP+ scheme and the philosophy behind it.
It is an important EU development tool: it contributes to economic progress in developing countries and the reduction of poverty, while taking on board the enduring need for promoting core human and labour rights, as well as sustainable development and governance principles.
One of the key priorities of EU trade policy is to be consistent with and to consolidate the objectives of development policy, in particular the promotion of sustainable development and good governance.
This goal has been given greater prominence in the GSP+ scheme, which aims at encouraging developing countries to comply with international standards relating to social rights, environmental protection and governance, including the fight against drugs.
It is worth recalling that the criteria on which the granting of GSP+ is based are objective and transparent and have been made public in the regulation itself - this is in line with our WTO obligations.
The success of the GSP+ scheme is that it provides an incentive for the applicant countries to ratify key ILO conventions in order to comply with the criteria of the GSP+.
It has played an instrumental role in the case of El Salvador, which deposited the ratification instruments of the missing ILO conventions on 6 September 2006.
The ILO supervisory committees reported that most of the GSP+ applicant countries have made substantial changes to their legal systems in order to comply fully with the rights enshrined in the ILO conventions, which was the precondition for being granted GSP+ trade preferences in the first place.
The GSP+ system is an instrument of encouragement and support.
It cannot solve everything at once; its role is to give an incentive, as I say, not to punish, and to maintain the momentum of reform.
The aim is also to integrate the GSP+ beneficiaries into the world trading system.
I am convinced that integration into the world trading system will further help these countries to advance towards greater respect for the principles enshrined in the conventions and to lock in essential reforms.
Following the ratification of these conventions, it is clear that actual implementation then needs to be monitored.
Progress in the implementation of the GSP+ conditionality is assessed in relation to developments in government policy, to administrative capacity and other institutional, legal and budgetary constraints.
Some of these can only improve over time.
Regarding monitoring, the EU relies in its judgments, in particular with regard to the initiation of any withdrawal procedure, on the monitoring procedures and expertise of relevant specialised monitoring bodies, such as the ILO, for which the EU itself cannot be a substitute.
However, we also have our own role to play in the proper application of the GSP system.
Therefore, whenever the Commission receives information from trade unions or other stakeholders about serious and systemic systematic violations of relevant international standards, it thoroughly examines whether appropriate action in line with the GSP regulation may be taken.
This is well coordinated, with relevant monitoring bodies, and Parliament should be regularly updated on developments.
I would like to stress the important role the European Parliament and parliaments in the relevant countries can play, both in monitoring the situation and in helping to bring forward implementing legislation in the countries concerned and ensuring its effective implementation.
Let me say to Members of this House: your interparliamentary contacts are very valuable for sending this important message and I am ready to engage in an even closer cooperation with you with a view to this end.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Generalised System of Preferences has proved its worth, as it actively supports countries in their efforts towards sustainable development and good governance.
We trade with these countries and also negotiate with them on equal terms.
We open up our markets to them, which also gives rise to competition - only in the medium term, if need be.
In other words, it is in our own interests, too, to ensure compliance with the rules and conventions of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization.
In this respect, we fully support the Commission's endeavours.
We also ask, however - and the Commissioner has already indicated that he is prepared to do this - that the Commission keep us informed on a regular basis.
This relates to, firstly, its observations on the implementation of the various regulations in the beneficiary countries, secondly, any sanctions pursuant to Article 16 and, thirdly, a mid-term review of the effectiveness of the GSP+ rules.
GSP+ should put us in a position to provide support whilst also benefiting from trade with these countries.
At the same time, we should take account of the legitimate interests of our economy and labour market and strike a balance between these two objectives.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with Commissioner Mandelson's statement and, as rapporteur for the report on the generalised system of preferences, I would also stress the importance of GSP+ as an incentive to commit the more vulnerable countries to sustainable development and good governance.
I take a positive view of the Commission's decision of 21 December to grant benefits to fifteen countries that requested it and the steps taken subsequently by countries such as Colombia, Venezuela and El Salvador, ratifying important ILO conventions.
With regard to the functioning of the system, I would like to mention three fundamental issues.
Firstly, the aim of GSP+ is to promote, amongst other things, human and labour rights through trade.
This association is essential and must not be squandered.
Trade must provide an incentive in terms of human and labour rights.
We must ensure that protectionist tendencies do not undermine this aim.
Secondly, in order to ensure that the system is successful, the number of benefiting countries must be increased.
One of the Commission's priorities must be to ensure that that number increases significantly, since those countries currently represent just 3% of the world population.
Thirdly, the effectiveness of the system must be guaranteed, by ensuring that it is applied intelligently, with the participation of the European Parliament.
It is important that the Commission cooperate with the benefiting countries in their efforts to meet their commitments, by means of various initiatives and, in particular, by strengthening the rigorous and regular control and assessment of their implementation, transparently and with the participation of the main social actors and benefiting countries, as stated in Parliament's report.
Furthermore, the sanctions provided for must be applied in the event of serious and systematic violations of the principles.
Those violating them must be punished, but not operators who are fulfilling their commitments properly.
Finally, as the motion for a resolution reiterates, the Commission, before the next review of the Regulation, must carry out a study to assess the impact of the system, to analyse its operation and to lay the foundations for the reforms carried out.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the GSP scheme was designed to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the world trade their way out of poverty.
There is not a fixed list of countries that fit into that category.
Where the GSP is a success, a country may graduate to a new relationship with the EU.
However, not all movement is upward: some countries, through circumstances entirely beyond their control, may now be in a worse position than when the scheme was renewed.
Pakistan is such a country.
Despite the backing of this House, Pakistan was denied GSP+ status by the Council, at a cost of 300 000 jobs and GBP 40 million a year.
Tragically, less than six months after the GSP scheme came into force, Pakistan and much of Pakistan-administered Kashmir was devastated by an earthquake that the World Health Organisation claims eclipsed the tsunami in terms of destruction and human suffering.
The major impact of the earthquake in the north-east of the region caused large-scale displacement of Pakistan's skilled and unskilled labour force.
They have traditionally provided a significant part of the workforce for the whole of Pakistani industry, notably in textiles.
Many were left homeless, without spouses and with children to care for.
Over one year later, they have been unable to return to paid work because they have been waiting for financial grants to rebuild their homes.
As a result industrial wages have increased, driving up the cost of production and dramatically effecting Pakistan's competitiveness.
Whilst the EU is always very generous in terms of the aid we offer to those countries in need, our pockets are not bottomless.
We must revise the GPS in order to make sure that we not only help the poor trade their way out of poverty, but also help the hopeless trade their way out of the rubble of disaster.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, in order to be credible and genuinely effective, we have to demonstrate that the GSP+ scheme is working properly.
In other words, the EU must act swiftly and decisively when there are infringements of the social or environmental standards in question.
This is not merely a theoretical or academic discussion, but a very real discussion about real countries.
The case of El Salvador has already been raised.
In fact, El Salvadorian workers have for years seen incredible resistance by their own Government, company owners and the right-wing media to try to avoid, or at least delay, the implementation of core labour conventions, and it is very unfortunate that an EU Member State, Spain, has seemingly supported them in that attempt.
However, the fact that the El Salvadorian Government has recently ratified four key ILO conventions is not the real victory it might seem, because by reforming its civil service laws the Government has actually succeeded in removing large numbers of workers from any possible benefits of those ILO conventions.
That is totally unacceptable, and I therefore formally ask the Commission to initiate without delay an investigation into the situation in El Salvador and to consider a temporary withdrawal of GSP preferences.
I would be happy to furnish the Commissioner with further details from the trade union groups and civil societies in El Salvador.
Colombia is another case of blatant violation of workers' rights, despite the window dressing of official enshrinement of ILO conventions.
The monthly and often weekly reports of trade union members 'disappearing' and being killed tell the true story of the blood toll paid by those who dare to assume that ILO rights officially adopted in theory will actually be respected in practice.
We cannot wait until December 2008 before we review these cases.
I ask the Commission to review them now.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, the Generalised System of Preferences, GSP+, is a good system that grants privileges to countries in the developing world in respect of their access to European markets, which is an enormously positive thing.
There, are, however, a number of strings attached.
It is right for Commissioner Mandelson to say that these countries should first and foremost be given encouragement and support.
Nonetheless, situations can arise where it is not enough to provide encouragement and support and where, in addition, there is a real need to tighten up on monitoring and perhaps use the tools available if the conditions in the conventions on workers' rights, and the like, are not met.
We know that infringements are taking place today, and we therefore want the Commission to tighten up monitoring and, where necessary, use the tools available to temporarily suspend offending countries.
When such steps are taken, we would further desire the involvement of Parliament in the process, so that we can give our views and work together in order to make the system work.
This must happen now.
As many other speakers have pointed out, it is also important to carefully review a few points before we evaluate the system in 2008, namely: has the system worked in every respect, what shortcomings does it have and what do we need to consider when we renew the system?
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the Council regulation of 27 June 2005 reforming the system of preferences that has been in force since 1971, the European Union has chosen to simplify and enhance its principal trade instrument for supporting developing countries.
Thus, three systems shall apply from now on: the general system, the Everything but Arms system - which is a tool adapted to the specific characteristics of the least-advanced countries - and, lastly, the GSP+.
The additional preferences granted under this last heading arose out of the firm belief that development can be considered only in close conjunction with the democratic process and with respect for human rights, labour law and the environment.
Fifteen countries are currently benefiting from this mechanism, which both encourages and rewards those developing countries that are most vulnerable and that make the most efforts in these areas.
However, if the GSP+ is to genuinely contribute to better governance and to greater respect for the environment, human rights and employment, it must be managed effectively, and that means, firstly, warning countries that are not fulfilling their commitments - of which there are still many - and, above all, making routine threats so as to effectively do away with the preferences granted to those who seriously and systematically violate the ILO conventions and who do not honour their commitments.
Next, it is vital that a regular assessment be carried out to ensure that every country benefiting from the GSP+ is honouring its commitments.
The assessment must be particularly exhaustive with a view to the renewal of this instrument at the end of 2008.
Our credibility and the effectiveness of this instrument depend on what legal experts call the principle of congruent forms.
These preferences cannot continue being granted to countries that are politically incapable of fulfilling these commitments.
The same goes for the future of this policy.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I shall try to save you some money by making three points.
First of all the Commissioner certainly agrees that we need to maintain high standards of surveillance and invigilation and we intend to do so.
We have done so in the case of Belarus and have submitted proposals to the Council accordingly.
As regards Pakistan, granting privileges in trade requires us to keep within the rules that create those privileges and that is what we are doing and what we have done in respect of Pakistan, but I entirely accept the honourable Member's view that we must do everything we can within those rules to give assistance to Pakistan.
As far as El Salvador is concerned, yes, I entirely accept that having granted GSP+ status, we must now monitor, on the basis of reports of international bodies, the effective implementation of the two ILO Conventions in El Salvador, and it is our clear intention to do so.
In accordance with Rule 103(2), I have received six motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.30 a.m.

Services in the internal market (debate)
The first item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal market (10003/4/2006 C6-0270/2006 2004/0001 (COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Gebhardt).
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today reaching the end of a debate that has been going on in this House for more than two years, on the subject of the services directive.
I believe that we can be entirely happy with, and proud of, the work we have done on this issue.
I am not, of course, the only one to have worked on this matter.
Many of my fellow Members have played their parts in ensuring a constructive collaboration.
Allow me to just name a few people I would like to thank as a way of thanking all those who ensured such a positive collaboration.
Thus, I would like to thank my colleagues Mr Goebbels, Mr Swoboda, Mrs van Lancker and Mrs McCarthy, as well as Mrs Thyssen from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Jonckheer and Mrs RÃŒhle from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
All of them have made great contributions to our success.
There is, however, one person I would like to single out, and that is the shadow rapporteur from the PPE-DE Group, Mr Harbour.
(Applause)
I would also like to express thanks on behalf of Mr Schulz, who asked me quite specifically to do this yesterday evening, for the constructive cooperation he has experienced, as it was neither easy to create a common text, given the differences of opinion that are represented in this House, capable of achieving a broad consensus and without leading to divisions between Parliament and the citizens of the European Union, nor could it be taken for granted that this feat could be accomplished.
This constructive collaboration can also be seen in the text that we are debating today.
It led to there being a symbiosis between the interests of employees and consumers and those of the economy.
We have succeeded, with this text, in making a real contribution towards putting people more in the centre of politics.
In my opinion, it is essential to our future work in Parliament that we should make it abundantly clear that we are shaping politics around the people, around the citizens of Europe.
The economy is important, stability is important, but the most important thing of all is the people on whose behalf we make policy.
With this common text that we have created we have succeeded, through the removal of the country of origin principle, for one thing, in protecting the rights of workers, namely labour law, social law, consumer protection and other important issues relating to rights, and in ensuring that we have a positive regulation.
It was very important for us to have ensured that the rights of employees were advanced, thereby averting an unhealthy competition between the social systems of the Member States.
By deleting Articles 24 and 25 we ensured that the services directive does not affect or jeopardise the Posting of Workers Directive, and that we were able to work well together on this area.
By removing quite significant elements of the services of general interest from the scope of the services directive, we have ensured that a solution was found to a truly enormous problem.
This is in the light of the fact that this services directive is in fact, of course, a directive for commercial services, a fact which means that health services and social services, which have totally different requirements due to the special interests involved, do not fit within the scope of the directive.
We have not, however, merely done something for employees; we have also ensured that there are gains from this services directive for the economy, the service providers.
We have ensured that the free movement of service providers across borders has been made much easier.
This we have achieved by means, for example, of having actually codified the principle of the freedom to provide services, of having made it crystal clear that protectionist measures in the Member States must be abolished and that single points of contact are available in order to help service providers to move around the European Union.
There are still a couple of points that we need to debate in Parliament and they are points that we have already debated.
I believe that the Commission can provide an important answer to these questions today.
Specifically, it can clear up a couple of points that are absolutely fundamental for us, relating, in particular, to labour law, social security entitlements, criminal law and the orientations that the Commission is to provide under the services directive and that the Commission, as far as I am aware, will not be using in order to undertake to provide interpretations of the implementation of the services directive, but rather to ensure that the services directive represents an aid to the Member States.
Interpretation of the texts is a task for the Court of Justice and not for the Commission.
The Commission has understood this and that is something we can very happily live with.
Mr President, I now very eagerly await the statement that the Commission is about to give.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, Mr Gebhardt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as earlier speakers have already said, today we are making internal market history.
For almost three years the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been engaged in painstaking, ambitious work on the Services Directive.
To be perfectly frank, the work has not always been easy and progress has sometimes been slow.
We can take comfort in the fact that there is a stronger feeling of consensus here in the House today than ever before during the drafting process.
The directive represents a major European reform.
No wonder, then, that there have been numerous obstacles along the road to the agreement.
There have been genuine differences of opinion on its content as well as the occasional slight misunderstandings.
Although today we all want to look to the future, I would nevertheless like to raise one or two matters that arose during the drafting process.
Firstly, I wish to remind everyone of the vote in Parliament last spring, the result of which might be seen as a historic compromise.
Parliament managed to arrive at a compromise, in what was a very challenging political situation, which enabled the proposal for a directive to move on to a subsequent and successful drafting stage.
In this connection, I would like once again to thank the European Parliament for this compromise, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, the Chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs McCarthy, the shadow rapporteurs and numerous other Members who have worked so hard to find common solutions.
Six presidencies of the Council have been involved in the difficult task of drafting the directive.
For Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency now, the situation at present is at once a welcome and demanding challenge.
The Finnish Presidency has been able to take advantage of the results achieved by former presidencies, especially the Austrian Presidency.
The Council's common position since last spring has given the Presidency a strong mandate to take this matter forward.
A lot of work also went into the Council's adoption of its common position and it involved a considerable amount of flexibility and a genuine desire for compromise.
I also especially appreciate the fact that the European Parliament has shown sensitivity in the matter of a common decision here too and the added value which comes with that.
The Commission's role in the drafting process has also been crucial.
When the debate in Parliament and in the Council has been at its most vehement, the Commission has, in accordance with its fundamental role, endeavoured to use constructive arguments to take the drafting process in a sustainable direction.
Commissioner McCreevy today mentioned some delicate issues in the directive, on which the Commission has been required to adopt a position.
Speaking on behalf of the Presidency, I fully support and acknowledge the Commissioner's message, and the need for a declaration and its content.
The Commissioner's personal role during the complex drafting process was exemplary in terms of its objectivity and the way it respected the opinions of both institutions.
One result of this lengthy drafting process is that the proposal for a directive has now in many ways changed during the debate.
The common objective and intention to develop the internal market has nevertheless remained unchanged.
The directive will open a number of doors, both to service providers and, at the same time, the receivers of services, be they consumers or businesses.
The Services Directive does not, however, represent an end to the development of the internal market in services.
On the contrary, the directive is a unique step forward in the development of the internal market in viable services.
It has become clear over the last few years that provisions in the Treaty are not enough by themselves to regulate with absolute clarity the internal market in services, which is the real heart of the Union.
I believe that the Services Directive will provide market actors with just the sort of legal security that they have been waiting for for so long.
This is the directive's greatest added value.
The Finnish Presidency of the Council warmly welcomes the fact that today only some of the amendments are to be voted on.
Of these I would like to mention the three amendments relating to comitology introduced in the plenary debate.
I can confirm the Council's acceptance of these, and in this respect the Council is able to amend its common position.
With regard to the other amendments, I hope that the common position will remain unchanged.
Mr President, I hope that Parliament will take a final and definite decision on the Services Directive today in the plenary part-session.
Then the objective regarding the agreement shared by both institutions, the European Parliament and the Council, would be realised at second reading.
(Applause)
Mr President, it is my belief that, with the official statement from the Commission, the last legal uncertainties in relation to particular aspects such as, inter alia, labour law and social security legislation, have been cleared up.
I now therefore feel able to recommend to the House that it should adopt the Common Position as presented to us by the Council of Ministers without making any amendments, excepting of course the three amendments relating to the comitology procedure on which we have agreed among ourselves.
I think that we, in this House, have performed very well, and I would like, once again, to thank the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for having accepted our text almost unaltered.
There is one more point I would like to make, however, and it is one that is just a little unpleasant.
I would like to recommend to the present and to future Presidencies of the Council that they should desist from the sort of behaviour we have seen from them thus far.
It is not acceptable for the Presidency to constantly repeat during a second reading that it is not possible to discuss the issue further and for it not to accept amendments that Parliament wants because a fragile compromise has been achieved in Council.
A similarly fragile compromise was brokered in this House too, and it is important to ensure that the rights of Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission are given full expression in the course of codecision.
For this reason, the way things have come to pass on this occasion cannot serve as a template for future legislative processes.
I have accepted it this time because 90% of Parliament's text was adopted and because we in this House did not suffer any great losses.
This will not always be the case, however.
When that happens, the Council must not say 'no' and insist that no more discussion is possible on this issue.
That is not constructive cooperation and I truly hope that this will be an isolated example and that, in future, we will again be able to enjoy normal cooperation in the codecision process.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, this is an important day for European citizens.
I emphasise that because sometimes when we talk about concepts like the internal market we forget that we are engaging people at the heart of what goes on and in our political work here.
This directive is about improving the standard of living of all citizens in the European Union and encouraging growth and dynamism in the economy.
It is as fundamental as that.
What is so important about this directive - and sometimes we perhaps forget this during our big debates - is that it has actually been the result of painstaking work by the Commission, to whom I would like to pay tribute.
It addresses the deep frustrations that businesses, particularly small enterprises, have faced in exercising their rights under the single market.
That is what this directive is all about. It is extremely detailed in its provisions.
It has directed at the Member States no less than 40 specific measures to take down barriers and 65 provisions to improve their procedures.
Now it is up to the Member States.
It is they that are going to have to deliver and we are going to be keeping an eye on them to make sure they do deliver.
I particularly want to single out the fact that for the first time we have a specific requirement on Member States to promote the single market in relation to their businesses, to encourage businesses to take advantage of the single market in the services sector and go out and trade crossborder.
The single market is a shared project of all of us.
It is not decided here, it is actually decided out there in the Member States.
We can do our best and this directive is a major step forward in achieving that.
A notable thing about this directive is that it has been good politics.
Why do I say that?
Because it has been the product of a lot of constructive and detailed argument: long debates and votes in committee, because different sides want to reinforce their position, negotiation and compromise.
It has been good politics, and at the heart of it has been Mrs Gebhardt.
She was generous enough to pay tribute to me and I want to say to her that it has been a pleasure to work with her.
It has been a challenge, sometimes, because she has been a very determined leader in pushing this forward, but I think that what we have done together will be good for European citizens.
However, it is not just we who worked on this, but all the members of our committee, and others as well.
I particularly want to thank my own team on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, many of whom will be speaking shortly, but we also worked very closely with our Liberal colleagues, particularly in the crucial vote that the Presidency was kind enough to mention earlier on.
They will speak in more detail now.
I want to conclude with my thanks to the Federation of Small Businesses in the United Kingdom and say two things to the House today about the importance of this directive.
The first one is that small and medium enterprises represent nearly 90% of the services sector. They are crucial to this proposal.
Secondly, if every small business in Europe created one more job, we would have dealt with the problem of unemployment in the European Union.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, naturally, I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - and particularly Mr Goebbels, who unfortunately cannot be here today.
As rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt has steered the ship of the Services Directive skilfully through many stormy waters.
I should also like to thank my fellow Members from the other political groups, however, particularly the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Although, of course, our differences of sociopolitical view remain, I believe that we have fulfilled our responsibility to present a tangible solution that is acceptable to the European public.
I am particularly obliged to Commissioner McCreevy, without whom this process could not have been structured so well, and to the Council Presidencies - particularly the Finnish, but also the Austrian Council Presidency.
I would ask the Council to bear in mind that the Austrian Presidency created a precedent when it invited us MEPs to a Council meeting.
This should not remain an isolated case; the possibility should definitely be left open in other contexts, too.
I also wish to thank the European Trade Union Confederation for holding such intensive consultations with us and also making it possible to arrive at a compromise on this.
I was born at the point where the former East and West met - between Vienna and Bratislava - and so I am aware of the fears, but also the hopes, associated with an internal market for services.
If nationalism and protectionism are now gaining ground once more in many of the transition countries, and also many of the 'old' EU Member States, one of the reasons may be that people are overwhelmed by the speed, sometimes even the brutality, at which this internal market is being established.
That is why it was so important to find a way to establish this internal market - which is needed - whilst also doing justice to social considerations.
After all, politics at EU level consists not only in removing the obstacles to an internal market - that is part of the story - but also in creating the political framework conditions for rendering this internal market acceptable to the people.
For these reasons, my group will give the Directive its wholehearted support.
Naturally, we have some reservations - which will be presented later - but, on the whole, my group supports this good compromise that has been reached.
We should have the courage to endorse this compromise today and champion it externally.
Once again, sincere thanks to Mrs Gebhardt.
