However, by restricting the number of days that ships may be at sea, the impact of total fleet capacity on fish stocks is reduced.
In this way the capacity of the fleet at sea on a particular day is within the norms laid down.
Such a scheme makes it possible to modernise and improve the safety level of the fleet.
If we are unwilling to limit the catching capacity of the fleet, nature will do it for us.
In the peripheral regions too, we must treat the riches of the sea that we have been given sensibly.
Mr President, the report on agricultural products from the overseas territories does not appear, on occasion, to take into account the rules of globalisation and free trade, which are, moreover, advocated by the European Union.
Although it makes some good proposals, such as the increase in government funding for investment in agricultural holdings, this report comes up against some sizeable obstacles.
The first of these is the WTO and its declared ambition to reduce subsidies and direct funding for farming. We would thus sacrifice bananas from the West Indies and the ACP countries, in order to please the American multinationals, with the introduction of a solely tariff-based system in 2006.
The second obstacle is the enlargement of the European Union, which will deprive the overseas territories of a proportion of the Structural Funds. The third obstacle is the bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that undermine the principle of Community preference and the fourth obstacle is tax harmonisation, which endangers dock dues and the advantages associated with the remoteness of these regions.
There are measures, however, for saving agricultural crops in the overseas territories, which are not mentioned in the report. These include bringing back Community preference, the strict application of safeguard clauses, favouring high-quality produce through designations of origin, guaranteeing tax advantages associated with the insular nature and remoteness of these regions, the application of export refunds for processed products and the checking of imported goods to avoid fraud and corruption.
Only at this price and under these conditions are we able to protect our traditional tropical products.
Mr President, it is nice to see the Commission respond in a positive manner to the desire of Member States to introduce flexibility into the management of the Structural Funds, from which the outermost regions can benefit in order to take account of their specific handicap.
Increasing the existing ceilings for the contribution of some Community funding is, therefore, a positive step.
On the other hand, some of the restrictions introduced by the Commission must be removed.
It is, therefore, imperative that the increase of the FIFG level be applied to shipbuilding activities, which are essential.
In the same way, in the field of co-financing, it is crucial not to impose the same strict rules on the outermost regions as on the continental territory of the European Union.
The effect of these provisions is extremely disadvantageous, particularly for the communities of the overseas territories on account of their recurrent budgetary difficulties.
Although the rule of co-financing can be retained, it certainly must be modified.
It seems to be all the more necessary to make these rules more flexible because the threats to the economic systems of the outermost regions and to the overseas territories are multiplying.
Some types of funding can be threatened overnight, as in the case of the banana crisis with the United States.
With the regional integration of the Caribbean islands into the Americas' free trade area looming in 2005, the overseas territories will have to contend with unfair competition from their neighbours.
Mr Lamy' s 'Everything but Arms' initiative will destabilise rice, sugar and banana production.
Since this provision is non-reciprocal, it will lead to unfairness.
The overseas territories will therefore have to import goods duty-free from the neighbouring LDCs, whereas the reverse will not be possible.
The LDC countries in the Caribbean will be able to ban European exports from the overseas territories using the negative list system.
It is therefore essential that structural aid granted to the outermost regions, even if not in itself sufficient, should benefit from special rules in order to allow European countries to make up, at least partially, for their structural handicap and the threats that they will face in the coming years.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, I would like to speak briefly in this debate to highlight the great importance of structural policy in the fisheries sector and the need for it to be flexible in order to be adapted to specific situations, which is demonstrated today in this debate.
I would like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs, including those who are not part of the Committee on Fisheries, such as Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, to whom I extend the congratulations, but I would like to focus, as is logical, on those who belong to our committee, Mr Poignant and Mrs Fraga, for the great skill of the work that they have presented to this Parliamentary sitting and for the strong support that they have achieved in our Committee on Fisheries.
In the case of the report by my colleague Mr Poignant, we must welcome the inclusion of Article 299, item 2, of the Treaty as a legal basis and as an essential starting point for a new concept of the true dimension of the concept of outermost regions and for adjusting the ceilings for assistance.
Our committee recently visited the island of RÃ©union on the initiative of our colleague Margie Sudre and I think that we all came back convinced of the need to help with generous solidarity to solve or at least to alleviate the specific and difficult problems that these very remote European territories have.
In the case of the report by our colleague Mrs Fraga, we should also thank our committee for its unanimous solidarity in supporting the initiative to extend assistance to 31 December of this year for a specific sector that is so affected by the failure to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
The timetable for the European Union to approve a specific plan for those affected by this lack of agreement means that this extension is needed as a margin in order to carry out the plan without worsening the already very heavy impact that there has been.
I only hope that both the Commission and the Council will take note of the unanimous position of the European Parliament.
Mr President, the European fisheries sector is, ladies and gentlemen, going through an upheaval.
These are difficult times for fisheries and here today, as proof of this, we are debating the extension of FIFG aid for the fleet that was fishing on the Canaries and Saharan Bank until a conversion plan is implemented, as the rapporteur of this report, Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, has explained to us.
The European media are already saying that the Commission plans to allocate EUR 142 million, charged to the flexibility instrument, to this plan, but I, like the sector itself, have too many doubts about this, which I would like Mr Fischler to clear up for me.
Does using the flexibility instrument not limit aid to just one budgetary year, while the proposal from the Spanish government, which was for multi-annual assistance, would be much more appropriate for dealing with these people who have been removed from the fishing ground where they habitually fished?
The Spanish government justified its plan and quantified it at EUR 540 million, 240 from the FIFG and 300 of additional funding.
Can the Commissioner explain to me why this is not being done?
Commissioner, as you were at the Council meeting in Nice, could you explain to me whether what was agreed there on the conversion plan for this fleet included aid for the economic regeneration of the areas affected or whether it was purely limited to aid for scrapping, aid for shipowners and fishermen?
The sector affected, which is a large sector, has more questions than answers about its future.
What is going to happen, for example, with the FIFG Regulation, which establishes that the aid that shipowners receive for temporary inactivity cannot be combined with subsidies for scrapping and that therefore, if they want subsidies for scrapping, they are going to have to return the aid for inactivity that they have already received?
The sector wants to know whether this conversion plan for the fleet is going to be debated at the Council of Ministers on 18 June, whether the aid is going to be extended equally, as this report proposes, to shipowners and workers, or if it is only going to be for the latter, whether you have received the conversion plans from the governments concerned, the Spanish and Portuguese governments, and when are you, Commissioner, going to present your proposal to the European Parliament and the Council?
Finally, in the Commission plan, whether funds are going to be included for the economic diversification of the areas, because in my opinion, simply redistributing and redirecting FIFG funds already allocated to the Member States, Commissioner, is taking from one mouth to feed another.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the nine proposals for regulation that have been submitted to us today represent the first wave of measures adopted for the outermost regions following the entry into force of Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Even if the Commission has not yet addressed all of the requests made by the Member States, these new proposals are particularly important and open up the way to greater changes.
With regard to the structural measures, we can take satisfaction from the fact that the Commission is proposing to raise Structural Fund assistance rates and the public subsidy limit for the outermost regions, even though the aim is really to enable these regions to regain funding levels close to those in force in the previous programming period.
Nevertheless, I am sorry that the increase in these rates only target closed investment categories.
The consequence of this will be to impose a major limit on the scope of the measure and, ultimately, to prevent the outermost regions from matching their situation in the 1994-1999 period.
With regard to the revision of the agricultural chapters that have been submitted, we should emphasise that this is part of a very limited budgetary context, which is having a very powerful effect on the content of the measures and their scope.
I must remind you that the total appropriations for the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the overseas departments (POSEIDOMs) have been reduced by 25%, falling from EUR 46 million to EUR 35 million in the 2001 budget, whereas the financial forecasts for funding the reform stated that the financial requirement for 2001 was EUR 55 million.
Without going into detail on the proposals, which are, on the whole, a step in the right direction, it is crucial that Article 299(2) should be kept as the legal base for this text and that the continuity of these measures is guaranteed in order to compensate for the delay by the Commission in drafting them and to prevent any interruptions to funding.
Lastly, with regard to the proposal for a regulation on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), the special rates for fleet renewal and modernisation measures must be applied to ships of up to 16 metres in length.
This is a fundamental issue for fishing in RÃ©union.
I would ask you to support these proposals and the two amendments that I have re-tabled.
Mr President, the POSEI programmes were proposed more than 10 years ago as aid instruments for what we now know as the outermost regions.
In the three versions for the regions and departments of France, Spain and Portugal, the POSEI were designed and implemented as an expression of the political will of the Council and the Commission to stimulate the development of these regions, which are among the most disadvantaged in the Union due to their remote and island nature.
With the inclusion of the new Article 299.2 of the Treaty, the outermost regions now have a sound legal basis that has enabled the Commission to propose these new POSEIs.
In the budgetary context defined by the stability agreement reached in order to allow Economic and Monetary Union, the financial statement proposed by the Commission complies strictly with the criteria of budgetary neutrality.
I must say that practically all of the additional spending is compensated for by the savings as a result of the reform of Agenda 2000.
Despite all this, the Commission' s proposals respond to their desire to fulfil the commitments that have been gradually made over recent years, as is the case with cattle and milk production in the Azores or the inclusion of tomato production in the Canary Islands, to name just two examples.
There are still, of course, a few aspects left to resolve, such as the case of some products, especially in the agriculture and food processing industry, within the specific supply arrangements for the Canary Islands, which will have to be resolved as part of the decisions to be made in the Management Committee responsible, given that if the conditions envisaged at the moment were maintained, the result would be unsatisfactory.
Mr President, as Commissioner Fischler is going to have to speak immediately, perhaps I could ask him to pay attention to me so that he can prepare his speech.
I would like to congratulate you and thank you for the Commission' s interest in the outermost regions and express the general satisfaction of the Members of this House.
I would also like to thank Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez and congratulate him on his work.
Above all, however, I want to point out three or four amendments to Mr Fischler that are of particular importance.
I am referring to Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92, concerning specific measures for the Canary Islands and, specifically to Amendments Nos 29 and 34, aimed at including aid for non-municipal public forests, and Amendment No 158, also concerning aid for non-municipal forests.
I think that the Spanish authorities were mistaken in not requesting this aid at the time and now they must do so.
I am also referring to Amendments Nos 126 and 127, which aim to protect local industry in the Canary Islands and, finally, the amendments aimed at protecting the Canarian tomato, which could encounter serious difficulties in the new phase of drawing up a Community policy that applies in Mediterranean countries. Also the proposed measures to support wine but to remove aid for imports to the Canary Islands of table wine and liquid milk, which could enter into competition with Canarian products.
In short, I think that we have a good proposal from the Commission and some good reports by Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez.
The European Parliament should adopt these proposals, which, incidentally, have not been amended at all in Parliament, as I think that the majority of Members consider that the text adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a positive one.
I hope that the Commission will be able to take into account at least some of the main amendments, which I have just pointed out.
Mr President, honourable Members, may I start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their detailed and constructive reports on the complex subject of outermost regions.
I should like, if I may, to quote a few statistics on the disadvantages of these regions.
Six out of seven of the outermost regions have an average per capita income of between 40 and 55% of the European average and are hence among the lowest in the Union.
The unemployment rates in five of these regions are among the highest in the European Union at between 21 and 37% of the working population.
The first proposal relates to contributions by the Structural Funds.
The maximum contribution by the Funds in outermost regions - and this is new - has been set at 85% of overall eligible expenditure.
The maximum contribution of the Funds towards investments in small and medium-sized enterprises has been increased from 35 to 50%.
The second proposal concerns the regulation on developing the countryside under the second pillar of the common agricultural policy.
The ceiling on the EAGGF contribution towards eligible investment costs has been raised from 50 to 75% for investments in farm holdings and from 50 to 65% in the processing and marketing sector.
In addition, aid will also be granted for woods and areas belonging to the local, regional and national public sector in the future.
The proposal also makes provision to increase certain financial contributions under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance.
All the additional expenditure incurred here can be financed from the budget approved for the 2000-2006 planning period.
I am delighted that Parliament supports the Commission proposals in principle and that we enjoyed such constructive discussion in the various committees.
I can agree with many of the proposed amendments, provided that we find the right wording.
They include the amendments increasing maximum aid rates to 65% for the entire foodstuffs industry and to 75% for SMEs, on condition that investments for sectors and enterprises comply with certain target specifications, to be decided at a later date.
They also include the amendments increasing agri-environmental measures in the agricultural sector and the three other flanking measures to 85% and doubling the maximum amounts for agri-environmental measures in the sensitive areas of Madeira and the Azores.
I also agree that these measures should enter into force with retroactive effect from 1 January 2000.
However, the Commission stands its ground on the legal basis.
Article 299(2) should only be used for derogations from the Treaties or general legal principles.
Now to the agricultural part of the POSEI programme.
Having evaluated aid regulations on the basis of past programmes, it is clear that previous measures have, by and large, had a positive impact, although there has been repeated criticism on certain points.
The Commission's proposals have been drafted in the light of both these evaluations and this criticism.
So what are the most important considerations?
First, the present framework for specific supply regimes and specific aid for local agricultural production should be simplified, consolidated and improved.
Secondly, the specific supply regimes must be strengthened because their objective, that is, to bring production costs in peripheral regions into line with costs in the rest of the Community, is still valid.
Thirdly, the list of products has been revised and a number of feedingstuffs have been included on the list.
Fourthly, we want more competition between supply sources, which is why we have introduced the principle whereby aid must reflect the costs of transport from the European mainland.
Fifthly and finally, the common organisation of the market in milk and in beef and veal needs to be revised in order to harmonise the three POSEI regulations.
The Commission's stand on the proposed amendments is based on the principle of budgetary neutrality, which must be maintained in all cases.
Nonetheless, expenditure on the three POSEI programmes can be increased to EUR 204.4 million between now and 2005, with the same breakdown, as this proposal is covered by savings.
The Commission can therefore only agree to proposed amendments which impact on the budget if they are offset by equally high savings.
I shall finish, if I may, by listing the points on which I can agree.
I can agree to a specific supply regime for the French departments for products from all third countries, that is, not just from developing countries and other overseas departments, and to the fixed deadlines for the entry into force of certain articles of POSEIDOM which guarantee continuity and facilitate trade between the Azores and Madeira in products which come under the supply regime.
The conversion of vineyards planted with hybrid varieties can be continued in the Azores and Madeira under certain circumstances.
Promoting imports of fattening cattle could be included in a comprehensive programme to promote cattle breeding on the Canary Islands.
Finally, the transitional regulations should be strengthened in order to guarantee continuity.
Again, I cannot agree to apply Article 292(2) here.
Now briefly to the fisheries reports.
I shall confine myself here to the proposed amendments; obviously you know what they are because you are about to vote on them.
The first two proposed amendments concern the legal basis.
As the same legal basis must apply to the whole package of measures, the Commission stands by its proposal to apply Article 37.
Article 299 should only be used in order to make provision for derogations from the Treaty, which is not the case here.
I can accept the third proposed amendment.
Amendments Nos 4 and 6 concern problems with fish and flags of convenience.
These problems were raised during the debate.
We are in full agreement with you here and I expressly welcome the fact that Parliament has a clear position on this matter.
We would prefer, however, to resolve this problem when we next amend Regulation 27/92, which we are already working on.
We shall be sending a proposal to Parliament and the Council within the next few days.
As regards the fifth proposed amendment, a broad majority in the Council is in favour of a compromise solution on this question.
A compromise would be acceptable to the Commission, because the fleet segment in question comes under the heading 'small coastal fisheries' and we want to avoid adverse repercussions, especially as artisanal coastal fisheries do not represent a danger to stocks.
In Amendment No 5, you suggest that action to renew and modernise the fleets in question should be included and that national and Community investment rates should be raised for the entire fleet.
We cannot accept your Amendment No 5 because we feel that we should not keep on promoting the overcapitalisation of the EU fleet.
I can accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8.
Then briefly to Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez's report.
This proposal is the first in a package of measures ordered by the European Council in Nice.
Today's proposal meets one of the specifications set in Nice, namely to extend the current aid regulation to 30 June.
The Commission will be adopting the second measure in the package ordered by Nice in June as well.
This proposal for a Council regulation will contain a series of derogations from the provisions of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance and will propose specific measures for which additional funds will be earmarked.
However, as this proposal will not pass through the Council until the autumn, we can agree to your proposed amendment extending aid to the fishermen and shipowners in question under this proposal until the end of the year.
I think this is justified for social reasons.
I hope that, despite the noise here, anyone interested in hearing my report and my position has been able to do so.
Thank you.
Mr President, I understand that at the beginning of today's sitting a point was raised about the travel office and the fact that the current staff are to make way for a new company.
I would like to make it clear that the Quaestors were not consulted about this change.
They should have been, and an undertaking was given that they would be before a tender was awarded, but they were not consulted.
I have managed to speak only to Mary Banotti so far, but I can assure you that we will take this matter up.
Mr President, in relation to the point that you raised after Commissioner Fischler had spoken.
I feel the noise in this Chamber is an absolute disgrace.
I know all the Presidents try desperately to stop it.
I suggest the presidency look at possibly having a five-minute break between the end of Commissioners' statements and the vote.
We cannot continue to allow Commissioners to be treated this way.
I entirely agree.
Something needs to be done about it.
It sets a disgraceful example.
I do not know what the people in the public gallery must think of this House.
VOTE
Thank you, that was clear and helpful.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0163/2001) by Rolf Linkohr, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Communication from the Commission on the European Union's oil supply (COM(2000)631 - C5-0739/2000 - 2000/2335(COS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Report Hughes (A5-0196/2001)
Thank you very much, and please pass on my regards to your mother.
Mr President, I would like to use my explanation of vote to explain my voting on the Hughes report.
I voted against all the amendments.
In my opinion these amendments have nothing to do with safety at work, road safety or health aspects, but instead were only a question of making the position of small and medium-sized self-employed hauliers more difficult.
We already have Regulation 3820/85 on driving and resting times which also regulates suitable driving and resting times for small haulage businesses.
This directive talks about total working hours and I find it appalling that the European Parliament is trying to regulate the total working hours of the self-employed in their own businesses and I voted against all these amendments.
Mr President, in the debate yesterday a number of speakers from remote parts of the Union drew attention to the potentially severe effects that this new law would have on outlying places.
Mr Hudghton, for example, drew attention to the problems of drivers coming from the Hebrides onto the mainland of Scotland and then onwards.
Ms Kauppi made similar points as I recall about Finland, and other colleagues made points about Portugal.
We were told that during the debate that the intention is to provoke a conciliation and obtain a compromise position between the Commission and Parliament at conciliation.
I voted as I did in the hope and expectation that the Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee will take proper and full account of the very severe problems of remote parts of the Union in relation to this law.
We voted for limiting the working hours and the driving time for so-called self-employed drivers, a category whose existence has until now been one way of getting around the law in this area.
We also condemn the fact that rest periods are excluded from working time, which means that the driver is not able to use this time as he wishes.
Furthermore, it is unacceptable, having stated that 'if night work is performed, the daily working time shall not exceed eighthours in each twenty-four-hour period' , you immediately add that this period may be extended to 10 hours, as long as the average of 8 hours is respected in a longer reference period.
It is unacceptable for an 'average' working time to be calculated, since accumulated tiredness on any given day, beyond the 8 hours, is not relieved by a monthly or annual average, with the risks that this implies for the safety of the driver and of other road users.
. The UK Conservative Delegation voted against the Hughes amendments for the reasons set out in my speech in the debate.
However, we voted in favour of my Amendment No 23, calling for a thorough Business Impact Assessment to be carried out and published within three years of the adoption of this Directive.
We did this in spite of the frankly outrageous comment by Commissioner Palacio at the end of the debate yesterday that 'of course' she could not accept this amendment as it would be an unreasonable administrative burden!
The Hughes amendments, if adopted by Council, would place further burdens on the self-employed and on SMEs.
It is therefore particularly important that the impact on such businesses is clearly identified and thoroughly assessed at an early stage, so that further revision of the Directive can be considered.
. (PT) The European Commission proposal is unacceptable in that it excludes self-employed drivers, since this puts important objectives in the common transport policy at stake.
The system it proposes will create conditions of unfair competition, jeopardising the objective of road safety and not helping to encourage quality of service.
The position adopted in the Hughes report is thus of the greatest importance, and we therefore voted for it even though the proposals we presented during the debate have not been fully incorporated.
It is essential, as we have maintained, that self-employed drivers should be included immediately within the scope of the directive to be adopted, or at least this should happen in the very near future.
This will be the only way to ensure that road safety is encouraged and to prevent unfair competition.
. (DE) The fundamental objectives of this recommendation are to increase road safety, guarantee a minimum standard of health and safety for those working in the sector and establish equal conditions of competition with other transport operators.
The common position adopted by the Council fails to take proper account of these objectives, especially on the following points:
the inclusion of self-employed truck drivers
the exclusion of employees in haulage companies based outside the EU
the definition of the working times and standby duty
the definition of night work
Although we realise that accepting the recommendation would lead to difficult negotiations with the Council, my group voted in favour because:
1. Self-employed truck drivers need to be included within two years of the transposition of the directive in order to resolve the problem of bogus self-employment so as to get round restrictions on working times.
2.
The working times of self-employed truck drivers must include not just the time at the wheel but also the time needed to check the vehicle, do administrative work, run the business etc., because otherwise rest periods are too short, thereby jeopardising drivers' health and lowering road safety because numerous serious accidents are caused by overtiredness.
3.
The definitions of standby duty, night time and night work must take account of social aspects.
4.
All truck drivers must provide proof of the time spent at the wheel, irrespective of whether they are employed or self-employed.
. (NL) Labour is still a commodity.
It is attractive to employers if they can get their employees to work at the times that involve the least costs.
They prefer drivers on the road who can be called on at any time of the day or night, all through the week. Sometimes twenty consecutive hours, and at other times five times a day for a couple of hours.
This helps them avoid having to take on more people to share tasks.
However, the result is that people become stressed and over-tired, cause more accidents and scarcely manage to maintain a private life.
Only a well-coordinated campaign by government and trade unions can help put a stop to this.
Now that road traffic is becoming increasingly international in nature and cheap Eastern European companies with poor conditions of employment are trying to capture a portion of the market in the European Union, there is an increasing need for measures.
Above all in the field of cross-border problems there is an urgent need for measures on a European scale, but the Council has been sabotaging those measures for two years and even now only wants a toned-down version.
It is good that the rapporteur wants to continue the main thrust, and calls for measures to prevent large transport companies avoiding their responsibility by offloading commercial risks onto their unprotected freelance drivers.
As representative of the Swedish Christian Democrats, I am choosing to support the second reading for the organisation of the working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities, since this is important, especially from the point of view of road safety.
However, I have decided to vote against the report on the following points: the proposal that the employee be informed at least 24 hours in advance, the proposal that time spent next to the driver is to be counted as working hours and the proposal concerning a maximum working time of eight hours when driving at night.
This is based on the position that a good balance must be found between road safety and reasonable terms for entrepreneurs.
Report Skinner (A5-0156/2001)
As you know, Mr President, I am the national secretary of the Pensioners' Party in Italy, and therefore I represent pensioners.
Unfortunately, many pensioners, including young ones, are such because they have had accidents at work.
I therefore applaud this report which seeks to reduce greatly accidents at work caused by working at a height.
This is a scourge which afflicts the whole world, especially Europe and, within Europe, the countries where people work hardest, and so I think this is an example of how important it is that Europe should produce Community legislation to govern these activities, which cause so much harm and so much grief in our Europe.
Just as at the first reading, we have abstained from voting on Mr Skinner' s report concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work.
This is an area in which the EU should not have such a great influence.
Our basic attitude towards the European Union is positive.
European integration provides an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close to those affected as possible.
That is why we are actively driving forward the issue of a constitution for the European Union, in which the division of responsibility is clear to everyone.
It must be absolutely clear to all citizens that the EU is only to be engaged in the matters at which it is best - cross-border issues.
We are convinced that the EU is not the best level for legislation concerning, for example, how steps are to be used in work above ground or floor level.
National requirements must be allowed to decide how structures are to be erected and how work is to be carried out.
For us, it is important that the EU instead concentrate on a small number of areas in which it can really do some good.
This is not one such area.
Detailed regulation is not the right way.
Consequently, it cannot be the task of the EU or the European Parliament to establish rules on the gradient of steps, how they are placed in relation to buildings or the fact that they must not rest on a slippery surface.
However correct and well-intentioned this may be, it cannot fall within the competence of European politics.
The European Parliament must effect this demarcation by showing restraint in what it applies itself to and seeks to have decision-making competence over.
The reasonable solution would have been a directive under which the Member States have a duty to take appropriate and sufficient measures to ensure a certain level of safety in the workplace.
A common market should have certain minimum rules and common aims in order to achieve better health and safety at work.
However, it is reprehensible to regulate in detail at EU level how these aims are to be achieved.
We Swedish Christian Democrats see it as a high priority task to work for a clearer division of competence between the EU and the Member States.
The EU' s legislation must be kept free of detailed regulations, and new legislation must take the principle of subsidiarity into consideration.
EU directives should essentially aim to establish goals, not to rule on details and describe the way to achieve those goals.
Let the Member States themselves decide how rules and regulations on workers' health and safety are to be elaborated so that the required aims of the directive are achieved in the best possible way.
Certainly, European parliamentarians - like national politicians - are expected to master a number of subject areas and to relate to a wide spectrum of political issues. Rules on the anchoring of, and support system for, steps can hardly be amongst these, however.
. This report, which culminated in the common position, promotes health and safety for all workers across the EU who have to work at heights on temporary equipment.
It is a law which is both employer-friendly as well as efficient at directing attention towards the 'safety culture' and practices required to save lives and reduce injuries.
The Labour Group has sought at all times to reduce any unnecessary burden on business whilst at the same time to promote the most effective and practicable of solutions that can be realised by legislation.
Report Sterckx (A5-0208/2001)
Mr President, it is important that today in the European Parliament we have been able to adopt at first reading the so-called Erika II package, the name of which reminds us of the sad case of a vessel that sank at the end of 1999, a year and a half ago, causing a great tidal wave and considerable consequences on the coast of north east France and its marine environment.
With this second package, the European Commission has put forward regulations to establish a European Maritime Agency and a compensation fund for damage caused in European waters by oil pollution, and to establish a Community monitoring and information system on maritime traffic.
In order to do the latter, vessels under Community flags and others that stop over in ports in the Union will be obliged to be equipped both with automatic identification systems (transponders), so that the coastal monitoring stations can automatically identify them, and with voyage data recorders (black boxes) to securely store information on position, movement, physical condition, control and checking.
All this is essential in order to solve accidents and, above all, to prevent them, if it is used with appropriate monitoring.
The Member States, for their part, will be obliged to develop ports of refuge and safe anchoring areas, for vessels that are in distress, and also coastal monitoring stations, which the vessels would also be obliged to provide with the updated report on their safety condition, drawn up by the classification society responsible for inspecting it, all of which is following the adoption of the amendment tabled by me, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
I hope, Mr President, that this second package of maritime safety measures will be more successful than the first and will be accepted by the Council of Transport Ministers, so that it can quickly enter into force and so that through it, human life and the environment are better protected.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of an improvement to maritime safety.
We have voted in favour of a European monitoring and information system for maritime traffic, for a fund to provide compensation for oil pollution and for the setting up of a European maritime safety agency.
Many pollution accidents could have been avoided if there had been better safety.
We have seen all too many accidents during the last couple of years.
There was the loss of the tanker, Erika off Brittany in December 1999, resulting in considerable oil pollution, and the loss of the Italian chemical tanker, Ievoli Sun.
Most recently, we have seen an extensive oil spill in the Baltic, which could have been avoided if we had had better European rules.
Ship owners do not think that a black box has anything to do with safety.
However, that is not the case.
A black box is very useful in the investigation after two ships have collided, as happened, for example, in the Baltic.
If we become better at discovering the causes of accidents, we also become better at preventing them.
We cannot wait for international rules in the IMO.
The EU must take the lead in the IMO by adopting better rules.
We cannot compromise on safety.
We must have safety so that fish, birds and people can use the sea without being covered in oil and chemicals.
- (FR) This directive seeks to improve the identification of ships en route to European ports and of all ships in transit in areas with high traffic densities or in areas which are dangerous to shipping and to make it compulsory for these ships to be equipped with transponder systems, by means of which they can be identified automatically and continuously monitored by the coastal authorities.
Once again, we feel that this directive presents clear advances in terms of control, but that it contains serious loopholes, particularly with regard to crews.
It is unacceptable, given what we know of the tragic situation of seamen on many dangerous ships, that examining the state of the crew' s health and physical conditions is not part of the compulsory inspections.
By the same token, the inspections must be carried out by a sufficient number of properly trained staff.
Lastly, the concept of a 'port of refuge' will only become a reality if effective facilities exist for these ports.
We shall be voting in favour of this directive, whilst continuing to work to ensure that all individuals - both seamen and inspectors - are given their rightful place, which is pride of place!
Report Sterckx (A5-0208/2001 ) and Mastorakis (A5-0205/2001)
Although we are abstaining on the Mastorakis report on establishing a European Agency for Maritime Safety, we shall be voting in favour of the Sterckx report, because it lays down practical measures to limit the risks of pollution and danger to crews' lives.
It must be emphasised, however, that it has taken disasters, particularly those caused by the oil tanker Erika and the shipwreck of the chemical tanker Ievoli Sun, for measures finally to be proposed.
What we need now is for these measures to be implemented.
No particular restrictions are being imposed to make these measures absolute obligations, either for shipowners or for charterers.
The minimum that should be done in this area is to make both groups responsible, in addition to their other duties, for any non-compliance with these directives.
Report Mastorakis (A5-0205/2001)
I was between eleven and fourteen years old, Mr President.
Every morning, since I lived on a hill in the city of my birth, Genoa, I had a magnificent spectacle in front of me: the port of Genoa seen from up high; ships sailing in, ships sailing out; many ships of all kinds waiting offshore to berth, there was so much traffic.
That is where my love of the sea and fascination with ships started.
I therefore believe that no city in Europe could represent the problems of shipping and, especially, maritime safety better than Genoa.
I hope, therefore, as a Genoese man and as a sailor, that Genoa will be chosen as the location for the Maritime Safety Agency.
If this draft regulation is adopted, it will lead to the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency.
Where safety at sea is concerned, it seems appropriate to address the issue at European level.
This agency will provide coherence for training action, for scientific and technical support to Member States to implement legislation, for the compilation of data on maritime pollution, for monitoring and for possible proposals to change current legislation.
This is a tool which will not interfere with Member States' political decisions, but which will aid decision making and monitoring.
This agency is also something that almost all operators in sea-related industries want.
Nevertheless, the role of the Commission in appointing the executive director and the members of the management board and in the agency' s management is so important that the European public, which has called for this agency to be created are in danger of being cut out of the picture.
This is why we are tabling several amendments, which seek to improve on the initial proposal.
It is quite reasonable that members of national parliaments, regional representatives and seamen' s rights and environmental protection associations should have a place on the agency' s management board.
It is also reasonable that the agency should produce regular reports on the results of its actions.
Report EsclopÃ© (A5-0201/2001)
This regulation will enable us to establish a fund for the compensation of oil pollution damage in European waters.
The oil slick of December 1999 demonstrated once again the inadequacy of compensation on offer.
Most of the victims have still not been compensated.
The proposal is a definite improvement but it is inadequate, because it does not take the idea of making both the shipowner and the charterer responsible to its conclusion.
It is an improvement because the money for the fund will be guaranteed by European businesses, which will enable the compensation to be both substantial and rapid.
The proposal contains major shortcomings, because this regulation does not establish the unlimited responsibility of polluters and does not deduct the payment from the total damages caused.
This is why we are tabling amendments.
Some of them are designed to establish unlimited responsibility: by clearly establishing the link between shipowner and flag State, and by placing the obligation on owners and charterers to underwrite unlimited insurance.
Other amendments seek to make the management of the COPE funds more transparent by means of the composition of its committee.
We shall be voting in favour of this text, but we shall continue to try to ensure that all damages are paid for out of the immense profits made by the polluters.
I wish to focus my speech on the issue of compensating the victims of oil pollution, which our House has quite rightly proposed to extend to pollution by hazardous substances.
The current system of limiting the financial responsibility of shipowners, which is an absolute scandal, and of oil-tanker owners limiting their own responsibility, under an International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF) with resources that are capped and which bear no relation to the real cost of the pollution caused, has led to tragically inadequate cover for damage suffered by victims.
It is unacceptable that the victims, or more often the taxpayers, should have to stand in, in financial terms, for those responsible for causing the pollution.
The Commission is therefore proposing the creation of a specifically European Fund (COPE), which would operate on the principle of the Member States standing in for the parties involved in acts of oil pollution.
The responsibility of each party and, of course, top of the list are the shipowner and the charterer, must be able to be clearly identified and brought to book by the victims.
We agree with the stated objectives, which are to fully compensate the victims for the damage they have suffered and to ensure that the compensation mechanisms function efficiently and speedily.
On the other hand, we are concerned at the methods proposed for the operation of the COPE Fund, in particular with regard to bringing the COPE procedures into line with those of the IOPCF.
In these circumstances, the victims risk coming up against the same problems of proving the pollution and of companies refusing to pay.
This is why, like the rapporteur, we are calling for specific procedures to be drawn up for the implementation of the COPE Fund, so that it can properly fulfil its objectives to the benefit of the victims.
Report Collins (A5-0203/2001)
From the sea, Mr President, we go up to the sky; from maritime safety we move on to air safety.
I applaud the aeroplane pilots, the aviation technicians, all the crews, the air traffic controllers and so on, who have made flying by far the safest of all means of transport.
I find this really reassuring because, ever since I have been a Member of the European Parliament, I have been constantly up in the sky in aeroplanes.
The aim of the directive which is the subject of the Collins report is to improve this safety even further, so let us have it!
A thank you to the Commission for having made this proposal and to us Members for having approved it!
. (DE) My group is delighted that the European Commission has taken account of the demands made by the European Parliament in the wake of the debate on harmonising safety standards and reporting systems in 1997 and has presented its own proposal for a directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation.
Reports on faults, defects and malfunctions, which represent vital safety information, are now mandatory in all the Member States of the EU.
At the same time, all such information is to be treated in confidence.
We all want to see constant improvements to air traffic safety, passengers, airlines, technical services and responsible political forces such as the Members of the European Parliament alike.
Especially since the volume of air traffic is expected to spiral in forthcoming years.
It is a proven fact that most air traffic accidents are caused by human error, which is why introducing a uniform system for collecting, recording, exchanging and disseminating information on dangerous or potentially dangerous occurrences in all the Member States of the Community will allow a wide variety of occurrences to be evaluated, conclusions drawn and preventive measures taken.
Systematically evaluating cases in which the wrong decision or wrong action was taken will be particularly important for staff training.
Recreating and simulating situations in which a decision is required will help to ensure that staff are better prepared and react calmly to irregularities and emergencies.
In addition, safety risks can be reduced by recording and storing any technical problems, faults or defects which occur in a database to which the safety authorities have access and by evaluating and disseminating the conclusions.
We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for a directive and are in favour of the report presented by Mr Collins and the few proposed amendments to it.
Report Busk (A5-0210/2001)
. (DE) Animal welfare is part of our basic ethical understanding.
However, we must not forget that high animal protection standards result in higher production costs in the EU, which is why we must ensure that our pig breeders are not exposed to competition from imports which do not have to comply with the same animal protection standards and are therefore able to charge lower prices.
We therefore need to prevent imports of pigmeat from third countries which do not have the same laws on animal protection and animal health standards, which is why the whole question of animal welfare needs to be dealt with during the forthcoming World Trade Organisation negotiations.
We should also consider that arrangements for animals change when new animal protection standards are introduced.
Pig breeders who only recently built pens which comply with current standards must be given a reasonable transitional period to amortise their previous investment and make changes when current rules are changed or rather tightened.
The new regulations will contain specific details on how pigs are to be kept, that is, pen sizes, the design of pens and arrangements for pregnant animals.
We must bear in mind when endeavouring to bring about changes in agricultural policy that anyone who wants better and better standards of animal protection must also bear the consequences as a consumer, that is, they must be prepared to pay more for pigmeat produced under better conditions of animal welfare.
We have a quality mark for such pigmeat in Luxembourg, for which there is a growing demand, proving that consumers understand perfectly well that they need to dig deeper into their pockets for quality agricultural products.
. (NL) Shortly, when we discuss swine fever later in the agenda, it will again become apparent that what matters in livestock farming is still more meat, cheap meat and satisfying the requirements of world trade.
Not only people and their environment but also animal welfare is sacrificed to the free market.
National rules for protection are brushed aside by great economic interests and European liberalisation.
The further liberalisation is carried, the more it works to the advantage of whoever produces cheapest.
The fact that poor working methods are used in order to be so cheap does not matter.
Pigs and chickens are shut up in very unnatural circumstances in too small a floorspace where they get in each other' s way.
That saves space and hence costs.
Quite rightly individuals and organisations have campaigned for years to highlight this fact.
For that reason it is positive that some more political interest is at last emerging in animal suffering caused by intensive livestock farming.
Every regulation that brings some improvement will have my support, although I am far from being convinced that approval of this proposal will put an end to unnecessary animal suffering.
Report Brok (A5-0209/2001)
On the pretext of helping Kosovo, this report proposes helping to privatise that country' s economy, which means, according to the examples given in the text itself, putting it into the hands of Western banks.
Our vote against the report expresses our indignation at the entire policy maintained by the Western powers, particularly those from the European Union.
This policy consists, having littered Kosovo with bombs as it did with Serbia, of making the very ruins of those countries into an additional outlet for Western capital.
The Western powers must realise that repairing what they destroyed is the least of the matter.
Only a fraction of the money spent during the war, only a part of the resources and equipment that were used, would be enough to repair infrastructures, to rebuild roads, railway and telephone lines and to rebuild the buildings and business that were destroyed.
This should be paid for by the Western powers, or more precisely, out of their military budgets, without generating private profit in the West.
For the moment, despite all the self-congratulating that is taking place, the economic balance sheet of the European Union' s action is reduced to carving up what remains of Kosovo' s economy and to putting it into the hands of Western banks and the grip of the mafias.
Report MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez (A5-0195/2001) and (A5-0197/2001)
Mr President, this is one of the most useful measures of all those we have voted on in Parliament.
Providing differential, specific aid through the Structural Funds to the outermost regions and islands of Europe, that is, the Azores, Madeira, the Canaries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and RÃ©union, is an extremely positive fact.
I am happy for my friend, Mr Fernando FernÃ¡ndez Martin, Governor of the Canary Islands, whose seat is next to mine, who will thus be able to go round the Canary Islands with greater pride in the knowledge that Europe is close to those more peripheral regions and islands of Europe.
Let us hope that this example will be followed whenever decisions must be made on the outermost regions of Europe.
We are entirely in favour of aid for overseas territories, which centuries of colonisation and exploitation by European countries have kept in an underdeveloped economic situation.
We must, on the other hand, express our reservations about the way in which the European Union is planning its aid for these regions, which it calls 'outermost' , because the aid is not intended solely for the poor communities of workers and country folk but is also intended to support interests, whether or not they are native to these regions and which have no need of aid, by promoting 'the spirit of enterprise' as well.
We are in favour of aid, but under different conditions.
This is why we abstained, but voted in favour of the amendments likely to promote the interests of the working classes in these regions.
. (PT) The European Commission proposals for the revision of Poseima fall well short of meeting expectations.
In view of the good results achieved since it was launched, the profound qualitative change that occurred with the introduction of Article 299(2) of the Treaty on European Union and the successive declarations of intention by various European Councils, one would have hoped for more.
This opinion of Parliament therefore takes on greater importance, and it is essential that the Council should accept it in its entirety.
I must highlight the proposals made by the rapporteur, Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, either on his own initiative or based on the contributions of several Members, including myself, through the presentation of 20 draft amendments to the Commission' s text, which I am pleased to see included in Parliament' s position, which has been approved by such a substantial majority.
Nevertheless, although I voted in favour of Parliament' s position, I must make the following reservations:
I cannot accept that Poseima should remain restricted to the agricultural sector and residually to the fisheries sector;
I cannot accept the 'principle of budgetary neutrality' either, which means that the spending levels proposed for the future will be less than at the start of the programme in the early 1990s (still without the article in the Treaty on European Union);
Neither can I accept the nature of the measure proposed to safeguard the principal production of the Azores: milk.
I consider the 70 000 additional tonnes allocated to Azorean farmers insufficient and I disagree with the transitional nature of the measure, in force only until 2003, in clear contradiction to Article 299(2) of the Treaty on European Union.
I hope, however, that the possible reduction in some measures has been averted, as was apparent in the text of the Commission proposal.
In this respect, I must point to the opinion approved by the Committee on Budgets, annexed to the MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez report, which addressed all these reservations.
. (PT) The Treaty of Amsterdam incorporated a legal base (Article 299(2)) recognising the need for the EU to give the outermost regions special treatment in accordance with their unique and specific reality.
This was now a 'legal-constitutional' recognition and no longer, as was the case until Amsterdam, a 'de facto' recognition, done through declarations annexed to the Treaties or instruments such as Poseima, symptomatically called the Programme of Options Specific to the Remote and Insular Nature of Madeira and the Azores.
I therefore give my full support to Parliament' s favourable opinion on a set of measures that we have just debated, presented by the European Commission, which aims to put into practice the outermost region principle.
A special mention, finally, for the proposed revision of Poseima. This is a programme that has proved highly significant in that it has guaranteed the application of important aspects of the common agricultural policy to Madeira and the Azores in a manner suited to the specific conditions of agriculture in these regions.
Poseima has thus made a significant contribution to the maintenance of our agriculture.
Poseima has also been crucial in that it includes specific measures aimed at cutting supply overheads, particularly in terms of transport, for foodstuffs for consumption or industrial processing.
The proposed revision of Poseima with the changes recommended by Parliament is highly positive.
New instruments are introduced and current ones are modified in the light of the experience acquired.
I hope the Commission will accept the changes proposed by Parliament.
. The British Conservative Delegation of the EPP-ED Group voted against the MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez report on specific measures for agricultural products for various countries.
My colleagues and I are wholly sympathetic to the special needs of the EU's outermost regions given their isolation and the problems this causes.
However, it is our view that the Commission has produced a sensible proposal to combat their difficulties and that going beyond this, as the rapporteur proposes, is not justifiable in terms of policy or budgetary implications.
Across Europe, the agricultural sector is in severe difficulties and stretching its budget further does not seem feasible at this stage.
Similar thinking instructed my delegation's decision to vote against Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez's other report on structural measures.
Report Fraga EstÃ©vez (A5-0185/2001)
. (PT) After the expiry of the fisheries agreement with Morocco on 30 November 1999, the Community fleet was left inactive.
In view of this situation, the Commission proposed a change to the rules on structural assistance with two objectives: to prolong the period for the granting of compensation for inactivity until 30 June 2001 and to allow the 4% FIFG aid threshold to be exceeded for this type of aid, because of the number of fishermen and shipowners affected by this cessation of activity in Portugal and Spain.
In this report, Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez proposes an extension of aid until the end of 2001, which I think is adequate given the uncertainty still surrounding the remote possibility of a renewal of the fisheries agreement and the delays in making available the means needed to cover the high costs of restructuring the Community fleet in the event of non-renewal. Renewal is in fact becoming less and less likely because of the stalemate in the negotiations and the conclusions of the last council of fisheries ministers.
For Portugal the situation is highly complicated since about 30 vessels and 600 fishermen are living in this constant uncertainty; therefore the extension of aid, although late, may minimise the consequences of the cessation of activity and even those of a more profound restructuring.
I therefore voted for the report.
Report Galeote Quecedo (A5-0199/2001)
(PPE-DE), in writing. (SV) We Swedish Christian Democrats wish to stress that it is important that any establishment of a College of European Diplomacy, as is proposed in Article 9, does not lead to the intention of this replacing each Member State' s own national diplomatic training.
It is important that each country' s foreign service has basic training of its own in order to be able to serve its citizens fully, especially in their own mother tongue.
Report Linkohr (A5-0163/2001)
Clear skies, swallows flying in from all around, calm seas, incredible sunshine.
Are we perhaps in Italy, Mr President?
No.
We are in Sweden, on the beautiful island of Gotland.
What, you will be wondering, has this to do with the European Union' s oil supplies?
It does have something to do with it because, last Saturday and Sunday, I was at a meeting on renewable sources of energy on this same beautiful island of Gotland, in Sweden, where 50% of their energy comes from renewable sources, like wind, the sun, biomass and so on. Well, I hope that the use of renewable forms of energy will be boosted in Europe.
- (DA) We have together voted in favour of the report, for we think it important that alternative energy sources to mineral oil be found.
However, we have voted against Paragraph 8 of the report, for we are, in general, opposed to the use of nuclear energy.
The report' s recitals maintain that "high oil prices and price fluctuations affect the poorer sectors of the population disproportionately" .
The explanatory statement also states that price increases are basically the result of speculation.
All the other factors, however, demonstrate the self-inflicted powerlessness of the European institutions, and indeed of the Member States, to intervene.
Each speculative price increase represents a huge levy imposed by some oil groups and capitalist middlemen on the population, including the poorest sections, who pay directly or indirectly.
With regard to the Member States, not only do they fail to intervene to put a stop to these increases, they also profit from them through fuel taxes, which is yet another indirect tax, as unfair as VAT, because it hits the richest and the poorest in the same way.
It is untrue that the public authorities could not ban price increases.
It is untrue that they cannot abolish tax on fuel for personal use.
The Commission is incapable of taking the measures that are required and is content to reel off hollow phrases.
We have therefore voted against this report.
The Member States must give serious consideration to becoming less dependent on energy supplies from outside the European Union.
They must do so firstly for strategic reasons, which will take on greater importance as oil becomes more scarce, more expensive and more concentrated in one part of the world, one which is not necessarily one of the most democratic.
Secondly, the problem of climate change linked to the greenhouse effect has forced us to respect international commitments.
This is why the Member States must do everything they can to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels.
In order to achieve this, one method open to us is to develop bio-fuels.
The European Commission' s proposals have not taken sufficient account of this: we are able to produce large quantities of oleaginous crops, sugar beets and cereals which can produce millions of hectolitres of fuels as a replacement for fossil fuels.
The more enlightened car manufacturers and oil companies are supporting this strategy.
We therefore feel that the Member States and the Commission must do everything they can to facilitate research, development and productive investments in bio-fuels, particularly through special tax measures. It is crucial that the Member States understand that bio-fuels must not be subject to taxes that cover fossil fuel products.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Direct support schemes under the CAP
The next item is the report (A5-0184/2001) by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common agricultural policy (CAP): direct support schemes (amending Regulation 1259/1999/EC) (COM(2000) 841 - C5-0762/2000 - 2000/0335(CNS)).
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the report now being debated is about simplifying the direct payments introduced in 1992 and then reviewed under Agenda 2000, at least at the bottom end of the scale.
The Commission's proposal allows for global payments of up to EUR 1 000 and abolishes the complicated application procedure for small farms.
We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development support this proposal but feel that EUR 1 000 is rather low and have proposed that this limit be raised to EUR 1 500, thereby allowing about a third of all farms in Europe to apply for global payments.
Of course, this varies from one country to another.
I think Mr Cunha will be addressing this point.
In Portugal the proportion is, of course, much higher.
We also suggest that the provision in Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation No 1229/99 requiring environmental standards to be observed should also apply here.
What we do not want is for global payments to small farms to be used to make savings.
If a farm claims global payment, it is not entitled to increases to compensation payments under Agenda 2000 as years go by, because global payments are based on past payments.
This means that these farms are not entitled to increases, which is why we suggest a 20% increase in global payments.
It could be argued that this 20% increase would also be justified by revising payments directly in line with increases.
We take the view that this is rather too complicated, but we do not want small farms to be punished by this regulation when payments are made.
You know all about the arguments in connection with premium payments: large, rationalised farms in Europe, wherever they may be, receive a very large sum of money for their labour force.
Given that such a small sum is paid to small farms, which also need a labour force, I think that the Commission should not be looking to make savings from this labour force and from these farms.
Commissioner Fischler, you have proposed or rather considered that farms of this size could perhaps receive up to EUR 5,000 in future under the second pillar in that, because of how they are managed, these farms help to shape the countryside in the ecological and social sense, provided that they observe certain environmental standards.
We should not therefore be looking to make savings with this regulation and from these small farms by excluding them.
Otherwise we would have to advise these farms not to claim global payment, because they are of course entitled to full payment - this does not repeal the law - if they do not opt for global payment.
This could lead to a situation in which this measure, which we feel is reasonable, is not taken up by small farms because they say, no, we want the full payment, even if it is only a very small amount.
However, because it is such a small amount and because it only affects small farms, which basically do a good job in the countryside, you should reconsider.
Mr President, I shall begin by welcoming this proposal by the European Commission, which through its timing and content aims at simplifying the procedure for small farmers applying for direct aids under the CAP.
In fact the experience we now have of implementing the CAP is that in practice it marginalises small farmers, defined in this proposal as those who have received less than one thousand euro per year on average over the last three years.
First, because aids per hectare or per head of livestock made up only a tiny part of the income of these farmers, who often have no more than five or ten hectares of arable land or half a dozen animals.
Secondly, because as a rule small farmers have to do the same amount of paperwork as is required for 10, 50 or even 100 times as much aid; sometimes they have to fill out a dozen different forms every year to get a sometimes ridiculous amount of aid.
In other words, the small amount of aid for these farmers added to the paperwork involved means that the great majority of small farmers do not feel at all motivated to apply for the aid to which they are entitled.
While this assessment of the proposal being debated is positive in principle, I should like to make three observations: the first is that I think the change approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to raise the threshold from one thousand to fifteen hundred euro seems reasonable, as it will include potentially a third of the farmers in the European Union and more than two-thirds in some countries, like mine.
It is a cautious but realistic start, which I think is both reasonable and important.
In addition, the change also approved here to increase the level of aid over the last three years by 20% is important in my view, in part because this level has not yet stabilised following the Agenda 2000 reform, and it is also yet another incentive for small farmers to apply for aid.
Certain aids, however, have still been left out, such as those for olive oil, bananas, tobacco, potato starch, etc., and I hope that these too will be included in future.
Secondly, the principle of uncoupling aids from farmers' productive options has some potential, but it cannot lead to the abandonment of the requirement for a farmer to have some effective production.
Otherwise we might be encouraging absenteeism.
My third observation is that in future we will have to consider another scale of aid for small farmers, who should receive a relatively higher rate of aid than large or middle-sized holdings, or else this aid will be ineffective.
This is fundamental.
Aid to small farms cannot be calculated at the same basic rate as other aids.
We will also have to have new bases for allocating aids, since basing them on an average amount received over the last three years excludes those small farmers who grow products that are not eligible for aid, but which from the standpoint of multifunctionality should also be entitled to it, like the others.
Mr President, the Socialist Group is pleased with this proposal because it is one step further towards simplifying agricultural policy and favours small-scale farmers.
The proposal recognises that in many instances the administrative costs of managing and processing the aid do not match the amount of aid that these small-scale farmers receive.
According to the Commission' s own data, 23.2% of farms receive direct payments of less than EUR 1 000, the amount set by the Commission as the maximum to be received under the simplified system.
However, 48% of farms receive less than EUR 2 000 and, as has already been pointed out, there is a great deal of variation within the Member States.
This indicates to us that if we want the simplified system to be effective, the maximum amount should be increased to EUR 1 500, as approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Moreover, we feel that it is unacceptable for any change to the management and payment system to be financially detrimental to those farmers with the lowest income capacity and who receive a lower percentage of aid.
We therefore support the rapporteur' s proposal that single global payments, which are calculated on the basis of the actual payments received in previous years, should be increased by 20% to compensate for the increase in future payments outside the simplified scheme.
This will prevent discrimination and the possible negative financial effects that this proposal could have on small-scale farmers.
I wish this initiative, which seems to be an experimental one, every success in its implementation and I hope that the Commission will continue to put proposals to us that move forward in the sense of simplifying the system and the management of agricultural policy, which is essential for achieving greater transparency, bringing Community policy closer to the European people and helping them to understand it.
Mr President, seldom have we encountered such a brief proposal with such potentially far-reaching effects.
The CAP aid schemes needed simplifying.
Despite the simplifications, we must guard against the risks of spoiling them or reducing their effectiveness.
In this context, what is surprising in the Commission proposal is the lack of detail in the scope of the measure and the fact that the Commission is relying on the accounting network to evaluate it.
The value of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report thus deserves recognition.
I would recall that I prepared a report and later Mrs Redondo prepared another which proposed statistical treatment of the EAGGF (Guarantee Section) payments to provide us with accurate information about the implementation of the CAP.
The Commission did not accept it at first, but then agreed to move in that direction.
I believe that if we had done that we would today have much more precise information about the subjects we are dealing with.
Returning to the subject in question, I think there are certain finer points that have to be taken into account with regard to the Commission' s initial proposal: the granting of aid without making it conditional on keeping up the activity runs the risk of deteriorating the economic fabric and creating a system of patronage in the sector, which over the last ten years has seen the loss of 30% of holdings and over 25% of jobs.
There may also be problems with this system regarding its ability to differentiate between aid for small-scale holdings and that for part-time farming.
In these conditions I believe that what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has done is of enormous value and has the support of my political group, and I would just like to say that we should have liked even more to support Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s initial proposal in its entirety and not as it ended up, as a result of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
In any case, we shall be supporting his report.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur.
I welcome the Commission proposal to introduce, on a trial basis, a simplified system for the payment of direct income support to farmers.
Although the scheme initially will apply only to farmers in receipt of small payments, it is nonetheless an indication of the willingness on the part of the Commission to respond to requests from this House, and indeed from national governments, for a simplified and less bureaucratic system of administering EU support for agriculture.
Since farming systems on most family farms are broadly similar, the principle of averaging payments over a three-year period seems to be reasonable and fair
However, the Commission should clarify the procedure in relation to the application of penalties within that averaging system.
The proposal will result in less paperwork for farmers and a more cost-effective system for administration by national governments.
I support the Agriculture Committee's view that the upper limit should be increased by 20%, and agree with many of the comments made earlier by Mr Cunha.
I hope that the maximum number of eligible farmers will opt to participate in this scheme and that the experiences gained will lead to its extension to other farmers in the future.
Given that many small family farms are under pressure and that there is a reluctance on the part of young people to take up farming as a career, I believe that the upper ceiling should be at a level that will encourage small-holdings and those dependent on farming for an income to continue operating.
I am pleased that the qualification has an environmental requirement.
There has been an enormous improvement in the environmental profile of the rural of countryside, resulting from farmer participation in the rural environmental protection scheme and the environmental requirements of a reformed CAP.
This is a very useful proposal that certainly should be encouraged, and I thank the Commissioner for bringing it to the House.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, on behalf of the Liberal Group I thank the Commission and the rapporteurs for this excellent work which does not seek only to simplify administration but this time also has an excellent goal from the point of view of farmers: simplifying the procedures for applying for support.
In this sense this move is a very fundamental one.
When travelling anywhere in the EU, talking to farmers, the first and only thing you hear is that bureaucracy, vast amounts of paperwork and the associated difficulties are creating a very negative picture for farmers.
This is a very important issue especially as far as the smallest farmers are concerned.
In the long term the scheme should be developed so that rural development activities are linked to it.
The scheme should also include an expansion bonus, even now in its initial stages.
It surprises me that the Commission is working on the basis of a policy whereby growth in income under the scheme would be set at a fixed level rather than being index-linked.
The rapporteur has correctly intervened in the matter and pointed out that there is an opportunity for raising support outside the scheme by virtue of the agenda solution.
I see this as a very important point.
To make the scheme attractive also to farms attempting to improve production, our committee' s proposal on raising the level of support is justified.
The level can be discussed but the principle especially on this matter is very important.
For this reason this trial, which at the moment is experimental and temporary, should receive widespread support.
Mr President, the Commission proposal misleadingly confines itself to an administrative matter which does not even merit discussion and deliberately overlooks the way in which direct Community aid is distributed to farm holdings and the worsening situation of small farm holdings.
According to the scant information contained in the report and from the farm accounting data network, 23.2% of the farms in the network are paid less than EUR 1 000 per annum in direct aid.
The actual figure is much higher if we take account of farms outside the network, which are obviously small holdings, meaning that far more than 23.2% of all Community holdings receive a mere 1.4% of total direct aid.
This item of information, which the Commission deliberately omits, proves that statements by senior Commission officials to the effect that the supposed aim of the Community budget and direct aid is to iron out inequalities between the rich and poor farming regions of the European Union and between large and small holdings are pure hypocrisy.
As a result, 20% of the large farm holdings in the European Union receive 80% of Community subsidies, as the former Commissioner, Mr MacSharry discovered to his surprise and, unfortunately, the situation is getting worse.
Because the way in which direct aid is distributed benefits large farm holdings at the expense of small farms, thereby constantly increasing the income differential between rich and poor farming regions and between large, capitalist-style holdings and small, family-run farms, because the way in which direct aid is distributed is helping to wipe out small holdings and because the Commission proposal makes no attempt to get to the nub of the problem, the members of the Community Party of Greece will be voting against the Commission proposal and the parliamentary report.
Mr President, apart from its costs, the common agricultural policy makes it difficult to allocate small farmer support to countries like Portugal, where 75% of farmers are small-scale.
Simplification of the direct support scheme has become essential, and so it is important to make progress in this field, even if only experimentally.
Parliament' s report improves the Commission proposal by broadening the scope of the simplified scheme to include farmers who get up to 1500 euro per year and also increasing aid by 20%.
However, given the characteristics of the agricultural sector in Portugal, we would have preferred the threshold of the scheme to be put at 2500 euro, as Friedrich Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf had proposed, which would ensure that many more Portuguese farmers would enter the scheme.
I therefore regret the proposal by Arlindo Cunha to reduce this threshold to 1500 euro.
Yet we must be careful that this simplified scheme is not used by the Commission to achieve other objectives, that is, in connection with a reform of the CAP: clear conditions for access to the simplified scheme must be defined in collaboration with the national governments with a view to guaranteeing that agricultural activity is maintained.
In any case, I support the report presented by Parliament.
Mr President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I should like to start by thanking you for your detailed report on this proposal.
Honourable Members, the Court of Auditors complained in its opinion on the Agenda 2000 reforms that the authorities in the Member States disburse relatively modest sums in aid to a relatively large number of farmers at considerable administrative expense.
Quite a few Member States have expressed similar views at working party meetings chaired by the Agriculture Directorate-General.
The present proposal is the Commission's answer to these complaints.
It should make life easier both for the national authorities and, more importantly, for the farmers who are entitled to use this simplified system in future.
The most important advantage for the farmers is that they will have to fill in fewer forms and the conditions which they must meet in order to obtain aid will be much simpler.
For the national authorities, the time needed to process applications and carry out controls will be cut.
I am hugely in favour of simplifying the common agricultural policy.
This proposal is a first step in this direction; it is something completely new and, having concentrated in the past on simplifying provisions which then prove to be difficult, complicated or too expensive to apply, this is a new approach, although we shall certainly continue to work on simplifying provisions already in force.
As numerous aspects of the small producers' regulations have yet to be tested, we must ensure that this is an endeavour which can initially be implemented up to 2005.
This is also why the Commission has deliberately limited the scope of the regulation to a specific selection of direct payments and set a relatively low ceiling in order to preclude any risks and ensure that it stays in the Court of Auditors' good books.
This regulation will be evaluated before the trial period ends and I sincerely hope that this evaluation will then form the basis for a more comprehensive, more ambitious, long-term solution.
Now to the individual proposed amendments.
The environmental requirements in Regulation 1259/99 will continue to apply because they are already covered in the regulation, meaning that Amendment No 1 is redundant.
The 20% increase to payments proposed in Amendments Nos 2 and 3 will, I think, cause problems.
First, the regulation would no longer be without any impact on the budget and we would have to reckon on additional costs of about EUR 100 million per annum.
Secondly, the sole purpose of the proposal is to find a simpler way of getting current aid to farmers.
May I also point out that farmers can, in any case, opt to use the average of the last three years or the previous year as a basis.
It is true that, to an extent, we are in a transitional stage.
However, this transition has closed today for all surface area premiums.
As far as beef premiums are concerned, there will be a further increase next year.
I can confirm that.
If a farmer really feels that he would lose money here, then he is entitled to file a normal application again this year and not to join the global payment system for another year.
In other words, it is not the Commission's intention to disadvantage farmers.
Nor is there, however, any justification for increasing premiums through the back door.
The Commission can accept the suggestion in Amendment No 4 to raise the proposed ceiling above EUR 1 000 but will have to reject Amendment No 5.
The decision to apply this system must be taken at the trial stage at national level when the Member States are given the opportunity to apply the small producer regulation on a regional basis.
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner a question before the debate closes.
You said we would need another hundred million.
According to the calculations in your proposal, the payments affected here - if I remember correctly - represent 1.6% of all payments.
In other words they are minute.
As Mr PesÃ€lÃ€ said, we were not looking to increase premiums, we were just trying to keep things simple.
If the Commission makes sure that it adds the additional premium increase for the farms to the global payment system, then we would be satisfied.
We are not trying to increase premiums through the back door, even though these holdings are sorely in need of an increase.
That is another kettle of fish, however.
To make savings here is out of order, however.
Given that you were so quick to work out or to get someone to work out the figure of one hundred million for you, then we would be most interested to know how much would be saved if the premium was not increased.
Because that would represent a saving and a reduction in premiums to the detriment of these small farms and I think we should prevent that.
Mr President, the Commission also takes the view that we should not be looking to make savings, but nor should we be looking to extend premiums.
As we understood the proposal, there would be an across-the-board increase of 20%, which would generate considerable additional costs here.
As I have already said, all increases in premiums under Agenda 2000 are covered here, with the exception of the last increase which is due to be applied to the beef sector on 1 July.
All the others have already been included; and the increase in the beef sector next year will not be 20%, it will be around 10%.
So if a farmer - and he has the choice - feels he would do well to wait another year before opting for global payments, then he can do so, and then this beef farmer would enter the global payment system a year later.
He has that choice and will not be disadvantaged as a result.
Our objective is not to make so-called savings and no such insinuation should be made; our objective is to make people's lives easier here while guaranteeing budgetary neutrality.
For the rest, as I said, this first step is a trial and once it has been applied for three years - no even sooner, because we want a sort of midterm review; in theory we can check whether or not things are working out once it has been up and running for a year.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Biological and toxins weapons convention
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0434/2001 by Patricia McKenna and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the Compliance Protocol for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention;
B5-0436/2001 by Pedro Marset Campos and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Compliance Protocol for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention;
B5-0446/2001 by Bill Newton-Dunn, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the Compliance Protocol for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention;
B5-0454/2001 by John Walls Cushnahan and Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the Compliance Protocol for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention;
B5-0462/2001 by Jan Wiersma and Margrietus Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the Compliance Protocol for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
Mr President, as everyone knows, the leaders of the EU and the American President are meeting in GÃ¶teborg today.
Obviously some of the things they will air are their differences about the Kyoto Protocol on the environment and global warming and about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which needs updating.
But there is another important matter, however, which has received very little publicity and to which this debate is designed to draw attention.
It is the six-year negotiations that are nearing completion to update the 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention.
The problem with the 1972 convention is that while it banned production of biological weapons it contained no means of verifying whether they were being produced on the quiet.
Despite six years of negotiation, it now appears that the new US Administration is backing off and is unwilling to support the terms that have been negotiated to date, including by its own predecessors.
In the widespread opinion of this House, the presidential elections last November did not suggest that the American people wanted a wholesale change in government policy, but favoured a continuation of the previous policy.
Nevertheless, there are now very alarming signals that the Americans may not support the work that has been done so far.
If that is the case, and if there is no final agreement on containing biological and toxic weapons, what kind of message will it send out to what President Bush calls the 'rogue' states of the world?
We cannot get involved in the negotiations but the most important thing we can do - and I hope the House will agree - is to give strong support to the EU negotiating team and say to the Americans: 'come on, sign up, we need this agreement' .
Mr President, the last century began with the widespread use of poisonous gas in the First World War, that is, with chemical weapons.
Then came the use of atomic weapons after the Second World War and the last quarter of the twentieth century, beginning with the Vietnam War, was marked by the development of biological weapons.
We have to understand that our era, with the possibilities offered by genetic engineering, brings with it the potential for appalling destruction.
Man's ability to destroy - and we are talking irreversible destruction - is increasing; at the same time, unfortunately, the international legal order is failing to keep pace and the foundation needed for the international legal order, especially common moral concepts and common ethical values, is becoming weaker rather than stronger; in other words, we have a weaker ethical basis alongside greater potential for destruction.
This illustrates just how tremendous our responsibility is, which is why we urgently need to comply with and strengthen international law and work towards multilateralism on these issues.
The USA obviously has a great deal of responsibility, as does the European Union, and we must guard against a tendency to play a part whereby, rightly as it happens in this case, we protest about the Americans but are unable or unwilling to act as an independent, powerful factor in the international play of forces.
We are quick to criticise the leading role of the USA - and I believe that this leading role is, in fact, too big.
That is not the fault of the USA, however, it is the result of political and, above all, security policy weaknesses in the European Union.
I call on the Gothenburg Summit to set the right priorities once and for all and to focus on foreign and security policy at the summit so that the European Union can at last work as an equal partner with the USA.
Then we shall be able to resolve these problems.
Mr President, President Bush' s visit to Europe is taking place partly in the context of his plans for a national missile defence system.
This is supposedly to protect the United States against attacks from so-called 'rogue states' .
To put it mildly, we are not very enthusiastic about these plans and want a multilateral approach to the threat cited by the United States.
For that matter that missile defence system will not protect the Americans against the threat of, for example, biological weapons, which can be spread in many ways.
It is ironic but also tragic that the United States does not seem to want to cooperate in the strengthening of the convention on biological weapons.
Biological weapons are easier to develop and spread than nuclear ones and the danger of these weapons can only be effectively combated with multilateral agreements and that includes an adequate monitoring mechanism for tracking those breaking the agreements.
That mechanism is required urgently.
Reaching agreement on this will mean at last another success in the struggle against weapons of mass destruction.
The political conclusion of an agreement would be that there definitely are international alternatives to unilateral action in the security field.
Mr President, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a major threat to the world.
The misuse of biotechnology for hostile purposes must be addressed straight away.
The use of biological and toxic weapons has to be tackled.
It is disgraceful that there is no mechanism in place today to verify compliance with the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention.
A legally binding protocol to strengthen compliance with the BTWC is a matter of the utmost urgency.
We would urge the States Parties to show maximum flexibility and readiness to compromise, so that a short deadline can be met and a protocol adopted before the Fifth Convention Review Conference in November/December of this year.
We would also like to see States create a stronger possible verification regime in order to curb the hostile misuse of biological technologies.
This means maintaining at the very least the measure currently outlined in the chairman's draft text.
We would recommend that the final version of the compliance protocol establish a modern and open verification regime capable of adjusting to changes in political climate and in technological capabilities.
Mr President, the Commission fully supports the resolutions tabled by the different groups in the European Parliament.
It is indeed critical at present that effective progress be achieved by the international community in the field of non-proliferation and disarmament.
As regards the specific case of the BTWC signed in 1972, the lack of a verification protocol has been a major flaw vis-Ã -vis non-proliferation in the international community.
The Ad Hoc Group was created to resolve this issue.
After five years of difficult negotiations at the Disarmament Conference in Geneva, the time has now come to conclude such a protocol.
The EU praises the commitment of Ambassador TÃ³th, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, to achieve effective progress in time for adoption of the verification protocol during the BTWC Conference at the end of this year.
The Commission hopes that all States Parties will accept the composite paper as a good starting point towards enabling the task of drafting and agreeing on the protocol to be finalised in time for the BTWC Conference.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Situation in the Central African Republic
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0431/2001 by Didier Rod and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Central Africa;
B5-0437/2001 by FodÃ© Sylla and Joaquim Miranda, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in the Central African Republic;
B5-0447/2001 by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in the Central African Republic;
B5-0455/2001 by John Bowis and Philippe Morillon, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in the Central African Republic;
B5-0463/2001 by Margrietus Van den Berg and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in the Central African Republic.
Mr President, it is a tragedy that we are discussing here. A rich country that has almost become bankrupt, State employees who do not receive their salaries, civil rights violations, attempted coups and oppression, armed conflict and hundreds killed.
We condemn the violence against the lawfully elected government, we demand lawful conditions and peaceful dialogue, and we would ask the Commission and the Council to help with humanitarian aid and to contribute to the dialogue, if that is possible.
I believe we can all agree about that here in Parliament.
However, your initial difficulties in finding someone who was here to speak about this point are highlighted by the fact that there are only about 10 Members here, and I am afraid that there will scarcely be hundreds of us here when, in a couple of hours' time, we vote on these resolutions.
I hope that you will take the matter up in the Bureau so that we can have these very important matters properly discussed at a time when both the Council and a fair number of MEPs are also present, for this way of proceeding is not good enough.
Mr President, the situation in the Central African Republic has, once again, just grown worse and several hundred people have been killed in the wake of the attempted coup and the consequent repression.
This crisis is, once again, striking a population that has suffered from tribal fighting in a country blighted for decades by a serious economic crisis, as Mr Haarder has just reminded us.
This crisis is all the more worrying because it has led to the intervention of foreign armed forces and militias, which is exactly what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
It is in danger of plunging the Central African Republic into a similar chaos, which will create even greater suffering.
Faced with this tragedy, the European Union cannot turn a blind eye.
It does not have to return to a policy of interference, but must simply not give in to the temptation of indifference.
The resolution, which is soon to be put to the vote in this House, expresses our compassion and condemns this return to violence.
The European Union has the duty to do more, by increasing humanitarian aid, of course, and mainly by closely allying itself with the efforts of the United Nations to establish a climate of reconciliation. I feel that these efforts would be made easier, to a great extent, if a corps of peacekeepers were deployed in the country, similar to the one which played a positive role between 1998 and last February.
We have suggested this in our proposal for a resolution, which the Group of the European People' s Party will give their unreserved support.
Mr President, we support the passing of this resolution condemning the repression employed by the Central African Army following the attempted coup d' Ã©tat of 28 May and the ethnic-based nature of this repression.
From its first recital, however, the resolution is concerned with the non-repayment of debt to the World Bank by one of the poorest countries on earth and by its population, which is dying of hunger.
The resolution condemns the presence of foreign armed forces, which happen to be Libyan.
How can we ignore the fact, though, that the foreign armed force that remained longest in the country, which sealed its fate, was the French army?
It was the French army that enforced colonial domination and it was the French army that installed one of its junior officers, Bokassa, as the head of the Central African State once it gained its independence, without asking the opinion of the population.
How can we forget the protection given for years to the dictator Bokassa and his escapades, the presence of French ministers and of the President himself at the farce that was Bokassa' s self-coronation as emperor?
Therefore, whilst we condemn the leaders of the Central African Republic and their army, we would like point out the infinitely greater responsibility of the French state and we shall abstain from voting on the resolution.
Mr President, democracy has still not been achieved in Africa. That emerged yet again in the attempted coup in the Central African Republic, in fact a classic scenario.
A leader refuses to accept the outcome of the elections and does everything to regain power, supported by soldiers from his own ethnic group and this is followed by repression and cleansing operations.
However, the difference is that this time troops from other African countries intervened to support the democratically elected leader.
So that, given the indifference of the international communities, African countries are slowly learning to solve their own problems for themselves.
The fact that in the process, a country like Libya gains more power and esteem in the continent is a regrettable but obviously inevitable side effect.
There is more to it than that, however.
The events in the Central African Republic are also an extension of the war in Congo.
The perpetrators of the coup were supported by pro-Kabila troops, who are trying to attack the Congolese rebels from the rear and cut their supply lines.
The war in Congo, the war in Central Africa is spreading like an oil slick across the continent. Unfortunately Europe is looking on indecisively and passively.
The lack of interest, but mainly the divisions within the European Union, leads to indecisive and inconsistent action against countries that break the Lusaka agreements.
I should like, in this context, once again to argue strongly in favour of our not forgetting Africa, neither in their interests nor in ours.
For if we wish to avoid hundreds of thousands of Africans migrating to Europe, then we must apply ourselves to conflict prevention and conflict management and ensure that these people are give the chance to survive in their own countries.
Mr President, the Commission is concerned about the recent attempted coup in the Central African Republic and the increasing political and social instability in the country.
In this context, the Commission, together with the Central African Republic, has recently finalised a country support strategy aimed at promoting good governance and a more stable, social and institutional environment as prerequisites for sustainable development.
The Community's cooperation is to be focused on the transport and health sectors.
This strategy may have to be reviewed in the light of recent events.
It should be emphasised that the crisis did not turn at any time into a widespread mutiny and remained essentially confined to military operations.
The resulting humanitarian crisis appears to be well identified and manageable.
The Commission's humanitarian aid office (ECHO) has, since the beginning of the crisis, been in regular contact with the delegation and international NGOs coordinating with the UN on the ground in Bangui.
In consultation with these partners, and in response to this crisis, the Commission will be providing up to EUR 1 million for a two-month operation.
This will include emergency food aid for 35 000 children and other particularly vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and the elderly; medical assistance in the form of drugs, medical equipment and small-scale rehabilitation to enable looted health centres to reopen immediately; and reinstallation assistance in the form of basic household items and, possibly, support to refurbish badly damaged homes.
Mr President, I do not have a great deal to add, because the Commissioner has answered the questions that I wanted to ask.
Having said that, I would just say that it is important that we focus perhaps one last time on the fact that all the causes of what is happening today in a country like the Central African Republic are linked to these famous 'structural adjustment' policies, which were imposed on countries by the IMF and the World Bank, which force whole populations to live in poverty and which prevent them from effectively resisting dictators across the world.
Commissioner, Mr President, I am very anxious that the European Union should continue to increase its efforts to come to the aid of civilian populations, and of democracy itself, by fighting against these policies of structural withdrawal, because they are unfair.
They help to strengthen dictators, not democrats.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.

Guatemala
Mr President, my group supports the recommendations of the Commission for historical clarification, in order to put on trial those who in the past violated human rights in Guatemala.
It is right and proper that the European Parliament, and that the European Union should support those who have the difficult task of tracing and bringing to justice the guilty parties.
I am talking about human rights activists, lawyers and judges.
In the past, support for such people from the Guatemalan authorities has often been lacking.
Consequently, I fervently hope that that support will increase after and because of this resolution.
But - and here I am appealing to those fellow Members of the PPE-DE who are present - in that case we must be honest and not place people above the law.
That is what is threatening to happen now.
You probably know who I am talking about, Mr Rios Mont, at present speaker of the parliament.
He too, he more than anyone, will have to account for his past as military dictator and accordingly, I hope that this Parliament will include that responsibility of his and others' in the 1980s explicitly in the resolution.
Mr President, a year ago we called in this House for an end to the impunity which meant that those guilty of the murder of Bishop Gerardi had not yet been sentenced.
Fortunately, we know today that three army officers and a priest - it is terrible that a priest should have been involved - have been sentenced for this crime.
We believe a series of proceedings should be started against all those involved in the murder of Bishop Gerardi, as suggested in the very well-balanced report on the case, entitled 'Guatemala, never again' .
Otherwise impunity would become a serious problem for the future of Guatemala.
To this end we believe the European Union should help protect all the witnesses, judges and defenders of human rights in Guatemala who are working towards this.
I am quite sure that we in the European Union can do this.
We must demand that all those working against impunity should be protected and that the facts with which this report is concerned should be made known.
Mr President, we fortunately live at a time when oppressed people and ethnic minorities can have their rights acknowledged and when the deeds of bullies and tyrants can be exposed and condemned.
Punishment is not always the crucial factor.
What is crucial is to bring out the truth.
Prosecutions must be brought because the truth must come out if people are not to be deceived again.
Guatemala has ratified the Geneva Convention and the convention aimed at preventing and punishing genocide.
The Truth Commission has asked that the authorities now take legal proceedings against those who have practised or supported genocide.
The President has supported this, but we see both judges and others associated with the legal authorities being persecuted and killed, and it is regarding these matters that we too in this Parliament must keep the closest possible eye on the situation and keep up a maximum of pressure so that these processes are carried through with transparency and so that the truth emerges and the skeletons come out of the cupboard.
Mr President, this Parliament has always upheld its commitment to the Guatemalan peace process ever since the signing of the 1996 peace accords, at which this Parliament was represented, just as we have repeatedly reiterated our intention and desire for national reconciliation in Guatemala, without this meaning the rule of impunity.
The joint resolution we have tabled, resulting from the unanimous agreement of all the political groups in this Parliament, underlines the homogeneous and consistent position of this House, which has for so long been committed to human rights in general and the Guatemalan people in their search for peace in particular.
The recent court sentences, such as the one that has been mentioned regarding the murder of Bishop Gerardi, have revealed just how important it is that justice and the rule of law should take their usual course and function normally, as in any democratic system, but we must not forget or stand in the way of the changes and pressures that have arisen in this process.
We must show our concern for the situation of violence, involving assaults on individuals and members of the judiciary, that has occurred and which has, of course, caused turmoil.
The rationale of wounds kept open for a long time is in any case unjustifiable, and the sooner a stop can be put to this the sooner Guatemala can move towards democracy, respect for the rule of law, development, peace and social improvement, leading to prosperity and the creation of the climate of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect that we so strongly desire for Central America and Guatemala.
We are not in favour of supporting Mrs Frassoni' s amendment to take concrete action against military commanders.
In our opinion the indiscriminate nature of this amendment is not good.
Moreover, we would be taking over the role that belongs to the courts, whom we want to support in their vital task of pacification and re-establishing the rule of law.
Mr President, on behalf of the Social-Democratic Group I should like to say about the wonderful country and remarkable people of Guatemala that they have of course been through a very dark period, in which the vast majority of the population have in fact as indigenos been ruled and dominated by a minority of whites.
The whole history of huge estates, owned by the capituleros, goes back much further.
That also explains why a country with such an institutional background, finds it terribly difficult, despite the peace agreements, to resource the authorities, values, the standards and the democratic capacity really to put its past behind it and to regard the peace agreements as a new beginning.
Rigoberta Menchu is someone who appealed strongly to the indigenous population.
It is still that population that is afraid and feels how strong the opposition is, but I believe that President Portillo is sincere in this and is trying to take new steps.
That is also the reason why I, contrary to what the honourable Member from the PPE-DE said, still believe that the amendment is meaningful. Because it makes it clear that even those circles which have long regarded and felt themselves to be beyond and above the law, must be subjected to the full force of the law and not exempted.
Someone like Rios Mont with his coterie of relations and contacts definitely belongs to those circles.
On that point I also hope that the Commission will draw strength from this. It will not do so without sufficient international support.
In that sense what we do here in the European Parliament is also of great value and significance.
In this resolution the new phase in which Guatemala finds itself is recognised, and the legitimacy of the government is fully recognised.
I hope that the resolution will also be in honour of Rigoberta Menchu.
Electoral fraud in Chad
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that the elections in Chad are a textbook case for those throughout the world who want a user' s manual for producing an electoral farce.
First of all, there is a climate of persecution against all opponents, with union activists being arrested and then the ballot boxes are stuffed with an extra one million votes.
I would say, however, to all those who still doubt whether a policy of neo-colonialism is at work, that it is the international community and above all, my country, France that bear responsibility for what has happened in Chad.
France has maintained a military presence in that country since independence.
The army printed the ballot papers and made the ballot boxes.
It is the army that transported the material needed for voting to the most distant provinces of this vast desert country.
I therefore feel that France bears direct responsibility and that France has colluded in this electoral fraud, or, in any event, has directly or indirectly contributed to it.
The silence of the international community is due to the fact that enormous oil deposits have just been discovered in Chad.
The Commission and the European Union, Commissioner, must immediately condemn the role of the international oil companies, which not only show no concern for the environment, but also care little for the interests of the communities they affect and even less for democracy.
I therefore feel that this is a real textbook case, which we could still call, forgive me for saying so, a neo-colonialist policy in Africa.
Mr President, the newly elected President Deby has made wonderful promises to his people, the European Union and the World Bank.
He announced that he would tackle the widespread corruption and would respect human rights. He was going to remove his country from the poverty spiral with the aid of oil revenues.
Is Deby aware that he is irrevocably bound to honour the agreements he has made?
The World Bank did not put almost NLG 4 billion into the oil project lightly.
Nor are the European Cotonou resources unconditional.
The aid creates obligations but all the indications are that the president is trying to wriggle out of them.
Deby used part of the oil consortium' s advance millions to acquire weapons.
In so doing he broke his promise to the World Bank that he would use the money to fight poverty.
The elections appear to have been heavily rigged.
The restrictions on press freedom and the arbitrary arrests among the opposition once again underline the lack of democracy.
Europe must make it clear to Deby that he cannot break his word with impunity.
Mr President, last year Mrs Maes, Mrs Carlotti and I were in Chad to look at the pipeline project and its impact on the local people and communities and on the environment.
We were also looking at human rights in that country.
Today we three have tabled this motion because our concern then for human rights has been compounded now by allegations following the presidential elections.
It is right that we should not jump to conclusions.
It is right that we should take note of the OAU monitors, who thought that the elections were broadly fair.
It is equally right that we should take note of the views of those other observers and human rights groups who thought they were not.
The government of Chad needs to reassure public opinion in Chad and throughout the world by holding an independent and a public inquiry into the allegations that have been made.
The European Union should insist on this.
We are major investors in Chad and we should certainly be thinking of sending monitors from this Parliament to Chad for next year's parliamentary elections.
However, there are questions to which we demand answers.
First, if there are 4 million voters registered in Chad and another half million registered abroad, how can 5.6 million people have voted?
Is it true that children were seen with ballot papers?
Secondly, why were the OAU and other international observers not allowed into the north of the country?
Thirdly, why were the officials of polling stations in the north replaced at midday by military and other civilian personnel?
Fourthly, if the total votes recorded in the south were overwhelmingly for opposition candidates as alleged, how can the overall vote have been calculated as it was?
Fifthly, is it true, and I believe it was, that a women's delegation seeking to present a petition to the French Ambassador was shot at and dispersed by military personnel?
Sixthly, is it true that the six opposition candidates were arrested after the election and one of these, Mr Yorongar, was beaten and wounded?
I met him in Chad and I met him again this afternoon when he showed me evidence of the treatment he has been receiving in a Paris hospital.
All these questions must be answered and accounted for.
That is our demand and it is the demand of the people of Chad.
Mr President, the Socialist Group is also extremely concerned about the unrest that has arisen in Chad since the re-election of Idriss Deby. Accusations of electoral fraud, arrests and torture of members of the opposition, demonstrations broken up violently.
We condemn these violations of fundamental rights in the strongest possible terms.
I have a further question - in fact I agree with all the questions posed by the honourable Member from the PPE-DE.
Is Idriss Deby in fact a new oil dictator ?
It is of course not very friendly to put it in those terms, but it looks very much as if the money earned from oil extraction is being misused to keep him in power.
Does this mean that Chad will follow in the footsteps of countries such as Nigeria, Angola and Sierra Leone?
We know the impact of the extraction of raw materials such as oil and diamonds have had, and are still having, on the conflicts in these countries.
The Chad-Cameroon pipeline project is receiving help from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank.
Parliament expressed its concerns about the pipeline project as early as January 2000.
Unfortunately, recent events in Chad seem to have proved us right.
The special set-up of the project is intended to guarantee that the proceeds are used for the economic and social development programmes for the benefit of the poor, but the unstable situation in Chad is threatening these good intentions and that is unacceptable.
Both the World Bank and we in Europe must increase pressure on Chad to ensure that the human rights situation there is improved.
This may, as far as I am concerned, eventually lead to the cutting off of funding.
At the same time the international companies involved must take their share of the responsibility.
I would argue again - as I have previously done with other countries in Africa - for a code of practice between the international institutions and multinational oil companies, according to which the companies concerned commit themselves to the conditions of socially responsible business.
Signature of this code of behaviour - which could be an initiative of the European Union or the Commission - should be a minimum precondition for multinationals to participate in projects in developing countries where public funding is used.
Mr President, honourable Members have highlighted at length the way in which the elections were rigged in Chad.
Again we see that democratic elections or elections intended to be democratic, are not conducted democratically.
In Chad it turned into a real electoral hold-up.
A coup in democratic guise, and foreign public opinion must not be fooled.
We have spoken to the representatives of Chad, as Mr Bowis has already mentioned.
The people of Chad have no faith in their democratic institutions and they have been proved right.
Attempts are being made to convince us by submitting pieces of legislation that supposedly guarantee that the oil revenues will be duly returned to the population and that the development of both north and south will hence be promoted.
On the contrary, people warned us back then that President Idriss Deby, again undemocratically elected, would do nothing except use the oil money to strengthen his military power, and military power is replacing democratic power.
Reportedly no less than four and a half million out of six million inhabitants voted.
Voting cards were distributed.
They were sold.
The population in the north was artificially increased and that in the south artificially reduced.
To prevent the number of votes cast finally exceeding the number of inhabitants, votes from abroad by citizens of Chad were simply not counted.
In short, we cannot accept such a travesty.
The complaints submitted up to now appear to have been all rejected by the highest authorities and reportedly the results of the election have been declared definitive.
We simply cannot take this.
In so doing we are depriving ourselves, our citizens and own democratic institutions of credibility.
I should also like to urge the French government most strongly not to shirk its responsibility.
Whenever we go to a West African country, we can see the extent to which French influence is still present there.
It serves purely neocolonial ends and we cannot support it.
Mr Yorongar, who was tortured, is here with us.
I should like to pay tribute to him.
Mr President, only yesterday the electoral commission in Chad confirmed the re-election of President Idriss DÃ©by and the result of 67% of votes cast in his favour in the elections of 20 May.
Such a percentage should not leave any doubt as to the legitimacy of his election, were it not for the accusations of irregularities made by the other candidates and the independent national election monitoring body.
President DÃ©by has himself declared to high profile media that irregularities are common in African elections and democracies, but one should not hide behind a general evil to justify internal outrages.
In this case, we are not talking about technical problems, which may occur, even in the most stable democracies.
We are talking about the use of coercion against opposition candidates, restrictions of the most basic freedoms that have to be set in motion during an electoral process, and finally we are talking yet again about the operation of the rule of law, which even at the most basic levels is open to question on this occasion.
As so often happens, it is up to the European Parliament to appeal to the European Union bodies responsible for foreign relations to assess whether, with the confirmation of the election result, democracy in Chad is making any progress.
If we are to believe some of the complaints, the facts that emerge are so serious that they are absolutely unacceptable in the twenty-first century.
Yet again we must reiterate the need to use all the means at our disposal, especially those provided for in the Cotonou Agreement, and our cooperation with the community of ACP countries, particularly the African ones, to prevent and to correct highly dubious acts such as those that have just occurred in Chad.
We must all ensure the success of those who are working hard to achieve decent levels of democracy, freedom and progress in those countries, as a necessary precondition for stability and prosperity to become a reality in their societies.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists asks you to support their resolution and also asks the Commission to adopt their declaration so that the government of Chad can learn of our concern and the sections of Chadian society that have been edged out of the electoral process can realise that they can count on our solidarity.
There will be further opportunities, particularly the legislative elections announced for March 2002, which must not be thwarted, to create a real framework of democratic coexistence in Chad.
Egypt
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the cases of Mrs El Saadawi and Mr Ibrahim involve a country that is not often in the news.
Our Parliament chooses to some extent to forget this country and the others that belong to the Barcelona 'mish mash' of countries that are party to the Euro-mediterranean agreements.
Nevertheless, in Egypt, rather strange things are happening.
The case of Mrs El Saadawi is typical.
She is accused of apostasy and is threatened with compulsory divorce, a custom which, I hope, my fellow Members will want to take a closer look at.
Mrs El Saadawi is in danger of being sent to prison.
I wish to thank the one hundred fellow Members who agreed to sign an appeal on her behalf, together with many international celebrities.
Mrs Bonino and other Members of the European Parliament will be in Cairo over the next few days in order to defend her and to be with her during her trial.
I think that it is Parliament' s duty to react robustly.
The procedure that has inspired this court case is called 'Hisba' and can only be initiated by men or women of the Muslim faith.
The procedure runs completely counter to the Egyptian Constitution, especially to its Article 40.
I therefore call on all honourable Members to support this fight, of which I do not think we have seen the last and I also call on the Commission to support Mr Ibrahim.
Mr Ibrahim worked with Commission funds and has been accused of fraud, even though the Commission usually carries strict controls.
It would, therefore, be only appropriate for the Commission to come to his defence as vigorously as possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it could perhaps be said quite simply that witch-hunting has started up once again in Egypt, since a number of writers and artists are now being censured and their basic rights are being threatened,
One example of basic rights might include the one laid down in Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights for which we have just voted, protecting individuals' private lives.
If Mrs El Saadawi is found guilty of apostasy, she will have to divorce, which is a violation of her private life.
We could go down that road, but first of all, we should talk about her, because in 1972, this woman was brave enough to condemn female 'circumcision' .
This was thirty years ago, at a time when making such a condemnation was no easy matter, especially if you were from one of the countries in which this is practised.
Since then, Mrs El Saadawi has ceaselessly pursued her feminist struggle, in newspapers, articles, books and by maintaining a considerable public presence.
We are fully aware, then, of who this woman is.
In treating her as she is being treated today, a lack of respect is being demonstrated to all her commitment.
Perhaps we should focus on the fact that the prosecution is now recommending that the charges against her be dropped.
As Mr Dupuis has just said, her trial will take place next week, but perhaps under international pressure - and I thank Mrs Bonino for having made this appeal, which I myself signed - Egypt will, as we hope, reconsider its decision.
I would nevertheless remind you that divorce...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Egypt is crucial to stability in the Middle East.
The country maintains important relations with the United States and Europe.
Unfortunately there is still no internal stability.
As long ago as 1967 a state of emergency was declared and has never been revoked.
Egypt is still far from being a democracy.
It lacks essential political freedoms and human rights are violated.
The government restricts the activities of political parties, human rights organisations, professional associations and the press.
People are imprisoned without trial and tortured.
Show trials are still held.
The recent sentencing of the American sociologist Ibrahim fits very well into this poor picture.
It proves that jurisprudence is controlled by political motives and is unjust.
As an important partner of Egypt' s, we should protest emphatically against these abuses.
The Barcelona process will never get off the ground if democratisation is bogged down in autocratic reluctance.
Stability means something else besides stripping people of rights.
The human rights situation in Egypt is giving rise to increasing concern.
As other Members have told you, the suffering that Mrs Nawal El Saadawi is having to endure is edifying and it has also been said today that she will soon have to appear before a criminal court and risks imprisonment and a forced divorce.
Several other human rights defenders are also experiencing legislative and judicial harassment.
The state of emergency, the law on association and the judicial system have been put in place to repress all freedom of expression, which reveals how far off course the government is with regard to respect for human rights, especially where torture and ill treatment are concerned.
As for the torturers, they continue their ruthless acts with total impunity.
The government does not respect the obligations of international law or the international undertakings given over recent years, including Article 2 of the Association Agreement concluded with the European Union.
It is therefore vital that the Egyptian authorities condemn all these expressions of violence and ensure the protection of its citizens.
It must implement real measures, especially on behalf of women, minors and prisoners.
It must guarantee an independent system of justice with investigations and inspections and renounce any legislation which restricts freedom of expression and association. It must not enforce a state of emergency whenever it wishes to restrain democratic freedoms and the activities of all these human rights campaigners.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Arabic Republic of Egypt, I would like to remind you of the importance of this agreement for the construction of a total partnership, which is not only commercial but also political and cultural, with this key player in the Middle East.
Nobody would be mistaken for thinking that this is an agreement of the heart with this friendly country.
Given that negotiations were concluded in June 1999, the Association Agreement is due to be signed very soon and we will be asked to take a stand on this text.
I hope it will mark the start of a new momentum in our relations with Egypt and the strengthening of our exchanges and our mutual understanding, as this is one of the crucial objectives of this Association Agreement.
It seems to me that we must not impose our own models and concepts and condemn certain attitudes out of hand. We must instead analyse, understand and support without, for all that, tolerating the unacceptable.
This, to my mind, is the justification for this compromise resolution and I would like to thank those of my colleagues who helped to draft and support it, especially Mr Purvis and Mr Dary.
The aim of this resolution is to demonstrate the unfailing vigilance of my group and of this Parliament regarding respect for human rights around the world and especially in relation to our Mediterranean partners.
We owe it to ourselves to remain intransigent on these issues whilst at the same time encouraging those who take the correct path.
Mutual understanding is crucial and that is one of the messages I would like to get across today. Urgent or topical resolutions must not make us forget this.
On the contrary, they must become the instrument of choice in our mutual understanding. Having raised this issue on numerous occasions with the Egyptian authorities, I know that they understand this and are willing to comply.
That is what is important.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming signing of a partnership agreement between Egypt and the European Union must enable us, particularly in the field of human rights, to iron out the difficulties faced on the ground by the various associations that defend these rights.
However, we must not systematically give way to urgent resolutions and I believe that, in the institutional relationships of confidence which have clearly been established between the European Union and Egypt, it would have been preferable to base our own opinion, our own debate, on the steps that certain Members of Parliament have already taken in this Chamber.
That is why, for my part - and it is my own opinion that I am expressing here and not necessarily that of my group - I think that this resolution is premature and that the situation was conducive to examining the human rights situation with a view to improving conditions in Egypt under the Association Agreement.
Members representing 'Lutte ouvriÃšre' will vote for this resolution in order to protest against an unacceptable attack on the freedom of speech.
By the same token, we take this opportunity to denounce the torture practiced in Egyptian police stations.
The facts related by Amnesty International, which alerted us to these practices, concern a number of cases of men, women and even children being tortured, in some cases to death.
The Egyptian police can only get away with this loathsome practice with the tacit authorisation of the Egyptian government, or indeed on its orders. There is every reason to believe that the leaders of the regime know that the great powers will turn a blind eye to it.
Yet the great powers, especially those of the European Union, have the means to put considerable pressure on the Egyptian regime, which benefits from considerable support from the West.
The European Parliament as a whole must take a stand against these barbaric practices of the Egyptian regime.
If it does not, then we will gladly comply with the wish of Amnesty International that Members of the European Parliament take action against state torture, if only in the form of personal letters of protest sent to the authorities.
If these police practices do not stop, this would perhaps go some way towards saving the victims who are currently in the hands of torturers.
Mr President, freedom of expression in Egypt in 2001 AD: the official writers' union expels the author Ali Selim from membership.
The reason for this draconian measure?
Selim is campaigning for normalisation of relations between his country and the neighbouring state of Israel.
For that reason I should like to add his name to those in the resolution before us.
For that matter, Selim' s expulsion does not come completely out of the blue.
For the last four years the actions of this brave, independent Egyptian author has been a thorn in the flesh of his colleagues.
The reason is plain.
The Egyptian writers' union forbids its members to have direct contact with Israel.
Nevertheless Selim has so far visited Israel seven times.
True to his vocation, he published his Israeli travel experiences.
They were not well received by the writers' union: exaggeratedly positive about Israel, was the collective judgment.
However, author Selim went further.
He spoke out openly in favour of an end to the present Palestine Intifadah.
This was the last straw for the writers, since it bases itself on the so-called 'Aksa-Intifidah' .
In short, Selim's exclusion was inevitable.
At the same time eleven other authors received warnings because of the same attitude as that of Ali Selim.
Meanwhile the renowned member of the Egyptian writers' union, the Nobel Prize winner Nagid Mafouz, has protested vehemently against these censorship measures.
I should like to see the Commission also take action in this matter.
After all, regimentation of thought combined with the propagation of purely anti-Semitic ideas is diametrically opposed to the values and norms that the Member States of the European Union claim to advocate.
In addition, the EU would in this way be contributing to reviving the flagging peace process in the Middle East.
In any case this peace process is incompatible with the general political tenor of the Egyptian state press.
The latter in fact deals wholesale in the most fantastic anti-Israeli and anti-Western stories and/or accusations.
In its pages you can read the following, for example, about the visit of Colin Powell to "his bosses in Tel Aviv": "The American foreign minister had no qualms about abasing himself when he was in Israel.
There he stood, humbly, a Jewish yarmulke on his head, in front of the monument to the (fictitious!) holocaust of the Jews."
No wonder that this year' s guest of honour at the Cairo book fair, the Arab equivalent of the Frankfurt Buchmesse, was Roger Garaudy. A man characterised in the European press as "the internationally infamous and hounded holocaust denier".
All in all, the Egyptian interpretation of freedom of expression is highly selective politically.
The Commission should also take the authorities in Cairo to task about this.
Mr President, this is an unnecessary and undesirable urgency debate.
Certainly it is premature, as Mr Dary said.
It was initiated by the Bonino radicals and was based on erroneous and tendentious accusations against the Egyptian justice system.
In the process of discussions between the groups we elicited the facts, which even they had to agree.
The result is that the proposed compromise resolution says virtually nothing more than could be required of any of our own Member States, that is, that freedom and human rights are fundamental to democracy.
Despite this, the authors of this motion have been peddling shameful and unfounded accusations in their speeches.
However, Commissioner, there is one question I wish to ask you and I would like an unequivocal response, if that is possible.
Paragraph 4 of this resolution expresses our support for the Khaldun Centre for Democracy and requires the Commission to continue its financial support for this organisation and its activities.
My question is this: is the Commission wholly satisfied that the Khaldun Centre for Democracy has properly managed and accounted for its funds and, more particularly, the European Union funds it receives?
That is one of the this case.
If 'yes' , I shall be pleased to support Paragraph 4.
If 'no' or 'perhaps no' , I believe we should vote against Paragraph 4 until we are satisfied, and also vote against the resolution as a whole if it still contains Paragraph 4.
An answer please, Commissioner.
Malaysia
Mr President, I have followed developments in Malaysia for a number of years through visits and acquaintances there.
It is depressing to see how Prime Minister Mahatir is increasingly doing violence to quite elementary democratic principles and general decency in order to put down his political rivals.
This Internal Security Act, or ISA, is used and abused for the purpose of getting at the Prime Minister' s political and personal enemies, as in a dictatorship.
The same applies to the paragraph in the Malaysian constitution, the intention of which was to secure peace in the country and between the ethnic groups and which is now being used for the government' s own purposes.
The former Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, said as long as fourteen years ago that it looked as though Mr Mahatir was on the way towards authoritarian government.
It can safely be said that he has since continued along the same path.
That is deeply regrettable, and it is good that Parliament is today getting to debate the matter and that we are getting a strong statement from the government.
Malaysia should know the truth when we meet with the Malaysians in the various fora during the coming weeks and months.
Mr President, no discussion of Malaysia would be complete without making reference to Tungku Abdul Rahman, the wise man who founded the state of Malaysia in the 1950s and who managed to integrate and strike a clever balance between ethnic groups and religions while ensuring that justice was meted out to one and all.
He reminds me of a figure in European history, Kaiser Karl IV, a Luxembourgois, like Astrid Lulling, who managed to integrate Germans and Czechs, French and Italians at the heart of Europe and whose Golden Bull gave the Holy Roman Empire the most up-to-date and most cleverly balanced constitution of the Middle Ages.
The role played in Europe by Karl IV was played in twentieth century Malaysia by Tungku Abdul Rahman, who managed to strike a balance between Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist, Malay, Tamil and Chinese interests within a federalist structure headed by nine different families of sultans which take it in turns in a clever revolving system to rule this multi-ethnic state.
This fragile structure is based on respect for other people's culture.
It is based on respect for the law.
It is, of course, based first and foremost on respect for the rule of law, which is why it is a serious problem that this sensitive balance in Malaysia has been increasingly disturbed over recent years by the centralist policies of Prime Minister Mahathir, who started by showing a lack of respect for the individual states, followed, in his abuse of the Islamic faith, by an increasing lack of respect for the other religions, and who is now upsetting the balance between the various nationalities.
It is against this background that the so-called Internal Security Act is now being used to silence political rivals from within their own camp and drive the rule of law in Malaysia further and further back.
This is particularly worrying because Malaysia occupies an important geopolitical position.
It is also an important country economically.
Above all, it is an important member of ASEAN, our partner community in South-East Asia.
This is why we must do whatever we can to help Malaysia resurrect the spirit of Abdul Rahman or the Luxembourg spirit, which does so much to foster integration in our European Union.
I think that Mr Mahathir's time is up and that new democratic forces need to take the helm in this country and renew the rule of law there; otherwise this complicated, multi-ethnic, multi-religious structure will become immersed in a blood bath as a result of excessive centralism and authoritarianism.
Mr President, may I jump the queue and ask Mr Posselt a question?
I have listened to his history lesson most attentively but was somewhat surprised by his criticism of Mr Mahathir, as Professor Rinsche has always taught us that Mr Mahathir was the greatest of all Asian statesmen.
Do the German Christian Democrats know something we do not?
You said, Mr Posselt, that Karl IV was a Luxembourgois like Mrs Lulling.
I had always assumed that Mrs Lulling was a Luxembourgoise.
If I have misunderstood, please do enlighten me.
Afghanistan
Mr President, I will not reply to Mr Purvis personally.
I think that his way of perceiving events that have taken place or which are still ongoing in Egypt is very selective and that is up to him.
Unfortunately, the future, as indeed the past, is unlikely to prove him right.
As far as Afghanistan is concerned, I still believe that we may frankly be disappointed by the policy pursued by the European Union and, in particular, by the Commission and the Council as regards Pakistan which, as we know, is crucial for the future of Afghanistan.
Until we adopt a very firm policy towards Pakistan, the Taliban will continue to do what they have been doing for years.
The news is still fresh: the Taliban recaptured a town in the centre of Afghanistan.
The first thing they saw fit to do was to bomb and destroy the hospital and to bomb and destroy the centre for humanitarian aid.
This is a daily occurrence in Afghanistan. This is the Afghanistan we will continue to support indirectly until we have a tough policy against all those states which continue to support it, starting of course with Pakistan, but not forgetting Saudi Arabia and some other States.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission if it could give us any clear, precise indications as to the policies it intends to implement with regard to states which help this renegade state to remain in place.
We know about the disasters, we have spoken about them very often, starting with the situation of women, but unfortunately they go far beyond that.
They include the exclusion of the whole of Afghan youth from any form of education worthy of the name.
We are very well aware that the Afghan version of the Koranic schools has nothing to do with education.
It is therefore high time we got some concrete answers from the Commission and the Council, which is once again absent.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the sinister fate that befell Afghan women and the Buddha statues of Bamyan the Taliban are taking a further step in their merciless religious fanaticism.
The Sikh and Hindu minorities will be required to wear a yellow identification sign on their clothes.
The Human Rights Watch today reports the very latest atrocity in this never-ending story: 60 citizens imprisoned and official, residential and commercial buildings destroyed.
When the regime in Kabul took over power it was to be recognised on the basis of three criteria: stamping out the drug trade, fighting terrorism and respecting human rights.
The Taliban have scored a notable success only in reducing opium production.
Consequently they are convinced that they will never gain international recognition, and hence opt for massive suppression, in other words mass murder, of their people.
The first result of the policy of isolation is that all negotiations have become impossible and hence the only consequences of the sanctions is that a sorely tried people is being punished, that can do nothing but flee to camps in the hope of reaching Europe.
So that the question is no longer whether the Taliban are violating human rights, but what conclusions must be drawn.
Accordingly our group is submitting two amendments.
