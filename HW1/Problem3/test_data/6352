I simply do not get it, and I do not see this as something that this House can take lying down.
What is the Financial Perspective about?
It is about everyone making a move.
We do, of course know that our continentâs ability to survive depends on our promotion of innovation, research and technology, and that these things are crucial to the Lisbon process.
We also know, of course, that we need money in order to do these things, and that it follows that money has to be reassigned.
Yet, if everyone knows that, why do we not get the right results?
Let me tell you what I think, what my very personal opinion is: it is that the reason lies in the fact that, this weekend, European policy was, yet again, not the deciding factor.
Things were of course said about Europeâs future, but most of the speeches made there were devoted to internal policy.
We all know that there is a great island state in this Union, where internal party constraints limit room for manoeuvre.
We all know too that there is a great continental state in this Union in which the results of elections hang upon agriculture.
There may be many more internal policy considerations than these two, the effects of which on European policy we Europeans have to live with, so let us, in this House, unite in saying that we are no longer prepared to do so, for this is proving to be Europeâs ruin!
The President deserves praise for having, today, delivered himself of a fine affirmation of his role in Europe.
You, Mr Barroso, are indeed the guardian of the European Treaties.
Nobody will be able to make the Treaty of Nice serve as the basis for a free trade zone; it may be inadequate, but it has taken the process of integration far too far for that to be possible, and if you want to defend the deepening of Europe, this House will always be right alongside you.
What the people of Europe are now waiting for, though, is signals from Europe; we do indeed need the market, we do indeed need internal and external competition, but those in the Netherlands and in France who voted ânoâ did so not least because they feared that this market, this competition, would wreck their social security, destroying what has been built up over decades.
In the realm of practical politics, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have produced a five-point plan showing how you can help get the Working Time Directive and the Services Directive adopted as social â rather than as anti-social â legislation.
That will give you a chance to show where the Commission stands.
We have heard a great speech from a great President.
Not only he, but also the Luxembourg team as a whole have â as the President of the Commission rightly said â done a terrific job, and for that, Mr Juncker, I thank you, as well as Mr Schmit and all those who have worked together with us this past six months.
Working with the Luxembourg Presidency was â I believe, for all of us â an extraordinarily pleasant business.
Differences of opinion are not always so pleasant in this political life.
Thank you for your speech, and I believe I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that I look forward to tomorrow with eager anticipation.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
President-in-Office, if the Luxembourg presidency has failed your expectations, I hope you will not blame yourself.
President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats in this House applaud your attempts to keep the EU show on the road.
You tried hard to strike the deals Europe needs.
Your lack of success was not for lack of effort.
Your final summit was doomed from the moment France voted to reject the Constitution.
The triumphalism of the ânoâ voters, however, will be short lived.
In Greek tragedy, actors often deepen their own plight while believing that their actions will help them to escape it.
So is the case with the French and the Socialists who were their cheerleaders.
Their votes will bring to bear the very changes they most fear.
At least in Greek tragedy the audience is permitted to understand what is happening.
That luxury is available to many of us only with hindsight some time after the referenda.
I suspect that you, President-in-Office, through your passionate commitment to the European cause, which I welcome, were unable to stand back and look objectively at the impact on your presidency of the week of 29Â May 2005.
Had you done so you might have looked upon that week as a defining moment in the history of a European Union that will never be the same again.
Hence your final summit was characterised not by the pockets of resistance of which you spoke optimistically, but by a fight between two ailing dinosaurs, Britain and France.
Unable to admit that national sovereignty is a luxury of the past, they persist in trying to impose their order on others.
Britain seeks a British Europe rather than a European Britain.
France is just as insular without the excuse of being an island.
Both harbour a dangerous illusion, for there can be only one Europe, truly European.
That Europe must have the necessary funding to function.
The insistence by some Member States on oneÂ perÂ cent of GNI would deprive us of the Lisbon investment, as indeed your final proposal might have done.
It is perhaps better to have no agreement and to re-think both how we raise money and how we spend it, than to reach agreement at any cost.
But to those who seek to use these setbacks to re-establish an iron curtain, I would quote Robert Schuman, who said in 1949: âI have no intention of drawing a geographical line of demarcation between Europe and non-Europe.
There is another way of setting limits: that which distinguishes those who have the European spirit and those who have not.â
President-in-Office, the Franco-German motor of European integration on which your presidency relied is kaput.
We need another motor to replace it.
It must be neither British nor French.
The Union must recognise that it has moved on from reconciliation and security of food supply to other demands of a rapidly changing world: a world that will not wait for Europe.
So do not allow this pause for reflection to be a period of paralysis.
Go home and make sure you win your referendum.
Then mobilise the other smaller states to prevent the prehistoric predators from destroying what has been built.
Take satisfaction from the achievements of your presidency: the agreement on the Euro-vignette for transport infrastructure charging; the action plan for The Hague Programme; the agreement on a European driving licence; and, with luck, even the elusive Membersâ Statute to demonstrate the maturity of this House.
All of these mark good progress for the Union, and you may well conclude that you are left with more than just an overflowing ashtray.
As Aristotle taught us, we may not always achieve our goals, but it is our pursuit of them that changes the course of history.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if, in order to make the European Union function, it were enough to have an effective Presidency of the Council and a President-in-Office endowed with a firm belief in Europe and a certain charisma and credibility, we would be home and dry.
MrÂ Juncker, I also say to you that if you genuinely wished to continue your work, you could perhaps have chosen the presidency of another, rather more stable institution, and you might have been able to play a more direct part in a European debate that we, in fact, believe is very important.
Luxembourg and its Prime Minister have steered the Union well during these turbulent months but that has not helped to restore confidence among the French and Dutch electorate, or to revive the European economic machine, or to put positive initiatives in the pipeline, of the sort that people dream about.
The European Council has only confirmed the reality of a divided Europe of governments, which is perhaps not even very interested in nursing a genuine ambition in the face of a Europe of uncertain and frightened peoples.
We regret, MrÂ Juncker, that the last action of your Presidency has been to put forward a genuinely unacceptable budget proposal, unacceptable because it follows the same failing logic of an unsustainable reduction of the Unionâs budget.
I greatly respect your pragmatism, your realism and understanding of the difficulty and the complicated calculations that you have outlined to us here.
It is also true, however, that even your proposal included cutbacks to positive policies â to the development policy, to the rural development policy, and even to the sacred Lisbon policy â that are not acceptable for todayâs Europe.
We therefore genuinely hope that, once your Presidency has come to an end, your government will throw out such a proposal, partly because we believe that that could help you in your referendum.
Today, it seems that those who only want Europe to be a large supermarket have a definite advantage compared with those who want a political Europe. For now they are the only ones who have been strengthened by the twin ânoâ vote, and I believe that we will have further confirmation of that tomorrow, when TonyÂ Blair will come to us, spruce and smiling, explaining how to make Europe even more intergovernmental and weak.
The only plan in sight for now is clearly the Blair plan.
My group therefore believes that the failure to reach an unsatisfactory agreement on the financial perspectives is a positive result and considers it important that the Council has given itself time to reflect on the Constitution, without, however, putting an end to the ratification process for those who wish for it to continue.
I can already tell you today, MrÂ President, that a great many members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support you for the referendum in Luxembourg.
We believe, however, that this reflection needs to be given time, method and clear objectives, and that, in terms of the financial perspectives, difficult chapters that already seemed to be closed need to be reopened.
It is on those two issues that the conflict between the âsupermarketeersâ and the unionists will burn itself out.
We therefore might as well begin to sharpen our weapons, MrÂ Juncker, because it is really not worth losing our way in abstruse compromises, even if they have brought 20 ministers together.
If we genuinely believe that political union remains the aim, and if we are genuinely ashamed of having to accept the initiative of the ten new Member States on the budget, then we need to act immediately and unambiguously.
Forget about agreeing on the details!
We have to reject the letter of the Six, finally begin to see that the debate on the size of the budget has to be based on the political priorities, and not the other way round, and reopen the debate on everything: the CAP, Life-Nature and the Structural Funds.
Then, MrÂ Barroso, we also have to do âsomething Europeanâ, in the words of a famous Italian film director, something quite different from the Bolkestein Directive, software patenting, the arbitrary and secretive authorisation of new GMOs, or a bit of hot air on sustainable development, whereas in reality â alas â environmental policy is becoming an increasingly marginal issue in your Commission.
Reflection on the future of Europe and its legitimacy will be made much easier if Europe has something to offer in the months to come: REACH, an action on climate change, the tangible redefinition of social Europe, the working time directive, serious attention paid to the Millennium Round commitments.
All of this is perfectly feasible and will help us to revive the Constitution.
I will conclude, MrÂ President: we have very serious doubts that reflection on the Constitution can be carried forward and guided by the bickering crowd operating at the top, and the European Parliament has to take some of the responsibility for that.
MrÂ Borrell, I will address you in the very few seconds remaining: I would like Parliament not to be just a talk show, but you yourself to sponsor an action to place it at the centre of a European-initiative debate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Frassoni; addressing the President of Parliament does not excuse you from having to respect speaking time.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Juncker, MrÂ Barroso, I would like to start by extending my warmest thanks to MrÂ Juncker for the respect he has just shown the European Parliament by giving us such a sincere, transparent and enlightening report on the European Council.
In my 26 years of parliamentary experience, this is a first for me.
I will return to this in a moment, and tomorrow, but, before that, I would like to dwell for a moment on the last topic brought up by MrÂ Juncker: the ratification of the draft Constitutional Treaty.
I note with interest that, three weeks after the success of the ânoâ vote to the ex-draft Constitutional Treaty, the truth is gradually pushing its way to the fore, both with regard to the demands expressed by these votes and with regard to their scope, which goes far beyond the two countries directly concerned.
Thus, a survey commissioned by the Commission itself, following the referendum in France, was analysed in these terms in the Eurobarometer bulletin; I quote: âsocial concerns âŠ [are] âŠ at the heart of the ânoâ voteâ.
Among the main reasons cited for voting ânoâ are that, and I quote: âeconomically speaking the draft is seen as too liberalâ and âthe lack of social Europeâ.
The commentary adds, and again I quote, that âthe rejection of Turkeyâs membership of the EU was mentioned spontaneously by only 6% of people who voted ânoââ.
The electorateâs choice was, as the Eurobarometer document notes, made after careful consideration.
We should also add that just 4% of the people surveyed declared themselves to be against Europe.
The message is therefore clear: âyesâ to Europe, including an enlarged Europe, but ânoâ to the liberal direction it is taking.
This sentiment is shared by many other peoples, which doubtless explains the domino effect of the first two ânoâ votes.
Lessons are starting to be drawn from these great manifestations of the citizensâ crisis of conscience with regard to Europe as it is, including by the European Trade Union Confederation, which has just called on the 25 to take into consideration, and I quote, âfear of lower social standards and neo-liberal policiesâ in order to regain the confidence of European citizens.
This is the context in which we need to assess the last European Council.
Let us summarise.
It has decided to continue with the process of ratifying the ex-Constitutional Treaty by, and I quote, âaltering the timetable according to circumstancesâ, which is a singularly cavalier attitude to democracy.
It has agreed, and again I quote, âto reflect togetherâ, to gain some time, as a high-up European official was kind enough to specify.
Primarily, the European Council has, moreover, provided European opinion with the grossest caricature of this commercial, egotistical, directionless Europe, which our fellow citizens, as it happens, have quite rightly rejected: we could not have done better in turning our backs on the expectations of Europeans.
In this regard, MrÂ Juncker, having worked so hard to avoid such a deplorable outcome, found the right words to denounce the main culprit for this fiasco.
Beyond that, it is the whole club of six, these countries which have, for months, been consumed by their obsession to freeze budgets at 1% of European revenues, that, in my view, incarnates a narrow concept of Europe, with no relation to our declared ambitions.
What real alternatives are there, not only in budgetary terms, but in terms of the direction of the institutional criteria: that, in the opinion of my group, is the agenda for the great citizensâ debate that we need to have on a European scale, and which I called for during our last part-session by quite particularly addressing the left of the House.
MrÂ Schulz appears to be responding positively to this idea, but in a very institutional context.
It seems to me that three of the conditions for the success of such a debate are, first, that it should be free from any pressure; next, that it should be open to actual citizens and not to institutional representatives of civil society; and, finally, that it should result in a new treaty that our fellow citizens can support this time.
I would add that the specific decisions that will be taken at European level during this pause for reflection must also demonstrate, in the eyes of our fellow citizens, our ability to listen to their message and our determination to take it fully into account.
However, we will discuss that tomorrow in the presence of our next Presidency, which will clearly be different from the outgoing one.
The great debate on the future of Europe is getting off to a good start.
Â Â  I have often praised the Luxembourg Presidency.
You always do things well at a technical level, but today I must criticise you, MrÂ Juncker, for the summitâs decision to continue the ratification process with a document rejected by the French in a binding referendum.
What an insult to your French neighbours and Dutch friends from the Benelux countries!
What contempt for the law!
The Treaty of Nice is unambiguously clear: it may only be altered by a unanimous vote, and there is no such unanimity now that the Netherlands has said that it will not ratify the Constitution.
What a retreat from reality, too!
All reflective people know that that document would never survive a referendum in, for example, Great Britain.
The Constitution is dead.
One should bury the dead, and doing so cannot be deferred or postponed.
With all respect, even you cannot breathe life into a corpse by threatening to withdraw as Prime Minister if the Luxembourgers also politely reject a Constitution that, on the basis of population figures and with no proper exercise of democracy, would shift power from the electorate to officials.
You are wasting time.
Let us, rather, start afresh.
Let us bring the same number of proponents and opponents of the Constitution together and prepare a joint consultation document for new ground rules.
We shall be able to discuss this and elect a new Convention able to represent the electorateâs attitude to Europeâs future.
We shall then be able to obtain a practical, brief and easily understandable cooperation agreement able to be adopted in referenda on the same two days in all the EU countries.
If we devise an agreement that is better than the Treaty of Nice, most Europeans will naturally vote in favour of it.
If the watchwords are transparency, democracy and proximity to the people, we shall also be happy to do so.
A new opinion poll shows that 80% of Danes support the proposal to reverse the burden of proof in matters of transparency and that 79% want each country to be able to elect its own Commissioner.
There are only, respectively, 11% and 12% of Danes who are opposed to these proposals.
That is the type of support we should be seeking by means of a new treaty.
We should not be seeking a Constitution to take precedence over Luxembourgâs and other countriesâ constitutions.
Â Â  âMadam President, the outcome of the European Council does not come as a shocking surprise, for after the âcold showerâ of the French and Dutch referenda we could not have expected that everything would turn out as the Presidency had envisaged.
It proved to be the case that the enlargement of the European Union and its possible socio-economic threats â immigration, wherever it may come from, economic liberalisation, whoever may have demanded it, played a significant part in forming a negative attitude.
That is how the citizens of the European Union perceived it.
With reference, however, to what has been said and taking into account also other negative attitudes towards the European Union revealed in opinion surveys, undoubtedly the greatest responsibility lies with the politicians of the Member States.
Too much is demanded of the European Union and Member States have been prepared to invest too little in order for the European Union to go from success to success.
Politicians from the Member States have been eager to nationalise and attribute to themselves too many of the European Unionâs true achievements, and to attribute to Europe their own domestic political failures.
Too often, when taking difficult domestic political decisions, politicians from the Member States do not forget to justify them by reference to European Union requirements.
It seems that we have overspent our credit.
There exist two visions of the European Unionâs future â one of a political European Union and one of a European Union of high-level economic cooperation.
In truth, these two visions are two sides of the same coin â without economic and also social integration it will not be possible to build a sustainable edifice of political integration.
That, to my mind, is the clearest lesson of the last two referenda.
We have to create the socio-economic preconditions for the citizens of the European Union to be able to assess and understand why political integration is necessary, why we, for example, wish to call the European Treaty a Constitution.
Can we really consider the Council meeting to be a long-term failure?
It approved the Lisbon Strategy, a strategy that means a lot more than integration of the internal market.
The Lisbon Strategy is the model for cooperation in the European Union which, when applied to its fullest extent, would help to organise in the European Union the ambitions of our economic and social policy, a direction for Europe to grow as united and competitive, and in the medium term to regain the confidence of society.
The Lisbon agenda, which has been a blatant example of the European Unionâs indecisiveness in the past five years, must become an example of success and cooperation in the future.
That, however, can only be implemented if we can overcome the attitude towards cooperation in the European Union that we have exhibited until now.
It is enough to recall the current unproductive debates on the Services Directive, which is a cornerstone of the Lisbon Strategy.
The concluding words of the agreement on the Lisbon Strategy have demonstrated that the Council has partners who are engaged in the future of the European Union, and who will be able to find a basis for important tasks â security and cooperation, the enlargement of the European Union and cohesion policy.
Â Â  Madam President, it was Bertolt Brecht who quipped that political leaders should simply choose a different people when the people vote incorrectly.
That statement by the German playwright is more topical than ever when we see the frenetic efforts that are being made â only last week at the failed summit in Brussels â to ignore the vote of the Dutch and the French people.
Allow me to quote a small example from my own country to illustrate my point.
My party, the , which is the largest party in Flanders, being opposed to the European superstate of which the Constitution is the groundplan, was not even allowed to take part in the radio and television debates that were organised on the subject.
The conduct of the media and political elites was much like that of the pigs in George Orwellâs âAnimal Farmâ; all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.
Everyone claims that the bookkeepersâ mentality of some egos in European politics blocked an agreement on the multi-annual budget, because it involved some USD 1Â 000 billion for seven years while, by way of comparison, the annual budget of the US alone amounts to USD 2Â 500 billion.
What matters is not so much whether Europe spends enough money in order to meet tomorrowâs challenges, but that it should do so by using its funds differently.
Europe should not get involved in matters that would, in the final analysis, be regulated more effectively at national level.
Europe should really start observing the principle of subsidiarity if it wants to count on the publicâs understanding.
When I see in Flanders how Europeâs billions, via the structural funds, end up in the bottomless pits of Wallonian profiteers, I can only sympathise with such people as the Dutch Prime Minister, who was treated with such contempt by our own Foreign Affairs Minister on account of his consistent stance.
At the risk of shocking some of you, it follows that I cannot get too excited about the failure of last weekâs summit.
Contrary to what some are trying to make out, neither the world, nor Europe, will collapse as a result of it.
One positive thing that came out of the summit was that everyone, including the most die-hard supporters of unrestrained enlargement, is now agreed that a period of reflection is what is called for before we hurtle down the path we have chosen.
If the voice of the Dutch and French people calls a halt to the undemocratic process of Turkish accession, in respect of which bureaucracy is flying in the face of what Europeans want, the end of the European Constitution might well spell the beginning of a fresh and different Europe where the will of the people is taken into consideration.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the summit that brought the Luxembourg Presidency to a close did not yield the success for which most of us in this House had hoped.
We all know what was decided in Brussels and, moreover, what was not.
I now want to convey two messages on behalf of Luxembourgâs Members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
The first is a message of appreciation for the outstanding achievements of the Luxembourg Presidency in general and of the President, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, in particular.
When individual Heads of State or Government are so arrogant, presumptuous and motivated by pure self-interest as to be prepared to jeopardise the progress of the European project and the success of enlargement, then we cannot expect what comes out of the summit to move Europe any further forward.
I do not propose to enlarge on what consequences this may have for the future of the European Union, but what I will say is that, if a few European Heads of Government want to put on the sort of performance that we saw last week, then we will not be able to win back the trust of those who, in France and the Netherlands, voted against the European Constitution.
My second message I bring as one who survived the Second World War, as one who, well advanced in years, is able, in this House, to work for the European cause alongside Members from the Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, and as one who can do no other than quote what Mr Juncker said: âThe last European Council makes me feel ashamed.â
I am ashamed of the evident fact that certain Heads of Government in the western half of our continent have no concept of what the eastward enlargement is all about, nor of the European Union being anything other than a continental bargain-basement.
I am ashamed of our inability, over a year after enlargement, to motivate people between Tallinn and Ljubljana and to persuade them that their sacrifices, their achievements and their endurance over the last 15Â years were anything other than futile.
We should all be ashamed of the way in which certain participants in the summit behaved.
If the founding fathers had behaved as they did, there would have been no united Europe, and half a billion Europeans would never have known peace, freedom and prosperity.
Europe will change and continue to develop, just as it did after the French National Assembly rejected the European Defence Community.
For my part, I can do no other than hope that the changes that this continent will undergo and experience over the years to come will show no trace of the pettiness and egoism that caused the last European Council to fail.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, all Presidencies preside, but do not decide.
The Luxembourg Presidency has indeed presided.
It has drafted many constructive proposals, and it has managed to produce honourable compromises on a number of topics.
The Lisbon Strategy has been relaunched and the national parliaments have finally become more sensitive to this grand European objective. The Stability and Growth Pact will be more intelligent, as it is adapted to economic cycles.
The broad economic policy and employment guidelines have been agreed for three years.
The Luxembourg Presidency has been able to move the EU forward regarding subjects as varied as increased commitment to the Millennium Goals, more targeted support for rural development and notable advances with regard to police cooperation and to security at external borders, etc.
The very positive record of the Presidency has been overshadowed by the festival of national egos celebrated at the end of the week by one Head of State and certain Heads of Government.
I have had the opportunity to say in this forum that the EU is currently sadly lacking in statesmen.
It is governed by political gnomes busy jealously guarding their small treasure.
Very few leaders have a true political vision of the future of Europe.
MrÂ Juncker is not one of them.
He is both an architect and a plumber.
Politics has sometimes led me to oppose my Prime Minister, but I sympathised with him when he declared his shame faced with the mean-minded arrogance of some of his counterparts in the rich countries.
Yes, Europe suffers from internal contradictions.
There are those who push for greater political integration and those who simply want one huge market. Europe is in crisis.
Etymologically, the Greek word means âdecisionâ.
The time for a decision has come; we have to choose: more Europe, or the opt-out.
The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to move Europe forward, and it deserves well of Europe.
In six months, we will assess the new Presidency, but MrÂ Blair will have to present us with something other than a pseudo-modernist discourse on the need for structural reform.
Yes, the world is changing.
Europe has to adapt.
Any community that does not have close links to employment, salaries and productivity becomes unfair, however, and, at the end of the day, becomes poorer.
I have just quoted CarlosÂ Fuentes.
The economy must continue to serve social well-being, and solidarity must be the keyword of European politics.
Europe will either be social or will not be at all, MadamÂ President.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrÂ Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, there are few politicians who succeed in presenting European integration, sacrifices included, among the positive objectives of politics, in founding real agreement on hopes, and not on fears, and in making it understood that new global concerns can only be addressed at European level.
I should like to thank MrÂ Juncker for his sincere efforts and the European passion that he has demonstrated.
The applause of this House has shown that, among the cries of the Eurosceptics and the silence of the extreme pro-Europeans, we have encountered in you political intelligence and the vision of the greatest pro-Europeans.
We would also like it if the other leaders of the Community institutions demonstrated the same courage and leadership in future.
Let us remember, however, that a defeat is only a defeat when we accept it, and we must not accept it.
We are faced with a difficult crisis, the most difficult for many years: first of all the referendum, and today the failed agreement.
A Pandoraâs box has been opened, exposing different visions of Europe.
I should like to point out to all those debating the costs of Europe that, if we do not resolve the crisis soon, as the Cecchin report said almost 20 years ago, we will be talking about the costs of non-Europe, and the costs of non-Europe are higher than the costs of Europe.
The contradiction between the tasks that we would like to give to Europe â in terms of global order, the economy and research â and the negotiations on the budget that MrÂ Juncker has outlined to us is therefore unsustainable.
There will no longer be development or a social model if the Euro group does not address the issue of common economic policy alongside that of monetary policy.
There will no longer be a Europe in the global disorder, if this Parliament and the countries ready to do so do not open a debate on enhanced cooperation on foreign policy and common security.
This crisis will not be short-lived.
The electoral calendar in Germany, in France and also in Italy, without mentioning others, does not help us.
Time for reflection, however, ladies and gentlemen, cannot, and must not, become a Mexican siesta.
I am addressing the President of Parliament and all of us: the referenda and the crisis involve us and affect us, but they have never questioned the work carried out by this Parliament in the constitutional triangle.
In difficult times, our Parliament has been able to launch ideas and summon the European spirit.
After years in which discussion has taken place on Europe for the people, it has to be us who must learn to communicate with the people.
I should like to conclude by saying that this Parliament, always orderly, always working according to the rules and the schedule, must also demonstrate that it will not carry on with business as usual, and that we have understood both the unease of the people and the unsatisfactory responses of many governments.
We will try to remember that the Commission will certainly be the custodian of the treaties, but that we are the representatives of the European people.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the Luxembourg presidency for the good and pragmatic work it has done.
I think more presidencies with such a pro-European attitude and less in the way of a pettifogging national outlook on the part of whatever government is at the helm would do us all a lot of good.
In the aftermath of the summit, Europe is the subject of much negative language and sentiment.
We did of course have something of a hangover in the first few days after it was over, and I am glad that our Prime Minister â in the Luxembourg parliament yesterday and in this House today â has regained his old form, and that we are aware of the need, more than ever, for a forward-looking and positive attitude to this Europe of ours.
The crisis is made less profound by the fact that more members of the public than ever before are taking an interest in Europe, and there are two things that they want: they want more input into debates, and they want Europeâs actual policies to go in a different direction.
As far as the new direction for European policy is concerned â and I see Mr Barroso looks to be already on the edge of his seat with anticipation â it is my view that, having presided over the Commission for a year, you really should think about to what extent your Commissionâs decisions on Bolkestein, the Working Time Directive, REACH and climate change have helped to promote a positive attitude to Europe, or whether, on the other hand, they tend to turn even more members of the public against the Constitution.
My final point is that, in Luxembourg, on 10 July, we will be campaigning for the Constitution.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be doing our bit to help get a âyesâ, for Europe is not the problem, and this Constitution is not the problem, but rather the solution to our problem.
Â Â  Madam President, no is no.
The Dutch ânoâ is final.
Those are not my words but of Mr Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister, in todayâs .
Following the Dutch and French votersâ rejection of the proposed text of the Constitution, most national governments are now opting for a time of reflection.
Will this be a time for those in government to reflect on their tactics or will it offer the opportunity to change and improve the Constitution by means of a broad social discussion involving the general public and social organisations?
My party proposed a broad social discussion of this kind, and that proposal was adopted by the Dutch parliament; how will the Council help to ensure that there can be one across Europe?
Looking back, some advocates of the rejected text consider the no vote, above all, to be a vote against further enlargement to include countries with a low standard of living, particularly Turkey, and against financial solidarity with the poorest regions.
It is probably far more important that many people feel angry about the differences that have grown over the years in terms of prosperity and input and about the uncertain future.
They fear that Europe will increasingly resemble the USA.
They are also indignant about projects that are vulnerable to fraud and about subsidies being poured into large agricultural companies.
The unnecessary pumping of structural fund monies among the richest Member States is another cause of irritation.
Does Mr Juncker agree with me that the neoliberal policy of emphasis on the market has helped foster opposition to this Constitution among the voters?
It is a good thing that last week, the Council did not make any hasty decisions about random cutbacks or the exclusion of new Member States.
First of all, we must discuss what we want, about what Europe does and does not do.
Studies can show that people do want to tackle the large-scale and cross-border issues in order to protect man and the environment more effectively, while they want minimal interference in national, regional and local democracy.
Is the Council prepared to start such a study?
I would like a response to that.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, with the impenetrable defences that were raised, the European Council ended in inconclusive chatter: in essence, a sinister death knell for this Europe, the Europe of bankers, which is so far removed from the dream of the patriots, the visionaries, the founding fathers of the European idea.
In a few daysâ time, it will be the 200th anniversary of the birth of Giuseppe Mazzini, a prophet of a Europe of the peoples, and the founder of the âYoung Europeâ movementWhat is emerging from the discussions of the European Council is more reminiscent of the Congress of Vienna than of that great patriotâs vision of solidarity.
The voice of the peoples must be heard, not the interests of high finance.
It is the peoples that suffer, together with the real economy, as a result of the havoc and failures of the euro.
So why not hold a referendum on the euro?
Instead, after having heard the results of the referenda, you write in your conclusions that the recent developments do not challenge the legitimacy of continuing the ratification process.
Nothing changes.
The bogus assumptions about this European integration, such as the claim that the nations of which it is composed, the body of this Europe, are disappearing, are therefore not taken into account.
Fortunately, they have not disappeared: there is still a vestige of national sovereignty left.
A lot has, however, been expropriated: monetary sovereignty has been expropriated, and, as a result of that, we want to give the decision on the euro back to the people, because the people very often say: enough of the euro.
It is the Member States, the nations, that are the repositories of the democratic will of the citizens, not your technobureaucracy that is accountable to no one.
Those discussions, that end of Europe is the result of your method of enlargement.
Even MrÂ Prodi is now distancing himself from enlargement and from the decision on Turkey.
It is a little too late, however.
Â Â  Madam President, the fiasco of the recent EU summit has left the European Union at a crossroads.
NoÂ one should rejoice at this crisis, however, regardless of the reasons behind it.
The Polish delegation to the Union for Europe of the Nations Group may well be opposed to the Constitutional Treaty, but this does not mean that we are opposed to the European Union itself.
The latter is something we should all value.
NoÂ one should make rash judgments either.
One cannot help thinking, however, that even though the old Member States have quarrelled for years over whether priority should be given to structural reforms and more effective measures or to regulations that enhance social solidarity, the EU now appears to be saying that it has no interest in either efficiency or solidarity.
Yet no one can claim that the recent EU enlargement is the cause of the crisis.
No one should lay the blame on the new Member States, or on the 150Â Polish plumbers working in France, who are in any case unable to meet the current demand for plumbing services in that country.
The problems we are experiencing with regard to the new Financial Perspective do not boil down to a simple dispute over money.
There is no longer any point in holding debates on the EUâs future on the basis of such obsolete ideological concepts as âliberalismâ or âsocial modelâ, because jobs cannot be created without growth.
On the whole, the EUâs economies are over-regulated, and in addition, unemployment is not falling.
Unless we want to escalate the crisis further, we must develop a job-creation strategy based on more effective action, enhanced competitiveness and higher incomes.
There is another dimension to this crisis, namely the failure of the Constitutional Treaty.
If its architects were keen to hear what the EUâs citizens had to say, then they have achieved their goal.
The only problem is that the EUâs citizens have voiced their national opposition to a federal EU.
The European project therefore needs to be thoroughly reconsidered, and the reforms must start from grass-roots level.
Attempts by an all-seeing elite to bestow happiness on people by force always prove counter-productive.
My final point relates to the common foreign policy, with regard to which people quite obviously have varying and divergent priorities.
I say this in view of MrÂ Junckerâs comments on improvements in the EUâs relations with Russia.
I would ask whether it is not the case that relations have improved because the EU has turned a blind eye to Russiaâs impertinent treatment of Poland and the other new Member States.
Unless the common foreign policy is to be devoid of any practical sense, it should seek to achieve a minimum level of security for all Member States, rather than to promote the interests of individual countries.
Â Â  IÂ would have liked to have started by thanking Mr Juncker, but he is probably not interested in our opinions.
Nevertheless, IÂ would still like to say that IÂ appreciate his stance in really trying to integrate the new Member States into the functioning of the European Union.
IÂ am sorry that the Luxembourg presidency will be connected with the failure of the Constitutional Treaty.
I must say, however, that it is precisely the inability of the Council to deal with the current situation that demonstrates the necessity of the Constitutional Treaty.
The Constitutional Treaty is not dead: it is, alas, the Council itself, unable to resolve this deadlock, that is dead and ineffective.
Council members cannot agree, as they struggle to protect their political hides in the domestic arena.
Today it is the European Parliament and the European Commission that know how to agree and adopt majority decisions.
Both these institutions work and take decisions that directly affect the lives of the people of the European Union.
It was stated during your presidency that the targets set by the Lisbon strategy are unrealistic.
But the reality, that is, a proposed solution, was not offered to us, and remains a hot potato for the next presidency.
And unfortunately not even the next presidency is a guarantee that the Lisbon strategy will be resolved rather than merely criticised.
If Kissinger were to ask for Europeâs telephone number today, he would be given 25 numbers to choose from.
Who to choose?
Big?
Rich?
Active?
It is exactly those who have now turned their backs on solidarity and on us all.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I in my turn would like to pay every homage to the Luxembourg Presidency.
Listening to MrÂ Juncker, I was proud to belong to a Europe presided over by a man of such quality.
You have shown that the authority of a Presidency can be measured by its willingness to place the common interest above its own national interest and it is on this criterion that, from tomorrow, we will judge your successor.
I would like to add three comments on the financial perspectives.
The first is that certain governments are calling for all the EUâs policies to be sent back to the drawing board, which is what the European Parliament did after the nine months of work by its temporary committee.
Our Parliament has succeeded in making difficult choices between old policies and new ones.
The Council could benefit from taking inspiration from this example.
I am sure that the future Presidency will find food for thought in it.
My second comment is that the lack of a position from the Council must not delay the implementation of the new cohesion policy or that of the new Framework Programme on Research.
We propose to pursue legislation relating to the legal bases for the multi-annual policies so that those policies can enter into force on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
My third comment, finally, is that the Council has failed, not on the main subject of the level of budgetary expenditure, but on the method of financing a budget that has remained stable with respect to EU revenue.
This confirms the analysis that we have made here right from the start.
There can be no agreement on future expenditure without, at the same time, reform of the revenue system, and this subject is too important to be left just to the Ministers for Finance.
Our Committee on Budgets invited the committees of the national parliaments to an initial exchange of views on this subject last week.
We propose that the EUâs system of own resources should be examined in the context of an interparliamentary conference bringing together the European Parliament and the national parliaments to aid the governments in their search for the necessary compromise.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, for the new Member States, these last six months have been a period rich in success, even if these successes were the fruit of some difficult compromises.
Nevertheless, this period has also been rich in disappointments.
We, too, have faith in the Lisbon Strategy, the key principle of which, solidarity, is one of the fundamental values for the European left.
It is very important, even though we know that these last few days have not really been characterised by that solidarity.
This period has also been an experience with regard to the functioning of relations between the European institutions.
Despite the improvements, we are not completely satisfied with the role that Parliament has been able to obtain in this legally complicated and uncertain situation.
Those who opposed the rapid ratification of the European Constitution did not take account of the fact that, at the same time, they were weakening the position of the European Parliament: the progress of the Constitution in that regard has been replaced by a permanent and complicated necessity for political compromises.
However, the Luxembourg Presidencyâs message was clear: no to a two-speed Europe, yes to a social Europe.
Of the main starting objectives, the financial perspectives were not adopted.
Despite the efforts of the new Member States, which were prepared to make many concessions during the Summit, the budgetary debate did not result in unqualified success.
The President, though, has nothing to be ashamed of.
Drawing conclusions from the last six months, I am convinced that we will continue to travel together down the European road.
I would like to think that, in deciding the itinerary, the small countries will also have a contribution to make.
Â Â  Madam President, the EU is undoubtedly in crisis.
The clear ânoâ votes in the two referenda have plunged the whole of the EU into a kind of vacuum, with great uncertainty about the future.
I am naturally sorry that the French and the Dutch rejected the Constitutional Treaty, but ânoâ votes as clear as that must be respected.
It would therefore be wise to stop and think and to devote some time now to analysis and listening and to reflection upon how we might move on so as to implement the reforms so badly needed by the EU.
The crisis was of course exacerbated by the âbudget fiascoâ but, in many ways, it is better to have no budget at all than a bad one.
I do not think that this budget was especially modern.
We cannot, however, put the whole of the EU in the deep-freeze and wait for the distrust felt by many towards the EU suddenly to disappear.
More than ever, there is a need for leadership and for someone who dares to stand up for visionary ideals and for European cooperation and to defend the decisions taken in Brussels.
In that context, the President-in-Office of the Council deserves all credit, partly for his candid speech and partly for his attempt to reconcile desires that are very much at odds with each other.
We cannot allow the muggy haze that has descended over the whole of Europe to put a stop to cooperation.
We have an enormous amount to do.
We have the Lisbon process and the myth-enshrouded Services Directive, which are genuinely needed.
We must combat cross-border crime.
We have the ambitious environmental work involving REACH, and there is an enormous amount to do within the foreign policy field.
The list of foreign policy measures â 33 pages of the Councilâs conclusions â was certainly compiled before the Council meeting even began but nonetheless gives the appearance of high ambition and a large degree of unity, something that is extremely commendable.
The EU has, and must continue to have, a large role to play in the surrounding world.
I am concerned, however, about enlargement, which is passed over almost in silence in the conclusions from the Council meeting.
We cannot use the referenda as pretexts for putting enlargement on ice in any way.
The enlargement of just over a year ago to include ten new Member States is a brilliant success for the whole of the European idea.
Unifying East and West is the best thing we have done.
The European home, which does not at the moment perhaps feel so warm and cosy, must be open to our neighbouring countries when they fulfil the necessary requirements.
We cannot convey the impression of the enlargement process too being put on hold and of their having to wait.
In many ways, Europe is the answer to what is at issue in these countries, even if it does not perhaps quite appear to our own people to be the answer to their questions.
Soon, it will be the summer recess for all our institutions.
There is perhaps more need than ever to take a few weeksâ rest, to pause for reflection and to reflect upon how we are to move on.
I believe that, in the long run, something good will prove to have come out of this crisis.
Europe is worth it, but in that case we must really make an effort and ensure that the current hiatus in the ratification process does not also extend to the whole of European cooperation, for that would be disastrous.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Schmit, I do not know whether you can find space at the front there for all the flowers with which this House is bedecking you today.
I echo all the gratitude that has been expressed, and wish to add another bloom for the courage that this presidency, the government of Luxembourg, has displayed by organising the referendum and pressing on with the ratification process.
It may be, Mr Schmit, that the result of this decision will be that there will one day be only one founding state in a politically united Europe rather than six of them, and that country will be little Luxembourg.
It may be that this decision represents the victory of the idea of a politically united Europe over the vulgar idea of a common market, of the ideal of uniting people over the mere claim to be uniting markets, market forces and resources.
Today and tomorrow see two Europes meeting head-on in this Chamber.
The President-in-Office gave us a thoughtful speech, reminding us of the case for a political Europe.
Tomorrow we will hear someone who broadcasts abroad for all to hear the propaganda of a Europe of nationalism and national corridors of power, adducing also the Rumsfeld formula according to which Europe is divided into âoldâ and ânewâ, and thereby taking us back to the 19th century, to a Europe characterised by balances of power, by struggles for might, by competition, nationalistic egoism and hegemonistic politics, to a Europe that is not ours.
I hope that the referenda will not be misinterpreted and will not be turned on their heads in such a way that their outcomes can be used against the public, but that they will be used in the manner in which they were intended, as a means of moving Europe forward.
Â Â  â Madam President, I really appreciate Mr Juncker and, when I think that he will be succeeded by Mr Blair, I appreciate him even more.
My political group, in contrast to the petty interests and demagogy of Mr Blair and a number of others, wants a stronger Community budget.
We want a Europe with ambitions and solidarity for its citizens: more united, stronger, more social, more democratic and with a stronger European Parliament.
We say a clear 'no' to neoliberalism, to regressing into ethnocentricity, to the conversion of the Union to a free trade zone.
It is unthinkable that the message of the 'no' from the peoples of France and the Netherlands should be ignored.
The Community budget, which some consider to be overly high, accounts for a mere 2.5% of the Member States' public spending.
It has increased over the last seven years by a mere 8%, while national budgets have increased by 23%.
That is why concessions in the face of the coercive tactics of the Six must stop.
Â Â  Madam President, I was surprised to find out about the initial steps that were taken towards reflection within the European institutions.
It is disappointing to see how various Heads of Government throw their entire weight behind a text that has, to all intents and purposes, been thrown out, thus needlessly obstructing the reflection on Europeâs future.
Moreover, the Summit of 16 and 17 June clearly underlines the collapse of this Constitution.
The optimistic references to a common destiny in the preamble ring false in the ears of someone from a country that, while supposedly fat and stuffed to the gullet, refuses to do anything for poor countries.
In that sense, a reflection on the subject of âdiplomatic choice of wordsâ is of primary importance for Paris.
Moreover, theimpasse surrounding the EUâs multi-annual budget cannot be seen in isolation from the current institutional crisis in Europe.
The discussion about the EUâs future budget is closely related to the debate about the European Constitution.
It is impossible, and indeed undesirable, to indicate policy priorities in a new multi-annual budget and to allocate funds to them while the reflection period and the reformulation of the EUâs mandate are still in full swing.
The European Union must take the publicâs objections about the speed and course of the European integration process seriously.
The citizens want sound European cooperation in respect of which national interests are not immediately labelled as selfish or nationalistic.
The public wants a Europe that does not get caught up in federal dreams but that tackles cross-border issues dynamically.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the Italian Socialists of the New Italian Socialist Party.
As we had cause to highlight before the Council, clear and urgent decisions on the strategy for the forthcoming years are needed for Europe.

A fundamental choice needs to be made between the Baltic perspective, the Mediterranean perspective or a balanced mix of the two; a decision needs to be made on whether or not to actually pursue the Lisbon objectives by means of practical and coherent measures; the foundations on which political integration is to be established need to be redefined; and courage is required to clearly aim at a free and competitive economic system and system of social organisation, which can cope with the ongoing processes of globalisation.
We furthermore believe that actions promoting the creation of a common European spirit are essential, as it can only be created by means of a gradual and progressive harmonisation of policies and by means of a debate designed to generate interest, involving the citizens, civil society and the social partners.
A fresh challenge, a large-scale commitment, an ambitious course of action, rightly begun by the Luxembourg Presidency, which will be continued by MrÂ Blair.
Â Â  Madam President, I hope that Minister Schmit can hear me, because I would like to say that what the citizens are demanding now, quite rightly, is greater transparency.
I believe that the President of your government was expressing everybody's feelings when he said quite clearly that he felt ashamed.
It is incredible that certain Member States should make all kinds of statements of a Europeanist nature, saying that they want more Europe inside and outside our borders, while at the same time they demand a drastic reduction in their contribution to the Unionâs budgets.
It is not acceptable for certain governments to complain about their net contribution to the European Union without taking account of their commercial balance with the other Member States.
The case of Germany in relation to certain Member States, such as my own, Spain, speaks volumes.
Germany's net deficit with the European Union is less than my countryâs commercial deficit with, in fact, Germany.
Neither is it acceptable, Mr Schmit, that certain Heads of Government should say one thing within the Council and then say something quite different to the media in their countries.
I would therefore like to ask whether it is true that there have even been certain Member States that have promised their support in the final vote and have then changed their minds and voted against.
I would ask you to respond.
It is precisely because of cases such as this, and regardless of what is laid down in the draft Constitutional Treaty, that debates in the Council must be made transparent, however shameful they may be.
Finally, Minister, I would like to wish you the best of luck on the 10th.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like firstly to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for the efforts and imagination it has applied to trying to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives in the European Council.
We have seen once again that the European leaders have not been a match for the circumstances: they have been unable to go beyond their exercise in national accounting, and at a crucial moment of crisis, they have been unable to show any positive sign of a forward-looking political vision.
The Commission has done its job; as has the European Parliament: it has adopted its position by a large majority and, for the first time in its history, showing responsibility and taking account of the economic difficulties faced by certain Member States, it has proposed slightly lower figures than those proposed by the Commission.
Both the Commission and Parliament have done their duty.
On the other hand, the Council is having increasing difficulties adopting a position and this is regrettable since it leads to a lack of leadership which undermines the foundations of European integration and confidence amongst the citizens.
I would like to point out that our group will stand by its commitments and that, if no financial perspectives are forthcoming, it will fully apply the provisions of Article 272 of the Treaty and will try to establish annually the figures that this Parliament has approved with a view to guaranteeing Community action.
We still want to make progress with European integration and we therefore need the resources that this House has indicated in its capacity as budgetary authority.
Let us be serious, representatives of the Council: it is not possible at the last minute to say that we must change the Unionâs spending philosophy, it is not possible to advocate that we must spend more money on policies which create more added value and less on agriculture.
What were certain people thinking in October 2002, when they approved the spending for the period we are dealing with?
We must respect the commitments we have made.
For the Socialist Group, and for the Council as well, I hope, the Lisbon Strategy and, hence, economic and social cohesion, are the mid-term development objective.
We would be delighted to have many more resources, we are aware of the achievements of governmental cooperation in relation to the Lisbon objectives.
I would therefore like to point out that all policies ultimately find their expression in the budget.
If the financial perspectives offer any added value, it consists of safeguarding and guaranteeing the programming of the Unionâs cohesion policies, which, apart from being a mechanism for solidarity and for correcting territorial imbalances, are the most important Community public instrument, and are able to generate investment, economic growth and employment, and hence attract the citizens to the European project.
Gentlemen of the Council â and I say gentlemen because there are no ladies â on behalf of my Group, I would ask you to show responsibility.
The ânoâ in the referenda and the lack of agreement in the Council are simply two sides of the same coin.
Â Â  Madam President, last weekâs European Council was a great disappointment.
No agreement could be reached on its own view regarding the new financial perspective, although the current one is due to expire next year.
Accordingly, it is an urgent matter to establish a new one.
The European Parliament decided on its own position at the start of June.
That decision was reached after a full examination of all the EUâs main policy areas.
That is why Parliamentâs conclusions are clear and sound.
The summit discussions were dominated by the quarrel between Great Britain and France over Britainâs rebate and the EUâs agricultural policy.
Rarely, hardly ever in fact, have the Member Stateâs shares of net contributions become such dominant issues as now.
Perhaps the only solution to the argument is to be found in the joint financing of agricultural subsidies, which Parliament is hinting at.
Its gradual implementation at the same time as a reduction in Great Britainâs rebate could create an adequate basis for a compromise.
The EU needs an interinstitutional agreement on the financial framework.
Without one, we could of course draw up an annual budget on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty, but it will not guarantee sustained and balanced development of the different policy areas.
Most multi-annual programmes will be discontinued at the end of 2006.
Of these, the main ones concern regional and structural policy, rural development, research and development policy, and many other areas.
The new legislative plans for these areas are now being debated in Parliament, but it is difficult to make the final decisions when one does not know how much will be available in the form of appropriations.
The situation seems to become especially problematic with regard to the one issue that really is the focal point of the financial perspective, which is increased competitiveness.
The intention is to treble research and development funds for growth and employment, the funding of training programmes, and Trans-European networks.
The situation mow seems quite wretched.
The funding would already have been halved in the proposals for a compromise, and now we do not have any finance policies at all.
Regional and structural policy also demands a solution.
When financing for the present programming period was decided at the Agenda 2000 talks in Berlin, just six months before that period began, the outcome was that structural policy should be put on hold for nearly three years.
The Member States and the Commission did not have time to draw up and adopt the programmes faster.
Now the situation is still more difficult, as we have 10 new Member States for which it is a problem even to estimate the extent of future structural and cohesion policy.
The next country to hold the presidency, Great Britain, cannot expect to while away the time doing nothing: we expect it to come up with proposals and solutions.
Â Â  Madam President, to prove Europe is really united we have to listen to what European people are telling us.
For the first time in the process of the construction of the EU, there has been a big difference â in France and in the Netherlands â between the proposals of the elected representatives and the will of the majority of citizens.
We are pro-European, we want a united Europe and we are working for it, but we the Catalans and other Europeans from stateless nations do not believe that we are going in the right direction on some issues.
We cannot forget a stateless nationâs rights as a part of the human, cultural, language and citizenship rights that are needed for the united Europe that we want to build.
Nowadays we have to listen and learn: learn from old mistakes, such as trying to build a European Union only on nation states; and listen to European citizens.
It could be that new EU Member States understand Members from stateless nations very clearly.
Most of the new Member States are new European states, but with a wild history like ours.
We all need to build new bridges and deal with new ideas to implement a European Union where everyone could be fully recognised.
If we continue going the wrong way; if we persist only in the Jacobinical model, the European Union will not succeed.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Council does not have the courage to bury the Treaty.
How can we talk of putting something off when it has already been killed off?
There can be no resurrection for something that cannot be saved.
The Council also lacks vision.
Its Presidentâs frankness only serves to show in stark relief the truth hidden from Europe by its governments.
A prisoner of national egos, the Council has no political ambition of its own and tries to make omelettes without breaking eggs.
With that shopkeeper mentality, we are doomed to fail.
With the French vote, there is a before and an after.
Either Europe wants to be purely a market or it endeavours to dig deeper and move forward by paying careful attention to the social reasons behind the referenda.
Public opinion is the most significant new element to emerge from this crisis.
This new player does not want less Europe, but, rather, more and better Europe.
The answer is not to stop, but, rather, to have the courage to initiate a fresh, genuinely democratic, constitutional process; the answer is not to head down a cul-de-sac, but, rather, to have a Europe that is provided with its own resources and that is characterised by greater solidarity and a greater ability to combat unemployment.
Â Â  Madam President, the referenda in France and the Netherlands and last weekâs summit genuinely revealed the European project as an elite project without grass-roots support.
Calling the peopleâs decision a crisis clearly demonstrates a genuine lack of belief in a democratic Europe.
We must now state that the draft Constitution has come to nothing according to the EUâs own rules.
Two founder countries have already rejected it.
The matter is clear, so the question is: what shall we do now?
In my view, we must arrange a new Convention that must be appointed democratically so as to reflect the peoplesâ opinions on this issue and not the eliteâs.
Three different issues must not then be mixed up, as has now happened. It was an attempt to impose upon the people of Europe something they did not want.
Firstly, there is a need to edit together treaties that have already been entered into so that they are clear and easy to understand.
That is no great political issue.
Rather, it is just a matter of simple editing.
Secondly, we must revise the form to be taken by the rules for decision-making in those areas in which we have already said that we must take joint decisions.
Thirdly, the draft Constitution included all sorts of plans for common defence, a common foreign policy and a host of other things that absolutely should not have been addressed in this context.
Such issues should not be included in what looks like a Constitution.
Instead, these are issues for the people of Europe to debate in the future.
We must begin again from the beginning, show respect for the peopleâs decision and then review that decision from a democratic point of view with democratically elected people in the form of a Convention.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main reason for reviewing the course of any presidency of the EU Council seems to be to gain an opportunity for mutual appreciation by the people at the top of the EUâs political establishment.
That sort of thing will not, however, do anything to help get Europe through the doubly grave crisis in which it finds itself.
What makes the crisis dual in nature is the fact that, on the one hand, the referenda in France and the Netherlands have shown evident and massive public rejection of the way the EU is going at present, irrespective of domestic political concerns, while, on the other, the failure of the summit has shown that, even at Council level, among the Heads of Government, the will towards a common way forward cannot be assumed.
What is demonstrated not only by this rejection on the part of the public but also by the tactical infighting on internal policies and national egoisms within the Council is that the EU is in a crisis and will not find it easy to extricate itself from it.
That having been said, this crisis should afford the opportunity for a radical change of direction, for a reorientation of the way Europe is going.
Let us get away from a Union characterised by the egoisms of bureaucrats, lobbyists and technocrats with no knowledge of the people; let us move on to a Europe of self-determining peoples and mature citizens.
That is what the opportunity for radical change ought to mean.
Â Â  Madam President, for the first time in my life I find myself in the strange position of agreeing at least in some respects with Tony Blair.
I believe he is right to call for a fundamental reform of the way the EU is funded, with particular focus on the common agricultural policy.
It cannot be right that in a Union of 25Â Member States, 42Â per cent of our budget goes to the CAP, while less than 4Â per cent of our workforce work in agriculture.
Nor can it be right that although the CAP cake has to be shared between 25 Member States, one country gets a gigantic 23.4Â per cent slice.
How can we tolerate a system that sees the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, sitting in session here in Brussels, demanding quite correctly ever more draconian regulations on the sale and marketing of tobacco products that kill half a million of our citizens every year, while across the corridor the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is happily voting for an annual subsidy to Europeâs tobacco farmers of more than EURÂ 1Â billion?
Reform, however, is needed across a much wider field than simply the CAP.
The people of France and the Netherlands showed us that we have lost touch with our own electors.
It was a valuable lesson that we would do well to learn.
Our brave words about achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, about facing up to the challenges of globalisation, about increased competitiveness and economic reform are never matched by brave deeds.
We have virtually abandoned the Stability and Growth Pact; we have begun a predictable and wholescale retreat from the Services Directive; we voted in this House to end the opt-out on the Working Time Directive, and meanwhile the Commission is preparing to unveil another 900 new directives: more red tape, more bureaucracy, more interference in the lives of our citizens.
Do we really believe that this will increase our competitive advantage in the global market?
Do we think this will achieve the goals of the Lisbon Strategy?
I do not think so.
It was a wake-up call from the French and the Dutch.
Wake up and smell the coffee!
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Juncker expressed his regret at having to give up being President-in-Office of the Council after only six months.
If the Constitution were in force, he would be able to be elected for two and a half years.
Perhaps the summit has shown how important it is that the Council should develop in that direction.
I am very pleased that the summit decided, not on a PlanÂ B, which would involve halting the ratification process and re-negotiating the text, but on a PlanÂ D, which involves proceeding with ratification while continuing with a debate â the great debate about Europe.
You, Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, now have in your hand the key that will unlock communication with the public in relation to the European project.
This is the right strategy, and I wholeheartedly endorse it.
I hope that the referendum in Luxembourg will be a success, for we will then have two popular âyesâ votes against two ânoâ votes, which might give the go-ahead for agreement to the Constitution.
We now need to debate what the EU is for and why we need it.
The topics for debate are obvious, including as they do the role of the EU in globalisation, the exit routes from the economic and employment crisis, the EUâs frontiers and the question of how much wider we may set them, not to mention transparency and democracy within the EU.
What I saw as missing from the summit resolution was any concept of how the debate should be structured.
It is not enough to have 25Â national debates in isolation from each other.
We have to bring them together and create a synthesis right across the EU.
If Giscard dâEstaingâs idea of a Congress of Peoples had not been blown out of the water after being proposed to the Convention, I would almost regard it as a good idea to hold an ad hoc assembly of the European Parliament and the national parliaments on that sort of platform.
I hope in any case, though, that what comes out of this crisis will be a stronger Europe and a Europe closer to its people.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrÂ Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, the Luxembourg Presidency will be remembered for having coincided with external events, which, although forcing the European project to undergo a genuine crisis, will enable the European Union to redefine its mission and to endow it with intelligence, institutions, organisation and resources.
That does not diminish our sense of gratitude towards you.
The solution to global problems of the past, a past in which, for us, the world and Europe were the same thing, enables us to state that that period of European history has definitely come to an end, as a result of the success achieved.
The way in which every issue is now rapidly globalised obliges us to embark upon another period, which is just as challenging, not to say just as exciting.
The achievement of peace and stability within Europe, the prosperity ensured by the construction of the internal European market through successive enlargements, and the fostering of the very many cultures within Europe, which can all be traced back to common Judaeo-Greco-Christian roots, make the founding fathersâ original project substantially complete, even if the full and necessary involvement of south-eastern Europe is still absent.
Today, the same issues â peace, prosperity and identity â can only be resolved on an international scale, with global actors demanding a European actor that is equal to the task, more unified, more integrated, more directly accountable towards the European people, without unnecessary, if not downright harmful intermediation by the Member States, and, for that very reason, able to guarantee the objectives that the European people believe are no longer achievable with the Union of today.
The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to mitigate the impact of external events, despite the bleak economic situation in many of the largest Member States and the difficult employment conditions, and despite a Council of 25 operating in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Nice and a Commission that is still not fully able to instil Community life into the work of the Union.
The defence of the fundamental completeness of the Stability and Growth Pact, the stimulus to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, the open-handed and determined search for agreement on the budget, and the impetus provided by the Lisbon Strategy are facts that remain, to the credit of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Above all, however, the Luxembourg Presidency has taught us that the Union, in anticipation of more appropriate constitutional procedures, such as those laid down by the Constitutional Treaty, has to utilise every political resource in order to keep the process in balance, whilst allowing itself time to refocus on the fundamental objectives and methods of its own work.
Without giving in to a state of panic, without preventing itself from continuing to utilise the existing treaties in order to protect and to increase the European of common decisions, even starting with only apparently modest results, such as the European driving licence, which I hope can be approved in a few daysâ time thanks to our codecision procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council said that Europe ought to have shown some maturity.
If anyone or anything has shown itself lacking in maturity, it is not Europe, but the Council, which has brought discredit upon itself as a legislative institution, and it is high time that we compel it to meet in public, which might perhaps be some help.
Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, is now calling for a radical reform of agricultural policy.
We are ready for it.
His demand, though, is a hypocritical one, for he was among those who put the brakes on the last time there was a reform, when he prevented direct payments from being capped or staggered.
He blocked the social cohesion that the coupling of premiums to each worker would have achieved.
He prevented, and voted against, the reallocation of funds to the second pillar for innovation, work and the environment and for the economic development of rural areas.
What that boils down to is that his flagging up of agricultural policy is retribution for the demand â which most of us do in any case support â that the rebate be brought back onto the agenda.
Â Â  Mr President, when Mr Juncker came to this Parliament in January to set out his presidencyâs priorities, the UK Independence Party reminded him that he had spoken about a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget, including the British rebate.
We pointed out that MrÂ Juncker was under the impression that he could revise in just six months arrangements that had taken five years to negotiate.
I do not know whether MrÂ Juncker was being naive or arrogant, but last week he counted the cost of it.
It has been suggested in the media that Mr Blair allowed the rebate to be discussed when such discussions were not necessary, thereby falling into a trap laid by President Chirac who wished to distract attention from the French ânoâ vote.
In fact the rebate was always going to be discussed last week because Mr Juncker was determined it should be.
His window of opportunity was almost closed, the curtain rapidly falling across his presidency.
Mr Juncker is right about one thing: the EU is in profound crisis and for that we can look back in gratitude upon his six months at its helm.
I would also like to thank Mr Juncker for his verdict on the French and Dutch ânoâ votes.
His quote, âI want to believe obstinately that neither the French or the Dutch have rejected the Constitutional Treatyâ, will go down in history as being typical of the attitude of the EUâs political elite in the 21st century.
I come from Devon, where we are often referred to as simple country folk.
Despite â or perhaps because of â my simplistic outlook on life, I found the EU Constitution incredibly easy to understand.
It is abundantly clear that if you wish to see your country retain its independence, you have to vote ânoâ.
Clearly the French and the Dutch share a Devonianâs ability to understand it.
What part of the word ânoâ does MrÂ Juncker not understand?
Â Â  Mr President, for those who still cling to the European dream, Mr Junckerâs presidency has been a stunning failure.
Under it the precious Constitution has been shipwrecked on the rocks of rejection and the budget is an unmitigated shambles, with rancour, as in Mr Junckerâs speech today, being its currency.
From this, however, some good could come.
If the effect was to jolt European leaders into the same reality stream that many of their people already occupy, then a workable Europe could emerge.
Root and branch changes are essential, in which the primacy of the nation state should be reestablished and Brussels centralisation reversed, with wide-ranging powers repatriated to national governments and parliaments.
A Europe built on sovereign states trading and cooperating for mutual benefit, and not for the unworkable, unwanted ever-closer union, has some hope of success.
This present Europe, as your presidency demonstrates, Mr Juncker, cannot work.
Â Â  â Mr President, given my institutional role in the European Parliament, I should be speaking about the failure of the Brussels summit in relation to cohesion, a failure which saddens us all and creates problems with the timely start of the programmes for the new period, for 2007-2013, in connection with the Community Support Framework and regional policy.
However, the debate, on the initiative in particular of one country, has opened up and gone beyond the bounds of the predefined Brussels agenda.
For example, the subject of the common agricultural policy has been raised.
I wonder why those who raised the subject were unable to raise it in 2002 when they signed off everything to do with the CAP and the agricultural budget up to 2013.
I wonder if they would all be prepared to set an example by cutting back the budgets for their large-scale farmers.
The south of Europe cannot pay for the costs of enlargement, nor can the previous cohesion countries.
The subject of a new model for Europe has also been raised, but every model for Europe requires financing.
More Europe also means more money.
We cannot talk about a new vision for Europe with just 2.5% of public spending at European level making up the Community budget.
What Europe needs today more than ever is bold and visionary leadership; leadership which looks to future generations, rather than to future elections.
Our political leadership should not present Europe either as a 'coat hanger' for its responsibilities or as a necessary evil.
We must show the citizens what Europe really is: a decision in favour of peace, cooperation, development and social cohesion.
Â Â  Commissioner, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Juncker, first of all, it is my turn to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for its efforts and, above all, for its method, which was respectful of the institutions and very democratic.
I think that, in the years to come, whenever the situation becomes difficult, we will refer to this method.
Having said that, it is with real bitterness that I now address you following this summit and its result regarding, in particular, the financial perspectives.
Far be it from me to be provocative, but I am personally embarrassed and even ashamed at the image of national egotism presented by some European states.
Overly attached to their historical advantages, they have been taught a valuable lesson in Europe by the new countries.
Once again, the Council has illustrated a political adage from CorrÃšze: promises only bind those who believe in them.
The citizens, though, are starting to no longer believe.
Gentlemen of the CouncilÂ Â in passing, I would point out that there were very few women there and I think that parity within the Council would bring progress in the political habits of that institutionÂ Â so, gentlemen of the Council, what has become of your commitments to boost growth and innovation so that everybody can find a good job, a place in our society?
Keeping your word is doubtless an antiquated, outmoded virtue, but, at the foot of the budgetary wall, the Councilâs word disappeared into thin air.
What we were afraid of in Parliament, therefore, happened in the Council.
The resolution that we broadly adopted, though, was very moderate in view of our projects and, over seven years, enabled certain policies to be developed realistically.
That is my only satisfaction as an MEP and as a European citizen.
We in Parliament are prepared to continue negotiations with the European Council as soon as it has its feet back on the ground, but above all when it has resumed the progression of a true political project.
Each country still needs to be convinced that the added value that we gain as 25 Member States is much greater than our contributions to the European budget.
Our European utopia does exist, but it needs a broader, more generous, more ambitious, more humanist vision with greater solidarity, shared by the citizens and respected by the Council, so that, together, we can confront reality and future challenges.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this first half-year has been especially full of major challenges for the future of the European Union: the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, the relaunch of the Lisbon Agenda, the ratification of the Constitution and the financial perspectives.
The Luxembourg Presidency, in its commendable effort to address them all, has confirmed its own political ability and its determined support for the Community project.
It then suffered an unfortunate setback in the European Council last Thursday and Friday, which, without doubt, does not help Europe to build an effective relationship with the citizens, a relationship that is genuinely based on the element of trust.
I must, however, add, Minister, that I was not so impressed with the position of the current Presidency on the resources for the cohesion policy in the next programming period.
With regard to the original, very restrictive proposal, a step forward was made at the start of the summit, which I personally do not believe was satisfactory, and which, in fact, if it were translated into an agreement, would not have provided an adequate response to the demands for balanced development in the regions lagging behind.
Parliament, however, had sent out a significant positive signal by approving the BÃ¶ge resolution by a large majority and by reaching full agreement with the position of the European Commission.
Is it possible that all of that is of no importance whatsoever?
Is it possible, therefore, not to take account of the opinion of 426 â that was how many of us voted â democratically elected Members?
Personally speaking, I hope â and I conclude â that after last weekâs unpleasant test, a balanced agreement is reached, mindful of the prevailing positions, and that that occurs as soon as possible, without indulging in the extended time still available.
Â Â  Mr President, as the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democratsâ coordinator on our parliamentary steering group for the Lisbon strategy, I should like to start by expressing a degree of satisfaction.
Satisfaction about the fact that under the Luxembourg Presidency, the Lisbon strategy was given another shot in the arm and can really get underway now that this last, particularly tricky summit has approved the integrated guidelines.
What this shows is that social cohesion, sustainable development and the new emphasis on growth and jobs remain priorities shared by the three institutions.
We know that the Member States play a leading part in this strategy, now and in future, but also that Europe has a task of its own.
In order to be able to carry out our part of the bargain, we need money; the failure to reach agreement on the financial package means that this is not, or is in any case insufficiently, forthcoming.
It is shameful for various reasons, which have been explained here by others, certainly in respect of the new Member States.
What is particularly unfortunate is the embarrassing manner in which the lack of political will to further develop the European Union together was exposed.
And to develop it into what?
Let us make good use of the active period of reflection, which we do, after all, have at our disposal.
We should use that time to turn the European Union once more into a project with visible added value, added value for all those people who worry about their jobs, who worry about their companies relocating and who are frightened by immigration. People who find the EUâs enlargement too much to handle because they were given far too little information in their own countries and who also fear the globalisation process, which they do not know to be guided in one way or another.
Should there be a supreme being, should Zeus still be around, he should be able to fall in love with Europa once again.
I think we should ensure that we offer the people a Europe of that kind, a Europe with charisma, a Europe that is attractive once more.
The Luxembourg Presidency is now coming to an end.
I am sure that I speak for many when I say that I continue, even once June is past, to count on your commitment and your conviction.
I also think that I speak for many, Mr Juncker, when I say that we are grateful for your transparency and your honesty.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to begin by commending the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency on their endeavours to prevent the European Council disaster.
To paraphrase Mr Juncker, the European Council was not a failure of the Presidency, but a failure of Europe.
It was a huge disappointment.
The citizens expected a strong message, but received a response that was devoid of quality, of ambition and of a rallying idea.
The Union thus missed out on a unique opportunity to convey an image of strong, unified leadership.
European leaders were not equal to the task that history had set them.
National interests prevailed over the Unionâs values and selfishness spoke louder than solidarity.
Let us now take this opportunity to look for answers to the citizensâ questions, such as: What is Europeâs role in the world?
How do we increase productivity and competitiveness in a globalised world?
How do we reduce unemployment?
How do we implement social cohesion?
What social model should we follow?
Europe may be at a crossroads, but history teaches us that it is at times of crisis that the best transformations can be effected.
Let us hope that we prove capable of transforming difficulties into opportunities.
The world has changed and the citizensâ concerns and needs have changed.
The EU must keep up and must begin by forging a new relationship with the citizens.
Change does not mean changing something so that everything remains the same, as one of Lampedusaâs characters suggested â that would be a confidence trick.
Europe can live without a Constitutional Treaty, but it is doubtful whether it could live without agreement on the Financial Perspective.
Europe must be a political Union, an area of cohesion and solidarity, and not merely a free trade area.
This is the challenge facing the forthcoming Presidency, which I hope is capable of giving us a pleasant surprise.
Â Â  Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to put the case for proactive reflection rather than turning round and going back.
We are glad that Europe can again breathe with two lungs.
In the Council, there appear to be those who are playing the ânew for oldâ and âfuture not pastâ cards.
While this House adopts the Constitutional Treaty by a two-thirds majority, there is no shortage of Heads of Government who cannot get a majority for more democracy, citizensâ rights and transparency in their own countries.
While the European Parliament, out of the desire to make the European Union more effective, efficient and economical, adopts the Financial Perspective, there are Heads of Government sitting on the Council who disregard their own decisions, ignore treaties, undermine the common goal of developing the European Union further into a political union and fail to abide by the rules of the institutions, believing as they do that they can cope on their own.
I get the impression that there are too many for whom mass appeal in their own countries is more important than their responsibility to the Community, who prefer to blame others rather than share responsibility and opt for egoism rather than solidarity.
If you want to regain the publicâs confidence in the European project as a success story, you cannot make them believe things, you cannot take them for mugs or ignore their worries and fears; instead, you have to meet them halfway, tell them how things are, do what you have decided to do and keep to what you have agreed.
If you want to put an end to double standards behind padded doors, you have to give parliaments more of a say in decision-making processes and say a resounding yes to the Constitutional Treaty.
If you want to replace egoism with solidarity, you have to contend for the social market economy.
If you want to stop the majority being held to ransom by the minority, you have to want a stronger Europe of citizens and parliaments.
More and more, I come to the conclusion that all those who are really serious about seeking political union and putting this continent in a stronger position on the world stage really must be committed to thinking, designing and implementing the federal state, the united states of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Juncker, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking PresidentÂ Juncker for the way in which he reported on this European Council.
I think that it was a great moment to hear a description of the work of the European Council, in application of the concept of transparency.
It was very useful for such a report to be given in this House.
I thank him, too, for the conclusions to which he managed to bring the European Council with regard to ratification of the Constitution.
I think that each population is free to decide whether or not it wants to continue with this process.
In addition, a pause is vital because what can we do when a question is asked and we do not have the answer?
Nobody yet knows what the French or Dutch will say in future, on what text, under what conditions.
It is a question that is still ahead of us.
I would, however, like to give certain speakers and perhaps the Members of the Commission or others a warning.
Saying that there is a problem of communication, and that it is because of this communication problem that two referenda resulted in a ânoâ, is a mistake. It is to imagine that the citizens do not understand.
That is what this argument implies.
I think that the citizens knew perfectly well what they were doing when they voted, and claiming that they voted the wrong way because they did not understand is, in a way, advocating a return to selective suffrage.
I do not imagine that anyone in this House would call for such a development.
On the issue of the budget, I think that the Luxembourg Presidency has tried everything.
The question is not really whether we are faced with national egos.
It is whether we want to continue with a strategy of going the extra mile and of European added value.
For this reason, we need to establish whether or not this terrible logic of a fair return, which was instituted by MrsÂ Thatcher several years ago and clearly continues to be favoured by some, must finally be sent back to the drawing board.
In that respect, I think, MrÂ Juncker, that you have made some good proposals.
We must continue with this debate.
What I think is a shame is that, in the end, the grand ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy will not be served by the financial perspectives they need.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the summit and, not least, the circumstances surrounding it, are symptomatic of the deep crisis that we are in, and which has been precipitated by the dramatic way in which the public have denied us their allegiance.
That much is apparent from what the voters in France and the Netherlands have done, and in doing it they surely represent many others.
Their motivations as individuals may differ, but what underlies them can be found throughout the European Union.
If we are to regain the publicâs confidence, we have to bring about a change in direction and a change in European politics.
I have only a few comments to make on this.
For a start, we do not want a constitution.
The mere term âconstitutionâ is redolent of a European superstate; nobody wants one, and we are not even trying to build one.
What we do need, though, and urgently, is a basic agreement setting out how decisions are to be taken in the European Union, and how the institutions â Council, Parliament and Commission â relate to one another.
We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights in an agreed form.
Such are the essential elements of what we need, and of what will enable us to organise and manage a Union of 25 or even more Member States in an orderly fashion.
We have to enable the public to understand and get a handle on enlargement, and that means that Europe needs borders.
A halt must be called to the process of enlargement until such time as we have consolidated the last additions, and I would also point out that most people in Europe would feel themselves affronted if the accession negotiations with Turkey were to start on 3Â October.
What is needed is a privileged partnership with Turkey, rather than for it to become a Member State.
My final point is that a new culture of subsidiarity is called for in the Commissionâs bureaucracy.
The Commission must give thought to how many regulations have to be enacted in Brussels and about the point at which the Member States should assume responsibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Council, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, when you took over the Presidency in Luxembourg, you had to deal with a natural disaster in the form of the tsunami.
Now, you are concluding your Presidency with a summit that has produced neither decisions on the budget nor a new treaty.
Unfortunately, few people talk about the excellent foreign policy decisions taken.
Thank you for all you have achieved.
During its period of office, Luxembourg has ensured that Bulgaria and Romania will become Members and that Turkey will be allowed to begin negotiations in October.
You have made history, and I would thank you for that.
Europe is emphatically not in crisis, because the debate is most certainly not now about countries wanting to leave the EU.
Rather, what has emerged from the referenda is that people want the EU to do more of the right things and the Council to concentrate on the right things, a state of affairs that would be better for the future.
People want us to be clearer about the objectives, that is to say more jobs, a proper state of affairs in the labour market, social responsibility, international solidarity, the fight against crime, sustainable development and gender equality.
At long last, we are obtaining a debate in our Member States about the future in which Europeans now wish to participate.
It is not enough for ourselves here in Brussels to do lots of good things if no one knows about what we are doing or takes any notice of it
I am hopeful and I look forward to a lively debate, but this time involving everyone who wishes to participate.
Let us not therefore wear sackcloth and ashes, be issued with yellow cards or be depressed.
We should pause for thought but not be passive.
Let us challenge people and call for them to be committed and to provide answers to questions as guidance on how we want the EU to develop.
We need to listen more and talk less.
That is difficult for us politicians, but it would mean that we should emerge strengthened from this period of reflection.
Finally, the debate is about politics and the future and objectives of the EU, and it is something I welcome.
Â Â  Mr President, while we, along with everyone else, regret that no financial agreement has been reached, I think that we should also consider the positive aspects.
After all, a large majority of this House has spoken out in favour of cutting back where possible but also investing where necessary, which was also the thrust of the BÃ¶ge report.
In the Council too, the differences have become more negligible than many people had thought possible.
I appreciate the presidencyâs efforts in this respect and also what Mr Juncker said, namely that he tried to reach out to the Netherlands even further.
I am not saying this for selfish reasons, but only to indicate that a country such as the Netherlands does not mind paying up.
If, however, newspapers carry reminders, year in and year out, that the Dutch contribute many times more than other rich countries, then the Netherlands, having been a pro-European country, will eventually end up being sceptical.
The Netherlands will soon need to get back on track in a referendum, and we must all find our bearings again.
We must also learn from those referenda.
There were many reasons for the no-vote.
Something that definitely played a role is a certain fear among people of how fast enlargements are carried out and of where they will stop.
We must explain in more specific terms that enlargements are not detrimental to us, but beneficial and what they have brought us.
We must also ensure that the enlargement processes that are currently underway remain credible.
That means that not only the position of candidate Member States must be taken seriously, but also the criteria we prescribed in respect of enlargements, and that guarantees must be put in place to this effect.
We all carry some of the responsibility in this, not least with regard to the criterion that Europe must be able to handle the enlargements.
We have not had an easy time of it, and if anyone was able to cope, it was this President of the Council, MrÂ Juncker, and his team.
It is impressive how he, time and again, underlined the idea that Europe is about cooperation, is more than just a free trade area, not only in his work and during negotiations, but also here today when he reminded us about the end of the Second World War sixty years ago with all the empathy one would expect.
I told Mr Juncker a moment ago that he is a leader of a small country but a big leader in Europe, and I am convinced that, if we carry on as he has begun, we will soon harvest what the Luxembourg Presidency has sowed during this difficult time.
I thank you, I thank the Presidency, and let us continue the good work.
Â Â  The ease with which Europe stumbled into crisis sends a very disturbing message, namely that peace and progress in Europe are regarded by people and their political leaders as something self-evident, but they are not.
If it is true that they depend on an increasing cohesion of European nations, of their mutuality and solidarity, then all of us who believe in the European idea must, at this very time of crisis, place in much sharper focus the dilemma we now face.
Will we be capable of giving the idea of political union some new impetus, some new inspiration, and can we move ahead, or will we be content merely with a common market, and in this sense take a step backwards?
Almost twenty years ago now, it was determined correctly that a common market alone could not provide an adequate response to the challenging issues facing Europe.
And twenty years later this idea can respond to these needs so much less.
If we have therefore found ourselves in a crisis, then I propose that we do not resolve it with some minor corrections, but rather that we focus back on the fundamental issues.
This includes â and I do not advocate the approach of Prime Minister Blair, although I would like to draw attention to a certain position of his which seems to me relevant to our deliberation over this future â whether from the aspect of the Lisbon objectives it is right for us to allocate almost half of the Unionâs entire budget to agriculture, while we are so effortlessly willing to cut financing for the fundamental measures and instruments of the Lisbon strategy: science, education and technology.
I believe that these are the relevant, fundamental issues that we should now be addressing.
And the more courageously we respond to these issues, the greater our chances will be of finding a good solution to the bind in which we find ourselves.
Â Â  Mr President, discouragement and determination are two words that begin with âdâ and which I believe accurately reflect the feelings of Mr Juncker today and of many Members of this House: discouragement in view of what happened at the European Summit, determination to face the future: discouragement, because Mr Juncker, on describing the debate on the financial perspectives to us, sounded like an auditor heading a team of accountants.
And I would put the question: who was talking about Europe when the financial perspectives were being negotiated?
Nobody talked about Europe.
Everybody talked about their national interests.
Actually that is not true, Mr President: some people talked about Europe, those we call the ânew countriesâ talked about Europe, the countries of the last enlargement.
I believe that, if there has been an example of vision and ambition at this Summit the vision and ambition that has always characterised Europeanism then that example has been given by the new countries.
I therefore propose that we stop calling them ânew countriesâ, because they have shown that they do not need to take lessons in Europeanism from anybody.
Like Mr Lamassoure, I too believe that we will certainly have to reflect upon the system of own resources.
We tried that in the Convention â some of you will remember â but there was no way of introducing anything.
In fact, there was a small group in the European Convention considering how to introduce a new system of own resources into the Constitution.
We will have to return to this issue.
With regard to the Constitution, Mr President, I believe that what is going to happen in practice, which is the suspension of the referenda, is a good thing: this is not the right time to hold more referenda and we must dedicate ourselves to debate.
I therefore believe that the idea of establishing the end of the Austrian Presidency as the time for relaunching the process is a good one and I believe that this Parliament must begin to consider what it is going to do in the future.
In this respect, the resolution that will be voted on tomorrow contains a clause that moves in that direction and I believe that it conforms to that âdâ for determination that Mr Juncker urged us to show and that I am sure this Parliament will agree with.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Luxembourg on three things: firstly, on having defended the European Constitution during its Presidency of the Council firmly and with determination, which it signed, like the governments of the other 24 Member States, on 29Â October 2004.
Secondly, on having maintained its referendum.
And thirdly, because Mr Juncker spoke very clearly yesterday, at the summit with the United States, when he used a phrase that filled me with pride and emotion: âEurope is not on its kneesâ.
That is more or less what those of us, for example, who represented this Parliament as observers during the Lebanese elections that ended this weekend, said: Europe exists and furthermore it is useful, not just for the Europeans, but also for the rest of the world.
We should reflect, I agree, but to what end?
So that we can remain in limbo, so that we can go backwards, have less Europe, come to a halt and ultimately allow the rhythm of the world to overtake us?
No, not for that reason: we must reflect so that we can continue to make progress, that is to say, to bring the European Constitution into being.
I believe that we must state very clearly that, if we believe that the European Constitution is good, it must not be renegotiated and that, however long it may take, the citizens must express their opinion on it, either directly or by means of their parliaments.
I would like to remind you, Mr President, that it is not the case that there have only been two referenda so far and that they have both said ânoâ: there have been three referenda: the first was in my country, with 77.7% voting in favour of the European Constitution.
In fact, if we add up the âyesâ votes and the ânoâ votes in the referenda held to date, there are more âyesâ votes than ânoâ votes, and far more countries have said yes to the European Constitution than no.
But we are facing the usual problem: a genuine debate between Eurosceptics and Europeanists, between those who want more Europe and those who want less Europe.
I am one of those who want more Europe and I therefore believe, from the point of view of the left, that what the citizens want is more and better Europe, a more democratic and more efficient Europe.
And that is why we need this Constitution, which is a point of balance, but above all a point of progress.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, to return to what PresidentÂ Barroso said, I would first of all like to say thank you to MrÂ Juncker and his team.
I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on having been, for almost six months, a good Presidency, I could say a full Presidency, without a momentâs rest, a committed Presidency, a political Presidency and an effective Presidency.
True, the last Council did not give the results we were hoping for, but MrÂ Juncker has given us a clear explanation of the content of the negotiations, of the British rebate and of the funding of the common rural policy, which represents, I would remind you, just 0.4% of the EUâs GDP.
We were a few millimetres from agreement, when the Presidency and the Commission had succeeded in getting most of the delegations to move kilometres, and that is really something to regret.
I think that there is one subject on which the Council has been particularly discreet, to a certain extent appropriately, and that is the subject of enlargement.
I, though, would like to be a little less discreet by saying that it is clear that this Presidency, up to the end of June, and the next one will have to ask themselves whether, with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, we can make it seem that, and act as if, nothing had changed since DecemberÂ 2004, as if Turkey had not slackened its efforts, as if Europe had produced a Constitution and as if it had produced a budget: it has no Constitution, it has no budget and Turkey has slackened its efforts.
Therefore, I would say very clearly that I think that, at the moment, we are not meeting the Copenhagen criterion on the ability of the EU to take on new members without losing momentum, and I would simply say, MrÂ President, that it would send a very strong signal if we said to the people: Europe is taking its destiny back into its own hands by being able to state where its borders are.
Â Â  â Mr President, it has been said that the small countries are organising and setting their seal on the big presidencies of the European Union with their work.
This was confirmed in the most decisive manner by the Luxembourg Presidency, by MrÂ Juncker personally and by the foreign ministers, MrÂ Asselborn and Mr Schmit.
The European cycle gave the Presidency to Luxembourg at a particularly critical turn on the path towards European unification.
Following the negative referenda in France and the Netherlands, the European Union is now in a state of institutional, political and strategic crisis.
This crisis was confirmed and reinforced by the breakdown of the European Council, despite the brave and honourable efforts made by the Luxembourg Presidency to broker a reasonable compromise on the subject of the new financial perspectives.
At this European Council, it was not only political will that was lacking.
Unfortunately, there was a serious lack of political leadership and management of European developments.
It is a European Council of political confusion and political cowardice, as the conclusions record.
It is a European Council of the deconstruction and deregulation of the objective of deepening European integration.
It is a European Council of the deconstruction of political union and social cohesion.
It is a European Council typified by the fear of the leaders in the face of the fear of the citizens.
A typical example is the reference to the enlargement procedure.
As the fabricated fear of enlargement affected the ratifying process in France and the Netherlands, it was judged expedient to dedicate literally two lines, almost hidden away in the conclusions, to a strategic plan to foster peace, security, stability, development and, more importantly, the political and social democratisation of the candidate countries.
A strategic plan which gave people hope of breaking out of the vicious circle of underdevelopment and autocracy and putting European principles and values into practice.
This strategic plan, which made the European Union a strong, international factor, is not defended by anyone today in the face of the fear cultivated by the more conservative and xenophobic political forces in Europe.
The Luxembourg Presidency was lucky to have institutional backing for its difficult task from the European Parliament.
At the same time, however, it was unlucky to have next to it a cowardly and weak President of the European Commission with no political vision.
To close, I must say that, above all, the Luxembourg Presidency had the courage to go ahead with the referenda in these difficult times.
Â Â  Mr President, last weekâs European Council was a clear reminder that the European Union cannot carry on with business as usual following the French and Dutch votes on the Constitution.
The decision to pause for reflection on the Constitution merely underlines a lack of direction across Europe.
When two founding Member States reject the Constitution with no expectation of holding a second vote, it is hard to see the logic of continuing the ratification process.
We would have preferred the Council to have acted decisively, accepted the will of the voters and moved on.
Of course there still is a time for a real debate about Europeâs future.
Like the British Government, we believe that Europe must face up to some profound questions.
The move to political integration has reached its high water mark.
It is against this backdrop that, with respect, I have to disagree with the President-in-Office when he said that he did not believe the French or the Dutch voters rejected the constitution.
Such statements damage the relationship between politicians and the people, and if ever there was a time for politicians to demonstrate that they are listening, it is now.
It would be folly for Europeâs leaders just to ignore the reality of what has happened.
This crisis was avoidable: for many years my party has argued for a more flexible Europe.
For too long the European integration process has carried on as a project of the political elite.
That is now over and we, the representatives of the people, are now charged with conducting further debate on the kind of Europe we want to see.
Those of us who have opposed that integration process have often been criticised, and many in this Chamber believe it is the only way forward, but it is not.
In the coming months we will argue positively and enthusiastically for a different kind of Europe that goes with the grain of public opinion and not against it; a Europe that gets away from the obsessions of the past and moves forward with the peopleâs real agenda, which is jobs, growth and prosperity.
That is the way to re-engage the electorate with the European Union.
I regret that on this occasion the Council failed to show the necessary leadership.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Juncker and his dedicated political colleagues in his excellent diplomatic and civil service on the job they have done over the last six months.
He has demonstrated, yet again, that it is quality and vision that count in the construction of Europe.
I would also like to express my admiration for the new Member States, for their solidarity and forward-looking effort to avoid the breakdown of the budget negotiations.
As has been said repeatedly, they are not the cause of the problems of Europe.
They in fact give us far more and offer us far more in terms of a peaceful, secure and prosperous future than we can offer them.
I would also like to remind the House that 28 states â not 25 â participated in the Convention and that at least Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania should be included in any debate now about the future of Europe.
I believe that if they are going to be full members of this Union within a number of years then they have a right to participate in debating what kind of Europe we are going to have.
Today Mr Juncker gave us a master class in transparency, frankness and humanity.
This is the kind of politics that the people of Europe are crying out for and I would urge this House to insist that from tomorrow onwards all presidencies and all Commissioners meet with the standards set by Mr Juncker today.
My group leader, Mr Schulz, has launched a five-point European agenda which seeks to kick-start the process of re-establishing the self-confidence of Europeans.
I would like to ask Mr Juncker in the remaining days of his presidency, Mr Borrell and Mr Barroso, to support that initiative and demonstrate to the people of Europe that we have a future together.
We must ensure that we do not leave the people of Europe to the likes of MrÂ Bonde and his ilk in other parts of Europe.
It would be a betrayal of the sweat and blood of our parents and grandparents and the lessons that they learned from having a divided Europe; from having a Europe which is locked behind its own sovereign borders, unable to share power and unable to share a future together.
Â Â  â Mr President, my speech will be shorter, as Mr Juncker has already mentioned many of the questions I wished to express an opinion on in his very honest and comprehensive speech.
That is why I should like to convey to him a personal thank you and also thank the entire Luxembourg presidency for its extremely important work.
It is a great pity that the success that we had hoped for is still to be achieved.
Now some words on the essence of the problem.
Evidently, our electors, our people still do not understand that we face new challenges.
If it was perhaps the case a few decades ago that we still had the Berlin Wall, we still had the cold war, and that this perhaps instinctively united people and allowed them to take common decisions more easily and to vote for them, none of that is present now.
Perhaps people still do not perceive or understand this new challenge, this global competition that Europe faces, and not just every one individually, but Europe as a whole.
That is why this medicine, this Constitutional Treaty, is essential.
That is why it is also essential to look at what are Europeâs values; and Europeâs values today are obviously its people, for we have to take into account the demographic situation, which unfortunately is not a progressive one for Europe.
I know that it is not progressive for my nation, but neither is it progressive for the whole of Europe.
If we are becoming fewer, then every individual must be of a higher quality.
Therefore our chief task is to invest in people, in peopleâs education; that is our future.
Â Â  Mr President, the European crisis that has resulted from two referenda is a clear indication that the political elite is not in touch with the people.
There is such an enormous difference between the propaganda and reality that the voters have stopped listening.
If, for example, solidarity towards the new Member States is nothing more than a mention in a speech in honour of a special occasion, the people do not need to believe anything else that is said.
The mood now is that a referendum can be organised on any issue at all, and the answer will always be no.
The leaders of nations have only themselves to blame.
They lack the courage to tell the electorate that there is no alternative to globalisation, and that it cannot be opposed through political decisions, but that we could adapt to it by taking the right decisions.
The same leaders, who in speeches complain that the Lisbon strategy is very much late in coming, allow a situation where not even the decisions agreed in one country are implemented in their own.
Instead, Brussels is blamed for the problems and setbacks.
Referenda are not entirely appropriate as a tool of pan-European decision-making.
National governments and parliaments should have the courage to make the necessary decisions.
Explaining and justifying European policy is always a local issue, if we want people to understand our good intentions.
In the end, however, the bills for our common decisions are paid for out of national budgets, and, consequently, only the French Government can explain to its citizens with any credibility that the position of agriculture in this continent has changed, and only the British can make their own citizens understand that the rebate Britain receives on its EU contributions originated in former times and in different circumstances.
Â Â  Â Â Â The polarisation of Europe we are currently witnessing is a result of the EUâs financial crisis, which in turn has been triggered by its institutional crisis.
It would appear that Europe risks being divided into two camps; on the one side advocates of closer political integration combined with efforts to achieve a more social Europe, and on the other supporters of a Europe limited to the single market, with a looser institutional framework.
The point I should like to stress is that the EUâs future is not a matter of choosing between these two approaches.
The EU must continue to move towards a more stable institutional framework, just as it must reform its budget and concentrate its resources on areas that will allow us to compete on a global scale.
The incoming British presidency has gained considerable popularity in Central Europe as a result of its efforts to drive forward financial reform and economic modernisation.
Yet such efforts must not go hand in hand with a weakening of the institutions.
Similarly, there is public support for France and Germanyâs attempts to achieve closer political integration, but not if this involves inefficient welfare systems and protectionist approaches being set in stone.
We must settle the political dispute over economic and social strategies within the bounds of the existing institutional playing field.
The EU will not find a way out of its current crisis if it tries to lay down its institutional framework at the same time as deciding on the content of specific policies.
In other words, it must not attempt to mark out the playing field while deciding who has scored how many goals in which net.
The incoming presidency has a unique chance to make its attempts to reform the EUâs budget and economy more credible, namely by ensuring that its first objective is to achieve a more stable institutional framework on the basis of Parts One and Two of the Constitution.
Â Â  Â Â Â I too should like to start with a few words of thanks.
I should like to thank the Luxembourg presidency for its work, which has been both highly professional and of first-rate quality.
I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the European Council, Jean-Claude Juncker.
Although he comes from a small country, MrÂ Juncker is a great statesman and a great politician, and he has demonstrated quite clearly that small and medium-sized countries can also play a large role in Europe.
In order to do so, they must remain true to the ideas that underpinned the gradual construction of Europe after the Second World War.
I refer to such ideas as Europeanism, solidarity and the placing of European interests before individual, and often selfish, national interests.
It is my belief that Jean-Claude Juncker will always serve as a fine example, in particular for the new Member States, or in other words the small and medium-sized countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
I should also like to congratulate the Luxembourg presidency on the solution which it put forward to the problems surrounding ratification of the European Constitution, and which enables those Member States that so desire to continue the ratification process.
I believe that the people of Luxembourg will vote âyesâ in the referendum to be held on 10 July.
I hope that politicians in other countries, including my own country, the Czech Republic, will be equally courageous and allow their citizens to take part in referenda.
I should like to raise one final issue that has not yet been touched upon, namely EU enlargement.
Accession treaties were signed with Bulgaria and Romania during the Luxembourg presidency.
In common with the majority of Members of this House, I supported this move, and despite the events in France and the Netherlands, I still believe that it was absolutely the right one.
Regardless of the problems we are facing, we should not ignore the fact that the unification of Europe is in the interests of Europe as a whole, and in the interests of our history.
Last yearâs enlargement demonstrated that the problem does not lie with the new Member States, since they are acting with the utmost responsibility, whether with regard to ratification of the Constitution or to last weekendâs summit.
I believe that Romania and Bulgaria will act equally responsibly after they join in 2007 or 2008.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make three points.
The first point is that we should not blame Luxembourg; quite the contrary: it did an excellent job with the presidency and showed what small countries can do while running presidencies in general.
The speech today from Jean-Claude Juncker was one of the best that we have heard in this House for many years.
Secondly, we need a positive vision.
I am sick and tired of listening to everyone blaming everyone, coming up with scapegoats.
The two worst scapegoats that I have heard so far are firstly enlargement and secondly the liberalisation of markets.
I do not think the results of the two referenda or the European Council should mean that we close the borders of Europe and stop competitiveness.
Quite the contrary: the best thing that has happened to us in the past ten years are the last two rounds of enlargement.
We must avoid protectionism and we must avoid nationalism.
The third and final point that I wanted to make is that in Europe we now have a leadership vacuum.
It is clear that France and Germany are no longer the engine of Europe.
Someone needs to come and pick up the pieces and drive things forward.
In the media it seems that Tony Blair would be the person.
If Tony Blair is the person, he needs to do two things.
Firstly, he needs to argue for more, not less Europe. Secondly, he needs to combine this with economic reform.
If he can do this he can grab the leadership vacuum, but unfortunately what we have seen and heard from Tony Blair when he has tried to get into the heart of Europe in the past is something that can be called âNATOâ: âno action, talk onlyâ.
Â Â  Mr President, sadly, I do not believe that the statements given here today deliver on the expectations of our citizens.
They do little to restore the credibility of the EU as a global player.
Furthermore they will not deliver on a forward-thinking budget that the 21st century EU requires.
The opportunity to overhaul the EU budget and to leave behind the antiquated system has, I believe, been missed both by the Commission and the Council.
We are now faced with a budget where the only flagship policy is agriculture.
This does little to captivate the imagination and aspirations of those we serve and has huge anomalies â not least vis-Ã -vis Luxembourg, the richest EU country and, at the same time, the largest net beneficiary.
The Europe of today needs to face up to the challenges ahead and we need to learn this lesson now.
Our citizens want us to create a better Europe, which means more economic growth and employment stability.
Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, how can you justify cuts in the very areas that people want in terms of research funding, growth and jobs?
Clearly we are not listening or delivering on our citizensâ priorities.
Finally, with regard to transparency, many people are asking why these talks are taking place behind closed doors.
I suggest that if the Council wants to connect with the people out there, then it should leave these doors open and let the citizens hear the debate.
All I can say is that I hope the UK presidency will make this its number one priority.
Roll on the British presidency!
Â Â  â Mr President, having congratulated the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and the other members of the Presidency, I should like to comment on the two points which dominated the last meeting of the European Council.
Point one: procedure for ratifying the Constitution.
The entry into a period of rethinking is bringing to the surface creative material for institutional, political and strategic self-criticism.
My question to the Vice-President of the Commission is this: how does the Commission intend to address citizens' criticism about over-regulation and the excessive technicality of legislative proposals?
Seriously, what has become of the White Paper on European governance?
My question to the President-in-Office of the Council is this: is there sufficient consultation of and information for civil society before and after the adoption of decisions by the Council?
My question to the President of the European Parliament is this: will the European Parliament be equal to its important role as a political body, as a forum for creative discussion of the stated will of the people, of the ?
The only way out of the constitutional and political crisis is to establish a permanent, transparent and democratic dialogue with civil society.
If the constitutional crisis is not resolved by 2007, then we will need to move either towards a constitutional review or in the direction of 'Nice plus' or, finally, towards the option of reinforced cooperation.
Î€he second point refers to the financial perspectives: we are being called upon to realise that ambitious objectives require the necessary financial resources.
Enlargement also requires enlarged resources.
The restoration of the historic and political unity of Europe brings to the surface new definitions of cohesion policy, a policy which signals, as a horizontal principle for the old and new Member States, a Europe of stability, of solidarity and of social prosperity.
It is to this eminent political position that the common agricultural policy aspires.
Â Â  Like many of my colleagues, I would like to begin by thanking Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Council and his colleagues.
I awaited the results of the European Council in Vilnius, Lithuania, and watched Mr Juncker's press conference on television after midnight on Thursday.
He looked very well and his emotion did little harm, but some others, to put it mildly, did not look so good.
I do not doubt that the new Member States, including Lithuania, will appreciate the last six months of the presidency and the personal contribution made by MrÂ Juncker.
Luxembourg has clearly demonstrated that the well-known definition of this state as âsmall, but notableâ is true.
What would the European Union be without you!
History and past experience clearly shows that Europe, the European Union, was always strong when it gave precedence not to national interests, the demonstration of states' power and the personal ambitions of certain political leaders, but to common values and solidarity without denying internal competition, the engine of all progress.
I believe that today, knowing and appreciating the results of the European Council, as well as the French and Dutch ânoâ to the European Union Constitutional Treaty, and considering the nature of the United Kingdom's vision of the European Union, we also ought to analyse the cause of the current situation very carefully.
The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty should not be an end in itself, and agitators and expounders will be of no help in this situation, no matter how highly qualified they are.
The citizens' Europe proclaimed by us should become a reality, and this means that we must listen attentively to the voice of the citizens if we want to avoid renewed disillusionment.
Analysis shows that in France and the Netherlands the European Union Constitutional Treaty was largely rejected because the door was left open to Turkey to become a European Union member in the future.
We also notice that the most sensitive issues today are employment, new jobs, the growth of economic competition and the further expansion of the European Union.
These should be the signposts in our dialogue with the citizens of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the Council President is known throughout Europe as an excellent and experienced negotiator.
We have to look elsewhere to find the reasons why we are standing here today empty-handed.
Many people have spoken here today about Europeâs crisis, but this is not quite right.
It is not Europeâs crisis; it is the crisis of the 15, and not only in a geographical sense.
We need a new agreement, and one that clearly should cover much more than just money.
Some want to speak about Lisbon, and about competitiveness.
Well, let us do it!
But let all twenty-five of us be involved.
We cannot negotiate on competitiveness if our hands and feet are tied.
We must review the regulations on free movement of persons â it is high time in any case.
We must not make the same mistake with the free movement of services as we did with persons.
When we were unable to resolve an issue politically, we put up administrative barriers.
Some want to speak about agricultural policy.
Fine, but I would remind you that we in the ten new Member States are contributing considerably from our own resources.
It is important that there should be a financial agreement, but it is even more important that we should avoid a situation where the new Member States are bound hand and foot once again by a multitude of administrative obstacles regarding how funds are spent, because it looks as if that is the direction we are heading in.
If we need a new agreement, then one of its pillars must be to solidify the enlarged 25-member Union.
Over the past decade and a half, we in the ten new Member States have vigorously cleared the hurdles, despite all the difficulties.
To invigorate Europe â as Europe seems to need such â all twenty-five of us must strive vigorously for solidity.
Over the past year, there has not been much evidence of this.
Perhaps now things will change.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, there can be no question that the outcome of last weekâs European Council has cast a shadow on the six-month Luxembourg Presidency.
A great deal has already been said about the reasons for this fiasco.
I myself concur fully with the views expressed by PresidentÂ Barroso at the start of the debate, and in particular with his comments on the reasons why no compromise was reached on the Financial Perspective.
I disagree with the view that the EU is facing a long-term crisis, and I believe that the deadlock on EU expenditure will soon be broken.
At the same time, however, I should like to emphasise most strongly that the new Member States must not suffer as a result.
European solidarity must not fall prey to conflicts between the 15Â old Member States.
We will never achieve dynamic economic growth in Europe if nearly one quarter of the EUâs population is deprived of the substantial support it will need over the next few years to overcome the effects of the political and economic division of Europe that was imposed upon the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.
The EU as a whole needs to work together to this end.
It is in the vital interests of the richer Member States to invest in the new Member States in order to accelerate their development.
A strong cohesion policy and free movement of services provide the best means of achieving this goal.
As a member of Parliamentâs Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I should also like to pay tribute to the Luxembourg Presidency for having instigated what has been termed a period of reflection in the debate on the Constitutional Treaty.
This was a very judicious move, and one that is essential if we are to maintain a healthy European democracy.
The outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands cannot be ignored without widening the gap between Europeâs elite and its citizens.
Those who have called for the ratification process to be continued without any period of reflection, as though nothing had happened, would achieve the very opposite of their intentions.
They would forfeit any chance of achieving genuine democratic legitimacy for the European project, perhaps for many years to come.
I am quite sure that by taking its foot off the accelerator, the Luxembourg Presidency has steered the EU round a dangerous bend as far as this issue is concerned.
I should like to take the opportunity to express my particular thanks to Prime MinisterÂ Juncker and MrÂ Schmit for having done so.
Â Â  â Mr President, a whole series of my colleagues has successively congratulated the Luxembourg Presidency.
I am doubly proud today because a country the size of the country which I represent has produced leaders who demonstrate that they can talk without mincing their words and who can also stand as leaders beyond the borders of their own country.
Little Cyprus, which qualifies as a positive contributor on the basis of certain questionable statistics, cannot be a positive contributor while, at the same time, Great Britain has the privilege of refunds.
The criterion of agriculture cannot be used for the contribution to gross national product; it must be the social balance between town and countryside, the combating of urbanism and the protection of the environment.
You have promoted the Lisbon process, the failure of which to date must again be blamed on the Member States.
You have achieved the Stability Pact on which the governments of the Member States at the time knew how to compromise, because this was a particularly burning issue for them.
I also wish to congratulate you on your contribution to the common position on the EU-Turkey Association Council, which must count as one of your achievements, and to congratulate you personally, Mr Schmit, on your contribution to action to find a package of proposals on Cyprus, which will form the basis on which a dialogue will be held, in a good climate, between the two communities, in order to resolve our problems.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to join those who have congratulated the President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr Juncker, for the real efforts that he made to try and reach a decision on these very difficult and complex issues at the European Council last week.
In retrospect we realise that Mr Schulz was right that we in the Parliament had done our work, the Commission had done its work, but the Council, for reasons of overcharge on its agenda, had not actually done the real thinking on the financial perspective.
Therefore, to have completed a deal within the space of two weeks was perhaps a little bit beyond the capacity of the Union.
No deal is better than a bad deal.
Now we need to look forward and there are four points I will raise quickly.
The first is to have a real debate about priorities of the Union.
How can you have a financial perspective unless you know what the policy priorities are going to be?
Part of that must be the economic reform agenda.
Mr Watson referred to the UK and France being in Jurassic Park.
I think the economies of France and Germany are the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.
We have to make sure that there is an economic dynamism that shows we can be competitive in the global economy.
Second, we need to be able to fix a budget deal.
Not, as Mr Barroso said, to have a seven year deal with a review.
Let us come back to what we said in the Berger resolution and have a five-year deal, allowing the Commission and Parliament to review it in 2011.
This way we can see how far we are going without having to predict what our expenditure will be too far into the future.
In reconsidering that option we need to do more, as Mr Virrankoski said, on co-financing on agriculture.
Third â and I include two last points here â we need to look at the question of the Constitutional Treaty.
I welcome the suspension of ratification, because there are many things that are needed in terms of transparency, accountability, democracy and inclusion of national parliaments.
This will be essential for a Union of the future.
Last, but not least, is the question of enlargement.
Mr President-in-Office, what you do not do when you are putting a house in order is put up a new annex and then try to make sure you are still expanding.
Let us, as Mr Nassauer said, focus on what is really essential for our European citizens and then think about enlargement, if necessary, a little bit further on.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European project is currently characterised by uncertainties and concerns, yet this is also a time that encourages us to look to the future.
By dint of the fact that Europe has become ambitious, it takes stock and asks itself fundamental questions.
The ambition was to create an inclusive, integrated justice system, characterised by human dignity and capable of setting an example to the world.
Europe drew up a Constitutional Treaty that enabled it to break free of the confines of offices and to go out onto the streets.
The debate on the European Constitution has, undeniably, seen the greatest democratisation in Europeâs history.
Europe is seeking a public domain characterised by transparency and trust.
Ultimately, there can be no turning back on this odyssey; Europe is duty bound not to abandon this ambition of political sharing.
Furthermore, Europe must not think solely on its own.
Without an integrated Europe there is no European model and without a European model we cannot set an example of human dignity around the world.
It is only through political integration that decision-making can be effective, that our system of values can be placed on firm foundations and that Europe can speak with one voice.
Parliament must be proactive and visible in the times ahead; it must work in a network with the national parliaments; political parties, local authorities and citizensâ groups must play their part; and the media must also become involved.
In this regard, the European institutions have a responsibility that they must fulfil unflinchingly, given that the European debate is not merely a sum of national debates.
The Constitution fits into this process of searching for consensus in an open and fragmented reality.
Through the Constitution we have a duty to raise awareness of our shared interest.
Accordingly, there are themes that must be addressed: the enlargement and governance; the EUâs financial model; the decision-making process and subsidiarity; integration and social, economic and political pluralism; the Constitution as a driving force or the Constitution as a framework.
Paths are made by walking.
Â Â  Mr President, as my Groupâs coordinator on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to congratulate the Luxembourg presidency for the outstanding work it has done, not just on moving to close a number of crucial files such as unfair commercial practices, but also in its very strong engagement with the work of our Committee and its very strong commitment to the internal market.
I particularly want to thank the Luxembourg presidency for the fact that, under the leadership of Minister KreckÃ©, it has moved forward with the vital work on the Services Directive.
I am delighted that there has been no question of the Luxembourg presidency being intimidated by noises off from certain great figures in European politics about the problems with that directive, of how they have sorted it out, and of how they have killed the directive in some cases.
President-in-Office, I have been pleased that you have been as committed to the vital project to complete the internal market as we are on our side, and we will continue to work strongly with the British presidency to bring it to a conclusion and to build on the work that you have done.
If I may, I would like to link that point to some of the important remarks that the President-in-Office made this afternoon.
I wanted to pick out one aspect where I disagreed with him: he said that one of the choices we are faced with at the moment is between a free market and a stronger political union.
I would suggest, colleagues, that is not the choice at all.
We have moved far beyond a free market already: an internal market is an entirely different proposition.
It is a major political and economic force.
Our citizens want and understand that, but I ask those of you still here in the Chamber how many of your electors know what a political union is, and know in what direction it is taking us?
Surely one of the reasons why the Constitution was rejected so soundly in Holland and France was because people do not understand what a political union is.
They actually feel threatened by the potential loss of sovereignty that it implies.
Therefore, let us get on with the internal market.
We may want to review where the political union goes and the changes we make to the Constitution, but the internal market must continue to be the driving force during the British presidency.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all I would like, on behalf of the President-in-Office of the European Council, on my own behalf, on behalf of all the other Presidents of the various configurations of the Council, and also on behalf of the whole of the Luxembourg Presidency, to thank you all for your congratulations, your positive assessments and, above all, for the encouragement that you have expressed during this debate.
It is true that Europe is experiencing serious difficulties, but I think that these difficulties can help us.
First by making us refocus on a more in-depth reflection on the development of this Europe.
To an extent, that is what has been decided: a reflection, not behind closed doors, in secret, but a reflection-debate, a reflection-dialogue with the citizens on the path of European integration that we must follow.
I think that, if our current difficulties can help us to open those doors, to open that debate, then, in the end, they will have had a purpose.
Some have referred to the idea that the negative votes were motivated by a number of concerns expressed by the citizens, particularly social concerns or those raised by globalisation.
In short, all of that needs to be included in this debate, included in this dialogue with the citizens.
We in Luxembourg are taking the risk of holding a debate-election, a debate-referendum: we are the ones who have stuck with the date of 10Â July.
It is a courageous decision, but it is a decision that was called for by the people of Luxembourg.
