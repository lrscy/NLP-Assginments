Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the best results within the environmental field are achieved when everyone involved is given the opportunity to participate in the process.
Improving the general public' s access to information on the environment leads to increased environmental awareness.
The citizen must therefore be made central to environmental policy if we are successfully to be able to make the adjustments required in order to guarantee sustainable development.
The importance of public participation in shaping and implementing environmental policy was emphasised as early as at the time of the Rio Declaration.
Without access to information on the environment, it is difficult for people to participate and bring pressure to bear.
That is why this proposal for a greater right to information on the environment is so important.
In 1998, the Member States signed the UN/ECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters - the Aarhus Convention.
This Convention is a major step forward in implementing Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and in continuing the process of transparency that began with Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment.
Before the Community can ratify the Convention, the Community' s current legislation must be adjusted.
That is also one of the main aims of this proposal.
Another main aim is to remedy the shortcomings identified in the practical application of Directive 90/313/EEC, adopted in 1990.
One of the most important features of the Commission' s proposal for a new directive is that it would provide the right to information on the environment instead of freedom of access to information on the environment.
A more detailed definition of information on the environment is also provided and a closer deadline set before which authorities have to supply information.
The exceptions are also clearly defined, and it is proposed that authorities should actively supply the public with information on the environment and that they should only be able to refuse to supply such information if disclosure might adversely affect private or public interests protected by the exceptions.
Since the issue of public authorities was raised, I am able to say that the Commission has approved Mrs Korhola' s amendment defining 'authorities' .
This is entirely in line with the Aarhus Convention.
When public services too are privatised, as is now happening in the United Kingdom, it is up to the responsible national authorities to ensure that information on the environment is still supplied to people.
The Commission' s proposal covers the most important obligations under the Aarhus Convention and, in certain respects, goes further.
The proposal nonetheless allows the Member States to decide how these obligations are to be put into practice.
The Commission' s proposal has definitely been improved in the course of the last few months, and I should like to thank Mrs Korhola and the European Parliament for the good work that has been done.
Thanks to this, I am convinced that it will be possible to adopt a common position at the Council' s meeting in June.
A number of Parliament' s amendments are aimed at adapting the Commission' s proposal to precise wordings in the Aarhus Convention.
In general, the Commission is able to approve these changes.
However, we cannot approve those changes which deviate significantly from the Aarhus Convention.
We think that certain amendments would lead to unduly detailed regulation of the issues included in the proposal.
I want to emphasise that this is a framework directive.
The main objective is to establish basic conditions for ensuring public access to information on the environment.
I therefore believe that the Member States ought also to be granted a certain flexibility in transposing the directive into national legislation.
One issue which came up during the debate was that of how we are to deal with registers.
The proposal provides for the possibility of setting up registers in the Member States, but this is not an obligation. No rules are laid down for compelling the Member States to set up registers.
Finally, I just want to say a few words about public access to information on the environment held by the EU' s institutions, since this issue has also been touched upon in the debate.
I am currently investigating various alternative ways of ensuring that the Community' s institutions also fulfil the obligations under the Aarhus Convention and I intend to come back to you on this matter as quickly as possible.
Naturally, we must first wait until the proposal being discussed right now has been dealt with.
We in the Commission cannot now approve the amendments affecting this particular issue because they fall outside the scope of this directive aimed at the Member States.
I also want to say a few words to Mr BerniÃ© concerning the Life programme and different Life projects.
I personally believe it is incredibly important that we should supply information and be completely open when it comes to the Life project.
We nonetheless come up against the problem of the Member States' saying that this is information which they themselves have produced and which they do not therefore agree to the Commission' s handing out.
It is precisely this problem that is dealt with in the discussion of Article 255.
These are issues to which we must return by proposing how we are to adapt the EU' s institutions to the Aarhus Convention, and I promise you that we shall return to this matter as quickly as possible.
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve the whole of Amendment 3 and partly approve Amendments 1, 11, 15, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26 and 28.
The Commission is able in principle to approve Amendments 13, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23 and 24.
The Commission is unable, however, to approve Amendments 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 22, 27, 29 and 30.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0018/01). We shall deal with questions to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 47 by (H-0191/01):
Subject: Labelling of meat with place of origin During February, a Eurobarometer opinion poll showed that support for the EU's plans for enlargement eastwards was in serious decline in several Member States.
In the three most populous Member States - Germany, France and the UK - a majority of respondents were opposed to enlargement.
These findings come at the same time as mad cow disease is at its height in most Member States.
When the EU enlarges to include more members, the geographical area from which our agricultural products originate will expand considerably.
It will then be even more difficult than at present for the public to know where a particular product comes from.
In order to help overcome the lack of confidence in meat producers, can the Commission envisage proposing the introduction of compulsory labelling of meat products with their place of origin, either on a national or regional basis, so as to improve information to consumers?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in July 2000, when the European Parliament and the Council approved a compulsory labelling system for fresh and frozen beef and veal marketed in the Community, that represented a first step towards greater transparency and the restoration of consumer confidence.
Today, as we experience a second serious crisis in beef and veal production, the compulsory labelling system can start to prove its worth, because every piece of beef or veal is now retraceable, and it is clear where the animal was slaughtered and cut up.
And from the beginning of next year, this information will be supplemented by an indication of the place of birth and the place where the animal was reared.
With regard to the labelling rules for beef and veal products, which cover all types of food preparations containing beef or veal, the Commission must adhere to the timetable laid down in Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, which means that it is required to present a report to the European Parliament and the Council by 14 August 2003 on the labelling of these products, including any appropriate proposals it sees fit to make.
In the framework of the general labelling provisions, however, the Commission is working on a proposal regarding the indication of the meat and offal content of all foodstuffs.
This proposal would be another major step towards greater transparency in relation to meat products.
I would thank Commissioner Fischler for that answer and note that, on the issue of meat' s place of origin, the places in which the animals concerned were born and bred will, as from next year, have to be stated.
In that case, will the name of the individual farm be stated, or just the name of the district?
I ask this question in view of the lack of confidence in agriculture felt by more and more consumers.
That applies especially with regard to the meat industry here in Europe at present.
It is therefore important that this information concerning the origin of meat and other agricultural products should be available as soon as possible.
Allow me to inform Commissioner Fischler about a company in my home district of Mora in Dalarna.
The company, which is called Siljanet and whose innovator is Anders Lindberg, has introduced a form of data labelling for which a patent has now been applied and which enables meat to be traced back to the individual farm.
It was showcased at a conference on 6 March in Brussels.
Mr President, if I may reiterate the point somewhat more clearly, why is this distinction made?
The provisions that entered into force on 1 September of last year relate to indications on the label providing information that can be ascertained at the abattoir.
Every animal has a numbered ear-tag, and if I pass the tag on with the meat, the meat can be retraced to the animal.
Secondly, the place of slaughter is obviously a piece of information I can provide at an abattoir, and I can also state where the carcass was cut up.
The other problem that has been acute since 1 January 2001 is that we also wish to indicate the places where the animal was born and reared.
I cannot establish that information at the abattoir, however, unless the animal comes to me with its life history, so to speak, and for this to work properly we need a suitable form of computerised registration.
This is where we have the problem, and it is also the reason why the second part of the system has to come into general use at a later date. The fact is that not every Member State has been keeping the requisite data for long enough to have every animal' s place of birth stored in a computer.
Even on 1 January 2002, this data will still not be available for every animal, but it will be possible to make a very precise distinction by that date.
High-quality meat and meat bearing a seal of quality will have the required information on its label, normally in the form of a code rather than a printed name.
From that point, no other meat will be marketable as quality meat.
That is the procedure.
Question No 48 by (H-0193/01):
Subject: Aid for the livestock sector in countries affected by BSE In recent years, cases of animals affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy have been discovered in various countries after the United Kingdom had exported animal meal to them at a time when sale of the product had already been banned in the UK.
At the time when it occurred the European Union granted the United Kingdom substantial aid to tackle the crisis.
Now that other States are experiencing cases of mad cow disease, pubic opinion expects similar Community aid to that offered to the country which was at the origin of the disease. Otherwise, we shall again be faced with the paradox, described by President Prodi when presenting the Commission' s work programme for 2001 to the European Parliament, of a Europe that is ever more necessary yet which is seen as ever more remote.
What funding did the European Union provide for the measures taken to resolve the BSE crisis in the United Kingdom and what percentage of the expenditure did this aid represent?
What funding is available and what percentage of the expenditure will the European Union provide to cofinance measures to assist the countries affected by this new BSE crisis?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to address the problems posed by the first BSE crisis, when the export of beef and live cattle from the United Kingdom was banned, Britain introduced the so-called 30-month rule, whereby the meat of all animals slaughtered over the age of 30 months was destroyed.
A calf-processing premium was also offered for the early slaughter of calves, not only in the United Kingdom but also in France, Portugal and Ireland.
In the four years from 1996 to 2000 in which the 30-month rule has applied in the United Kingdom, the cost to the EU budget has been EUR 1 275.4 million.
This amount is equivalent to 70% of the purchase price of these animals, since 30% of the purchase price and the entire cost of disposal were to be met by the UK.
In each case, 80% of the amount was paid when animals were slaughtered, and the remaining 20% was paid on presentation of evidence that any meat-and-bone meal produced from the carcasses of these animals had been burned.
It should, however, be noted that the entire cost of slaughter and safe disposal was the responsibility of the UK.
The calf-processing premium has been funded in full from the Community budget.
For the four Member States I mentioned, where these premiums were made available, the total expenditure amounted to EUR 326.6 million, of which 235.4 million went to the United Kingdom.
The Community action to tackle the first BSE crisis, however, also included full funding of public storage and an early-marketing premium for calves as well as additional direct aid amounting to EUR 1 309.9 million.
This direct aid - the early-marketing premium and the grants for public storage of more than 700 000 tonnes of meat - benefited all the Member States.
To tackle the present crisis, the Commission has not only provided EUR 238 million for interventions and 700 million for the destruction strategy but has also recently presented the Council and Parliament with a proposed package of measures for the beef and veal sector, comprising both intervention measures and other special market measures designed to reduce the production of bovine meat in the period from 2001 to 2003.
In addition to the sum of around EUR one billion that has been voted for the 2001 budget, this entails further expenditure of 157 million in the year 2001 as well as additional expenditure of 1 145 million in 2002 and 181 million in the 2003 budget.
The Community will also meet 70% of the cost of the buy-out operation and the special arrangements; all other costs must be met by the Member States.
The storage of intervention stocks will be fully financed by the Community as hitherto.
Thank you for the information you have just given us, Commissioner.
Given the exponential growth of Community expenditure in this sector, do you believe that the various Member States affected by the second BSE crisis will actually be able to meet these requirements with the resources likely to be available to the Commission in the years 2002 and 2003?
Mr President, annexed to the package of measures we presented a fiche financiÃšre, which shows quite clearly the items of expenditure that will be incurred and how we intend to finance them.
In this respect, the funding is guaranteed from our point of view.
We expect to remain below the limit agreed in Berlin for the 2002 budget too, especially in view of the development in the euro/dollar exchange rate, which was not foreseen in Berlin, and because our export trade, especially in wheat, is continuing to flourish, while expenditure has been lower than anticipated in some other areas.
This means that we are able to take up the slack that has developed in these areas in order to help the pressurised cattle farmers while still operating within the ceilings that were adopted in Berlin.
There is a great deal of concern in Galicia, Commissioner.
This is an Objective 1 region affected by BSE where a model plan to combat the disease is being strictly implemented.
Commissioner, I should like to know whether, under the measures you referred to, direct aid to farmers is already being provided or will soon be.
In particular, since I have been asked to query this, have any specific measures been authorised or are there plans to do so concerning heifers aged between 9 and 24 months? Also, are there plans to adjust the special premium for the slaughter of steers, changing the criterion from age to weight: 185 kilos?
These are the requests I have received and they would be useful in the context of combating this disease.
Mr President, I am sorry that we always have a bit of a delay, but translations take a little longer than speakers' speeches.
Let me say the following in answer to the questions from Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna: first of all, we are already spending all available funds on the points in our proposal.
In the 2001 budget we have no additional funds available for use as direct aid to farmers, for example.
This is also quite a different situation to the first BSE crisis, because at the time of the first crisis the old agricultural guidelines were still in force, and they were far more liberal. Expenditure is now governed by the considerably tighter limits that were adopted in Berlin and reaffirmed at the summit in Nice.
In other words, the Commission is not at liberty to exceed the prescribed limit.
As far as the Objective 1 areas are concerned, operational support is not an option here; the most that can be done is to provide support in connection with investments, agri-environmental schemes and suchlike.
For that reason, I cannot see any possibility of paying special income-support grants to farmers from Objective 1 resources.
Thirdly, I should like to point out that, in view of these circumstances, one option does, of course, remain available, but only within the framework of the rules on state aid.
Within that framework, national support may be provided by the Member States.
However, the provision of such support is subject to the proviso that aid awards must be notified and must not exceed the limits laid down in the rules governing state aid.
) Mr President, I just put two very specific questions to the Commissioner.
He dealt with one, but has not replied to my question concerning premiums for beef.
Perhaps it was not conveyed through the interpretation. I should like to repeat it if I may.
Will the Commissioner authorise specific measures for heifers aged between 9 and 24 months and will he adjust the special premium for the slaughter of steers, changing the criterion from age to weight, namely 185 kilos?
He has not provided an answer to these queries.
Mr President, there is only one slaughter premium.
The slaughter premium is regulated in the common organisation of the market and is the same for all animals.
For that reason, I cannot give you a more detailed answer - at least not to the question that was conveyed to me in the translation.
Question No 49 by (H-0137/01):
Subject: 1996 Convention on the Protection of Children The 1996 Convention on the Protection of Children is widely regarded by those of us who are involved in child protection as a very valuable instrument which will make an essential contribution in a wide variety of areas of child protection.
It is paramount that any new development of a system of child protection within the EU should not impede the implementation of the 1996 Convention.
Given that certain questions of competence in this field have been raised at EU level, can the Commission give assurances that Member States may proceed to ratify the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of 'parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children' without delay?
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which resulted in the transfer of the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters to the first pillar, the Council adopted in May 2000 the Brussels II regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses.
This regulation sets out rules on jurisdiction, automatic recognition and simplified enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for children.
As a result, in these areas, accession to the 1996 Convention on Parental Responsibility, to which you refer, has become a matter of Community competence.
This means that in these matters that I have mentioned, Member States can no longer proceed to ratify the 1996 Hague Convention on Parental Responsibility on their own.
The Commission is fully conscious of the need to reinforce European Union action in this area, both internally and externally and, as the honourable Member suggests, to do so without delay.
To this end, the Commission plans this month to adopt a working document on the mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility.
It is in this context that Community accession to the 1996 Hague Convention on Parental Responsibility is at present being considered.
Would the Commissioner be in a position to say whether there is universal support for the ratification of the 1996 Hague Convention?
Just in case there is any confusion, this is not the Hague Convention on Parental Child Abduction - that dates from 1981. I am talking about the next one.
I understand that there may be some problems concerning ratification by some Member States.
If there are, could you tell us (a) what the problems are, and (b) which Member States are concerned?
We have to clarify that conclusion of the 1996 Convention lies partly within the exclusive competence of the Community, because the rules in the Brussels II regulation are also affected, and partly within the competence of Member States, because the Convention has a much broader scope that goes far beyond the limits of parental responsibility deriving from the Brussels II regulation.
The working document that the Commission is producing this month will have two main targets.
The first one is the follow-up to the Brussels II regulation, which we have talked about on a previous occasion, because we recognise that it is necessary to go beyond the Brussels II regulation to guarantee parental responsibility at Community level. But on the other hand, there is scope for Member States to adopt the Convention and therefore we think they should do it without delay.
We must recognise that it is necessary to clarify the way the Union can accede to the Convention, to improve the conditions under which Member States can ratify the parts of the Convention that do not fall under Community responsibility.
I do not have any indication of Member States having specific difficulties with the 1996 Convention but I know that only one Member State - the Netherlands - has ratified it up to now.
Mr President, the Commissioner has made it very clear that the Convention in a sense falls into two parts: those parts covered by Community law and those parts covered by the Member States.
But, as Mrs Banotti has indicated, the Convention is a holistic document and it would be wrong if some Member States had only part of it applied to them through the Community law method and did not ratify the other part.
Now I know it is partly at the Commissioner's responsibility, but will he, in pushing forward the ratification of the Community part of the 1996 Convention, also make it clear to Member States that it makes sense for them to ratify the rest of that Convention at the same time so that there is no disparity between the Convention and the way it is applied in different Member States within the Community.
I totally agree with such an approach but, as the honourable Member will recognise, it will be extremely helpful if we clarify first of all the conditions under which the Community as such can accede to the Convention.
There are some legal problems because the drafting of the Convention only provides for Member States to be part of the Convention.
So we need to incorporate the fact that the communitarisation of the subjects of the Convention give the Commission and the Community exclusive external competence.
Once we clarify that, it will pave the way for Member States to ratify the rest of the Convention with the full support of the Commission because the Commission is committed to solving its own problem without delay.
Question No 50 by (H-0149/01):
Subject: Bank transfer costs Does the Commission believe that bank transfers in the Union, within the euro area, should cost the same as national transfers, as has repeatedly been called for by consumer associations?
Does it consider that the costs currently charged to senders and recipients of transfers involving large sums of money are excessively high and out of step with the single currency and the single market?
What legislative or negotiated measures will the Commission implement to ensure that bank transfers in the euro area and on Union territory cost as little as possible?
I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Member for his question.
The Commission shares his concerns.
It is our political goal to have the fees of cross-border and domestic transfers converge so that it will be no more expensive to transfer money abroad than to transfer it within the borders of a single country.
This statement and objective has been repeated by the Commission on numerous occasions. For example, in the communication entitled "Retail payments in the internal market" of January 2000; in my reply to Parliament on the Peijs report of 26 October 2000; and further in the Commission's round table conference entitled "Establishing a single payment area" of 9 November 2000.
I should like to stress that it is intolerable in a single-currency zone that charges for cross-border transfers exceed those for domestic transfers by several orders of magnitude.
However, the determination of charges and fees should be left to competition and market forces: European legislation should not aim at price regulation.
The introduction of the euro has only limited effects on transfer costs.
The reason is that the convergent costs of currency are only one element of the total transfer costs.
In fact, the currency convergence costs represent about 20% of the total.
The remainder - the other 80% - of the persisting high fees for cross-border transfers are mainly due to insufficient automation and standardisation.
There the Commission supports, and indeed promotes, the initiative aimed at changing and improving the present situation.
The Commission will continue to monitor the situation and keep pressure on the EU banks for the establishment of more efficient cross-border retail payment systems.
Commissioner, I am aware that you have spoken more than once on the subject of my question. However, I am taking it up on behalf of consumers' and users' associations.
Mere talk will not placate them. The way to earn their gratitude is usually by resolving the problems.
They have raised this concern on a number of occasions yet they continue to be informed that their consumers are lodging complaints about current practice which it is indeed difficult to accept. This is because transfers do not only generate a high cost at their point of origin.
They also do so at their destination, inasmuch as banks make unjustified charges when the transfer is initiated and the recipient bank makes unjustified charges at the same rate on receipt of the money. Current practice does not therefore seem to be in line with the aims of the single currency, due to enter into circulation on 1 January 2002.
What specific negotiating action could the Commission undertake in this connection, to give some satisfaction to consumers?
I reiterate and stress that the Commission shares the anger of consumers.
As I said in my first reply, it is not acceptable that cross-border payments are so much more expensive than payments made within the borders of any one country, so the concerns of the honourable Member are shared by the Commission.
However, I must repeat that the Commission is not in the business of regulating prices: the Commission cannot tell banks what to charge.
The Commission can urge the banking industry and national administrations to intensify their efforts in the following areas: standardisation, infrastructure of payment systems and simplification of reporting obligations.
To begin with the last point, the Commission has been able to achieve a certain success in avoiding the necessity to report operations under EUR 12 500.
Parliament and the Commission are at one in wanting to increase that cut-off point to EUR 50 000 per transfer.
I made that clear when I spoke on the Peijs report.
So in the matter of the simplification of reporting obligations, the Commission has been able to achieve a step forward.
On the matter of standardisation, there is IBAN, the international banking account number, and the BIC, the bank identifier code.
Both of these codes should make the transfer of money simpler, faster and cheaper.
The Commission is actively working on familiarising the general public with both the IBAN and BIC in order to make them use them for so-called straight-through processing and therefore cheaper transfers.
As far as infrastructure is concerned, the Commission is again active on this front and has introduced a new low-value payment system - a particular system for small payments - called Step 1 by the Euro Banking Association.
That has been in operation since 20 November 2000 and ought to contribute to more efficiency and therefore lower prices.
In addition to that, some sectors have established their own systems, but only members or partners of those organisations have access to those systems.
So I would assure the honourable Members that we share their concerns.
It is not the business of the Commission to regulate prices - price control is a thing of the past.
The matters which occupy the Commission's mind are, as I have said, standardisation, the infrastructure and simplification of reporting procedures and obligations.
The Commission is active in improving the situation.
No doubt, also as a result of competition, prices will go down. But at the moment they are far too high, and that is not acceptable.
Mr President, I agree with the Commission that it is not its job to fix prices.
However, it is its job to ensure there is proper competition in the EU market.
It is not true to say that the banks are operating a price ring and deliberately keeping the prices high because with globalisation there are fewer and fewer banks, which means less and less competition.
What measures is the Commission taking to ensure that the banks are not applying anti-competitive prices as a way of keeping their bank charges so high?
Mr President, I am not at the moment in a position to agree with Mr Titley's statement that there is less and less competition in banking.
That is something that would require further research.
However, it is certainly the business of the Commission to see that fair competition prevails.
As Mr Titley will appreciate, it is my colleague Mr Monti who deals with competition.
I know that Mr Monti has made certain investigations, but they were more concerned with the exchange of currency.
There are two different aspects involved here: first the cost of transferring money, which was the original question put to me, and secondly the cost of currency exchanges.
The Commission's investigations on this have not yet reached their conclusion.
The latter will, of course, be a thing of the past for the twelve "Euroland" Member States as from 1 January 2002.
Mr President, it is true that we live in an era of industrial change and reconstruction.
It is true that every day there are new acquisitions and mergers and that sometimes restructuring is synonymous with job losses.
This can have tragic consequences for the social fabric of any region, but particularly those regions where there is little potential for job creation.
The Commission appreciates that citizens and workers need to feel secure in this difficult time.
We believe that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels, based on full and transparent information.
The basic ideas that the Commission intends to highlight are as follows. The first one is that decisions and corporate restructuring are both a prerogative and a responsibility for the management.
This means that, when considering action that will have social consequences, companies should always actively try to find less negative and less damaging solutions.
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, everything possible must be done to assist with the redeployment of those concerned.
This requires forward planning, timely preparation and effective management of these processes.
Thirdly, nothing is more important than the social dialogue.
There must be timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation with workers' representatives and this must, of course, be before initiatives are launched or publicly announced.
Worker participation is not only a basic right but also a necessity if corporate restructuring is to be accepted.
Under the existing European legislation, employee representatives in merging companies may be informed and consulted on the potential social consequences of the announced measure.
There are concrete European directives which have been transposed into national law relating to collective redundancies, transfers of undertakings and European works councils.
But it is not for Europe to intervene at this stage as regards compliance with the directives.
They have been duly transposed into the national law of the Member States and any conflict or litigation arising from the application of the rules should be assessed by the relevant national authorities.
In my first point I concentrated on the social dialogue and the implementation of the existing European legislation.
My second point concerns the three enterprises concerned by the merger in particular, because they have considerable experience with restructuring and dealing with the social consequences and social dialogue and social partners.
In particular, if social measures were to be taken to assist the workers affected in order to redeploy them, to provide them with temporary income support or remove them from the labour market by early retirement before the ECSC Treaty expires on 23 July 2002, the Commission could, at the request of the government concerned, provide additional aid under Article 56 of the Treaty.
This is the aid commonly known as readaptation aid.
Mr President, I should like to express my thanks to the Commissioner for her extensive explanation.
I fully share much of what she says.
Like her, I believe that dialogue is necessary and that the directives concerning workers' rights and European works councils should be implemented.
You will, however, understand my concern when I tell you that I live in Asturias.
Asturias is a region that has undergone restructuring in coal, in mining, in arms manufacturing and in shipbuilding.
There have been dialogues and agreements with the workers, and there have been retirements and early retirements, which is what one of the chairmen of these three companies that we are talking about today is proposing for the Charleroi steelworks, for instance, which seems to be one of the first that will close.
My specific question, Commissioner, which probably already has an answer, is this: given that the Lisbon agreements talked about full employment, is it not awful to use public funds to create jobs in this way while continually losing jobs through company restructuring, privatisations and mergers?
The problem in Asturias, where there have been retirements and early retirements, is that young people today have no prospects because more than 30 000 jobs have been lost.
Of course I share with you the concerns we have just mentioned because it is an area with big problems.
But you know that the entire area - Valencia and Asturias - belongs to Objective 1 of the framework support.
Within this framework the government of Asturias can possibly make some changes to the proposed programme for the next six years and maybe they could acquire some money, according to the regulation on implementation of the European framework programme and according to the governmental rules.
There is a need to combine the Social Fund, the employment strategy and the finance of the employment strategy and the implementation of the European and national - in that case, Spanish - laws.
What we are trying to do in this case is to find a combination of actions within the framework of this information and consultation.
This would mean that we can organise training courses and we can finance them; we can support people in organising their own self-employment activity or small SME.
In some cases - and this is one of the cases in which it can be permitted - we have the early retirement system.
So we must find this combination and address the situation.
Obviously we cannot prevent companies from merging or making acquisitions.
Mr President, you too were born in the region of Asturias and so you are naturally concerned about matters involving our region.
A supplementary question for the Commissioner: do you believe that the main role for the Commission in this issue of creating or aiding large companies is to create a sufficiently efficient and competitive economic environment?
I mean, we believe it is much simpler to guarantee employment through providing companies with an efficient enough environment to allow them to compete with companies elsewhere than to maintain a restrictive social policy that often works against the interests of the workers themselves.
Your question is the fundamental question of how we can combine economic and social policies.
This is the main problem we face in Europe: how to combine competitiveness and cohesion.
As far as this merger is concerned, this is a field with many problems.
We have major acquisitions and mergers across Europe.
The only way to address this is not through legislation or restrictions concerning jobs.
After every merger or restructuring in the industrial field we must see not only the number of jobs lost, but also the number of jobs saved.
In some cases mergers, modernisation and acquisition are very important for the future of the sector.
So what we have to do now is to address both: to support the competitiveness of our companies and to see how we can address the implications of these mergers in our societies.
This is what I have just explained.
In this case there are three main elements.
You can use the ECSC Treaty. We only have one year now to use it.
The Asturias can be subsidised under the Treaty.
Secondly you can use the European framework.
And finally, you can use national money in order to organise or to implement social policies in the area.
Question No 52 by (H-0134/01):
Subject: Incorporation of the occupied territories of Cyprus as part of Turkey The Turkish Government has decided to implement a plan to incorporate the occupied territories of Cyprus as part of Turkey.
Measures envisaged under the plan include giving Turkish Cypriots and Turkish settlers Turkish citizenship, the settlement and distribution of land in the occupied territories, bringing the 'Turkish-Cypriot land register' under Ankara's control, etc.
These measures - which have also been confirmed in a Turkish newspaper interview by the Turkish Interior Minister, Mr Tzem - have been contemplated at the same time as the national plan is being drawn up under the EU-Turkey partnership which requires Turkey to take a positive approach to the Cyprus problem.
Does the Commission consider that the decision to incorporate the occupied territories of Cyprus as part of Turkey is consistent with the decisions taken at the Helsinki and Nice Council Summits, the relevant points of the EU-Turkey partnership, and UN resolutions?
Mr President, the Commission is informed that Turkey has approved a financial protocol worth USD 350 million over the next three years in favour of the northern part of Cyprus.
This money is budgetary support, designed to enable the northern part of Cyprus to implement the budgetary consolidation plan that was announced last year.
The decision on the financial protocol was taken on 12 January 2001 at the fourth meeting of the so-called Association Council of Turkey and the northern part of Cyprus.
Other points discussed at the same meeting relate to measures for the facilitation of trade.
These measures are likewise intended to contribute to the economic support of the northern part of Cyprus.
Mr GÃŒrel, a Minister of State in the Turkish Government, stated before the meeting that the aim of these measures was to overcome the economic crisis in the northern part of Cyprus.
He did, however, repudiate suggestions that Turkey sought to incorporate the northern part of Cyprus as its eighty-second province.
The Commission expects the Turkish side to make every effort to contribute constructively to the attempts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cypriot question that are being undertaken in the framework of the UN peace process.
If the stalled UN talks are to be reactivated, both sides must demonstrate genuine willingness to resume their dialogue and to engage in substantive negotiations.
The Commission will continue to give unstinting support to the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and of all interested parties to achieve a lasting peace settlement.
This applies both in political terms and with regard to the provision of the requisite information on the aspects of established Community law and practice that should be taken into account in any settlement of the Cypriot problem.
The Commission takes every opportunity to reiterate its position to the interested parties.
The Cypriot question is one of the subjects of the intensified political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey that the European Council launched at its Helsinki meeting in December 1999.
I thank the Commissioner for replying in his mother tongue, because we sometimes get the impression that, whereas we have a multilingual Parliament, with all due respect to the English language, we seem to have an English-speaking Commission.
However, I do not particularly thank him for the reply which he has given me.
I think that he underestimates the matter; we have a clear statement by Mr Cem on the prospect of incorporation and the threat of incorporation of the part of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish army as part of Turkey as we approach integration and I should like to ask the Commissioner, who spoke as if both sides had the same responsibilities: Cyprus, the Republic of Cyprus, is the first of all the candidate countries when it comes to chapters completed and approved.
What is going to happen?
What is going to happen?
Cyprus is just about ready for integration, technically speaking, but the political problem has still not been resolved.
Are both sides equally to blame?
Do both Mr Denktash and the President of the Republic of Cyprus bear the same responsibility?
What initiatives does the Commission intend to take?
Turkey needs to take a clear stand on this matter.
May I assure the honourable Member that the Commission does not underestimate this in any way - quite the reverse.
The Commission does not have the information that the honourable Member clearly possesses.
Only a few days ago, I had extensive talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister, and he did not mention this plan, of which you have evidently read or heard somewhere.
Nor have I heard from any other member of the Turkish Government that an annexation of northern Cyprus is planned.
I am not aware of any such plans.
If it were to happen, it would be a breach of international law and would have the appropriate consequences.
I have frequently made public pronouncements to that effect, and I am saying it again here.
You asked what happens next.
First of all, we shall continue the negotiations with Cyprus with no loss of momentum.
It is an important principle that our accession negotiations with Cyprus should not suffer because the political conflict has not yet been resolved.
At the same time, as I said, we are supporting the peace process with all the resources at our disposal, and we assume that the two processes - the peace process and the enlargement process - will support and reinforce each other.
At the moment, as you know, the peace talks have stalled. But without betraying any secrets, I can tell you that very strenuous efforts are being made in many parts of the world, in many capitals, to get these talks moving again.
Let me take the opportunity presented by your question to appeal earnestly to the representatives of the Turkish community in Cyprus to return to the negotiating table and to be prepared to contribute, through UN proposals, to a substantive and lasting settlement of the problem.
Thank you, Mr President.
I just want to inform Commissioner Verheugen that, last autumn in Mr Morillon' s report on Turkey, the European Parliament called upon Turkey to withdraw its occupying troops from northern Cyprus.
That proposal from myself was adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and by Parliament.
I wish to entrust Commissioner Verheugen with the task of requesting clarification from Mr Cem, the foreign minister, concerning what he said and what are his and the Turkish Government' s intentions, for I consider the information that has emerged on this subject at today' s Question Time to be very serious.
Mr President, may I thank the honourable Member for making that point.
The position of Parliament on this question is no different to those of the Commission and the Council.
I have very frequently discussed this point with all those whom it concerns, but at my next meeting with the Turkish Government, which is only a few weeks away, I shall gladly take up your suggestion and raise the issue again.
I can certainly assure you that nothing will change our view that the continued occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops is an infringement of international law.
Question No 53 by (H-0220/01):
Subject: Transitional arrangements for Poland and the Czech Republic What is the Commission' s position in the present debate concerning the transitional arrangements for Poland and the Czech Republic in the fields of freedom of movement, freedom to set up in business and freedom to purchase land?
Mr President, let me say to the honourable Member that the accession talks proceed from the principle that the candidate countries recognise the so-called acquis communautaire, the established body of Community law and practice, which is non-negotiable, and that they will apply it from the moment of their accession.
Transitional arrangements whereby the application of part of the acquis is postponed can only be authorised in properly substantiated cases.
In the strategy paper on enlargement which the Commission adopted on 8 November of last year and which President Prodi and I presented to Parliament on the same day, the Commission has laid down principles governing the treatment of requests for transitional arrangements.
The Member States have endorsed these principles, and they now form the basis of our work in this area.
They may be summarised as follows: transitional arrangements should not relate to the nature of the acquis but only to the postponement of its application for a fixed period; they must not cause any significant distortion of competition; they must include a clear implementation plan, including details of any necessary investments; in areas connected with the internal market, transitional arrangements must not be too numerous and must be of short duration.
Freedom of movement, freedom of establishment and free movement of capital are fundamental elements of the single market.
Under the agreed negotiating timetable, the European Union has undertaken to formulate a common position on this chapter by the end of June of this year, if the information provided by the candidate countries so permits.
Deliberations to that end, which include the examination of some requests for transitional arrangements, are currently taking place on the basis of the aforementioned principles.
This also applies to Poland and the Czech Republic, and may I add that one element of our negotiating mandate is that proposals for transitional arrangements can also be made by the Commission if such arrangements are in the interests of the entire Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I believe transitional phases should be as few, as short and as flexible as possible, and in that respect I very much welcome your reply.
However, I should still like to ask you about two specific points.
Firstly, do you consider it conceivable that there might be no transitional phases at all for these two countries in the three areas in question?
Secondly, may I ask whether you find it conceivable that, if there are such transitional phases, one side' s temporary derogation from freedom of movement in respect of certain groups of people will be balanced by the other side' s derogation from freedom of establishment for particular groups of people?
Mr President, I can answer the second part of the honourable Member' s question with a categorical no.
Not only do I regard such an arrangement as inconceivable; it would quite simply be non-negotiable as far as we are concerned.
We should resolutely resist any such attempt from the outset, but I have to say to you in all honesty that I cannot imagine that anyone at all would try to do something so utterly contrary to the spirit of the enlargement process.
What do I find conceivable?
I find it conceivable that we shall be able to define interests of both sides that need and merit protection in the three areas to which you referred and that, having defined these interests, we shall indeed arrive at a highly flexible, highly refined and highly specific system of transitional arrangements.
But at the present time I cannot make any precise predictions.
You know that the discussion process and the decision-making process on these issues have only just begun.
Our talks are still in their infancy.
I do expect, however, that it will only take three or four weeks until the first decisions emerge.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are forever discussing transitional periods and the related problems.
Can you imagine our introducing the notion of pre-accession transition periods, starting to iron out the problems now by means of bilateral agreements between countries and developing an incentive system to that end? In other words, for the key areas, which we all know and which are constantly being cited, we should devise a system of incentives that would enable us to solve these problems in advance, before these countries accede to the Union.
Let me say to the honourable Member that the Europe Agreements are in force with all these countries, and these agreements allow all Member States and applicant States to conclude bilateral arrangements on freedom of movement.
The Member States, however, have made very minimal use of this facility - if I am correctly informed, only Austria and Germany have done so - which compels me to conclude that there has never been a compelling need to conclude such arrangements.
Since the Europe Agreements are still in force, governments are naturally free to go on concluding bilateral accords.
I beg to inform the honourable Member that the Commission, in its communication strategy for enlargement, strongly advocates the involvement of local players such as communal authorities, town councils, members of regional assemblies, schools, chambers of commerce, craft and trade associations, unions, churches, societies and voluntary organisations as credible representatives of civil society.
The communication strategy will be implemented on a decentralised basis.
Our delegations in the capitals of the candidate countries will select cooperating partners there as part of a strategy designed to satisfy national and regional information requirements.
Local operators should, of course, take precedence in the selection of partners.
The underlying principle is that, because of the time constraints and the inherently restricted character of this project, we cannot create any completely new structures.
Nor do we have enough money to avail ourselves of the instruments of mass communication, which means that we cannot buy advertising space or write scripts for publicity spots on TV.
It is therefore entirely logical that we should use the existing communication structures in those societies as vehicles for our message.
Each of the institutions and organisations to which the honourable Member referred is a suitable vehicle in my eyes.
I am especially grateful to the honourable Member for asking this question because it gives me an opportunity to express my gratification at the commitment to this communication strategy that has been shown by the Members of this House and to state that the campaign in the Member States is currently suffering - and in truth has not really started in earnest - because the amount allocated to this project under the budget heading PRINCE has not yet been released.
May I therefore also appeal for your help in ensuring that the funds allocated to the information campaign are released as quickly as possible so that we can make a start now on the actual implementation, since time is gradually slipping away from us.
It would be a bit late to tell people about enlargement after the accession Treaties have been concluded.
As I said, the Commission is not planning an advertising campaign but is focusing on information, communication and scope for popular involvement.
At the heart of the effort, of course, are the major issues such as the preservation of peace, the extension of the stability zone in Europe and common access to the peace dividend after the end of the Cold War.
We shall speak about the economic benefits of sustained growth in an area of Central and Eastern Europe stretching from the Baltic down to Istria.
We shall speak of the efficient use of the division of labour that will develop smoothly in the enlarged single market, which is now assuming continental dimensions and which must compete successfully on a global scale with the Far East and North America.
We shall speak about the application of EU standards in the candidate countries - environmental standards, transport-safety standards, competition rules, provisions relating to internal law and order, food-safety standards and the many, many other benefits accruing to citizens of the Union.
Another important subject is the use of human capital, of the unique historical and social experience acquired by the people of the candidate countries, to enrich the future integration process.
Let me sum it up in one sentence: our aim is to create awareness of the fact that we have a historic opportunity to overcome, now and for all time, the division that was imposed on Europe.
I thank the Commissioner for a very thorough answer and ask him three questions.
First, does he agree with me that we have got to sell enlargement to, in particular, the people of the European Union?
If we do not sell enlargement we are likely to run into difficulties with ratification.
Secondly, how do these organisations get access to funds?
Do they have to go through the national offices of the Commission?
Is there information available on how they do that?
Finally, he did not cover my point about twinning.
Is it possible to have projects which twin, for example, schools in Member States with schools in the accession countries and also to twin local authorities in Member States with local authorities in accession countries, to discuss the implications of enlargement and what it means for the candidate countries?
Would it be possible to bring forward proposals such as that?
In answer to the honourable Member' s first question, may I say that it is indeed a matter of the utmost urgency that the people of our Member States should be made more aware of the enlargement process.
As you will know, this is one of my pet subjects, and my team and I have been working especially hard to achieve progress.
Things have certainly improved in this area, but the general level of public awareness is not yet satisfactory, and the subject is not one that sells itself automatically.
People must be told what is at stake, and we must address the anxieties, concerns and fears that are associated with enlargement and tell our people quite openly and clearly what we are doing to ensure that the contingencies they fear will not materialise.
Secondly, applications to take part in this project must indeed pass through our offices in the national capitals, because the whole project is decentralised, as I said before, and because we naturally wish to tap into the synergetic potential that exists in our Member States and in the candidate countries.
We are not the only ones, of course, who are active in this field.
Responsibility is spread somewhat more widely.
Others must also play their part in the communication process, and so it is only reasonable that we should devote part of our effort to the quest for coordination and cross-fertilisation.
That, then, is why the project is decentralised, and if you know of any organisations or groups that would like to be involved in this campaign, the right answer to give them is that they should contact the office of the European Commission in the relevant capital.
As far as the twinning of towns, schools, local councils, etc., is concerned, I believe these arrangements fall into the category of 'existing communication structures' .
My personal view is that town-twinning arrangements can be an extremely useful instrument in this context, because they enable us to operate through existing contacts and avoid the need to establish these contacts from scratch.
I also believe that exchanges between local politicians and schools are extremely valuable.
Our delegations and offices in the national capitals have been fully briefed on the eligibility of these schemes for support from the campaign budget.
Mr President, Commissioner, I only wanted to ask a supplementary question regarding the extent to which the Euroregions are incorporated into your strategy and the extent to which the candidate countries themselves will receive funding to enable them to obtain information from us about their own situation, because I believe our task is not only to inform these countries but also to enable them to converge with us.
I believe there are projects such as the planned Europa Centre at As in the Czech Republic and many others.
I wanted to ask whether this sort of thing is included in your plans.
My reply to the honourable Member is yes - the Euroregions are naturally included.
Indeed, they are an absolutely essential component, because we already have very close-woven information and communication networks at our disposal there.
I do not believe it would be wise for the Commission to provide the applicant States with money for their own public-relations activities.
I must say quite plainly here that I believe this would mean overstepping boundaries that we should not overstep, particularly in terms of interference.
This money is political money; its use is a very sensitive issue. No country should accept funds from an external source if they are granted for purposes of information or public relations.
The candidates have never asked us for funds for this purpose, but you know that they do engage nonetheless in these activities.
Thank you, Commissioner.
As time is running short, I would ask you to refrain from asking supplementary questions unless it is absolutely necessary.
Mrs Reding has agreed to answer Questions Nos 56, 57 and 58 together when their turn comes.
Question No 55 by (H-0188/01):
Subject: Exploitation of African footballers What action has the Commission taken with regard to the continued exploitation of young African footballers by either European soccer clubs of soccer agents?
. (FR) Mr Cushnahan has asked this question because he is aware that exploitation of young African footballers by clubs or by agents has received broad media coverage and that this exploitation stems from several problems which must be treated separately.
With regard to football agents, the Commission' s departments are still working on a process based on the rules of competition and the discussions that have taken place have led FIFA to change the ways in which the profession is organised.
These new rules came into force on 1 January 2001.
Some Member States also chose to pass legislation in order to supervise more closely the activities of football agents.
Raising the moral standards of the profession is a concern shared by the public authorities and by the authorities that represent football.
We should not, however, blame the whole profession for the improper behaviour of some of its agents.
The second problem is that of commercial transactions which involve young players.
The Commission was recently given the opportunity to show its concern about this matter.
The Helsinki report on sport, as well as the European Sports Forum, which was held in Lille in October 2000, pinpointed this problematic issue.
Furthermore, a whole workshop in Lille was devoted to the subject of protecting young people.
For reasons of competence, however, it is up to the Member States to pass legislation if they consider this to be necessary.
One Member State has already done so.
Generally speaking, all the issues concerning the exploitation of young African footballers are the subject of in-depth consideration by public authorities and, in the Nice Declaration, made in December 2000, the European Council expressed, I quote, its "concern about commercial transactions targeting minors in sport, including those from third countries, inasmuch as they do not comply with existing labour legislation or endanger the health and welfare of young sportsmen and women.
It calls on sporting organisations and the Member States to investigate and monitor such practices and, where necessary, to consider appropriate measures."
This is in line with the approach that we are committed to, and Mr Cushnahan, you know very well that I gave an answer on this subject in the debate on football transfer rules. It is also in line with the new rules on the protection of young people that FIFA would like to be granted.
As the Commissioner is under pressure of time, I will forego my right to ask a supplementary.
I appreciate the Commissioner giving me a very full and detailed response today on this and other questions. I just want to thank her for that.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 56, 57 and 58 will be taken together.
Question No 56 by (H-0219/01):
Subject: Impact of European Year of Languages on regional and minority languages 2001 is the European Year of Languages, which has just been officially inaugurated.
What impact does the Commission believe the Year of Languages will have on regional and minority languages and how does the Commission intend to follow up the Year of Languages to create a lasting impact on the position of those languages?
Question No 57 by (H-0239/01):
Subject: Multiannual programme for minority languages A whole range of minority organisations and representatives had hoped that the Nice Summit would result in a situation in which cultural matters would in future be decided on by qualified majority, so that decisions in favour of minorities or minority languages could no longer be blocked by individual Member States, as has frequently been the case in the past.
Can the Commission say how it assesses the present situation (after Nice), with specific reference to the situation of minority languages and a multiannual programme intended for these languages?
I shall try to answer all three questions at the same time.
They are not all identical but they are along the same lines.
It is too early to know what the impact of the European Year of Languages will be, so soon after its inauguration.
I can inform you, though, that already the whole of Europe is involved in an extensive debate.
There is an extraordinary fascination surrounding this event in our regions, universities and amongst the general public and it is not just for official languages, but for all languages, which is very significant.
Furthermore, several events and projects that have been funded for 2001 will fuel this debate and will even focus exclusively on regional and minority languages.
We expect there to be further contributions, from the European Parliament, which has commissioned a study into regional and minority languages, from the Committee of the Regions, which is preparing an own-initiative opinion on this issue, as well as from the Commission, which has begun a study into the economic and practical aspects of protecting languages.
At the end of 2001, the situation will be much clearer, thanks to all these initiatives, all these discussions, studies and research projects, enabling us to consider our options, instead of the various legal, political and practical commitments, which will shape the action we take in this area.
It will, therefore, only be at the end of the European Year of Languages that the Commission will be able to draw conclusions from all these activities and to determine what initiatives can be taken to safeguard linguistic diversity in Europe.
To turn now to the subject of linguistic diversity, it is wonderful to see that the Member States have included all languages in the decision that has been made on the European Year of Languages.
Not one was excluded.
The issue was dealt with entirely openly in all the Member States.
I think that this is very important and is a marvellous thing, and I would also like to reiterate that linguistic diversity is highlighted in Article 22 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This linguistic diversity has been put into practice in the Member States for the European Year of Languages.
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
Clearly, it is too early to draw any conclusions, but I believe some progress could certainly be made both on cooperation concerning language learning methods and on the preservation of unusual languages.
I know that the Commission is aware of the current difficulties when it comes to cooperation on preserving minor languages and I hope that the Commission is able to use some of the experience that has been accumulated in order to maintain and develop those cultures and languages that belong together.
During this European Year of Languages, I have been travelling extensively within Europe and I always begin speaking in Luxembourgish, in order to demonstrate that there are no minority or majority languages.
There are only mother tongue languages, which shape individuals and their environment.
Rest assured, then, that as a Luxembourger, I shall fight for linguistic diversity in Europe, for all languages to be respected and for progress to be made in the teaching of all languages.
Furthermore, thanks to the Socrates-Comenius project, there are already possibilities for cooperation, and I can inform you that many schools are taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the Comenius project to put the spotlight on learning regional languages.
I have two slogans for the European Year of Languages: 'mother tongue plus two' and 'learn your neighbour' s language' .
In a Europe made up of regions - and I am pleased that the Commissioner responsible for a Europe of the regions is sitting beside me - we must learn the language of our neighbours, especially in cross-border regions in order to have a successful Europe of the regions.
Therefore, the ideas of learning your neighbour' s language, your mother tongue plus two and regional languages are all contained in this slogan.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the Commissioner for her commitment in this area and to thank her for that.
She has tackled this issue with an enormous amount of dedication and enthusiasm.
But unfortunately, the perception of the Luxembourg people is not shared throughout the Union, and there is still a great deal to do in this respect.
That is why I was particularly disappointed that it was not possible at the Nice Summit to bring this matter into the realm of majority voting.
We must resolve the various minority situations before they develop into problems.
We need a preventive strategy.
We have 60 minority situations in the European Union today.
In the continent as a whole there are a total of 300.
Even though the unanimity principle continues to apply, making certain policies difficult to pursue, perhaps a way could be found by means of structural support.
Could I ask the Commissioner for her opinion on such an approach?
To answer Mr Ebner' s question, I would like to say that, of course, the people of Luxembourg are completely trilingual, but other people can also master three languages.
All they have to do is follow the example of Luxembourg, where children start learning several languages at the age of five or six, and this is a successful formula.
So, on the subject of unanimity and majority, cultural questions always require unanimity.
With fifteen Member States, it is therefore fairly difficult to take decisions that represent a step forward.
That is also why the European Year of Languages falls under the umbrella of education.
I very consciously placed this event within the sector including education, training, linguistic diversity and the learning of several languages, because this area affects most people.
Commissioner, first of all I should like to thank you for your answer and very briefly request that, since the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties and the Treaties state that the Community must contribute to the enhancement of the cultures of the Member States and to respect for regional diversity, it should ensure that those Member States within which several languages that also have official status coexist can take part in organising the events planned for the European Year of Languages.
That is, you have said that no State had excluded any language from taking part.
That in itself is good news, but it is not enough for them to be able to take part.
It is very important that representatives of the peoples that use these languages should also be able to take part in the body that is to organise the events, as stated in the report we approved at the time, in order to guarantee their presence and enhancement.
I can reassure Mrs Ferrer that Catalan has not been omitted.
That would have been absolutely incredible because the legal bases of the European Year of Languages stipulate that the languages recognised in a Member State, even if they are not official EU languages, should be part of the European Year of Languages.
I tried to ensure that Europe' s linguistic diversity was represented in the range of projects that were selected, and I am very pleased to see that things are getting off the ground and that, perhaps due to the European Year of Languages or perhaps because the time is right, we are adopting a more flexible approach to the language issue.
Furthermore, fewer problems will arise if we tackle the language issue through learning, through the learning of many languages, than if we approach this from a regionalist point of view.
My second answer is that it seems, for now, that we are holding all the cards.
Mrs Ferrer will remember that I quoted the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which makes linguistic diversity a requirement.
Well, this will be a strong component in the future development of our linguistic policies in Europe.
Thank you, Mrs Reding, for your answers and for confirming that Catalan will enjoy a strong presence in 2001.
Question No 59 by (H-0132/01):
Subject: Progress and quality of major projects in Greece Can the Commission provide a new estimate, on the basis of current data or developments, of the date for completion of the major projects under construction in Greece?
Does it consider that the deadlines for completing the work will be met within the financial estimates for each project?
Is any more recent and detailed information available regarding the quality control of these projects (a possible improvement in their quality) and penalties against firms and organisations?
What is the outcome of the cases already forwarded to the public prosecutor (including the list of projects exhibiting highly substandard work)?
To go back to the previous debate, I would like to say to Mrs Ferrer and other speakers that I saw the importance of Catalan when I visited Barcelona on Friday.
If you agree, I shall now turn to the question that Mr Papayannakis asked me about major projects undertaken as part of the Community support framework in Greece, and in Athens, in particular.
Mr Papayannakis, the term 'major projects' has a very precise meaning in the rules on the Structural Funds, since it refers to a project which is granted a budget of more than EUR 50 million.
Since there are quite a number of projects of this type in Greece, which receive cofinancing from the Cohesion Fund or the Regional Fund, mainly in the transport, environment and energy sectors, it is difficult for me to give a very accurate and thorough answer now, in a matter of minutes.
Mr Papayannakis, I would like to reiterate that granting a project Community cofinancing does not alter the fact that national authorities are still responsible for carrying out the project.
Furthermore, the information at the Commission' s disposal is, of course, initially provided by those same authorities.
Rest assured that we certainly do take an interest in how the projects and their costs are progressing.
Our overriding concern, moreover, is to ensure that the financial resources granted by the Community to Greece enhance progress and the quality of life of the Greek citizens and this concern applies to all Member States.
With regard to major projects in Greece, there are three types or categories, rather; the first includes those that have already been completed, and here I am thinking of the Athens underground system and Spata airport, which is due to be inaugurated in May.
Some of these projects have also been undertaken with or on the basis of concession contracts.
I could have mentioned other projects within the first category but the second category includes projects that are ongoing and that are also being undertaken with concession contracts, such as the Athens ring road and the Rio-Antirio bridge.
The Athens ring road should be completed at the end of 2003 and the bridge completed in 2004.
There are, of course, other projects that I do not have time to mention, which have, in general, also been undertaken with concession contracts.
It is difficult for me to give a deadline for the completion of the work, Mr Papayannakis, as there are many projects and therefore many deadlines that will fall due over a period of time.
Does this mean that we shall no longer exert pressure to ensure that progress is made with these or other projects, such as the extension of the Athens underground?
Certainly not.
I would like to repeat that, in accordance with the new rule for the Structural Funds, of which you are aware, Mr Papayannakis, we should remember that expenditure on programmes, which are part of these major projects, must evolve in line with the programme, and the Member States risk financial penalties if this does not happen.
I would therefore like to reassure you, Mr Papayannakis, and inform you that the Commission' s departments will closely monitor the rate of progress and the changes in costs of these programmes and projects within the European Union as a whole, and in Greece in particular. With regard to Athens, because I, like you, am committed to successfully preparing for the next Olympic Games, in 2004, I am also extremely anxious that the projects financed by the European Structural Funds and which will contribute to the success of the Olympic Games, run smoothly.
Lastly, I shall briefly touch on the subject of quality control.
Not long ago, on 29 January, the Commission' s departments requested detailed information from the Greek Government on the independent checks that had been decided for the cofinanced projects in Greece.
As soon as I receive this information, Mr Papayannakis, I shall be able to pass this on to you.
The European Anti-Fraud Office has also said that it has not yet received any communication from the Greek authorities pursuant to Regulation No 1681/94 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the structural policies and the organisation of an information system in this field.
Mr Papayannakis, these are the details that I can give to you today.
Commissioner, I would like to thank you very much indeed.
However, the reason for my question was firstly so that you would provide a list of what is currently expected.
I have a list here from five years ago which provides some deadlines.
This list was drawn up by your predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Matthies and the deadlines specified at that time have not been met.
I would therefore like to know what is happening.
The second point obviously relates to quality.
We have constantly called for a blacklist of companies or individuals whose work was of a poor quality, so that they can no longer tender for contracts.
This is a very important point.
With regard to the cost - the comparative cost - I would like to know how much it costs per kilometre to build an underground system in Barcelona, Athens or Paris for instance, so as to be able to judge the state of Europe' s finances.
Commissioner, I should like to end by saying that I am not very committed to the Olympic Games.
In actual fact, I am rather against them.
Since, however, we have scheduled this train, a train that is unforgivably delayed, I would like an explanation.
Mr Papayannakis, I have no problem with finding out the cost per kilometre of the underground system in Barcelona, Athens, or in any other city.
This information will, of course, be relative, because in the case of the Athens underground system, for example, you know as well as I do that many archaeological sites and remains were discovered during construction and considerable excavation work was also carried out.
Therefore, when you encounter these complications, although they are not always strictly negative, they do involve extra costs.
The reasons differ depending on the location.
Having said that, it will not be a problem to do the research you mentioned into comparative costs, with the help of my departments.
I shall now refer back to the list that you mentioned and which was drawn up, as you said, by Mrs Wulf-Matthies.
If you look at this list objectively, all the projects, the major projects, have been started and some of them have been completed.
I mentioned them earlier and I do not wish to go back to them.
With regard to the Athens sewage system, the water supply system or the gas pipeline, I do not think the reality is all black or rosy or, for that matter, green.
No doubt there have been delays.
Mr Papayannakis, some of the reports have also enabled us to see that there are quality problems on building sites in general - poor quality materials, inadequate control measures etc. This is the reality.
I am striving to be objective and to shoulder my responsibilities.
That is why, for example, I took as much time as was needed before this week approving the first operational programmes, so that I could verify that every one of these operational programmes, which will be granted a great deal of money, some tens of billions of euros, will be managed by a properly-run agency.
Only when I have this assurance do I approve these programmes, and I do this one by one - I also have many more to approve this month.
I have taken careful note of the other questions that you have asked me, and, if you wish, I shall answer you in writing, providing information that is as objective as possible.
Question No 60 by (H-0142/01):
Subject: Steel closures in Wales Would the Commission report on any progress made in efforts to ensure that funds are made available as a matter of urgency for the workers, families and the communities affected by the Corus steel closures in Wales?
Mrs Kinnock, as you know, most of these job losses at Corus in Wales affect the plant at Newport and the sheet steel factory which are, respectively, in the Objective 2 region, East Wales, and the Objective 1 region, West Wales and The Valleys.
The factory at Shotton, where there will also be redundancies, is also in the Objective 3 region, East Wales.
Some weeks ago, in a press release dated 2 February 2001, when this problem began to be more serious, the Commission announced that it was willing to discuss any proposal, as soon as the National Assembly of Wales and the other parties involved decided that the European Union' s programmes must be refocused and redeployed to take account of developments in this situation.
In the same press release, I also clearly stated that even if the current programmes could be refocused or redeployed, there is no possibility of the EU making extra funds available, either within the rules of the Structural Funds or of other policies.
The answer given to you was the same answer that I gave in relation to the recent natural disaster in Portugal and with regard to the earthquake in Greece.
We do not have a budgetary line to cope with exceptional and unexpected costs, but we can and do redeploy funds and packages to the affected regions.
On 28 February, our departments met with a delegation from the National Assembly of Wales.
The proposals that were considered on that occasion relate to aid for professional training, business development, site renovation, support for communities, infrastructure aid and as part of these discussions, we hope to receive more detailed proposals on the basis for regional partnership.
I should like to add, Mrs Kinnock, that aid from the European Social Fund may be granted using the Objective 1 single programming document, which covers the West Wales and The Valleys region and represents EUR 591 million.
The East Wales region is covered by the Objective 3 programme, which receives a budget of EUR 132 million.
Both these programmes contain measures which can relate to training, the professional retraining of those made redundant, as well as measures designed to help staff with ongoing training.
Lastly, the Commission also has resources from the ECSC budget until July 2002.
A payment of this type could be granted on an individual basis to redundant steelworkers to help them train for other employment.
The amounts are not huge but they do, nonetheless, come to a maximum of EUR 3000 per person and the Member State in question is obliged to contribute the same amount.
These are the details that I wanted to give you in addition to the Commission press release that I issued on 2 February 2001.
Commissioner, thank you for the enormous support and commitment you have made to Wales at a very difficult time with the job losses in the steel industry.
I was very interested, Commissioner, to hear that you have met Members and officials from the National Assembly of Wales and I wondered whether you had been given any idea of the timescales that are envisaged before any suggestions for programmes are made.
Secondly, Commissioner, my Labour Welsh colleague and I wrote to you last week inviting you to come to Wales to see first-hand what the problems are, what needs to be done and also to have an opportunity to meet some of the key people in the National Assembly and other areas.
So, Commissioner, I very much hope, although I do not expect an answer now, that you will look seriously at that request and that we will see you in Wales before too long.
Thank you very much for your invitation, Mrs Kinnock.
I was very pleased to receive an invitation from you and from your colleague, and I can, in principle, accept to come, as I intend, in any case, to visit all the regions of the UK - as I visited Scotland some weeks ago - and to hold discussions with the National Assembly of Wales, local partners of representative bodies and leaders of social and professional organisations.
I accept your invitation, therefore, in principle, although at this point, I am unable to give you a firm date.
Let us move fairly swiftly on to the subject of implementing new guidelines for some of the programmes, following the first meeting that was held with the representatives of the National Assembly of Wales.
I informed you that we were expecting very firm proposals, in accordance with the guidelines that were outlined the other day.
I promise that I shall act very quickly as soon as I receive these proposals for reallocation, concentration or redeployment to target more specific funds in the region for the men and women affected by these restructurings in the steel industry.
With regard to East Wales, which is an Objective 2 region, I hope that we will be able to finalise the adoption of the Objective 2 programme before 31 March 2001.
I wanted to confirm this date with you in my answer to your question.
Question No 61 by (H-0144/01):
Subject: Quality of projects in receipt of delayed spending under the 1994-1999 structural funds in Italy Twenty-five per cent of the funds granted to Italy for the 1994-1999 programming period have not yet been spent.
The Commission has set a final deadline of the end of 2001 for the funds to be spent.
A similar situation arose in respect of the 1989-1993 funds, which resulted in the loss of around 3% of the funds allocated.
Faced with the delays, the Italian regions and the Commission were forced to reprogramme investments, which resulted in the danger of having to grant funding to projects that were not compatible with the principles of environment-friendly development and the rational use of natural resources.
Can the Commission guarantee that this will not happen again and that, if reprogramming is necessary, it will be directed towards investments that promote sustainable development (in sectors such as energy, transport, biodiversity, tourism, agriculture and human resources, etc.)?
And if this is not possible, can it guarantee that the funds will instead be withdrawn?
In particular, can the Commission provide assurance that dubious investments will not be made in the areas of road infrastructure, hydraulic works and the management of water resources, such as dams and channelling?
As briefly as possible, I would like to inform Mr Celli that we have committed all the commitment appropriations earmarked for the 1994-1999 period for objectives 1, 2 and 5b and for Community initiatives.
It is true that, on the basis of the latest figures supplied to us by the Italian Ministry for Finance, the situation for payments is much less healthy, and I would like to write to you, Mr Celli, to give you precise details of how quickly the payments for each objective are being made.
They are unsatisfactory, particularly for Community initiatives.
I have informed the Italian authorities on several occasions that they must step up the pace of spending and that control activities must be improved so that projects can be completed and payments can be made within the specified timescales.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would also reiterate that the rules governing financial management for the 1994-1999 period do not allow us to reprogramme the resources after the deadline for making payments.
The last reprogrammings to be carried out in this way were in 1999.
In relation to the 2000-2006 programming period that has just started, I would like to inform you that coordination between our departments has again been improved, in order to achieve better interaction between the Habitat Directive and Structural Funds programming.
Mr Celli, I share your concern to ensure the environment, biodiversity and sustainable development are respected in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
It is up to the Member States to identify programmes and projects to be financed which adhere to the legislation in force.
Commissioner, I would like to know whether, in effect, all these projects, which have been reviewed and maybe altered, are genuinely in line with adequate environmental impact studies.
I regret to say that, in the past, we have been confronted on several occasions with a number of occurrences: in Italy, for example, the Trasimeno Lake protection proved to be maize planted along the banks of the lake which draws up water and thus reduces the level. We have even had Directive 2078, which authorised the use of insecticides instead of reducing it.
Therefore, my question is this: are all these projects - which have been reviewed because the funds had not been used until shortly before the deadline - all compliant at the current time?
Has the Commission genuinely ensured that the environment will not suffer at precisely the time that it should be being protected?
Mr Celli, I am not going to go into the good or the bad aspects of how this was managed in the past.
I cannot say that all the projects, both here and in other countries, worked perfectly, but, to tell you the truth, I am not very pleased to have had to carry out urgent reprogramming at the end of 1999, which involved very considerable sums of money, for Italy and for other countries. This had to be done after I noted that the projects that were initially devised were not or were no longer feasible.
I was not very pleased to carry out this enormous reprogramming exercise in the very last months of the previous period, 1994-1999, but I did this so that the money would not be lost and I intend to make sure that we do not find ourselves in the same situation in this period.
The general rules agreed at Berlin allow us to impose increased sanctions and restrictions on Member States, and so avoid this sort of reprogramming.
Now, Mr Celli, with regard to what was carried out at the end of the year, all the assistance provided from the Structural Funds should, in practice, be consistent with Community policies, and should therefore respect the legislation in force, particularly with regard to the environment.
If irregularities or infringements do come to be identified - whether you inform us of them, whether we carry out inquiries or evaluations or whether Member States also inform us of them - the Commission will, by virtue of the regulation, be able to eradicate the irregularities in conjunction with the Member State and consider reducing or sometimes even withdrawing some financial assistance.
In this respect, I can assure you that, in conjunction with the Member States, the greatest care and attention will be paid to the issue of the environment during the period for which I am responsible, in other words 2000-2006, as, personally speaking, it has always been one of my overriding political concerns.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 62 to 113 will be answered in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was suspended at 8 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Emissions of pollutants from large combustion plants
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0068/2001) from Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants [COM(2000) - C5-0562/2000 - 1998/0225(COD)].
Mr President, thank you so much for giving me the floor.
I am delighted that so many MEPs are attending today' s debate on an issue of such importance.
I understand that a large number of British MEPs had a meeting in the bar and discussed how they could prevent me from speaking.
That plan did not work.
But I would like to take this opportunity also to thank my Spanish fellow MEPs: I cannot fault their behaviour which is entirely in tune with the Rules of Procedure, for although we do not see eye to eye in terms of content, they still made the effort to be here.
All credit to the Spanish.
As for my British counterparts, I can no longer show them any respect because they surreptitiously tried to cancel all debates this evening within my own group.
Mr President, we have been working on this directive since as early as the autumn of 1998. On the basis of that directive, we will adapt the rules on emissions of pollutants from large combustion plants.
Despite all opposition on the part of a number of Member States and despite all warnings and protests from some interested parties in the electricity sector, my instinct tells me that we can amend the original regulation without any problems.
The technical facilities are already widely available and, in a large number of the EU Member States, the modified rules are already prescribed and are hence normal policy.
The environmental requirements which, in a number of countries are prescribed for large furnaces, are invariably stricter because the acidification of our environment is still ongoing.
Add to that the issue of ozone - you will be aware of the fact that many citizens suffer from respiratory disorders, which are partly caused by nitrogen oxides originating from traffic and the sector at issue today - then surely it should be more or less a point of honour for everyone in this House to address these problems when it is possible to do so in a simple and effective manner.
The original Commission proposal to amend the 1998 directive was not what you would call a runaway success: standardisation was poor and existing installations were kept outside the range of the directive.
Parliament showed its best side at first reading and did what parliaments are expected to do, namely to lend substance to the care for humans, nature and the environment in general.
The Council' s common position came about with the greatest difficulty.
Moreover, the European Parliament' s wish to include existing installations in the directive was also taken into consideration, and legislation was tightened up to some extent.
The snag - and my fellow Spanish MEPs regret this - was that each country managed to negotiate their own exceptions, and if it was up to the Court of Ministers, we would be using old and polluting power stations not updated with state-of-the-art technology ad infinitum.
The common position lacked any vision whatsoever; it was a pick-and-mix with something for everyone.
Alongside environmental arguments, I have also supplied evidence for the need to tighten the common position: in addition to the need to protect public health (ozone smog), I also came up with a few economic alternatives, for it is true that we would like to develop an environment industry in Europe.
If we compare the Council' s emission requirements with the regulations which currently apply in the United States or Japan, we come off rather badly.
Some people claim that there is no need for requirements with regard to combustion plants, for, thanks to Mrs Myller' s report, we are being given emission ceilings anyway.
If we meet the expectations of those in favour of liberalising the energy market, in other words if we do not prescribe requirements, or if we allow exceptions, with regard to generating electricity using old, polluting power stations, the market mechanism will be disturbed, and those who neglect the environment will be rewarded with a headstart thanks to their cheap energy prices.
That cannot be the intention of European environmental legislation.
Mr President, I wanted to speak before the debate actually started, because we had been led to believe in our group meeting that one of the other political groups had tabled an amendment under Rule 146 calling for this debate to be adjourned until the next part-session.
I understand that it has not been brought forward and therefore I would have liked to put it forward in my own name at that time.
As we have now started the debate we cannot do that, but I would just like to express my concern that I was not called before the debate started.
Mr Goodwill, to avoid any misunderstanding, let me say that I knew such motions might come from the floor, so I cast a careful eye around the Chamber before inviting the rapporteur to speak to see whether anyone wished to raise a point of order.
There were no hands raised when I looked round.
But let me point out one option that you can certainly exercise tomorrow before the vote.
Rule 144(1) states that "referral back to committee may be requested by a political group or at least thirty-two Members when the agenda is fixed or before the start of the debate or the final vote" .
I am sorry, but an intervention tomorrow is the only option left to you.
It is up to you, of course, whether you exercise it.
But let me repeat that I did look round the Chamber myself.
Mr Gorbachev once said that life punishes those who are late.
I am sorry.
(Laughter)
I assume that the other points of order concern the same matter.
Is that so?
It seems to be the case, so there is no need for me to call anyone.
Mr President, I have no wish to punish anyone, so I shall come to the point fairly quickly.
It is true that the European Union has finally overcome its reluctance to introduce European rules on combustion plants.
The importance of these European rules lies very simply in the fact that we have a liberalised electricity market in the European Community, and it goes without saying that, in this liberalised market, standards for atmospheric pollution and the like should be comparable throughout Europe.
The Commission has therefore reacted properly by focusing primarily on the old plants, for which there have regrettably been no rules since 1987 and which, to put it bluntly, have caused quite heavy pollution throughout Europe.
I fully support the Commission' s activity in this area.
I warmly welcome it, and I believe it represents a step in the right direction.
Of course there is room for argument about whether particular exceptional arrangements can be extended for a year or two in the case of small power plants.
That would not have posed us any problems in our quest for a compromise.
The great pity is that we have not arrived at such a compromise.
The approach is right.
And anyone who thinks - and I wish to say this in spite of all the anger that has been voiced here - that environmental policies are a national responsibility is quite wrong, because most of the pollution emitted by these power stations ends up in the territory of our partners in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway.
I believe we are jointly and severally bound to find an answer.
I believe we have found that answer and that we have also found ways of ensuring that special arrangements can be made for small plants for the next few years.
I believe the rapporteur has presented a good report. We should continue along this path.
Mr President, we have in front of us today a very important piece of legislation.
It will affect our air quality, our water quality, the general quality of our environment throughout the whole of Europe and beyond in the coming years if we bring it to fruition.
That is, of course, if the Member States have the will to do so.
The proposal has now reached its second reading.
We have insisted very strongly at first reading that the most stringent measures are taken to control gaseous emissions from large combustion plants throughout the Union because of the acid gases that are formed, because of the effects upon the environment, and because of the effects upon human health.
We have now reached the point where we have in front of us the common position.
I understand the Council has worked very hard to achieve this and it does propose new and better levels of emissions.
However, my group thinks that things can go further.
My group thinks that in combination with a number of other factors, Mrs Myller's report which is to follow for example, it is possible to put a little more into this proposal than we see already.
In that respect, I would commend to you the amendments, particularly those that apply to the articles and the annex which control the emission limit values from the large combustion plants.
It seems to me that we are confronted with a very difficult choice tonight because we must decide if what we vote tonight is at least in some way acceptable to the Council.
The Council has indicated that it is unwilling to accept further amendments from Parliament.
If we achieve the appropriate votes tomorrow, that unwillingness becomes an obligation and the Council will have to sit down and negotiate with Parliament.
That cannot be a bad thing in terms of the recognition of the ability of this Parliament to achieve a high level of environmental protection for the people of Europe.
It seems to me that what we can do tomorrow in the vote is to take a few more steps forward to achieve a little bit more in terms of benefit to the environment.
That has to be balanced against the possible consequences for the energy strategies and the energy industries of the European Union.
We are very mindful of that.
If you look tonight at the amendments which the Socialists will be supporting, we have relatively long timescales for these new regulations to be incorporated into EU law.
We must take this step forward, but inevitably we must also allow for the fact that this step needs to be accommodated not just by the environment but economically as well.
You have in front of you a report with the amendments, the majority of which the Socialist Group can support, some of which we feel go too far.
However, I would commend the report to the House.
Mr President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report is sound.
The report on large combustion plants, take two, is also an important report.
It concerns acidification, traditional air pollution and ozone smog.
Acidification was a buzz word in the 80s.
That is when it all started.
Many citizens believe that the problem of acidification has now been resolved, but that is not the case.
We have a long way to go yet.
At the same time, the energy market has been liberalised.
That means that it is becoming more difficult to uphold environmental rules.
For example, in my own country, the Netherlands, a Belgian company is buying up Dutch gas plants and is replacing them with coal plants, which are many times more polluting and also bad in terms of CO2-emission.
That is why we need environmental rules, and strict ones at that.
The Environmental Committee has fortunately supported these, but the Environmental Committee' s amendments will, unfortunately, not make it: they are unlikely to attract 314 votes.
But the Green Group would like to know who will then be responsible for this.
The Green Group will be supporting the Christian-Democratic amendments, albeit with an aching heart. These are weaker because they leave ammonia out of the equation for no good reason.
That is an unnecessary concession to the farmers who constitute their grassroots support.
Despite this, we will be supporting those amendments, for the Greens, too, have now grown up.
Mr President, obviously we need limits on emissions of atmospheric pollutants in order to protect the environment and human health.
However, the measures proposed in the common position are one-sided.
Basically, it proposes to abolish lignite and coal as energy sources, ostensibly to protect the environment, but it ignores or is silent on the subject of other major sources of pollution, such as cars.
At the same time, it ignores the fact that 70% of new power stations in the United States and 50% in Japan use solid fuels, such as coal, because production is cheaper, even if initial investments are more costly.
We would also point out that, if lignite and coal are abolished, a large number of power stations will close and the numbers of unemployed, which are already high, will swell still further, whereas we could be discussing additional measures to prevent pollution, such as filters, green belts etc. Perhaps this one-sidedness at the expense of solid fuels comes from a willingness and an intention to promote natural gas, which serves certain interests in the European Union.
In Greece, we use lignite as a basic and financially satisfactory source of energy.
At the same time, we are pressing for as many protective measures as it is possible to take.
If, as the experts say, natural gas reserves will run out in a hundred years and solid fuel reserves will run out in two hundred and fifty years, we should be discussing how to make the best possible use of all these sources of energy, not abolishing some of them, especially at a time when the energy question is paramount and affects the cost of living of our workers.
Mr President, all large combustion plants together account for 63% of the sulphur dioxide and 21% of the nitrogen oxide emissions in the European Union.
There are therefore major environmental gains to be had in this sector.
Rapporteur Oomen-Ruijten has made sound proposals to this effect.
The Council has reviewed the directive in its entirety, but there is sufficient reason for making a number of further adjustments at this stage.
First of all, the emission limit values must be brought into line with the current scope of technology.
If we realise that waste incineration plants and cement kilns are only allowed to emit 40 mg of sulphur dioxide, I am surprised at the values for combustion plants which can be as high as 2 000 mg.
I can just about understand why the rules for large combustion plants are more relaxed, but forty times more relaxed is unacceptable to me.
As the state-of-the-art technology stands at present, it is altogether possible to reduce the level of SO2-emission down to 100.
Therefore, the values proposed by the Environmental Committee, which vary from 1 200 to 300 for existing plants, are definitely not too strict.
Strict standards can be prescribed for new plants since the new technology can be used here.
The amendments which we have tabled in tandem with the Green Group include limit values of 400 for small plants and 200 for large plants.
Secondly, the bizarre exemption provisions must be deleted.
The fact that large, old combustion plants are allowed to pollute 2 200 hours annually is unacceptable, as is the fact that it is permitted to exceed the emission limit values if the fuel, such as highly polluting brown coal, is extracted from the country' s own soil.
In my opinion, the exceptions for Spain and the islands of Crete and Rhodes are also unacceptable.
The liberalisation of the energy market should bring with it equal environmental conditions. We therefore need to abandon the aforesaid exceptions in order to avoid distortion of competition.
In addition, incentives must be given to rejuvenate or renew old and heavily polluting plants, instead of allowing the serious pollution of the atmosphere to continue.
Thirdly, the offshore gas turbines must also meet emission requirements.
Because of the changing composition of fuel, I am aware that it is impossible to meet the strict emission requirements at certain times.
But if offshore gas turbines are written off completely because of it, any incentive for improvement is taken away.
The amendment I tabled contains very flexible emission limit values by way of alternatives.
My fourth point concerns the approximation of this directive to the waste incineration directive.
In the event of different fuels being mixed, the ultimate emission limit value in both directives is calculated in a different way.
It makes little difference to the result but, in practice, the combination of these two calculation methods is not only very complicated but also unnecessary.
I have proposed an adaptation in Amendment No 43.
Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the President on having handled the first part of this discussion so well that we do, in fact, have an actual document to discuss.
However, I also want to emphasise my disappointment at the fact that Members of this Parliament, and above all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, are unable to accept the democratic process embarked upon three years ago and now to be brought to a conclusion, but are, at the last minute, trying to thwart this document.
I also want to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, even if I have not always understood the path she has chosen, the course she has subsequently charted and why the end result appears not to reflect the original, higher ambitions.
We know that our use of fossil fuels is not a sustainable use of energy.
That is something we are really all agreed on.
We have known about the problem for at least 30 years, and it is now time to do something about it.
I have said it before and I shall say it again: Parliament supported a strategy on acidifying air pollution three years ago.
Now it is time to put this strategy into effect. That is what this directive is about.
It is not only about acidifying air pollution in Sweden, Norway or Denmark.
It is about half a million people who, in different places on this earth of ours, die each year because of the use of fossil fuels.
It is about all those who contract chronic illnesses, for example chronic bronchitis, because of the burning of fossil fuels.
It is not only, therefore, a question of tightening up limit values but, to just as great an extent, a matter of our people' s health.
That is something which Members must not forget.
It is in actual fact possible to retain a good level of service in the energy field and, at the same time, to work towards a better environment.
We are on the right road.
It is we who have the opportunity to set the pace if 314 Members have the courage to take up a definite position tomorrow in favour of the more ambitious alternative.
It is scarcely surprising that the Council should have submitted a compromise in the form of a text which is a watered down version of that which Parliament approved at first reading and would have liked to have seen.
It is also obvious that, at second reading, we should again put forward the same demands in order to put pressure on the Council and obtain a good negotiating position for ourselves in the inevitable conciliation, for we know that we must act now if we are to get to see any results at all within the foreseeable future.
We must dare to set strict limit values for all types of plant, both old and new, large and small.
The Council' s limit values are not as far-reaching.
The Council appears to have lost faith in our ability to develop new technology at all.
It is absolutely crucial that old plants which already exist should be covered by this directive and that they should also be subject to strict limit values.
Nothing would be as intended if too many exceptions were granted.
Nothing would remain of the high ambitions entertained. Small plants too must, therefore, be covered by the directive.
It is also important to point out that the directive establishes a framework for that liberalisation of the energy market we are seeing today.
Without such a framework, there would be total anarchy in the European energy market.
Minimum environmental requirements are needed in order to create common ground rules.
Those requirements we are now imposing upon ourselves in the European Union are also demands which must apply to the Union' s future members.
Today and tomorrow, we have the opportunity not only to put a stop to dangerous emissions but also to improve public health and prepare the ground for a successful future enlargement of the European Union.
Mr President, the biggest event in the football calendar in Britain is the FA cup final.
At half-time millions of kettles are turned on to make a cup of tea - for those who have not been drinking beer since the start of the match at least.
The demand for electricity - a commodity that cannot be stored - peaks.
To meet this demand, or at similar times such as particularly cold days in winter, some of our older coal-fired power stations are pressed into service.
Amendments to the common position threaten the future of some of these stations and the jobs of the miners who supply the coal.
It is technically possible to upgrade them, but in many cases it would be cheaper to build new gas plants and retro-fit these stations with exhaust scrubbers.
The main plank of our air quality strategy in this area is the national emission ceilings and, as long as they are met, Member States should have a degree of flexibility.
New gas-fired plants have already contributed to the UK meeting its targets.
How a Member State meets its obligations is an issue of subsidiarity.
Some of the proposed amendments will be counterproductive.
For example, the inclusion of an end date of 2012 will result in old plants being run harder to use up the time remaining and will increase pollution during those four years.
The common position is already a compromise and takes account of first reading amendments by adding in measures on existing plants which were not part of the Commission proposal.
We should not destabilise the delicate compromise package by seeking to further amend this directive, which already delivers substantial and very real environmental improvements.
Mr President, this directive is important for the EU in terms of the environment, energy production and competitiveness.
Up-to-date limit values for large power plants are needed both in the Member States and the candidate countries.
For that reason, we must thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, sincerely for her hard work.
The committee is imposing substantially stricter limits with no adequate differentiation being made with regard to their size and type.
The one-off investments in new technology the directive calls for are the same irrespective of the size of the plant.
This would particularly threaten the ecologically recognised combined production of heat and power.
In my own country, for example, this might mean a step backwards in ecological terms.
In Finland many different bodies share this concern, among others the Ministry of the Environment.
The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would mean investments that were not cost-effective in terms of ecological benefit, and difficulties for the combined use of energy-efficient wood and peat and the combined production of power and heat.
The latter process is carried out mainly in medium-size plants, which would now be treated in the same way as the large ones.
On the other hand, the use of peat is justified.
It promotes the added use of wood in power plants, as combined combustion improves the way the combustion process can be controlled, reduces problems of corrosion, and adds to the reliability of fuel being available.
The report does not support this objective either, one which is directly linked to the matter of bio-fuels.
It might even be said that the report could be accused of environmental avarice in some of the amendments and that it is therefore in danger of stifling many important environmental objectives.
However, it is important that the report should be adopted and the directive be brought into effect, as it will prevent emissions from drifting long distances and acid deposits affecting the natural environment of another Member State.
With its amendments, in search of compromise as they are, my own group is trying, among other things, to ensure that the combined production of heat and power in small and medium-sized power plants can continue, while the large plants are compelled to invest in technology that can adhere to stricter limit values.
In addition, the compromises seek to ensure that burning peat, which contains very little sulphur, does not require needless extra investment, as opposed to processes using fuels with a higher sulphur content.
This is contained in Amendment No 36.
We appreciate it very much that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has agreed to these compromises.
We find ourselves once again in a situation where a legislator has to face the fact that different environmental conditions also mean different environmental effects.
Unless we can find the right solutions to these problems, our last resort may have to be to have our own directive for fuels within the context of the northern dimension, although this would not be a very good solution.
Mr President, Ireland does not in general have a problem with stricter ELVs for new plants, as these can simply be incorporated into IPC licensing and will help achieve national emission ceilings.
However, we must question further tightening beyond the common position and whether it will bring any significant additional environmental benefits.
The common position was developed in tandem with the proposed NEC directive and represents a coherent and balanced approach to achieving environmental objectives over time.
The proposed amendments are not justified in terms of environmental benefits and associated costs and other impacts and would disturb the balance achieved.
Further tightening would increase costs and reduce Member State flexibility in meeting agreed national targets and accelerate increased dependence on natural gas with attendant fuel security concerns for electricity generation, particularly in countries like Ireland.
Additional restrictions on existing LCP are not justified in the context of Member State commitments under the NEC directive to reduce overall emissions and the impending application of the IPPC directive.
Some amendments will even have a perverse effect.
For example, stringent and uneconomic ELVs for small plants will hinder combined heat and power development and others do not support an integrated approach to the environment.
Proposals to tighten ELVs are not proportionate regarding costs and benefits and fail to recognise that the common position is a balance between improving environmental performance and avoiding excessive costs and other impacts.
No cost-benefit analysis is provided for the further reduction of emissions from plants with already low emission concentrations.
One amendment I have difficulty with is the proposal to reduce NOx emission limits from 650 to 200.
It is technically feasible but will require the installation of costly end-of-pipe controls.
This will require more energy input and result in increased CO2 emissions, the use of more raw materials and the production of hazardous waste.
The Council's proposed ELVs could be met by primary means at a much lower cost.
As noted previously, these additional costs will ultimately be borne in high electricity prices.
However, it is not at all clear that the benefits in additional NOx emission reductions outweigh the associated environmental and economic costs, i.e. this is not consistent with an integrated approach to the environment as a whole.
Mr President, air pollution remains a real threat to citizens' health and well-being in many parts of Europe.
Our ecosystem continues to suffer from acidification and eutrophification.
It is an issue where Europe can and must act since air pollution knows no borders and this directive will make an important contribution to reducing atmospheric pollution.
Let me turn to the key issues under discussion.
The question of existing plants has been the major point in the debate on this proposal, both at first reading in the Council and now at second reading.
After a very difficult discussion in the Council, the common position was achieved with unanimity.
It now includes significant new and tougher requirements for these plants and this will result in considerably reduced emissions of sulphur dioxide from the large combustion plant sector of the existing Member States and ultimately in an enlarged Community.
While I consider that it is necessary to keep a degree of flexibility in the approach to existing plants, I share Parliament's view that a final date should be established, after which the obligations for everyone will be clear.
Parliament has played a very important role in pointing towards the outcome on existing plants, and I am grateful to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her efforts as rapporteur.
Parliament has proposed a number of amendments to make the emission limit values more stringent, both in the case of existing plants and plants that will be licensed after the new directive comes into force.
Already the common position will reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide from the LCP sector considerably.
Therefore I see little justification at this point to further tighten emission limit values for sulphur dioxide for existing plants.
However, in the case of nitrogen oxides the effect will be less significant as the standards that apply to existing plants are not very demanding.
Hence there is some merit in tightening emission limit values for nitrogen oxides.
In the case of new plants, economies of scale which reduce the cost of compliance allow for further tightening of emission limit values for both nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides.
On the question of indigenous fuels, the time has come to remove the divergent treatment of indigenous solid fuels and other fuels and the process of phasing-out should now begin, especially in view of the changing commercial nature of the large combustion sector.
In this context, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3, 4, 7, 8 in part; 9, 12, 13, second part; 14, 16, 17 for plants over 300 MW; 18 and 19, both for plants between 100 and 300 MW; 21, 28 and 29, both in part; 39 and 40.
However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 6, 13, first part, 15, 24, 25, 26, 30 to 38, 43, 44, 49, 50 and 51.
I should like to make a short comment on the other proposed amendments.
Let me assure you that the Commission has considered carefully all the 50 amendments tabled.
Overall we can accept 23, either fully, in part or in principle.
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 10 and 11, which will simplify the obligations for refineries, and Amendment No 23 in principle, subject to ensuring that its implementation is compatible with other legislative requirements on access to this type of information on emissions.
The Commission can also accept in principle Amendment No 1, dealing with economic instruments; Amendment No 2, concerning the alignment of the definition of biomass with the recently adopted directive on the incineration of waste, and parts of Amendment No 5 requiring further examination of emissions of heavy metals from the LCP sector and emissions from large combustion plants in the maritime sector.
However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 22 and 27 as they would detract from the common position or introduce inconsistencies with recently adopted and related legislation on waste incineration.
It is preferable to await the outcome of the review in 2004 before including gas turbines in offshore applications.
We have not yet assessed all the technical implications but that will be done in the review in 2004.
Thus Amendments Nos 42, 45, 46, 47 and 48 are not acceptable.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say that in both readings Parliament contributed to improving this legislative proposal.
This will have an impact not only in the present European Union but ultimately also in an enlarged Community.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
National emission ceilings for pollutants
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0067/2001) from Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants [10674/1/2000 - C5-0563/2000 - 1999/0067(COD)].
Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, I would like to warmly thank all the members of the committee for the constructive debate this part of the directive fuelled in committee, and I also wish to thank the division responsible for servicing the committee.
We are in a rather special situation in the sense that the committee in the second reading was even able to improve on the results of the first reading, and this is due - thanks again to the committee members - to the adopted amendment, which combined the best aspects of the first reading and the Council' s common position.
We have therefore drawn up some very ambitious aims for limits on emissions by the year 2010 to present to Parliament.
Last summer' s common position took the results of Parliament' s first reading into account only to a very limited extent.
However, the committee' s own vote on the issue shows how much it wanted to support the results of that first reading, and so we now have adopted a good and purposeful position with regard to tomorrow' s vote.
I hope this position will prove successful tomorrow.
This directive is an attempt to reduce the quantity of certain pollutants in the air, which are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and ammonia, so that in the long term we reach a situation where there is no danger to people' s health.
This is to be achieved by setting some interim targets for the year 2010.
These interim targets should help us to get to a point at which areas where the critical acidification loads are exceeded will be halved, where the ozone load that affects health is reduced by two thirds, and where the ozone load in excess of critical levels for vegetation is reduced by a third.
Regrettably, these decisions will not, however, enable us to achieve the targets that were agreed in the Community' s Acidification Strategy.
For this reason, the parliamentary report now being dealt with is proposing a deadline until 2015, when these critical loads may no longer be exceeded, and a target for the year 2020, when critical levels should not be exceeded either.
The proposal for a directive also contains the call for a review of the situation in 2004.
The point of this is to better enable us to steer a course towards the 2010 deadline, see if we are on the right track, and consider what to do to achieve the targets.
The proposal for a directive under discussion places a demand on Member States to reduce the proportion of pollutants in the air to a level that is safe for people' s health, although the Member States themselves can choose the remedies they need to attain results.
The biggest threats, and thus the most challenging problem for the Member States, are emissions that result from energy production, and in this respect Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report, which has just been debated here, was a most important one, and I genuinely hope that in tomorrow' s vote we can achieve the best possible results, as that will have a direct impact on how the emission ceilings this directive deals with can be achieved.
Other causes for concern are industry and traffic.
Industry is the only area that has been able to reduce emissions in the last few decades, while traffic only appears to continue to produce increased emission levels.
Member States therefore have to do something about it.
Traffic is a real challenge.
We must be able to reduce traffic and change our behaviour, favouring alternatives that are less polluting, rail traffic and public transport, and, at the same time, lend support to technical developments that will have an impact on cleaner transport systems in other ways.
And lastly, I would like to say that the costs of this directive have been set too high in various connections.
If we take into account what was decided in the Kyoto Protocol, for example, we will get to a position where we can halve the proposed costs.
If then we compare them to the benefits we will derive as a result of this directive in terms of improved health, they will be worth many times the costs incurred.
Mr President, the present draft directive concerning national emission ceilings tackles the main atmospheric pollutants.
The salient points of this directive, therefore, concern the reduction of emission levels of the said substances to below the critical levels and loads.
The directive' s key element, or rather the most talked-about part of this proposal is, of course, the table which lists per country the permitted annual emission for each substance.
A key concern in the discussion on this subject matter was that when at UN level, the 36 countries, including the EU Member States, agreed upon other, and often less strict, standards for the same substances, this met with a storm of protest.
Consequently, at first reading, many argued in favour of replacing the European Commission table, which may have been ambitious, by the UN' s so-called 'Gothenburg table' , which allowed higher ceilings.
During the discussions at first reading, I already indicated that the line of reasoning was rather weak.
After all, UN agreements always have a lower level of ambition due to the fact that it is difficult to compare the situations in rich, prosperous, and thus often more polluting countries, with the situations in developing countries.
Moreover, our continent suffers the direct environmental effects of the emission of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic substances and, albeit to a lesser extent, ammonia.
At first reading, the PPE-DE Group adopted the European Commission' s ceiling at first reading.
However, we have improved the ammonia table, partly because the risk of spreading is less pronounced.
My instinct tells me that the Council' s compromise proposal with regard to SO2, NOx and the VOC will lead to higher emission levels.
Only with regard to ammonia can I identify with the Council' s compromise.
The Commissioner is as aware as we are of the problems involved in implementing the nitrate directive: in actual fact, none of the Member States meet the standards specified therein.
The Commission' s proposals to further reduce the ammonia ceiling are not feasible, in my opinion.
I would add to this that the effects of ammonia emission are also partly a local phenomenon, and that a lower goal can therefore also be justified.
That means that we largely go along with the rapporteur: we support the first eight amendments; we do not endorse Amendment No 9.
In the table, we support the SO2, NOx and the VOC and, where ammonia is concerned, we would refer to the Council' s proposal.
We are also struggling with the rapporteur' s notion that what we want to reach in 2010 should, in actual fact, be reached in 2004.
That seems highly ambitious to us.
Finally, I must also say that the working relationship with this rapporteur was highly successful, and that the work on the large combustion plants was excellent too.
I would like to express my gratitude in this connection.
Thank you, Mr President.
A lot of what was said in the previous debate is of great relevance to this directive too.
These two documents form the basis for the acidification strategy that we adopted three years ago.
When measurements were taken last Monday in my own home district, the level of acidity was higher than it had been for a very long time.
Acidification is still a problem to which we cannot avoid drawing attention.
I want to begin by thanking Mrs Myller, who has done a magnificent job, as well as my fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have contributed to our now having a proposal which is looking really good.
The problem, however, is that the path between the committee and the plenary sitting of this Parliament is at times fraught with obstacles.
The closer we get to the day of decision, the more afraid some of us seem to become.
Once again, we see the conflict between industry, employment and the environment rear its head.
Many who have previously been environmental campaigners are transformed into preservers of the status quo in their own countries and regions and embrace the old coal-fired power stations in their home districts.
The long-term view and acceptance of responsibility are suddenly things of the past when the issue arises of how we are to obtain a sound environment for life in the future too.
At Parliament' s first reading, we supported those emission ceilings proposed by the Commission.
In this connection, it must also be pointed out that the ceilings and figures presented by the Commission were based upon countries' own reporting to the Commission.
These were not invented figures, plucked out of the air.
Certain people appear now to be denying these figures.
The figures were not over-optimistic and, just as Mrs Myller said earlier, the economic calculations were, in actual fact, a good reflection of the reality.
When, now, the Council contributes its own points of view, it will come as no surprise if, this time too, a much more meagre result is arrived at, a result very close to the figures in the Gothenburg Protocol.
In this connection, I would also remind you that - to begin with, at least - the Commission refused to sign the Gothenburg Protocol because it thought it was so inadequate and not ambitious enough.
I really do hope that the Commission will now show that it supports what Parliament has said, above all in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
If we opt for the Council' s line, we in actual fact choose poorer health for our citizens in a situation in which children and asthmatics are among the most vulnerable.
We also choose to exceed the critical loads and levels over a further several hundred thousand hectares of land. The list could extend much further.
I hope that, tomorrow, we shall have the courage to approve the proposal tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, at first reading the Liberal Group gave its support to the Commission's proposals.
We want to see a significant reduction in air pollution within a period of time that reflects the serious environmental problems we face.
The Commission argued that the economic benefits would far outweigh the costs involved, but Member States dissented and said that they could not go beyond the targets agreed at the Gothenburg Protocol.
Parliament was right, then, to back the Commission.
I am pleased that in negotiation the Commission was able to overcome Member States' resistance, make some progress and secure more ambitious targets.
But at second reading we are in a rather different position.
The Commission has said that it has made a firm agreement with the Council and is sticking to it.
It will go no further, it says.
It will not support the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE or the Socialist Group.
I would like Member States to be more ambitious.
But at first reading, Parliament supported proposals based on a Commission model which I find fiendishly complicated.
In the absence of the Commission's support now, I do not see how we, as legislators, not technical experts, can propose more ambitious targets for individual countries unless we pull figures out of the air, which seems to me a rather poor and amateurish way of making law.
So I have accepted that this is as far as we can go for the time being.
But I am also aware that this is a poker game and I am a rotten poker player.
It may be that Member States have cards up their sleeves which they are prepared to offer up if pushed in conciliation.
It may be that the Commissioner secretly wishes Parliament to pursue its original agenda.
If that proves to be the case then I have misread the game.
I am waiting with interest to hear from the Commissioner whether she has been keeping cards close to her chest or whether her public position remains the same.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Myller on her sterling report on national emission ceilings.
There are four polluting substances involved.
For two of the substances, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, an adequate solution can be found in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report on large combustion plants.
The problem of ammonia must be solved at local and national level.
As for volatile organic compounds, we are, in actual fact, still missing part of the legislation.
There are now rules which apply to volatile organic compounds which are released when filling up with fuel, as well as for substances of this kind used in industry.
However, for volatile organic compounds in households, which, after all, account for one third of all emissions, such rules do not yet exist.
That is why I am asking the European Commission when it will at long last come up with an EU directive on paints.
We must move towards water-based paints, and it is time that rules were drafted to that effect.
The Gothenburg Protocol has been signed by 36 countries, and is subject to the right of veto.
The common position is hardly more ambitious than the Gothenburg Protocol.
The right of veto on environmental legislation has been abolished within Europe.
It would be disgraceful if the European Union were unable to prescribe environmental standards which are substantially stricter than the Gothenburg Protocol.
Tomorrow, Parliament has the opportunity to prevent this disgrace.
I hope that 314 or more of my fellow MEPs will be voting for Mrs Myller' s excellent report.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur as well and to ask how far we can trust the Council.
It is nothing personal.
This is one of the very few proposals I can recall which has come with a price tag attached.
It is true that it is printed on page 112 of the original proposals.
It does not appear on the Internet version any longer, but it was there on the version that was originally submitted to Parliament.
This shows us the actual cost of implementing the proposed directive on national emission ceilings.
It was news to the Belgian members of my committee that this proposal would cost them EUR 1 000 million a year.
We showed it to the Belgian members and they did not like the look of that at all.
Can the Commissioner state whether the cost of what is being proposed has been discussed in the Council and what, for example, the Belgians have said about it?
What about the French, for whom this measure will cost an additional EUR 916 million a year?
What about the Greeks?
According to the Commission's estimate, this will cost them an additional EUR 338 million a year.
So how far are they actually willing to pay the cost?
Mrs MÃŒller has addressed this problem.
In her Amendments Nos 1 and 6 she rejects the word "broadly" and says that the Member States must actually agree to remain "exactly" within the emission ceilings.
If Parliament accepts that, we have an even greater right to ask how far the Member States will actually agree to abide by these proposals.
When the Commissioner comes to reply, could she perhaps say something on Amendment No 8?
Does subsidiarity apply here or not?
If it does not apply, then presumably we have to await proposals from the European Commission.
If so, since the instruments cannot be taxes, which would not be agreed, what will they be?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have an important report before us.
I welcome the directive' s objective, namely a drastic reduction in air pollution, with open arms, as well as the fact that we are setting a new deadline for 2020.
As Mrs Jackson observed a moment ago, my objection pertained to the table in Annex 1, in particular the calculation method and the implications thereof for Member States with a small surface area and high population density.
Commissioner, I assume that, as you already stated in the debate at first reading, we can expect a fairer distribution of the burden, also for small Member States, during the review in 2004.
That is why I will be voting against Amendment No 10 which has again included the Commission' s old table in Annex 1.
Mr President, the acidification of forests, fields and watercourses is the single biggest environmental problem in my own country.
Almost all acid rain comes from the burning of fossil fuels used in energy production in other European countries.
Acidification is therefore a problem 'imported' into our country.
The natural environment in large parts of the north of the EU has little capacity to act as a buffer against pollution.
That is why acid rain causes a lot of damage in Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
Major efforts are made each year to reduce the damage by liming lakes and watercourses.
Without being able to put my finger on the exact figures, I would venture to maintain that, over the years, Sweden has, in financial terms, invested more in liming in order to combat acidification than certain Member States have invested in reducing acidifying emissions.
Certain areas are extremely vulnerable to acid rain, such as south-western Sweden, certain mountain areas in northern Sweden and, especially, southern Norway.
I would address all you MEPs from different Member States.
If we are to be able to save the valuable countryside in these areas, we need your help.
We appeal to you to see the issue from a European perspective and to help us with the major problems caused by acidification.
Moreover, reducing combustion emissions is an important health issue in quite a few EU countries.
Many people in my own country with an interest in the environment are pinning their hopes on the European Union.
The UN has proved to be poor at tackling environmental problems in Europe.
I believe that taxation is an issue for the individual nations.
The national parliaments must choose the best and most practicable ways of achieving the national emission ceilings that have now been proposed.
I cannot therefore support the proposal for EU taxes to combat emissions.
I also want to comment on the unemployment argument.
Overall, a good environment and better health do not lead to unemployment.
In the long run, efforts in favour of a sound environment and better health are a good investment, leading to reduced costs and a better economic position.
The situation in Russia would have been much better today if there had been no need to inherit the ill health and the environmental catastrophe left behind when the Communist system collapsed.
The Council' s common position is remarkable for its lack of ambition and for the fact that the Council does not want to set a date for when the measures are to come into effect.
So we know how the directive is to be complied with. It will quite simply not be complied with at all.
Parliament should therefore again be as ambitious in combating acidification as the Commission was in setting what have been called emission ceilings.
With Parliament and the Commission shoulder to shoulder on this issue, the Council' s position is becoming rather embarrassing for the governments of the Member States.
Finally, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, for her efforts to achieve results in this important area of environmental concern.
Mr President, President of the Commission, I agree totally with the previous speaker that acidification, eutrophication and the increase in ozone levels in the soil are problems we have to effectively address throughout Europe.
Effective national emission limits must therefore be set for the main pollutants.
After some long and hard negotiations the Council achieved consensus on national emission ceilings.
The Commission, for its part, supports the Council' s common position.
The Council' s common position would mean a significant reduction in emissions.
It is perhaps not as ambitious as Parliament, in its first reading, would have liked, but perhaps it is the best possible compromise in this situation.
Our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has unfortunately finished up by making some proposals that are so dramatic and ambitious that, if they were implemented, the general consensus that has been reached would be jeopardised.
In this respect I am in agreement with the views expressed earlier by Mr Davies.
When emission limits were being discussed in Parliament' s first reading in March of last year, I stressed that new targets should not be set before the earlier ones had been achieved.
The Commission must check that there is continued improvement in all Member States, and promote measures to help industry to make the necessary changes.
It is important that environmental targets are achieved as cost-effectively as possible.
For that reason, Mrs Jackson' s question is more than justified.
As worthy as the tighter restriction on emissions as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are, we should be aware of the possible adverse effects of our hopes and voting behaviour.
Delaying this directive and embarking on a course of prolonged conciliation, the poker game which someone mentioned, would certainly be the worst alternative from the point of view of the environment. And besides, the environmental benefits gained from more stringent measures would be very slight in comparison with the costs.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her work on this important proposal.
I know you have a lot to do on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and other things.
The proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings aims to tackle acidification, eutrophication and ground level ozone simultaneously.
It is therefore highly significant for two of the four priority areas identified in the Commission's proposal for a Sixth Environmental Action Programme: nature and bio-diversity and health and the environment.
There are still important areas of the Union where nature and biodiversity suffer from the impact of acid rain eutrophication and citizens are affected by ground level ozone, as has already been commented on by Members of Parliament.
We must solve these problems.
Amendments Nos 10 and 13 seek to reinstate the emission ceilings originally proposed by the Commission.
In their common position the Member States endorse both the long-term goals and the interim objectives of the proposal.
They have re-examined the commitments that they made in the Gothenburg Protocol and have signed up to more action.
But they all consider that there are uncertainties and other factors that may change the picture in a few years time: energy plans, accession and so on. This is why Member States have agreed to look again at these issues in 2004.
The Commission can accept this as a first step on the understanding that our aim in 2004 will be to make up the shortfall.
I am very concerned that it would be exceedingly difficult to have successful discussions on Amendments Nos 10 and 13 with the Council.
