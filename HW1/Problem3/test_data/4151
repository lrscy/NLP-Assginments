I am just floating the idea.
Think about it!
The final point I wanted to make is that I think we need to move from a time of euro-pessimism towards euro-optimism.
Let us stop whining and blaming.
Let us start working and looking at the bigger picture.
We are actually doing quite well.
With these words I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency and welcome the Finnish Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, the Austrian Presidency has been marked by numerous initiatives and challenges on gender issues.
Political agreement was reached on the draft regulation establishing the European Institute for Gender Equality, and conclusions on the review of the implementation by the Member States and the EU institutions of the Beijing Platform for Action and on womenâs health have been adopted.
The roadmap for gender equality was presented, which can be marked as a milestone and a concrete timetable for key actions on gender equality for the period 2006-2010.
I welcome in particular the commitment to produce a communication on the gender pay gap next year.
This is something on which PES Women, of which I am President, has done a lot of work.
We need concrete actions.
The legislation dates back to the 1970s but there has not been much progress.
The average difference in the EU is still 16%.
The grave situation as regards the trafficking of women has been put at the centre of attention in association with the FIFA World Cup.
I have strongly welcomed the campaign launched by German women, showing the red card to forced prostitution and calling for cross-border cooperation in the promotion of the red card campaign, putting forward the idea of zero tolerance of trafficking throughout Europe.
On the eve of the World Cup I handed over the final list of signatures to the anti-trafficking campaign to Commissioner Frattini.
The largest trade union in Denmark handed over a similar petition with 80Â 000 signatures.
The PSE Group collected 23Â 000 signatures calling for action by EU Member States to prevent the trafficking of women into Germany to work as prostitutes during the World Cup.
Commissioner Frattini was asked to report back after the World Cup with an assessment of the scale of the problem and a summary of the actions taken.
There is need for a real debate across Europe on tackling the root causes of trafficking for sexual exploitation, and that means looking for ways to reduce the demand for prostitution.
The EU should intensify the fight against trafficking in human beings.
Note that we are not going to stop pressing the EU to take this issue seriously.
In conclusion, I wish the music of Mozart not just for the elite, but for all.
Â Â  Mr President, the reflection period has been more like a paralysis period, which is very reminiscent of the reaction of animals in the countryside when they are blinded by entirely unexpected glints of light.
SchÃŒssel is asking us to be cheerful, Barroso is asking us for confidence and more cheerful colours, but we need something more from them in order to give them what they are asking for.
We need more realism in their diagnosis and more courage to face up to what is really necessary.
You know what is needed.
It seems clear that we have to wait until 2007 for the elections in a Member State in order to really start moving.
However, we need to use the extensive possibilities offered by the current Treaties.
In this sense, the movement towards transparency deserves all of the congratulations and we need to start working on realistic options.
These realistic options do not include putting an old, completely dried out dish in the microwave and serving it again.
We need to cook afresh, because if we just warm up a dish that no one can digest, indigestion will result in it being rejected even more than the first time it was served.
Â Â  Mr President, today I wish to pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency, and to Austria for having held the Presidency of the European Union in recent months.
I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to three things.
Firstly, the Austrian Presidency has helped to maintain transatlantic relations at a high level, and indeed to deepen relations between the European Union and the United States.
It has been apparent that this has been one of the Austrian Presidencyâs priorities.
I should like to express my particular thanks to the Presidency for the part it has played in ensuring the success of the dialogue between the European Parliament and the US Congress, and in the excellent organisation of the meeting between delegations from the European Union and the United States in spring 2006 in Vienna.
The second issue I should like to highlight is the fact that the Austrian Presidency took the monitoring of racism, xenophobia, homophobia and nationalism throughout the European Union as one of its priorities.
This has indeed been one of the Presidencyâs priorities, and there can be no doubt that, as far as Austria is concerned, the fight against such phenomena is one of the European Unionâs key areas of action.
The third issue to which I should like to draw the Houseâs attention is the enlargement dimension, which has been steered by this Presidency.
I should like to express my thanks for the Presidencyâs impartiality.
It really can be said that Austria has held the Presidency without resorting to ideology or partisanship, and that it has instead reflected the majority opinion in the European Union.
In some ways, one could say that it has represented the voice of the majority in the European Parliament.
Above all, I have in mind the role played by the Austrian Presidency in appeasing enlargement-related sentiments and in encouraging moderation in this matter, as well as in ensuring that the enlargement of the European Union is still open to debate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, ladies and gentlemen, the balance sheet of the Austrian Presidencyâs six-month term is positive, above all in respect of its political achievements.
We have seen the last of the phase of Euro-pessimism, of that negative sentiment that the Romans called Today, European politics are looking ahead; despite the resistance of certain countries that emerged at last weekâs European Council, we have resumed discussions of the operational project aimed at establishing the European Constitution.
In this connection, I believe that MrÂ Poetteringâs proposal must be welcomed by the Council and the Commission.
Although the text signed in Rome will have to be modified in order to receive final approval, I agree with you: the substance of what is to be the European must not be changed.
Without the Constitutional Treaty there will be no Peopleâs Europe, nor a European Union capable of fulfilling its role.
But what should this role be?
It should be based on the principle of subsidiarity, thus satisfying the demands of those citizens that cannot get adequate responses from their own governments and from local bodies.
In this era of globalisation, the Member States, on their own, cannot solve the major issues relating to immigration, to the war on terrorism, to energy policy, to the liberalisation of the market and to the budget.
It is therefore Europeâs task to confront these issues, which fortuitously are those that have been examined and, in some cases, resolved by your Presidency â which I genuinely consider to be the forerunner for subsequent presidencies called on to establish the Constitution, thanks also to the active support of the European Parliament.
Chancellor, I should like in conclusion to appeal to you in your capacity as Austrian Chancellor: in the matter of stem cell research, please continue to defend the principle of subsidiarity and ethical values, the heritage of European civilisation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is in better shape now than it was a year ago.
However, it is not yet what we want it to be.
There is still a long way to go, but it is in a better state than it was a year ago and it has shown itself capable of acting in certain areas.
On 26 July we shall hopefully be able to add the foreign policy Financial Perspective to Austriaâs achievements.
Permit me to take this opportunity to offer sincere thanks in this connection to a pillar of European policy in Brussels, AmbassadorÂ Woschnagg.
The Financial Perspective has been agreed, but we can see that, even on these kinds of issue, the veto principle leads only to a victory for the lowest common denominator.
This reveals the weaknesses of our decision-making structures.
I am thankful, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, that we shall now have more transparency in the Council.
We have fought for that.
It still does not amount to the democracy and citizenâs rights encapsulated in the Constitution, but we can be thankful for the progress made.
You have brought the Constitutional Treaty back on track.
We can see new opportunities, and I am more optimistic today than I was six months ago.
However, we need to talk about more than the substance.
It must be made clear that no one is really bringing Parts I and II of the actual Constitution into question because they represent a balance which no one has so far formulated better.
This should be our guiding principle in the debates in the months to come.
With regard, in particular, to the internal orientation of the European Union in the light of the Constitutional Treaty, issues relating to Europeâs borders, its absorption capacity and such like have also, under this Presidency, been placed at the centre of the debate.
The balance struck between these two aspects â internal structure and external borders â will be important to the future structure of Europe.
This is something we need to debate.
I hope that the necessary new approaches exist to enable us to advance further in these respects.
If we do not make progress in these areas, we will end up with a smaller Europe, and that is something that none of us wants.
We do not want Poland and other countries to assume second-class status in Europe.
You are meeting the Americans today and tomorrow.
GuantÃ¡namo is an important issue, but the United States and Europe are not bound by any treaty.
Both, however, have treaties with other countries in the world.
We need an institutional framework for relations between Europe and America.
Perhaps we can set the ball rolling today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to address the issues briefly.
Firstly, the issue of the US summit.
I will start with this issue as it has been mentioned by several speakers.
You are entirely right that we need to pay great attention to the transatlantic dialogue and its outcomes.
If America and Europe work hand in hand rather than confronting each other, we can really get things moving.
We are surely all aware of that.
Notwithstanding legitimate critiques of American behaviour â to which we should not turn a blind eye - the American-European friendship and partnership is, moreover, an important foundation stone for the future.
I am deeply convinced of this, and I want to express this conviction in this House, even if it may not be universally popular.
We shall therefore lay several very important milestones at this summit.
Firstly, an agreement whereby Europe and America will take up arms against product piracy on the basis of very specific concrete actions.
We also want to collaborate on the energy question, this being an area in which the Americans are in fact ahead of us.
In fact, when it comes to research into renewable energy carriers, the Americans are well ahead of us.
Together we could get things moving, partly in the interests of the Kyoto objectives, climate protection and a lot more. Foreign policy is also important.
The Near East, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan all constitute important issues, and it goes without saying that we are not losing sight of long-term goals such as a transatlantic free-trade zone and an overall treaty.
You can be sure that the issues of human rights, GuantÃ¡namo and CIA overflights will naturally be discussed.
I mentioned these matters personally during my visit to Washington in December.
I also say this because, during the Austrian Presidency, we have begun a dialogue with legal experts - John Bellinger of the and, now, the Office of the Legal Advisor in Austria - on what is to be done in practical terms.
It is a little-known fact that Hans Winkler was also one of the pioneers of this dialogue, and I agreed the proceedings with MrÂ Bush in December.
The fact that there are gaps in international law is obvious.
These gaps are being discussed quite intensively in America, with decisions being made by the highest courts.
Yesterdayâs Austrian âStandardâ published an interview with John Bellinger which I find very interesting.
We have been able to eliminate some elements from the dispute that are of great importance to me, and I hope that tomorrow the situation will remain the same.
There should be no part of the world in which human rights do not apply.
There must be no torture, whatever the standard by which this is measured.
There must be no abduction of persons and no detaining them in secret prisons or detention centres or whatever these might euphemistically be called.
This must be expressed in the knowledge that at the same time - and we partly have the Americans to thank for this â we can and must do a great deal to export democracy, strengthen NGOs and strengthen civic or civil society.
These issues are being discussed.
Secondly, I turn to the subject of transparency.
I really do not want to fight an Austrian election, because that is not my intention.
It is interesting, however, that the Austrian Greens have all left the Chamber.
To accuse me of not seeking dialogue with the people seems to me to be a little unfair, for the âCafÃ© dâEuropeâ was really an attempt to become involved with everyday life.
The fact is, the idea of Europe originated in the coffee houses.
Europe was born in the coffee houses of Europe.
Moreover, Europe is still being created in the cafÃ©s of Europe, where many writers, philosophers and journalists are continuing what Coudenhove-Kalergi started.
To dismiss Europe as a project of the elite is, if you will pardon my saying so, simply unjustified.
We are also exploiting the new media.
I am surprised by the fact that our own website, âThe future of Europe; Europe is listeningâ, has had eight million visitors.
How many politicians have the opportunity to speak directly to eight million people?
We have also had 32 million visitors to the Presidency website.
In fact, I think that we can do more and that we should have the confidence to do more.
This has nothing to do with self-congratulation. It is simply about working in a professional way with the new media.
I turn now to the subject of enlargement.
This issue is very important to me, as, in 1998, I was the Austrian Foreign Minister and Council President when we began the enlargement process.
It was sometimes an uphill struggle.
Majority opinion in Austria was sometimes against me and my strategy.
However, we remained steadfast and, today, we have, for example, in connection with what was the very contentious issue of the accession of the Czech Republic, a majority that is now pleased that that country joined the EU.
I am very happy about this.
That is to say, it is only right.
It is just a question of standing up for enlargement, and MrÂ Rehn, who is investing a lot of time and energy in the matter, can confirm the need to make such a stand.
Ten years ago, the wage and income differential between ourselves and the new Member States was 10:1.
Today it is half that.
This is a win-win situation.
We can export, we have a virtual Hong Kong on our doorstep and we can profit from this impetus for growth.
We just need to have faith in ourselves, to position ourselves well and to spread positive news rather than the usual negative rumours.
The Turkish issue is also part of the overall picture.
We must speak truthfully.
I have fought hard to open negotiations with Turkey and also to bring this chapter to a conclusion.
We need to be clear about one thing, however: obligations must be honoured.
The obligations contained in the Ankara Protocol must be honoured in full, and, coming when they did, the statements of last week, which have been very disappointing for all those who have shown great commitment to the European route of binding Turkey to Europe, were an example of particularly bad timing on our part.
I turn now to my last but one point: the Constitutional Treaty.
Allow me to speak openly here.
We need some new elements.
This is obvious to everyone who feels affection for this painfully acquired child of European unity.
We all know this.
Forgive me, but I am not keen on the term âConstitutional Treatyâ.
It has, in any case, been a very peculiar compromise.
What we have is neither a Constitution nor a Treaty, but a Constitutional Treaty.
Let us give it another name, because it resonates with other implications.
People must already be aware of that.
What is more, we will of course need interpretations.
That is why this Messina-type declaration is quite important.
Why was there some opposition to this Constitutional Treaty?
Because there were concerns that liberal or other tendencies were being over-emphasised.
I am of a different opinion.
I believe that the Constitutional Treaty contains solid individual social basic rights.
It contains twelve concrete basic rights which can be enforced right up to the level of the European Court of Justice.
Nobody knows about them, however.
I believe that we must try to bring this element of European life and of the European social model more into the spotlight.
If we can do that, then we shall be in a better position and less vulnerable to criticism, for, according to Eurobarometer - â if I read the figures correctly - 63% of Europeans are in favour of such a Constitution or Treaty.
It is not right that a minority put its stamp on the whole of Europe.
It must be possible to come to a common solution, characterised by consensus, even while some are bound to find fault.
That is democracy, after all.
It must be possible for the majority to fight for a majority view, and that is what I am doing.
I shall say a few words about the subject of sign posts, just to put everyone in the picture.
Last year in Austria, I was partly responsible for having 20 extra bilingual signposts put up with the cooperation of the Austrian Regional Governor, a measure that was greatly welcomed by all the political parties.
I now have an ordinance in the course of being appraised which will provide for a further 60.
We expect the Constitutional Court of Appeal also to recognise the ordinance this week, and we shall produce the final resolution next week.
However, for me the most important issue is not that of the sign posts.
The greatest success for minority politics in Carinthia is that 36% of all school-age children in Carinthia now attend bilingual primary school classes and learn German and Slovenian â voluntarily.
That is the real success of the European model: the fact that we are voluntarily becoming curious about our languages.
It makes me very happy to hear praise that we have introduced a bit of realism.
I have no time for those who mutter that it is all hot air and will evaporate tomorrow.
We need to prepare in a very professional manner for what we have to do, and the Finns will do just that.
I wish them well.
Matti Vanhanen and his team and Erkki Tuomioja and all the rest will do so just as we have, as will the Germans thereafter.
However, we still have something to learn, and not only culturally but also in terms of sport, from what is now happening.
I have just worked out that, so far, we have seen 32 matches in the football world cup, of which 20 have pitted Europe against the rest of the world, that is to say against other continents.
We have won twelve, drawn four and lost four.
That is not bad for a global player and, if we do the same in our political dealings, nothing can go wrong anymore.
Â Â  . Mr President, after the Chancellorâs comprehensive summing-up of the debate, let me just say a few words about enlargement after the European Council.
The Commission welcomes the conclusions on enlargement of the European Council, skilfully presided by the Austrian Presidency.
These conclusions pave the way for a new consensus on enlargement in the European Union.
This new consensus should, above all, enhance our enlightened self-interest to extend the zone of peace, democracy and prosperity in Europe, while, at the same time, ensuring our capacity to function effectively and gradually absorb new members.
I want to draw your attention to three particular conclusions.
Firstly, the European Council rightly underlines the success of EU enlargement by stating that it has proved a historic opportunity contributing to peace, security, stability, democracy and the rule of law, as well as to growth and prosperity in the Union as a whole, to which Chancellor SchÃŒssel rightly referred.
Secondly, I am satisfied that the European Council did not change the criteria of accession that were agreed in Copenhagen in 1993.
No new criteria were set up; instead, the European Council reaffirmed that it will honour its existing commitments .
Thus it confirmed the EUâs consolidated enlargement agenda, which covers south-eastern Europe, i.e. Bulgaria and Romania, Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans.
I shall have an opportunity to talk about Turkey and its reforms and commitments at this afternoonâs meeting of Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Thirdly, the European Council stresses the importance of ensuring that in the future the Union is able to function politically, financially and institutionally as it enlarges, and to further deepen Europeâs common project.
It is a very important dimension and objective for this House and for the Commission.
As we know, the European Council will hold a debate in December 2006, and the Commission was invited to report on all the relevant aspects of enlargement pertaining to the Unionâs absorption capacity.
This corresponds by and large to Parliamentâs resolution following the Brok report some time ago.
The Commission will duly and gladly present a strategy document on enlargement, including absorption capacity, as part of our enlargement package in October/November 2006.
I have started to prepare that document, and we are looking forward to a substantive and responsible enlargement debate with Parliament and the Council.
This debate should not be limited just to the EU institutions: it should also reach out to civil society, both in the Member States as well as in the candidate countries.
It is time to create a new consensus on EU enlargement policy, based on the consolidation of our commitments, rigorous application of conditionality and better communication with our citizens.
That is the best way to ensure that enlargement remains a success story, as has now been acknowledged by the European Council.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, firstly, please allow me to congratulate the Austrian Presidency and MrÂ WolfgangÂ SchÃŒssel, the President, for their work and the results achieved in the past six months.
In the course of its term, the Austrian Presidency has had to face considerable challenges.
Further work is required in respect of the Constitutional Treaty before a final â and hopefully positive â decision is reached.
The âparallel approachâ which, on the one hand, continues the reconciliation work regarding the future of the Treaty, and on the other hand, focuses more resolutely on results and projects that facilitate daily processes to a higher extent, seems to be correct.
I find that the published list containing the successful initiatives that can be implemented by 2010 is very useful in this respect.
I believe that the adoption of a time schedule regarding continuation has been a particularly significant step forward.
However, I think it is unfortunate that real, substantial decisions have not been reached even during the Austrian Presidency on issues that are always postponed, such as the regulation of working hours.
Still, I welcome the initiative that a solemn political statement on European values and endeavours should be made at the March 2007 European Union Summit in Berlin, which will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
I agree that in the case of codecision procedures Council sessions should be public, and I support the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union, in the hope that this will improve the situation of the Hungarian ethnic minority.
The new Finnish Presidency will inherit numerous unresolved problems, and it will have to focus in the future on economic reforms, social justice, safety and stability, as well as the role of Europe in the world.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Tuesday 20 June 2006.
Â Â  Ten years after the Dutroux case, Belgium is once again in the throes of an horrendous drama.
Two girls, Stacy Lemmens and Nathalie Mahy, have been murdered.
Their names have been added to those of Julie and MÃ©lissa, to those of An and Eefje and to that of Leyla.
I would like to express my condolences to their families on behalf of the European Parliament.
Some people may see this as an individual isolated case that only affects the victims, but when does an isolated case become an issue for society?
I believe that we are dealing with an issue for society and that, whether in Belgium or in any other country where such tragedies may take place, we cannot remain indifferent when it is innocence itself that is being murdered.
It is our duty to consider thoroughly why and how this kind of behaviour continues to take place in our developed and civilised societies.
That should be another purpose of politics: to prevent it, to help the families of the victims and also to prevent people from forgetting and therefore allowing similar dramatic events from happening again in the future.
I do not therefore believe that we are yielding to the surge of current public opinion when we stand and remember these victims: because we are not dealing with a single isolated event that warrants no more than a mention in the newspapers; no, we are dealing with a real problem being faced by our society which has a lot to do with the black depths of the human soul.
While I was preparing this speech, I also heard the news of a tragic rail accident which is likely to have caused 40 deaths and hundreds of injured in Valencia.
I therefore believe that this is an appropriate time for us all to observe a minuteâs silence in memory of all of these victims.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 29 June 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendment has been proposed.
A request has been received from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, pursuant to RuleÂ 168, to return to committee the report by MrsÂ Roure on the protection of personal data (police and judicial cooperation), the vote on which was scheduled for tomorrow.
Do you wish to explain the committee's proposal, MrsÂ Roure?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like my report on the framework decision on data protection to be referred to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
May I remind you that during the last plenary session we asked the Council for a position and a clear commitment on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament.
We have still not had a response from the Council.
I know that the Finnish Presidency intends working very closely with us on this subject.
That is why we need more time and why we are asking for the report to be referred to committee and for tomorrowâs vote to be deferred until the September part-session.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  â Mr President, with the World Cup being held in Germany, I feel obliged to take this opportunity to congratulate the organisers and the German Government on their safety measures â which are functioning perfectly â and, more importantly, on the hospitality being extended to foreign citizens visiting Germany.
I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the European Parliament's efforts, both on the resolution on racism in football and on measures to combat forced prostitution during the World Cup, which I denounced in plenary, have paid off.
Billions of television viewers around the world are watching and hearing our message during transmission of the football results.
It is without doubt a unique success on the part of the European Parliament.
I visited Germany during the World Cup and I noted that the German authorities, in cooperation with FIFA, had taken our suggestions on board and that the measures were having positive results.
Many of them are now experiencing in Germany the enthusiasm and anxiety for their teams and are celebrating their victories together.
They will return home, where discrimination, racism and xenophobia await them after the intermission for the World Cup.
Let this happy intermission be an example to us; it showed us that Europe and the entire world can understand differences in a climate of equality, harmony and mutual respect.
Â Â  The uprising in the Polish town of Poznan, the first revolt against the dark dictatorship enveloping Central Europe, started fifty years ago, in June 1956.
As a Hungarian MEP, I believe that it is particularly important to remember the heroes of the democratic movement in Poznan, because the Hungarian revolution in the autumn of 1956 was partly based on and inspired through solidarity with this movement.
Although the dictatorial Communist regime in Eastern Europe only collapsed a few decades later, in 1989, it is clear that the heroic self-sacrifice of several thousand Poles and Hungarians constituted the first step towards freedom.
These democratic movements fighting for civil rights showed the world that the Polish and Hungarian nations' love of freedom cannot be suppressed, and that it could not be suppressed even by Soviet tanks and Communist collaborators.
Here in Europe, in the European Parliament, we are building the Europe of the future, but in order to be successful, we need to know our history well.
We should not forget that fifty years ago, fundamental values such as democracy, freedom, independence and human rights were already so valuable that thousands of people were ready to sacrifice their lives for them.
Only in the knowledge of these facts will we be able to appreciate the results that we have achieved together.
Â Â  Mr President, the Council, the Commission and the Committee of the Regions have reached agreements with the Spanish Government on the use of Spainâs co-official languages in their activities.
The Bureauâs rejection of a similar agreement in the European Parliament has led to passionate calls for it to reconsider its decision.
The President of the and the President of the Galician Parliament have both sent messages calling for a decision in favour.
The Bureau is going to deal with this issue again at its meeting today.
As the Community institution directly representing the European citizens, this Parliament cannot close its doors to a form of institutional cooperation that will provide it with means to intensify its relations with the citizens and to give their linguistic rights a European dimension.
Diversity, a source of mutual openness and wealth, is the genuine meaning of European unity and a genuine counter-balance to the homogenising tendencies of globalisation.
Â Â  â Mr President, last week the Turkish press reported that the Turkish Ministry of Home Affairs was conducting an enquiry into the role of the Mayor of Diyarbakir who, according to allegations by the Turkish Government, supported the protesters during the episodes which took place in this town a short while ago.
At the same time, the Turkish authorities have prevented 41 Kurdish visitors from leaving Istanbul because their Iraqi passports contain both Arabic and Kurdish script.
How can we negotiate with a country in which there are no fundamental democratic institutions and which also snubs us as an institution, given that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, MrÂ Gul, has refused to appear before next week's Committee on Foreign Affairs?
Let us take decisions which will ensure that there are no surprises in store in a few years' time.
We may not be here, but we need to be careful as to what we leave behind for those who come after us.
Â Â  Mr President, the adoption at the most recent plenary session of a resolution which slanders first and foremost Poles and the radio station , making unfounded allegations of homophobia, anti-semitism, xenophobia and racism, is a scandal against which I have received thousands of protests, including those asking whether any of the 301 Members who sanctioned this Machiavellian lie have ever listened to .
The resolution has already been cited with the aim of inciting violence against my nation and against the radio station in question, which also has non-Catholic listeners.
I would therefore like to ask whether this is what tolerance means in the European Union; a European Union in which a minority imposes its views on millions of citizens, and attempts to impose not only a superstate with one government, military and currency, but also a single legitimate ideology, something with which Poles are particularly familiar from their experience of previous totalitarian systems?
I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the young Member from Finland to show some respect for the truth and for women, something which even a less sophisticated culture requires as a minimum.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrsÂ Krupa.
I must point out that they have not only written to you.
The President of Parliament has also received a letter from the President of the Polish Parliament expressing his concern and rejection of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament.
That letter has been passed on to the members of the Conference of Presidents where it will be subjected to political analysis at its next meeting.
Â Â  â Mr President, in all the countries of Europe there is the capital and a large city: there are Madrid and Barcelona, there are Paris and Lyon, there are Rome and Milan.
In Greece, there is no shortage of cities competing with the capitals in terms of quality of life.
In Greece, we have our second city, Thessaloniki, the symbol of all the Balkans, a city with a two-and-a-half thousand year history, which bears the name of Alexander the Great's sister, that is how far back it dates, a city which was the cultural capital of Europe ten years ago and which is in a terrible state.
It has three times the pollution of any city in Europe.
It does not have even 100Â metres of intersections.
It has no trams, no metro, not even a flyover.
The people are suffocating: it takes about two hours to travel five kilometres.
So we need to do something.
MrsÂ HÃŒbner had the kindness to tell me the mayor's position is ineffective; in other words, he has not asked for anything.
However, this does not mean that the people of Thessaloniki need to have the quality of life which they have.
We need to do something.
Â Â  We are currently celebrating the 550th anniversary of a victory of worldwide importance. We are celebrating the fact that ten thousand soldiers in a Hungarian border fortress, called NÃ¡ndorfehÃ©rvÃ¡r in those days and Belgrade today, managed to stop the one hundred thousand-strong Turkish army.
This was a tremendous victory, because three years after the fall of Constantinople not only the Balkans, but Western Christendom too was in extreme danger when the Sultan started to advance along the Danube.
The Pope was so relieved and happy that he ordered the bells to be rung at midday in every church, every day.
This is why church bells have been ringing at midday in Christendom for over five hundred years.
After the NÃ¡ndorfehÃ©rvÃ¡r victory, the Turks did not dare threaten the Western world for seventy years, and the ensuing huge social and economic boom allowed capitalism to take hold.
The victory also demonstrated that Christendom was able to defend its values when it acted in union, because the victory against the numerically superior enemy was shared by West European mercenaries too, some of whom, however, fought on the Turkish side as well.
A strategic alliance was formed between the Catholic kingdom of Hungary and the Balkan nations, especially the Serbs and Albanians, which later included Wallachia too.
Unfortunately, volunteer crusaders arrived only from Hungary and our East European region, although solidarity should have been reciprocal then, just like it should be today.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to denounce before the European Parliament today's unacceptable decision by FIFA to suspend the Hellenic Football Federation and to ban the staging of international matches in Greece, the country which organised such spectacular Olympic Games and in which the sporting ideal was born.
In its response to a question about the legal framework of professional football, the competent Commissioner, MrÂ Figel, told me that the national authorities are basically responsible for clarifying the legal framework relating to the staging of sports at Member State level.
The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has to ensure that Community law is fully respected and applied.
FIFA has passed a decision that undermines this vertical relationship between the European Union and the Member States and is unacceptable.
The Commissioner said, and I quote, that FIFA and UEFA, insofar as they are engaged in economic activities, must ensure that they comply with the legislation of the European Community.
We have case law.
Â Â  â ( Mr President, the trial of the Palestinian doctor and Bulgarian nurses in Libya reopened three weeks ago.
The procedure chosen is a very complicated one and will make it very difficult for international organisations to help defend the rights of these persons who have been wrongly imprisoned.
In fact, the procedure involves only one hearing a week.
You can see how difficult it is going to be to organise their defence.
Moreover, everyone knows that, materially speaking, the crimes of which they are accused are implausible and that these citizens have been held in prison and tortured for seven years.
May we therefore join together in saying to Libya that our only concern, now and in the future, is to help young Libyans who are infected with Aids.
In no case, however, do we want Libya to take citizens hostage, be they from Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We must say to the authorities, in the name of human rights, in the name of respect for Libya, ârelease them!â
Â Â  The Memorandum of Understanding concerning the implementation of the Nabucco gas pipeline project was signed in Vienna over the past week.
This is obviously good news, at a time when we continue to receive mainly negative news from the natural gas market.
Following the supply problems experienced at the beginning of the year, further problems are predicted for winter, and prices are rising; also, in a manner not unrelated to this, Russia is using its position as a gas supplier as one of its political instruments, in an increasingly obvious fashion.
Therefore, the vulnerability of Europe and European consumers is continuously increasing.
In this situation, the twenty to thirty billion cubic metre capacity of the Nabucco pipeline would tangibly increase gas supply security in the European Union within a decade.
This would be due to the fact that Nabucco provides a simultaneous diversification both in respect of the transit route and the source of procurement, compared with other proposals that would only provide an alternative transport route for the existing infrastructure.
Therefore, we should welcome the Memorandum of Understanding signed last week, and we can state that at this time, Nabucco does not have any real competitors in terms of increasing the European Union's natural gas supply resources.
Â Â  Mr President, there is something to which I should like to draw your attention.
On 10Â July 2003, SibelÂ Yalvac, a 21-year old, mentally-retarded woman from Rotterdam was arrested at the airport of the Indonesian capital of Djakarta.
On 6Â April 2004, she was sentenced there to 10 yearsâ imprisonment for smuggling drugs.
Two independent Dutch experts, a psychologist and a probation officer, have examined Sibel and declared her to be not fully .
She has difficulty distinguishing between cause and effect, is gullible, has a great deal of fantasy and cannot count to 12.
Sibel has been exploited by ruthless criminals for their drugs trade and now faces years of hell.
It so happens that in Indonesia, each year around Independence Day, which falls on 17Â August, there is a possibility of gaining amnesty.
Together with my fellow countryman, MrÂ vanÂ Bommel, who is a member of the Dutch Lower House, I have started a campaign to ask the Indonesian Government to be lenient and, given her special circumstances, to grant Sibel amnesty.
On behalf of Sibel and her desperate family, the âHelp Sibelâ campaign is asking for your support in this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago, on 29Â June, the 120th anniversary of the birth of Robert Schuman took place, one of the founding fathers of a united Europe.
It is a shame that this anniversary went by so unnoticed; it is a shame because I do not know how this honourable statesman would feel if he were here today and could see how the European Parliament is breaking yet another barrier protecting the human species from destructive biomedical experiments.
We have to call a spade a spade.
The funding of research into human embryos and embryonic stem cells under the Seventh Framework Programme, a Programme which is necessary in other respects, creates a dangerous testing ground with respect to .
Human embryos are not objects; they are the beginnings of a human being just like you, like me and like all of us.
How does this fit in with respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, for instance, which states in ArticleÂ 1 that âHuman dignity is inviolable.
It must be respected and protectedâ?
How does this fit in with respect for the legislation which is binding in many Member States of the European Union, including Poland?
How does this fit in with respect for the religious beliefs of many Europeans?
That is why I appeal for reflection and for halting this decision.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out a worrying development to you and to my fellow MEPs: the deterioration that I feel is taking place in relations between the European institutions and that section of civil society that is represented by consumer associations.
The latest event that I should like specifically to point out (though there have been others) is what happened recently at the European Food Safety Authority.
In accordance with ArticleÂ 25 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the 14 members comprising the management board must include four members that should have â and I quote from the text â âtheir background in organisations representing consumers and other interests in the food chainâ.
It says 'and' and not 'or' in the article but, in actual fact, only members representing interests were appointed.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to pay tribute to the Polish citizens who, 50 years ago, stood up in PoznaÅ for their freedom, dignity and social justice against a Communist dictatorship introduced by the Soviet Union.
This autumn will also mark 50 years of the Hungarian revolution.
These anniversaries remind us of a task still to be accomplished: the integration of our historic heritage to unite peopleâs perception of history in all parts of Europe.
Mr President, I expected you to mention the PoznaÅ uprising in your introduction today.
Tomorrow I will be interested to learn more about the Franco dictatorship in your native country.
Still, I expect you to show an equal interest in the history of central and eastern Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last month, we held a debate here in response to the tragic deaths in Antwerp of a two-year old girl and her Malian nanny who died at the hands of an 18-year old lunatic.
Ten days ago, my city of Antwerp was once again startled by brutal and racist violence when in broad daylight and right in the city centre, six young immigrants stamped a 53-year old train driver to death on a public transport bus, because he dared to ask them to keep the noise down.
This reminds me of those two French men, Jean-Claude Irvoas and Jean-Jacques Le Chenadec, who were lynched during last yearâs riots in the French for similar reasons.
These too are incidents of racism, of anti-white, anti-Flemish and anti-French racism.
I therefore dare express the hope here that this House, concerned as it is about every form of xenophobia and intolerance, will once again organise a debate on a matter of topical and urgent importance, that matter being the explosive situation involving migrants in the districts of some major European cities.
At least then, the most courageous gesture of my murdered fellow-countryman will not have been in vain.
Â Â  Mr President, 18 months ago I was one of the signatories of the appeal, signed by over 50 Members, which called for Parliament to support the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.
I also voted in our Parliament for the door to be opened to Ankara.
It is therefore all the more regrettable that today there are reports in the world press of another attempt on the life of a Catholic priest in Turkey.
The priest is injured but has survived the attack.
Sadly, this is not the first attack on a clergyman, a non-Muslim, in that country.
The previous attack had a tragic end as the priest was killed.
Personally, I am worried about Turkeyâs failure to respect religious freedom.
I am not the only one who is worried.
This makes the road to European Union membership longer for Turkey.
Even supporters such as myself, who are in favour of enlarging the European Union structures to include this country, believe this to be the case.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to express my deep concern about the situation in the Middle East and my support for the Palestinian people.
Events following the abduction of the Israeli soldier and Israel's reprisals are, on the one hand, harming the Palestinians as a political entity, with their representatives, be they ministers or parliamentarians, being abducted and with citizens' being deprived of passports and residency rights, and are impoverishing the entire nation, given that bridges, schools and pumping and electricity stations are being bombed and set on fire, on the other.
Apart from direct humanitarian aid and the call for both sides to act in a mature and responsible manner, we must also set other objectives and analyse the situation, the causes, the aims of each side and the means being used to achieve them and we must also analyse our own political conduct.
European citizens are calling on us to defend the principles of legality, international law and solidarity.
They are also calling for us to defend the European national and Community resources used to finance the infrastructure works of the Palestinian Authority which are then destroyed in Israeli attacks.
Â Â  Mr President, this afternoon the decision will be made as to whether, finally, the citizens of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia will be able to address the European Parliament in their respective mother tongues.
I hope that the letters from the Presidents of the Parliaments of Catalonia and Galicia which have been addressed to the Presidency will help to win the respect and support of those people who have opposed what will be a great step forward in terms of bringing more than 11Â million speakers of those languages closer to the European Union.
It is just one step, a first step, on the basis of which we will have to move forward towards full recognition of the rights of these citizens, who have made their resolutely European tradition and vocation one of the pillars of their democratic societies.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to make it clear that, when we advocate the use of these co-official languages of the Spanish State by its citizens in their relations with the Union, we are also defending the linguistic rights of all those speakers of languages of the current EU Member States â rights that have not yet been fully recognised in the normal functioning of this Parliament; these citizens have our full support.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ Badia.
Thank you for alerting me to the existence of the letters from the Presidents of the Parliaments of Catalonia and Galicia, which are not scheduled to be put to the Bureau today.
Parliamentâs services will ascertain whether those letters have arrived or whether they are still on their way to us.
Â Â  â I wish to greet the workers from Opel General Motors in the Azambuja region of Portugal in this plenary session, who are currently fighting for their jobs and for the future of the company, following the threat of manufacturing being transferred abroad.
If this threat materialises, thousands of jobs will be lost and the social and economic impact will be devastating.
Parliament has adopted a number of resolutions putting forward a series of recommendations on company relocations.
I therefore feel it is vitally important for Parliament to examine what initiatives the Commission has taken with a view to implementing the following measures: making Community aid conditional on long-term agreements on employment and local development, as Parliament has proposed; setting up a register of companies relocating and benefiting directly or indirectly from public incentives, thereby failing to meet their contractual obligations; refusal to grant or requirement to return Community funding for companies that fail to meet their contractual obligations in full â I wonder how many times this has been implemented; practical measures adopted by the Commission to support the workers and to foster the economic recovery of the regions affected by relocations; and the drafting of a Code of Conduct to prevent company relocations.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to another case of discrimination that has arisen recently.
My colleague hired a car from Europcar in Brussels to drive to Strasbourg.
The hire companyâs representative explained to him that the car could not be used in the countries of the East and indicated the forbidden areas.
I found that very strange because Europcar operates in all the new member countries.
How is that possible?
I have myself hired cars for two years in Budapest and I was able to drive from Budapest to Brussels.
I did not, however, travel from Brussels to Budapest with a car from the same company.
The explanation given was that it was a very dangerous area.
Now, statistics show that fewer cars are stolen in Slovenia and Hungary than in some countries of the Fifteen.
That is no doubt a detail, but it reminds you of the case of the Polish plumber.
Â Â  We shall find out what has happened so that we can prevent any kind of discrimination and because we cannot carry on adding cases.
After the Polish plumber, we cannot now get into the case of the Belgian car.
I am sure that MrÂ McCreevy will have taken good note.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak about a serious incident that took place only a few hours ago: 18 emigrants have drowned while heading for the Canary Islands, and another two emigrants were found dead this morning at the Melilla fence, between Morocco and Spain.
According to a statement made by a representative of the Melilla Government, the two people would appear to have been shot dead.
We, in this House, have already previously denounced the Spanish civil guard's use of firearms on immigrants.
The Spanish daily claims that handguns have been used in an intimidatory fashion to deter immigrants who wanted to cross the Melilla border.
Mr President, we believe that all of this is very serious and we would ask you whether it is possible for the Bureau to ascertain the truth of these claims, with a view to determining whether it is true that the Spanish civil guard has used firearms to prevent immigrants from being able to climb over the Melilla fence.
We feel that all of this is very serious and we believe that the European Parliament should urgently intervene on this matter, with a view to preventing further deaths at the border between Morocco and Spain.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to a problem which arose a few weeks ago, and which is a recurrence of a problem which also arose last year.
The matter concerns raids on Polish construction companies in Germany and their destruction.
Many companies are scared to talk about this, and some have told of incidents which occur during the inspections carried out by finance officers or customs officers, and which remind me of scenes from the Second World War.
I will give you just one example.
The company , which has operated on the German market for 16 years, was checked during the past weeks by 250 officials.
The German newspaper printed on its front page a photo of a Polish worker standing in front of a wall with his hands up against the wall, being inspected by customs and finance officers.
This company has been in operation for 16 years.
The companyâs computers were confiscated, as was the sum of EUR 1.2Â million.
How are these companies supposed to operate in the European Union?
The Irish peace process is at a critical juncture.
The Irish and British Governments have set 24 November 2006 as the date for agreement to be reached among the political parties.
However, Ian Paisleyâs Democratic Unionist Party has shown no interest in power-sharing or in progress and it has been allowed by the two governments to prevent progress being made.
The Irish and British Governments must act to bring about the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which is an international treaty.
I urge the Finnish Presidency to encourage everyone concerned to make progress and would ask Parliament and the President to join in this call.
Without such progress, the peace process is in danger of unravelling further.
Â Â  Mr President, in his written declaration, the Communist Daniel StroÅŸ accuses Estonians of mass execution of Jewish people during the Second World War.
It is a harsh lie which is not based on fact.
On the contrary, Jewish people have lived side by side with Estonians as one family for centuries.
Already in 1925, Estonia adopted an act of cultural autonomy for ethnic minorities.
It was an extraordinary event in the whole world at that time, and Jewish people entered our state in their golden book.
During the Second World War, Estonians helped and rescued Jews, and in memory of that, a tree of gratitude has been planted in Yad Vashem Park in Jerusalem.
Estonia was the only occupied country where provoking programmes did not succeed.
I do not know what made Daniel StroÅŸ publish it.
Was it foolishness or something else?
It does not matter.
Â Â  Mr President, the car manufacturing plant in Warsaw which, until 2000, was owned by the Korean company Daewoo managed to avoid bankruptcy, paid off 92% of its debts and cut two thirds of jobs thanks to the determination of its management and staff.
The plant asked the Polish Government for a loan in line with the restructuring plan.
A recommendation from the EU Commissioner for Competition is needed in order to receive this loan.
The plant has valuable long-term contracts, which means that there should have been no difficulty in obtaining approval for the loan.
However, after a meeting with the Polish economy minister in Brussels, there are reports in the media that the Commissioner for Competition is considering refusing to recommend the loan.
This will damage the factory and amount to an attempt to drive it into bankruptcy, and, most importantly, will be harmful to fair competition in the European Union.
Such a refusal by officials in Brussels will mean that they are acting not for the common good but in the interest of a select number of capital groups and car corporations.
That is something we cannot support.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is the interim report by MrsÂ Wallis, on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry into the crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, on the crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society [2006/2026(INI) (A6-0221/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present our interim report and I would like to thank our secretariat, the Chairman of our committee and the members for their support and work.
The starting point for this report has been a disastrous personal event for thousands of EU citizens: the loss of their pension investments.
The challenge now for us as the European Parliament is to exercise our supervisory powers over EU legislation.
We have perhaps a once-in-a-generation chance to look in detail at the implementation process of EU law, taking one particular directive as an example.
Did we the institutions get it right?
Did the Member States get it right?
How can we do better in the future?
This fits well with our wider, better legislation agenda.
In presenting the interim report, first let me deal with two items regarding the process: one general and one particular.
This is the first such committee of inquiry in ten years.
Each time we have the chance to learn how to do this better in future, to build our own institutional knowledge.
We have, as always, been asked to produce an interim report but, to report properly we need all the evidence, all the studies, all the answers to our inquiries to be available.
Having to produce an interim report as a matter of form is something of a distraction, although of course we like to keep our colleagues informed as to where we are.
Maybe we can think about this question for the future.
This brings me to the particular aspect.
Our inquiry is about the EU aspects of this case.
Others have already made extensive inquiries in the UK and another, even more in-depth inquiry is due from the British Parliamentary Ombudsman in November 2006.
It would be foolish for us to publish our report in advance of the information that report is likely to contain.
The UK Ombudsman has had substantial access to many UK actors in this drama.
It makes no sense for us to repeat the exercise, but equally it would make no sense for us not to take account of these findings.
Hence we will need a little more time.
This is foreseen in the report and we will ask the House to endorse our request for probably a couple more months to produce our final report.
Let me come to the ground that we have covered. This is set out mainly in the annex to the report.
We have set up our working method, which involves a number of comparative studies; these have been commissioned.
We have already heard a wealth of evidence, most importantly from many of the victims. Their stories have been heartrending.
They have made me angry â angry that they have been let down by their experience of our internal market for financial services.
For them it has not produced extra choice, but rather the loss of life savings with no redress mechanisms available.
We have learnt more details about the Commissionâs implementation checks â or rather I should say checklist.
Maybe we need to look for more checks in the future.
We have seen the difficulty of inserting EU legislation into the existing fabric of Member Statesâ legal and regulatory systems.
It does not always fit.
We have seen that we can raise undue expectations by what is written in EU law particularly, in this instance, about the availability of compensatory mechanisms.
When it gets to Member-State level, maybe something gets lost in translation.
Then there is the big missing part of the jigsaw: access to justice.
Where is this in a country-of-origin regime?
Let this be the real lesson to all of us.
In this inquiry we have heard from victims sent from pillar to post.
The Commission has now admitted, in a note to us on home and host country authorities, that this does not work.
Let me read: âThe directive can only work smoothly if there is good cooperation between home and host state authorities.
It is not a satisfactory situation, where aggrieved policyholders are referred by the host state authority to the home state authority and are then sent back by the home to the host authority, thus to find themselves unable to have their case examined by either.
The Commission plans to seek further discussions with Member States.â
I should jolly well hope so!
If this inquiry does nothing else, I hope that we can put this injustice right.
That is an indication of where we have got to as of now; there will be much more to come.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work already carried out by the Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life affair under the leadership of MsÂ McGuinness and the rapporteur, Ms Wallis.
The interim report under discussion today provides a useful summary of the committeeâs mandate and programme of work.
As the report says, it is too early to draw conclusions.
The committee continues to collect evidence.
We all await with interest the second report of the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman.
The Commission has, from the start, declared its readiness to cooperate fully with the Committee of Inquiry.
We have provided all the documentation and information requested by the committee and will continue to provide whatever support we can.
I will be more than happy to appear before the committee in November.
The Equitable Life affair has caused much anguish and financial loss for many citizens and we must draw appropriate lessons for the future.
In that context, our ongoing Solvency II insurance project is aimed at contributing to the financial strength of all EU insurance undertakings.
Solvency II intends to enhance policyholder protection and to overhaul and deepen EU regulation and supervision in the insurance area.
Risk-oriented calculations of the solvency requirements of insurance undertakings would be introduced.
Under Solvency II, the calculation of insurance liabilities will be harmonised and convergence of supervisory practices will be fostered.
I am confident that those efforts will create a framework that helps to prevent this kind of financial crisis happening again.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am something of a thorn between two roses: Ms Wallis, who spoke so well today as the rapporteur, and the able and charming Ms McGuinness, the chairman of our committee.
That means that I often find myself caught between the two of them, but the work they have done is excellent and what Ms Wallis has spoken about today proves that point.
We have had several meetings at which many organisations and individuals have presented evidence that confirms me in my judgement that this special committee was very necessary.
We have been much impressed, angered and even moved by those speaking to us and the financial and emotional losses they are experiencing.
We have also heard from some of those who are responsible for regulation.
So far, I do not think there is any evidence of negligence or criminal activity, but I would characterise their behaviour so far as benign complacency.
There are as yet no firm conclusions, but one loophole has been exposed.
If a German or an Irishman buys a policy from a British company, it is the British regulator who is responsible for the financial probity of that company.
The German or Irish regulators appear to play no role, but that does not help the EU citizen, for whom it is impractical, inconvenient and costly to pursue concerns with the British regulator, even supposing he were interested.
The Commission needs to address this.
We continue our investigation, but we have no magic wand to restore the fortunes of the aggrieved policyholders.
As Ms Wallis said, we must close the loopholes, learn from what has gone before and improve the position next time, especially as it relates to the activities of the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the debate tonight on this interim report by Mrs Wallis, which has largely been agreed by consensus within the Committee of Inquiry.
One of the extraordinary aspects of this issue is the fact that those outside the UK who purchased policies from Equitable Life did so believing that they had European Union protection and that the regulators in their own country would protect them.
They then discovered some years ago that, in fact, they have no protection whatsoever.
When the 8300 investors in Ireland, who were putting money aside for their pensions, and about 4000 such investors in Germany went to their respective regulators, they were told to go and talk to the UK regulator.
This is not the way that people expected to be dealt with.
This report highlights another important aspect: the manner in which this has come to the House through the Committee on Petitions. That committee is one of the most effective ways of bringing Europe close to the citizens.
The Commissioner and others have said that it is too early yet to draw conclusions.
However, one of the conclusions I have come to is that we need to look closely at the manner in which financial services are regulated, because it would appear that we expect a regulator to do two functions which are distinctly different.
One is to protect the stability of the financial services market, and the other is to protect the interests of the investor.
At one level it may be that this is possible, because clearly an investor in pension funds is interested in having a stable market.
However, when it comes to the crunch â when a treasury may face large claims â does the regulator protect the market or protect the investor?
In this particular instance the UK Treasury was directly responsible for regulating Equitable Life and it would have been faced with claims for billions of pounds sterling had it found that Equitable Life should close down.
It did not choose to do so.
I would argue that we need to look closely in Solvency II at what regulators are expected to do and separate out those two functions.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I would like to thank MsÂ Wallis for her report.
I agree that it is too early to draw conclusions; however, I would like to make a few observations.
The first is about solvency.
Whether or not the company should be considered to have been solvent during the time leading up to the crisis has several consequences.
That affects the policyholdersâ possibilities of defending their rights and interests, but it also has an impact upon the responsibility of the UK authorities and, possibly, the Commission.
The UK authorities strongly emphasised that Equitable Life had never had any problems with solvency and always complied with EU law.
The UK authorities also indicated that there are a number of different ways of valuing assurance companies.
If there are several ways of calculating solvency, how is it possible to make a proper analysis?
It is clear that the directive seeks to ensure that an assurance company is not managed in such a manner that it may jeopardise the undertakingâs solvency in the long term.
It is also clear that the directive obliges Member States to take such measures with regard to the undertaking, its directors or managers, or the persons who control as are appropriate and necessary in order to prevent or remedy any irregularities prejudicial to the interests of the assured persons.
I doubt whether this has happened.
The fact that the UK authorities always considered Equitable Life solvent also had repercussions on customers and authorities in other Member States.
It appears that both customers and authorities in Ireland and Germany were taken by surprise when the crisis broke out.
Another observation I have, which concerns the country of origin principle, is the question of monitoring and provision of information.
The UK authorities, who were responsible for monitoring the activities of the company in other Member States too, never informed those Member States that there was a problem.
Maybe it was because they did not want to recognise this.
Frankly, in hindsight, it does not look as if the supervision has worked.
The second problem with the home country of origin rule is the lack of redress for consumers, who have been sent back and forth by the national authorities.
Consumers who trusted that the European Union would guarantee them an equivalent position and safeguards if they bought assurance on the internal market as they would if they had bought on the national market found themselves in a situation where nobody would accept responsibility for their efforts to obtain damages for their losses.
From a consumer point of view, the home country of origin principle turned out to be a real ping-pong game.
There seems to be a large vacuum in EU legislation here.
The EU should take more measures to protect individual citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate MrsÂ Wallis, who is a very experienced lawyer and an excellent rapporteur.
We have heard a whole series of reports prepared by MrsÂ Wallis which have been characterised by outstandingly precise legal language and a brilliantly clear description of the facts.
MrsÂ Wallis is also a member of the Committee on Petitions.
I have the honour and pleasure of working with her on that committee and I always regard her work with great respect. This also applies to the report we are discussing today.
The case of Equitable Life was first sent to the Committee on Petitions. The committee is very pleased that the case is being discussed at a plenary session of the European Parliament.
Insurance matters are incredibly sensitive issues.
We all remember well the Lloyds case which we recently looked into.
These are cases which are damaging to large numbers of people, in this case the many thousands of people who trusted the insurance company Equitable Life with their future.
Just when they reach old age it turns out that they have been left without means and a great injustice has been committed against them.
We must look into the matter very carefully but there is also another matter related to this case and that is the effectiveness of our actions.
MrsÂ Wallis very aptly said that it is not simply a matter of implementing or adopting the directive but a matter of both implementing the directive and involving everyone who is affected by the directive.
Therein lies the problem which we often face, namely that decisions of the European Parliament as well as those of other European bodies are sometimes not as effective as they should be.
It should be important to us, when Parliament adopts a certain position, for that position on the matter (at the moment I am thinking of the insurance cases, and the Equitable Life case in particular) to be enforced in its entirety, so that it does not merely end with a Parliament decision or a Parliament resolution.
It must end with the making good of the damage done to a very large number of people, and the effectiveness of our work is incredibly important here.
MrsÂ Wallis proposed in her report that our House should address this matter and adopt a position which would facilitate the work of the committee in the future.
I strongly appeal for all the suggestions put forward by MrsÂ Wallis in her report on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry to be supported by the House.
I congratulate MrsÂ Wallis and I hope that a satisfactory conclusion will be found to this matter as well as for those people who have suffered damages as a result of the Equitable Life case.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a rare occasion for me: I have more than one minuteâs speaking time and for once I am not going to disagree with anyone!
I should like to emphasise one or two things that have been said and look at them from a slightly different perspective.
There are a number of practical issues that MsÂ Wallis touched on, as indeed did Sir Robert Atkins.
The reality is that we have had many potential witnesses on our list; we have heard a few; and there are a great many more that we need to hear if we can. That includes many of the most important witnesses.
Another practical problem is that too many of these witnesses have come forward at the same meeting, so there has been very little time to interrogate them.
There has been no real cross-examination; they are not under oath; we have not been able to subpoena them; and there is the practical problem that flows from the inevitable requirement of interpretation.
Taken together those are fairly serious weaknesses, although the committee is collectively doing its very best to overcome them.
To give you an illustration of what I am talking about, the British Government turned up en masse.
A spokesman for the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary all arrived together, clearly having rehearsed their parts to the nth degree.
They hunted as a pack, they stood together and we were unable to prise them apart or to check facts because they had come to admit nothing and to concede nothing.
Even their answers to specific questions were evasive.
To give you one vivid illustration, they denied that the Government or the equivalent department had any knowledge of problems with Equitable Life ten years before we knew â and we have proof that they did.
With regard to the point about shared management, which has been raised by others, it seems to me that, in this case, shared management is turning out to be no management at all.
The Irish thought that the British Government was checking on Equitable Life.
If they were, they were saying nothing.
So, the Irish were kept in ignorance.
If today, for example, a Latvian financial services company started conducting business all over the European Union, it seems each Member State would assume that the Latvian Government was itself satisfied, but that would not necessarily be the case.
This is not a reflection on Latvia, just an example.
However, if that company was outside the European Union, every Member State would check thoroughly.
That is a problem.
Â Â  Mr President, as the person chairing the Committee of Inquiry, I can reassure Mr Mote that those witnesses who did not answer be back â we have a guarantee!
I would urge the members of the committee to sharpen their interrogating skills and we will get answers, because that is a priority.
I would say to my eloquent friend, Sir Robert Atkins, that, whilst he described me and the rapporteur as roses, we intend rather to be thorns in the side of the system, because there is something rotten here.
People have been badly burnt and the system has failed them.
We have heard from all the petitioners of the disasters suffered by individuals.
I agree with the rapporteur that this interim report is something of a distraction, but an important one just the same, because it will awaken Members of this House to the importance of detail.
We vote here, we go home and we forget that in a couple of years the votes we take here are implemented in Member States.
Sometimes we get it wrong as legislators and I think Equitable Life might yet prove that.
We have not reached any conclusions yet, but one thing we have established is that the regulators were playing games of ping-pong with policyholders.
It is important to thrash out the rights of the host country and the obligations of the home country.
In my view, there is a key question to be answered.
Some say they know the answer, but I have not come to any conclusion.
Who knew of the difficulties in Equitable Life and when?
Were others notified?
In other words, were Member Statesâ regulators in other countries informed as soon as possible?
Is it not the case that the directives, as they are implemented, would not allow a regulator to reveal confidential information that might dissuade a policyholder from investing in companies with problems like Equitable?
That is a key question.
Beyond the work we are doing today, there is no doubt that Equitable has left a sour taste for the losers and others who are watching events unfolding and it does nothing to help those who are trying to encourage citizens to invest in pensions.
What we find out from our investigation will be key for the future.
Everyone tells us that with Solvency II life will be great in the future, but it will not be unless we get the regulations right.
In conclusion, you can have all the regulation in the world, but if there is not a committed individual watching and guiding for all the Member States, it will amount to nothing.
Finally, who is regulating the regulators?
Is it the Commission?
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, let me say that I welcome the report by MrsÂ Wallis.
Investigations into the Equitable Life Assurance Society are becoming more and more painstaking, and the deeper we delve, the more we are compelled to recognise what a tangled web of events we are actually examining and how much has actually gone wrong at all sorts of levels.
With our resolution today we will reaffirm that governments, parliaments and the responsible authorities in the Member States, and particularly in the United Kingdom, must do more to assist the committee of inquiry in the fulfilment of its mandate, for the principle of cooperation in good faith which is enshrined in the Treaties must be upheld.
The committee of inquiry has explicit powers to request documents and to summon and question witnesses, but it is also entitled to have its questions answered.
The answers given by people in positions of responsibility at the committeeâs hearings, however, have been far from satisfactory.
To be precise, this applies to the answers given by both the British Financial Services Authority and the Commission.
The fact is that, in the case of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, no one either feels responsible or wants to accept responsibility, and the policyholders are left hanging.
Imagine policyholders in Cologne or in Galway trying in vain to obtain information.
From one month to the next they are being strung along.
If it comes to the point that even a committee of inquiry is being fobbed off with politically correct and legally safe answers, how much worse must it be for the woman in Cologne or the man in Galway who, as a policyholder, is personally affected, whose money is at risk, who is perhaps approaching retirement age and now has to scramble after his or her pension.
There are two things we can and must do: firstly, we must make the best possible use of the mandate given to us in the committee of inquiry to establish clarity, so that policyholders are finally shown where the faults and weaknesses lie.
Secondly, all of us, and especially the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, must endeavour to ensure that the Solvency II project provides greater security in future for all concerned, so that we no longer need a committee of inquiry to discover whether the fault lies in European legislation, in the way it has been transposed by a Member State or in a companyâs mismanagement.
Â Â  Mr President, the report we are discussing here today is very much an interim report into the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society in Britain.
Due to the very technical nature of the European Parliamentâs investigations into this issue, this Committee of Inquiry is going to take a lot more time to complete its work.
This is a very serious business for the European Parliament.
We should recall that, from an Irish perspective alone, over 6500 Irish citizens lost their pension investments either in total or in part as a result of the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society.
In this day and age, when there is so much EU regulation concerning the governance of financial investments, this is simply an intolerable and unacceptable situation.
It is not, as Mr Mote said, that the Irish were kept in ignorance: they were treated differently.
I say that it is intolerable and unacceptable for any company, financial or otherwise, to treat its policyholders differently.
They should be treated the same, whether they are British, Irish or German.
The committee has already invited a number of key witnesses to the European Parliament, including from the following categories: pensionersâ groups, the Equitable Life Membersâ Action Group; British and Irish policyholders, representatives of the Equitable Life Assurance company; and representatives from the Financial Affairs Directorate at the European Commission.
The committee is going to have to invite more witnesses if it is to get down to the nuts and bolts of how the UK life assurance market has operated in recent years.
The committee is also going to need more time to carry out a comprehensive, comparative analysis into the operation of similar life assurance markets in Germany and in Ireland.
The European Parliament is carrying out a very serious inquiry and the Committee of Inquiry is going to need more time to complete its work.
I urge Members of this House to give it that time and to give it every means at the disposal of this Parliament to complete its work.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for an excellent interim report, as also the Chairman, Mrs McGuinness, who will, I am sure, be a thorn in the side of the regulators and ensure that we can get to the bottom of what actually happened with Equitable Life.
Equitable Life is the worldâs oldest assurance company; right up to the end of 1999, even Westminster MPsâ pension funds were still being invested in the company.
Thousands of investors have lost money because of the cost of over-bonusing âwith-profitâ life assurance policies.
Many assurance companies offer with-profit policies â I have several such policies myself â but provided the company does not pay out more bonuses than it can afford the system works perfectly well.
In my opinion, from the mid 1990s until 2000 the Equitable Life Assurance Society over-bonused its with-profit policies, which showed on paper at least that Equitable Life had the best results of all major assurance companies, thus encouraging people to take Equitable Life policies out.
The problem is that the cost in real terms of overvaluing the policies meant that Equitable Life paid out nearly GBPÂ 6 billion more than it earned between 1997 and 2000.
No assurance company, however large, can afford such sums.
From the information and evidence collected for the committee, it all seems very convenient that so many people carrying out the checks and balances of the company came very late to the party: i.e., the present board of management took over in 2000 after the company had all but ceased taking on new business; the Financial Services Authority was not created until late 1999, so it is not responsible for what happened before it came into existence; the financial actuaries advising the UK Government before the FSA was formed maintain that Equitable Life was always solvent, although one actuary giving evidence to our inquiry did admit there are up to six ways of valuing an insurance company.
The committee has heard from many people who invested in Equitable Life and who have lost a great deal of money, which has caused them great hardship.
The committee will carry on its work and we are determined to find out what went wrong with Equitable Life so that these problems do not happen in the future.
We will try to get the best deal for those who have Equitable Life policies.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ Wallisâs report is an interim report, since the Committee of Inquiry still has a lot of work to do.
In any event, a parliamentary committee of inquiry is not a court of justice.
In other words, this committee is not going to be able to decide whether the British authorities have behaved correctly or incorrectly in their regulation of this field; that is a job for the courts of justice.
What are being exposed at the moment are shortcomings in the European Unionâs rules, since they are intended to make it possible for activities of this kind to be carried out across national borders.
What we are detecting at the moment is that there is no control mechanism for activities crossing national borders.
As the representative of the Commission has said, each national authority is theoretically responsible for supervision, but, when the company collapsed, neither the Irish authorities nor the German authorities were able to do anything, because the companyâs subsidiaries and branches in their respective countries were closed at that point.
The 6Â 500 pensioners that MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtain was talking about, in Ireland, and the thousands of pensioners in Germany, did not therefore have any opportunity to exercise control.
As I said before, a parliamentary committee is not a court of justice, but it can draw conclusions from a legislative point of view.
I believe that the lesson we can now draw in this sense is that, at the moment, the principle of mutual recognition, the so-called âCommunity passportâ, is not enough.
When laying down Community rules, an effective control mechanism must also be established, which, eliminating the principle of country of origin or country of provenance, makes it possible for the European Union institutions to monitor the operations of institutions operating across national borders.
I believe that that is the most important conclusion we can draw so far.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating MrsÂ Wallis on her work on this interim report and on the clarity of her proposals; I would also like to say how much I agree with her proposed approach.
I also agree with her on the points that must be examined in the weeks and months ahead.
The exercise the Committee of Inquiry is engaged in is not an easy one.
It needs first of all to look for the causes of the situation in which Equitable Life policyholders find themselves.
In this regard, everything that the motion for a European Parliament resolution asks for and requires must be approved.
Much is at stake, and the limits of the exercise need to be all the clearer because of that.
As the previous speaker said, we must not lose sight of the fact that this is a parliamentary Committee of Inquiry.
It is not a court of law able to hand down decisions on penalties or compensation.
The information collected will, at the most, be useful for defending the victimsâ interests, furnishing them with evidence that may be used in any proceedings they may take.
On the other hand, the results of the investigations may make a crucial contribution to the development of European regulation.
They may reveal the inadequacies of the rules laid down or the failings in how they are applied.
There will, no doubt, be more general lessons to be drawn by Parliament itself, by the Member States and by the Commission when it comes to regulating and monitoring the decisions that are taken.
The work that has begun must therefore be continued accurately, determinedly and dispassionately, and with no ambiguity as to the expected outcome, lest undue expectations again be raised for the victims.
Â Â  Mr President, most of what needs to be said has been said already.
I commend Mrs Wallisâs report. It is a very thorough interim report.
I particularly welcome the request that we delay for three months.
It is vital that we do not rush to judgment and that we await the outcome of the inquiries that are being undertaken in the United Kingdom.
Of course we must look at the causes of this situation and the crisis that occurred, and particularly at the application of Community law.
In that respect I am pleased to be speaking before Commissioner McCreevy.
I look forward to what he has to say.
It is vital, as I have said, that we do not rush to make a judgement.
The witnesses have been extremely forthcoming and cooperative with the Committee of Inquiry.
Uppermost in our minds, as the former speaker said, is that we have some recourse to justice, but we must certainly ensure that another Equitable Life crisis never happens again.
Those people did what, arguably, we ask all good citizens to do: provide for their retirement, their future.
They did so in what should be arguably one of the safest investment pots in any investment industry.
It failed to be so, on the evidence that we have before us.
I commend the report and the work of the temporary committee.
Â Â  . Mr President, as has been pointed out, drawing conclusions at this stage would be premature.
The Commission looks forward to continuing working with the Committee of Inquiry.
The aim is to see how we can ensure that Community and national law is properly implemented and applied.
The single market offers advantages for consumers.
Policyholders should be able to rely on their financial institutions and the fact that their solvency is ensured.
We must ensure that consumers have viable means of redress.
I look forward to the committeeâs recommendations on the problems experienced by policyholders in various Member States and how they could be avoided.
However, I would not accept that the Equitable Life affair calls into question the basis of internal market in the insurance sector.
As Lord Penrose stated in his report on the affair, the origins of this crisis go back many years.
National supervision is constantly developing and improving, whilst at European level the Solvency II project will provide a more coordinated and risk-based system.
But no system can be guaranteed to prevent all market problems.
I think we should avoid a more or less useless debate on host versus home state control.
Host state control would not have made a difference in this case.
In a single market, supervisors should cooperate.
Both supervisors have roles to play.
However, I certainly agree that we should not and cannot accept a âpassing the buckâ attitude.
That is definitely something that we need to address.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  As a company, Equitable Life was in financial trouble for a long time.
However, the growing crisis was concealed from policyholders.
What is worse, new policyholders were solicited and presented with a false impression of a company with a secure future in which their funds would prosper.
The regulators failed.
In 2001, Equitable Life lost a case in the UK that made it impose exit penalties on UK policyholders, though money for Irish policyholders was supposed to be ring-fenced and safe.
Despite this, two years later in 2003, exit penalties worth about 20% of the value of Equitable Life policies were imposed on Irish policyholders.
The regulators failed.
Since this time Irish Equitable Life policyholders have lost their investment, which in many cases means their life savings.
They have been denied justice by the UK, Irish and EU authorities though they are entitled to redress and protection when regulators fail.
Their case has been before this Parliamentâs Committee on Petitions for a year and a half.
It is time for this Parliament to stand by the victims of failed regulatory mechanisms and to insist that an equitable settlement be finalised for the policyholders of Equitable Life.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following:
- A6-0170/2006 by MrÂ Muscat, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on further consolidation in the financial services industry (2006/2081(INI));
- the oral question (O-0069/2006 B6-0317/2006) by MrsÂ BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on mergers and acquisitions developments around Europeâs stock exchanges.
Â Â  , . The issues brought up by the debate we have before us are many, important and sensitive.
For this reason, I choose to begin by immediately giving attention to the main emphasis of this report, on which a wide convergence has significantly been reached in the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs.
We have four messages to put across.
First of all, we acknowledge the consolidation process in the field of financial services as one which has so far had positive economic effects.
Secondly, it is the justly regulated, transparent market, free of unjustified obstacles, which decides what the level of consolidation should be.
Thirdly, our role as legislators is to ensure that this process, particularly the acquisition and the merging of banks, leads to greater competition and not to the creation of new monopolies.
Fourthly, competition should mean a true and wider choice among quality products and services, reaching the broadest possible spread of consumers.
In my opinion, consumers should be the ones who benefit from the possible advantages of this process.
I do care that financial institutions gain from consolidation, but I am much more interested in the greatest benefits going to the consumer, in the form of wider choice, better products, more efficient services and more competitive prices.
By consumers, we mainly understand individuals and families, especially those who are more vulnerable.
However, to these we should add companies, above all small and medium-sized companies which are the core of our economy, and which should be given the service they deserve.
At this point, those who share my social ideal may find themselves confused.
Yes, it is good that consumers have more benefits thanks to consolidation, but should it be the workers of financial organisations who pay the price?
We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend that this problem does not exist.
News about the acquisition and merging of companies often does not excite workers with the new prospects that this may entail for them.
On the contrary, we cause them to worry that the money-saving moves being mentioned, and those yet to be mentioned, take place at the expense of their working conditions, or even worse, at the expense of their job.
Is there no solution at all?
I have no doubt that serious institutions look to other methods of efficiency before considering turning towards the workers, but there are some who do not set the example of social responsibility towards the community.
The point we surely need to support is the one which workers' representatives from around Europe made with me: that is, the need for them to be informed and involved in the process as early as possible.
There is another point related to this. Countries' economies, especially those in transition or in the process of developing, are not simply a cow which is there to be milked.
Corporations have the duty to truly invest in these countries, with the creation of new and better work opportunities which provide access to a higher quality of service.
The new environment being formed in the field of financial services will push vital questions onto us as legislators, among them the issue of supervision.
Many of the national authorities are doing an excellent job, but the issue is much bigger than this.
Given the shape that the market is taking, is the field of supervision still good enough to protect delicate interests, such as those of the economy and of consumers? There are many different answers to this question, even among ourselves.
Nevertheless, we need to begin discussing them, and not leave them on the shelf.
If we do not begin to deal with these questions, the danger will be that in the not-so-distant future, when a crisis may arise, we will not have the tools to face it, whatever these tools may be.
It is also for this reason that the main recommendation of the report is to ask for a committee of independent experts, so that in a period of six months from when the mandate begins, it provides us alternative proposals which we can consider before taking decisions in this field.
It would be remiss of me not to end my intervention by thanking all those who helped in the drafting of this report.
Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the representatives of the other groups for the proactive way in which we worked.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Charlie McCreevy and his Cabinet for always being ready to discuss.
I also thank those who took the time to put forward their opinions on the report, the secretariat of the Socialist Group, and the secretariat of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Mr President, Commissioner, fellow colleagues, I believe that we have a concrete, balanced and positive report, which can send a strong signal that the European Parliament has a clear vision for this sector, which is of such importance to our economies and to our citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliamentâs Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thought it necessary, at this stage, to put an oral question on the state of discussions concerning mergers and acquisitions developments around Europeâs stock exchanges.
I said Europeâs stock exchanges because we in this Parliamentâs Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have for many years now been working for the construction, consolidation and integration of a European financial market, and I think the question we are faced with today is really whether or not there should be European stock exchanges.
We as legislators cannot in fact be interested in every segment of the financial market, since this question, no doubt the most fundamental, is solely a matter of strategy for the market players.
The issue lies beyond that: it is an issue of public interest that the legislator needs to take hold of and to which the Commission, as the holder of the legislative initiative, cannot remain indifferent.
The situation of the stock exchanges today reminds me of the history of the euro, and I want to draw your attention here to something we all need to remember: without political intervention, that is if it had been left to market forces alone, the euro would not exist today, or else it would be quite different from what it now is: a currency that inspires confidence, that is shared by so many Member States and that so many Member States aspire to adopt.
What we need for the stock exchanges is a solution in the same spirit as the euro: a solution whose conception goes beyond mere market forces and market logic.
From this point of view, Commissioner, you who have the law-making initiative have a tremendous responsibility.
That is something, of course, that you share with MrsÂ Kroes, who has her own responsibilities in the field of competition.
What concerns observers and many parliamentarians today, however, is that the Commission, despite its power of initiative, remains content to arbitrate between opposing interests, analysing market situations and assessing the chances of getting a text passed in the Council, instead of trying to rise above all that and take a European perspective.
From this point of view I believe we must follow the negotiations about stock exchange restructuring very closely because there is one point, Commissioner, and you are as aware of this as I am, that very much determines the state of those negotiations: it is not what happens on the securities market, but what happens in the back office â a question that has been before the Commission for years.
A number of us in Parliament thought we ought to deal with the back office at the same time as talking about the market.
Some, because it corresponded to their market strategy, wanted to keep the two separate.
They now have the text on the market and think that competition ought to reign supreme in the back office.
Some of the questions raised will not, however, be resolved by market forces alone, because the market cannot take everyoneâs interests into account.
Last time this Parliament expressed an opinion on this subject, it said it was waiting for an impact study before deciding whether a legislative initiative was necessary.
That impact study is in your hands, Commissioner, but you have not yet allowed us to see it.
The wildest rumours are circulating, suggesting that you might go so far as to amend the text of that impact study before reporting to us on it.
I think this debate will allow you to enlighten us on all these points, Commissioner.
My colleagues will be addressing other matters.
There are nevertheless two points to which I would again like to draw your attention in conclusion.
First the consequences of the following decisions at European level, consequences that have not been thought through or anticipated: one, the quotation of the stock markets; two, the withdrawal of the institutional investors â the big banks and insurance companies â which will have been the first to make their profits, leaving the door open for what are called the hedge funds to be the main players on the European stock exchanges.
Then, I will draw your attention to the questions of supervision and corporate governance.
We can in fact see that a merger between the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext could be to the detriment of any European governance.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the few minutes I have this evening, I am going to follow current financial trends and consolidate my opening remarks in covering both Mr Muscatâs report and the oral question by Mrs BerÃšs on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
As I emphasised during the hearing organised by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in January, the real debate cannot be on more or less cross-border consolidation.
That is for the market players to decide, not the politicians.
Rather, the core of the debate is on how to create the optimal regulatory and prudential framework for the European financial sector to thrive, delivering concrete and substantial benefits to the consumers and boosting economic growth and job creation.
That is why I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, and members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their work.
With such complex issues, it is not always easy to identify the real questions, to take into account all the different points of view and strike the right balance to set the way forward.
Thanks to the rapporteurâs open, transparent and inclusive approach, the report does just that.
It brings a substantial contribution to the debate.
I believe that there is a broad consensus on the main obstacles identified, shared by the Council conclusions adopted by the Ecofin Council in May.
We must improve the cost efficiency of the supervision of cross-border activities.
In that respect, as noted in the report, further convergence of supervisory practices and standards is essential.
To achieve this objective, we do not need a supervisory âbig bangâ, but rather to optimise the functioning of the Lamfalussy structure.
There are concrete projects that can be implemented rather soon.
The role of the Level 3 Committees is essential, for instance to implement common reporting standards and thus avoid costly and unnecessary duplicative requirements.
A number of such concrete improvements have been identified and were endorsed by the Ecofin Council last May.
I would like to give a push to accelerating work in this area.
We cannot have an internal market if companies are going to have to keep under-utilised capital tied up because we do not have in place sufficient cooperation between supervisors.
I intend to come back to that in the time ahead.
There is a regulatory and supervisory cost that should be evaluated.
The report rightly underlines the implications of increasing integration for supervision.
Some complex questions, such as deposit guarantee schemes or the issue of lender of last resort, must be re-examined in that context.
The Commissionâs White Paper on financial services policy has identified those questions. This will surely be one of the most interesting policy debates for the coming months and years.
Besides supervision, the fragmentation of retail markets must also be addressed.
The current difficulties in selling similar retail products in different countries is a major stumbling block in exploiting scale synergies.
I fully agree with the report that further integration, notably in the retail market segments, should not occur to the detriment of consumers.
We have means to prevent that from happening and we will use them.
The ongoing sectoral inquiries, under the supervision of my colleague Commissioner Kroes, are a good example.
A third area calling for our attention is the one related to impediments to corporate reorganisation on a pan-European basis.
We are currently consulting on future priorities for company law and corporate governance to identify how we could make further progress.
I would like to thank the rapporteur again for his work.
We now have a shared analysis of what the main obstacles are.
Our challenge for the coming years will be to remove them.
Turning to the oral question by Mrs BerÃšs, let me be clear: the Commission believes strongly that market forces and shareholder choices should determine the optimal shape of exchange consolidation â not bureaucrats, not politicians.
We should not be in the business of âpicking winnersâ or trying to shape markets according to a bureaucratic vision of what is best for European shareholders, investors and issuers.
In the long run, European investors and European corporations seeking to raise capital will be best served by world-class institutions doing business in a world-class regulatory framework deploying cutting-edge technology and able to provide the breadth and range of services they want.
Those services might include the ability to trade in a multitude of currencies, time-zones and instruments.
There are strong commercial pressures driving consolidation.
If a deal makes commercial sense, and if the competition law and regulatory aspects can be adequately dealt with, then we will not stand in the way.
However â and this is the key point â the Commission considers that it is essential that financial market business in the jurisdiction of the European Union is regulated by European and Member State rules, and by our regulators.
Of course we will be very vigilant to ensure that current levels of investor protection and market integrity will be maintained.
We believe in strong and effective regulation of European marketplaces.
Otherwise, we would not all have put so much effort into getting the MiFID right, as well as the other aspects of the Financial Services Action Plan that we have laboured on for so long together.
We note the preliminary assessment from some regulators in Europe and the United States that the mergers being discussed will not mean significant changes of regulatory responsibility.
But if there are any spillovers, regulators should work out constructively together what the rules are going to be and how to cooperate.
I will be maintaining close contact with the college of Euronext supervisors in the time ahead so as to ensure there is a full understanding about how all these issues will evolve.
So there is no question of imposing new, extra-territorial burdens on European businesses that would put us at a disadvantage and jeopardise our internationally successful and developing financial markets.
We know European users and shareholders do not favour that either.
On competition issues, the Commissionâs competences in merger assessment are laid down in the EC Merger Regulation No 139/2004.
Within this framework, it is up to the parties in the first instance to inform the Commission as to whether, in their view, the relevant turnover thresholds are met for Community competence.
The New York Stock Exchange and Euronext have informed us that this transaction would not meet these thresholds.
On clearing and settlement issues, in the course of our work we have been trying to determine the best range of measures â legislative or not â that will deliver improved competitiveness in these areas.
As regards the steps needed to deliver those benefits, the Commission has not yet taken a decision.
All options remain on the table; a decision will probably be taken shortly.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I need hardly say that I very much welcome the report on further consolidation measures in the financial-services industry, which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I should also like to convey my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for our constructive cooperation.
The consolidation of the banking sector among most of the EU Member States is not so far advanced as it is within some individual countries.
In accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, the financial-services industry has to take the lead here, and it is aware of this and is willing to play its part.
How is the European banking sector structured?
Where do its strengths lie, and why has little consolidation taken place in Europe?
I welcome the initial studies of these matters conducted by the Commission.
Regardless of whether we are considering the financial-services industry, education systems, the linguistic landscape or regional differences, Europeâs strength has always lain in its diversity.
In the realm of financial services, this has three main implications: firstly, a financial-services sector that is working for European business will necessarily comprise diverse operators, namely those whose size enables them to face up to international challenges and those that are mostly concerned with regional markets.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are active in these selfsame regional markets, where they account for the bulk of Europeâs economic potential.
This diversity must be preserved within the European Union, and I am pleased that we have addressed this point clearly in our report through the amendment tabled by MrsÂ BerÃšs and others.
Secondly, what does a pluralist banking structure mean in the European Union?
It means nothing more than institutions in France, Spain, Hungary and so on being able to follow different business models with different commercial aims.
Which model or aim succeeds is left to market forces.
Perhaps this is just another of those areas where Member States can adopt diverse approaches rather than seeking the ideal way.
Thirdly, European consumers differ in their cultures and lifestyles and will therefore demand different financial services too.
Only a variety of products can guarantee effective and efficient financial services in Europe that are tailored to the needs of consumers and the economy.
The hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is also mentioned in this report. The report backs the European financial-services industry in its efforts to remove the real obstacles to cross-border consolidation.
There has also been positive feedback from the European Central Bank.
Â Â  .
Mr President, although the Muscat report and the oral question we have accurately reflect my concerns about the developments, of the questions we have asked with regard to the developments in stock exchanges, Commissioner McCreevy has only really answered the first part of Question 2, namely whether we should infer from the silence surrounding these developments that you really think that this is only a matter for the shareholders.
That is apparently your opinion, and I should like to stress that it is one that I do not share.
I think that you certainly cannot say that it is only a matter for the shareholders.
There are many other stakeholders with major interests, including users of the stock exchanges, companies who are listed on them, private and institutional investors, as well as pension funds that invest via the stock exchanges, but also financial institutions that offer alternative investment routes have their own interests, and I am referring here to the investment banks with in-house dealerships offering alternative platforms, and the hedge funds.
I do not know whether you are familiar with the book by MrÂ Seifert, former CEO of the .
In it, he describes very accurately how hedge funds, based on other interests, have also exercised their shareholdersâ rights within the battle surrounding the proposals which the made at the time in an attempt to take over the London Stock Exchange.
I do not know whether you read German, or whether a translation is now available, but it would be good to take on board the advice from somebody with first-hand experience in converting a stock exchange, which the users owned, to a listed company, and who can now also see the drawbacks of this pure shareholderâs mentality.
I think that you will need to focus more on the general interest that is at stake.
As politicians, it is incumbent upon us to consider this public interest, and that is clearly a task at European, rather than just national, level.
It is certainly not my intention to elicit from you the combination that would work best and whether it should be a European or transatlantic stock exchange.
I do think, though, that it is up to the Commission to prescribe the conditions, and what is needed based on the interests of those other stakeholders, the users, of the European economy.
With regard to this transatlantic dimension, you have already stated that we should not adopt the rules of the United States.
In that respect too, there are various experts, including Harvey Pitt and Callum McCarthy who indicate that this is certainly not that cut-and-dried.
Accordingly, what we expect from the Commission is clear answers as to what the consequences are and how we can prevent this American influence from extending into possible constellations in Europe.
As a final remark further to the Muscat report, I should like to stress our proposal to set up a committee of wise men.
I think that we need to bring about European supervision as a matter of desperate urgency. The stock exchanges are an example of a sector where that is very much needed.
Similarly, the consolidation of financial institutions elsewhere demonstrates that we cannot afford to leave this matter to be dealt with at national level alone, because other interests would then come into play.
Clearly, in this globalising economy, we urgently need a European outlook and European supervision, and it would be great if a committee of wise men were to advise you in this respect.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whatever may be said to the contrary, the single market has not yet been completed.
Financial services is one of the main areas where further improvements are possible and necessary.
You, Commissioner McCreevy, are trying to change this state of affairs.
The European Parliament is happy to support you in this venture.
The Muscat report gives the House an opportunity today to throw its weight firmly behind the immediate removal of unwarranted obstacles to mergers and acquisitions.
I should like to congratulate MrÂ Muscat warmly on a very balanced report and thank him for the open and constructive cooperation.
The political frontier between two Member States of the European Union must not be a barrier to cross-border mergers or acquisitions.
The decision to merge with or acquire a company should not be a political matter but should depend solely on whether the merger or takeover will benefit shareholders and staff as well as customers and business partners in Europe or round the globe and will thereby make the companies in question more competitive.
On no account, however, must a merger or acquisition infringe EU competition law.
In short, the task of politicians â as Commissioner McCreevy has said â cannot be to decide whether more or fewer mergers will take place but only to ensure that the whole system is not thrown out of balance.
With regard to the possible merger between the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext, I take the view, unlike the previous speaker, that politicians should not play an active role here.
They must only draw a line where it becomes apparent that American attitudes to supervision are suddenly establishing themselves in Europe through this merger.
That possibility cannot entirely be dismissed if we consider that even money-market transactions between European parties are increasingly being conducted, to all intents and purposes, in accordance with US market legislation.
Unwarranted barriers of a fiscal or supervisory nature must be removed.
At the request of the Ecofin Council, the Commission has been working to identify the precise nature of these barriers.
As a concrete result of these efforts, let me cite the forthcoming publication of the amendment to ArticleÂ 16 of the Banking Directive.
Supervisory authorities must, of course, have teeth.
In ArticleÂ 16, however, the grounds on which the competent supervisory authority can reject a cross-border merger or takeover are too vaguely defined.
Assessment based on the âfit and properâ test leaves the supervisory authority a great deal of scope to interpret the criteria and is therefore open to abuse.
Recent cases have clearly illustrated this defect.
Transparency, logical decisions and hence predictability for companies are aspects that we shall have to discuss over the coming months.
As the parliamentary rapporteur on these issues, I await the Commissionâs proposals with particular interest.
Lastly, let me make a few comments on the tabled amendments.
I support MrÂ Muscatâs proposal for the appointment of a committee of wise men to examine the effects of consolidation and to study issues of supervision and supervisory law, of financial stability and of crisis management.
I also consider it right and proper that the committee be given six months to compile an authoritative report with specific proposals on the issues that have been highlighted.
My own amendments are designed to make the draft somewhat more impartial.
It is about the single European market and the removal of unwarranted barriers.
In other words, Parliament must not seek to set the specific situation in a Member State in tablets of stone or to change such a situation at all costs.
Let us set aside our national spectacles.
Let us ensure that the industry and consumers are given the single market they desperately need.
This is the only route to success in the global marketplace.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Muscat report applauds the consolidation and merger and acquisition activity that has been taking place in pursuit of these elusive economies of scale and scope.
However, I am not aware of any evidence that consumers are more satisfied, that risks have been reduced or that the cost of capital has been reduced.
On the contrary, the main effects of the financial services action plan to date seem to be that financial services at all levels â retail banking, stockbroking, investment banking â are all being rather seriously hampered by onerous and largely unnecessary reporting requirements.
However, the issue I want to highlight â and which the report acknowledges â is crisis management, or, to put it more bluntly, who bails out.
Sooner or later some large multinational bank is going to get into difficulties, not necessarily through bad management, but simply because banks, like any other business, can go bust.
Banking, like any other business, is risky.
There will be calls for bail-outs and guarantees to forestall contagion and to prevent the breakdown of the payment system.
At that point, cooperation between the national authorities becomes non-cooperation, as each national authority strives to limit its own financial liability.
Nobody has thought this through.
The report mentions the lender of last resort without telling us what it is or how it is going to work.
So, instead of the blind pursuit of the single market in financial services, I believe it would be prudent not to encourage any more consolidation or cross-border merger activity for the present, until such time as the European Union has a single fiscal authority to take the potentially large financial responsibility when things go wrong.
Fortunately, I think that time is very far in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like, if I may, to agree with my party colleagueâs, MrÂ Hoppenstedtâs, views and, especially, with his appreciative remarks about the work done by the rapporteur.
I think there are three important things to say in this connection.
Firstly, experience of consolidation in the financial market has been positive.
It might, if anything, be said that there is too little cross-border consolidation.
Where we have seen such consolidation, it has been an expression of genuine cross-border integration and produced sound conditions for consumers and customers.
Another thing that it is important to say in this connection is that, when we debate the situation in Europe, we should do so with the global financial market in mind.
We need not only strong European players but also strong players in Europe if we are to have both ready access to capital, notably for investment purposes, and a powerful financial dynamic.
It is in this context that it is important for major companies to be able to develop in Europe, and it is, therefore, also important to welcome the consolidation we see.
In this connection, I should also like to point out that it is important for the European economy to develop the transatlantic market.
Irrespective of what develops as regards the transatlantic issue of European and US stock exchanges or purely European ones, it is important to exploit the opportunity we now have.
We have an interest in, as far as possible, upholding European rules when it comes to reporting, sound company management and common rules governing competition.
I should like to call on the Commission not to intervene in the discussions about transatlantic stock exchange mergers and not to steer matters in one particular direction or another.
Instead, it should use these discussions to emphasise European rules, the implementation of which could give European financial markets a strong position in the global economy.
That is an opportunity of which we must take advantage now.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to join with all those who have congratulated MrÂ Muscat on his report on consolidation in financial services and particularly on his proposal to create a committee of âwise menâ.
I shall refer primarily to the phenomena of mergers and acquisitions in European stock exchanges.
For the last thirty years, technological development, the free movement of capital at international level and financial innovation have led to profound changes in the capital markets and have increased domestic saversâ participation in the financial markets, in general, and in the stock market in particular.
In some European countries their participation is equivalent to around a third of their savings and in others a fifth.
The demutualisation of stock exchanges, which began in Asia in the middle of the 90s and then at the beginning of this decade spread to the main European centres of London, Paris and Frankfurt, and is still taking place, as is currently happening in Spain with the process of public offerings, has led to restructurings and to concentrations in the internal market, as in the case of Euronex and the Scandinavian market.
All of these are positive developments, since they lead to reductions in costs and the extension of transactions and the quotations markets.
In my view, the recent announcements of transatlantic mergers and acquisitions represent a qualitative change. I say this because, despite the increasing convergence taking place on each side of the Atlantic, substantial differences remain between the two markets, which have been identified both in the model of the stock market and in the actual structure of the market and in the elements of post-negotiation.
Furthermore, this is happening at a time when the European Union, having approved the MiFID and when it is going to be applied in the future, intends to complete the European financial market.
At the same time, an important debate has begun on the updating of the stock markets. This debate relates to their role in the future, to organisation, structures, transparency, economic aspects, competence, governance and infrastructures.
This is a time of very significant changes.
There are therefore many questions to be cleared up and it is not just a matter of simply acting on a case-by-case basis.
Rather, we must identify the European Unionâs general interests, assess the impact of the operations announced on those interests, consider the consequences of the operations from political, legislative and economic points of view and, of course, seek the best necessary response, bearing in mind that the financial policy and the stock market policy have a significant impact on the European Unionâs monetary policy.
I also believe that we must assess the best method for ensuring transparency, stability and balance on the part of the European Union with a view to the proper global operation of the financial markets.
That is the task that we must carry out.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to explore the transatlantic mergers of the stock exchanges.
We have seen on the front page of the Financial Times several times and heard from the head of the New York Stock Exchange that it is possible the US Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance rules could apply to the merged exchange, with jurisdiction in US courts.
Of course not everybody agrees with that analysis.
Indeed, at the New York Stock Exchangeâs second annual securities conference a couple of weeks ago, Commissioner Annette Nazareth of the US Securities and Exchange Commission said that the merger seemed to call for a common technology strategy but not a common exchange platform.
So there will be a common holding company under US jurisdiction, but Euronext would not register as a US exchange and would not offer its products on the US market.
On that basis, Sarbanes-Oxley, in her opinion, would not apply to Euronext.
However, it would seem to me that neither would the benefits of a merged market, at least from the Euronext side.
In fact she said a mere affiliation with a US exchange does not subject a non-US exchange to US law.
However, with all the excitement and interest in cross-Atlantic acquisitions, it seems likely that perhaps something more momentous than a mere affiliation was afoot, at least in the minds of some.
Is it possible that some kind of asymmetric process, with the US base parts registering in Europe but not vice versa, may occur?
What would be the consequences for the European market?
Commissioner Nazareth was very careful with her words in referring to the technology platform.
Is it in fact practical for there to be separate IT platforms in the long term?
I doubt it.
There would be a desire to integrate and at that stage it would seem Sarbanes-Oxley would surely come into play, which was why she was so careful with her words.
Therefore, unless steps are taken to reach an international standard sooner rather than later, there could well be problems ahead.
I would say there is a role for the bureaucrats here as well as the shareholders.
In Europe we have experience of having to balance different legal traditions and practices and that is one reason we should be taking the lead in the future of regulation.
Â Â  I would like to congratulate Mr Muscat and all those who took part in the preparation of the report, which required a considerable amount of thorough work, and produced a balanced document.
I believe that there are two factors that have a significant influence on the consolidation of financial processes.
One of them is, with reference to the Lisbon process, the building of the internal market and the increase in competitiveness.
The other, with reference to enlargement and alongside the advantages of expanding the market, is the implementation of cohesion, as well as equality and unity between Member States.
Unfortunately, in respect of the latter, the balance has been upset.
This is due to the fact that while in financial processes the sensitivity of new Member States is pushed to the background with the declaration of increased opening-up, the determinant factor in the case of labour-intensive services is the sensitivity of old Member States, rather than internal liberalisation.
This overturns the balance in the services sector.
Incidentally, this is why I cannot accept the consideration of social or environmental protection aspects in the consolidation of financial services or of the financial sector.
Additionally, I believe that it is important that we move forward with some regard for solidarity.
We should not allow the development of a situation where market supervisory authorities in recipient states â and new Member States are basically recipient states â are defenceless against the dominant market supervisory authorities of old Member States.
We can only move forward in the area of liberalisation if we impose strict requirements for cooperation, and, in particular, for transparency.
At the same time, I agree that in order to facilitate concentration, we must help change the tax systems, and in particular the VAT regime.
I would also like to stress that the over-concentration resulting from mergers and acquisitions should be analysed both from the perspective of the emerging internal market and for the sake of the cohesion of Member States trying to catch up.
This is required because in some situations it may happen that there is no over-concentration at Community level, but it is present at Member State level, which is damaging to competition in that Member State.
Therefore, competition policy impact assessments must pay particular attention to this, as signalled by recent examples.
Accurate procedures will be able to resolve this difficult situation, and will also be able to ensure that oligopolistic conditions are truly excluded, without allowing them to be replaced by unilateral protectionism.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I am very sorry that today, you did not understand why we raised this question and invited you to this Chamber.
It certainly was not because we wanted more market rules, but because we lack political leadership backed up by the European Union's strategic guidelines for financial market development.
We all know very well that the European Union has fine traditions of principles-based financial regulation. These principles must be proclaimed.
We miss the declaration of these principles, and because of this feel confused in the market which leads to various rumours, various opinions.
Hopefully, now that we have an excellent European model, which developing markets also follow readily, we will be able to protect it; however, at the moment, it seems that the Commission's, forgive me, hesitation is allowing that model to be washed away.
Take, for example, those prospectus directive amendments which are now being debated.
It seems that we are waiting for some sort of intermediate result â a transatlantic average, which will not mean anything good for either Europe or the USA.
In truth, we ought to say honestly that we have different views and perhaps then we can try to respect and recognise each other's position.
Talking of clearing and settlement market regulation, we must recognise that this is a complex matter which perhaps needs to be solved gradually.
We should also have our own European view and not align ourselves with decisions made by large conglomerates.
Because doing nothing is not a liberal position.
When the regulator does nothing, then the law of the jungle takes root in the market and the market is ruined, and most importantly innovations are ruined, which we really do not want.
Â Â  Mr President, many colleagues have already asked what we are doing today in discussing stock exchange mergers in Europe.
Of course it is not for the European Parliament to decide on the kinds of mergers that can occur and the kind of activity on the market.
It is also up to the Commission to make judgements on whether the Euronext-Frankfurt BÃ¶rse merger is better than the transatlantic one.
We need to look at the kinds of opportunities the transatlantic merger might give us, especially in terms of the transatlantic financial services dialogue which, I think, has been the most fruitful example of what we can do together if we really cooperate with the US SCC.
I want to congratulate the Commissioner on the amount of progress made.
I think if the market forces decide that we will have a transatlantic stock exchange, that will be a huge opportunity for regulatory convergence.
It is not about extra-territorial Sarbanes Oxley rules coming to Europe; the point is also that we can put forward our strategic models, our very good technological platforms and put them to very effective use in the US.
We have been negotiating, for example, about the issue of electronic trading screens in the GATS negotiations.
We have been trying to get our trading screens to US stock markets and vice versa, but this has not happened.
That kind of transatlantic stock exchange merger would be a huge opportunity for regulatory convergence and allow the job that has been done so well to continue in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I only have two points.
The first is: is there anything in the wording of paragraphs 9 and 26 that in any way gives comfort to the Berlin savings banks and the German savings banks system that they will be in any way stultified for the future?
I ask that question of Mr McCreevy.
The second is whether we really think that yet another committee of wise men â asked for in the last paragraph â is necessary to look at this.
Â Â  . Mr President, a range of issues has been brought up this evening.
I believe I have covered most of them in my introductory remarks, but let me stress a few points.
A lot of effort has gone into creating a harmonised legal framework for the EUâs financial markets.
Indeed, a lot of work is still being done on that.
The framework is aimed at creating a level playing field, promoting deeper and more liquid markets and ensuring that consumersâ and investorsâ interests are safeguarded.
Within that framework, we should allow the market to play its role.
Regulators should steer away from intervening in decisions taken by market players.
The fact that European companies are coveted by operators from other countries is a sign of the confidence they have in us and in our regulatory model.
What we need are strong financial institutions that can stand their own in the global economy.
We need state-of-the-art exchanges, and competition policy ensures that undue concentration and abuses of dominant positions are avoided.
But beyond that, I believe that we should allow the market to play its role.
Mrs van den Burg raised a number of questions.
She said that in her opinion it was not just a decision for the shareholders â referring to stock exchanges.
Well, I believe it is.
I do not agree with her.
I agree with her that users of exchanges have an interest, but I have not noted any degree of consensus between them as to what they consider to be the best and most desirable combination of exchanges.
She also raised the question of the consequences of the possible mergers.
It is too early to tell, but I made it clear that consolidation of exchanges should not lead to what I call âregulatory spill-overâ.
That issue has been referred to by other speakers too, such as Mr Klinz and others.
As I said in my opening remarks, in reply to Mrs BerÃšsâ question on behalf of the committee, there are two separate issues.
It is a matter, in my view, for the stakeholders and shareholders to decide what they want to do with their stock exchanges.
That is a matter entirely for them.
The market should decide that.
On the other hand, the question of our regulation is of great interest to us.
We want to ensure that European regulators regulate European exchanges, and as I understand it, the proposal put to the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext will ensure a system where that will be allowed.
I agree that it will be important to ensure that this remains the situation into the future â not just this year or next year, but four or five years hence â and that whatever procedures are put in place, they have to be followed through.
As I said in m opening remarks, yes, we are taking an interest in that and will be involved in it.
