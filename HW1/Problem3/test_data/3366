I have already reached the appropriate agreement with my fellow-Commissioner MrÂ PotoÄnik.
The Seventh Framework Research Programme makes clear reference to child health, and I am assuming that the Commission will be deciding on the relevant programmes in just a few weeks, as planned.
It may come as a surprise to hear this from the person responsible for enterprise and industry in Europe, but I should like to reiterate categorically that what interests me here is neither the interests of enterprises nor those of industry, nor even the interests of national health authorities; my one and only concern is the interests of the children to whom this proposal relates.
I have been dismayed to hear a number of arguments here this evening that clearly betray support for cold economic interests.
I wish to make it perfectly clear to you that the Commission will have nothing to do with this.
We shall not deviate from our proposal on the crucial point: the duration of the Protection Certificate.
This is the cornerstone of the whole proposal, without which the European pharmaceutical industry â which is of course privately organised â will not produce the necessary research investment.
It may sadden you to hear that the European pharmaceutical industry needs to make a profit, but that is just the way it is, and neither I nor anyone else in this House can change that.
That is why we have an interest in the European pharmaceutical industry generating revenue: it will invest heavily in research only where it sees the prospect of financial gain.
There is no way of getting around this.
Some of the things I have heard here are naÃ¯ve, at best.
Appeals are of no use whatsoever in the face of the profit-driven mentality; only clear free-market incentives.
We are creating such incentives, and for that reason I once again urge you most strongly to lend your support â not in the interests of industry, the health sector or the authorities, but solely in the interests of the children and their parents.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
The Commission can accept the following amendments: 4, 5, 7, 10, 15 (1st part), 17, 18 (1st part), 19 (Art 2b, 1st part), 22 (1st part), 33, 34, 35, 39, 40 (deadline of 60 days, and 'or the request for a deferral or waiver'), 44 (1st part), 45, 46 (2nd part), 58, 62, 77, 80.
The Commission can accept the following amendments in principle: 1, 2, 6 (1st part), 6 (3rd part), 8, 9, 19 (Art 2b, 2nd part [amp] Art 2c, 1st part), 20, 21, 22 (2nd part), 26, 27, 28, 31, 42, 43 (1st part [amp] 2nd part), 50, 52 (2nd part, re data protection), 55, 56, 57, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 76, 79.
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 3, 6 (2nd part), 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (2nd [amp] 3rd part), 16, 18 (2nd part), 19 (no to moving Articles), 19 (Art 2a, Art 2c 2nd part [amp] Art 2d), 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, 40 (last part), 41, 43 (3rd part), 44 (2nd part), 46 (1st [amp] 3rd parts), 47, 48, 49, 51, 52 (1st part, re patents), 53, 54, 59, 60, 61, 65, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and the Commission statements on liberty and security: responding to the threat of terrorism whilst protecting the rights of citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking you for the opportunity of addressing the European Parliament.
I want to take the opportunity to set out the approach that the British Government will follow in its conduct of the Presidency of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will be occupied by myself and my colleague Baroness Ashton, who is with me today.
I start from the proposition that the European Union has been a massive force for good.
Thirty-five years ago, when I was a student, we campaigned for democracy in this continent, to remove the fascist or military dictatorships which then existed in Greece, Spain and Portugal, and the totalitarian dictatorships which then ruled much of eastern and central Europe.
Those campaigns succeeded as, it is worth pointing out, did the campaigns in other parts of the world, for example Southern Africa and Latin America.
In fact, 11 of the 25 current European Union Member States have since emerged to democracy as full members of the European Union.
It is a magnificent achievement which we should continue to celebrate.
Of course the nature of our societies has changed dramatically over these years, economically, socially and technologically.
It has changed in the composition of our communities, which vary across the Union, with many communities of differing races, faiths and histories living together.
But in all of this I believe that it is our duty to promote a society which is based on the true respect of one individual for another, one culture for another, one faith for another, one race for another.
It is our duty to promote the view that democracy, and not violence, is the means of bringing about change and governing ourselves.
We have to defend our values of respect, tolerance, freedom and democracy against any who wish to destroy or replace them with some other doctrine, particularly if they seek to use violence to promote their ambition.
That is part of the history of the European Union, but it must be central to the future of the European Union too.
As we look to that future we have to acknowledge that, despite the fantastic record, many of our citizens remain highly sceptical about the European Union, to such an extent that in some countries the national referenda rejected the proposed new Constitution in a way which suggested more deep-seated concerns.
I believe that a deep reason for these doubts is that the European Union does not appear to give sufficient priority to offering practical solutions which make a difference to some of the issues of greatest concern.
I am referring specifically to serious and organised crime, including drug dealing and people trafficking, to illegal migration and false asylum seeking, and to countering terrorism, whatever its origins.
These issues top the political agenda across Europe, and they are often the most potent in mobilising political activity, often in a reactionary and even dangerous way.
They can even be used by poisonous demagogues to undermine the very democracy which has in some cases so recently been created.
It is not difficult to see why these threats motivate anger amongst our peoples.
The threat from terrorism remains very real, as we tragically saw in London in July.
In 2004 over 100Â 000 women were trafficked in the European Union and over 8Â 000 people die each year from drug use, as crime and misery is fuelled in every part of the continent.
Illegal migration and a system of control which is too loose raise concerns in every city.
I therefore believe that the whole of the European Union â but in particular the Justice and Home Affairs Council â needs to give real priority to tackling these issues in a practical and systematic way.
It is that conviction which will inform the UK Presidency.
In so doing I suggest three principal approaches.
The first is that in our globalised world no single nation can tackle these problems alone, even in its own country.
In a world with millions of international journeys and economic transactions every year, ideas of âsplendid isolationâ or rhetoric about âthe White Cliffs of Doverâ can do nothing to address international criminality, terrorism or serious and organised crime or address patterns of international migration.
The need to fight terrorism and serious and organised crime means that we need more European cooperation and not less.
The truth is that in each of these areas we will all, including within our own countries, achieve most by sharing experience, information and resources and by identifying and then targeting the threats systematically and consistently.
I make the apparently obvious point that these threats are best tackled internationally, since there remain political parties and other organs of opinion within the European Union which believe that protection from these types of threat can best be secured by the construction of higher and higher fences between us, whilst the truth is the opposite â our best chances of success lie in deeper and deeper cooperation.
The second principle that must underlie our approach is to strengthen the foundation of practical and pragmatic police and intelligence work.
In each of these areas â organised crime, terrorism, immigration, asylum â we have already taken action at the European Union level.
For example, we have agreed the European Arrest Warrant, common rules on penalties for and definitions of terrorism, people trafficking and other serious crimes.
We have rules on police and judicial cooperation and we have established Europol and Eurojust to support their work.
We have also strengthened freedom to travel within the EU and established the European Borders Agency.
There is of course more that we can do and are doing.
We have agreed a comprehensive programme of action in the Hague Programme and the Counter-Terrorism Action Plan.
These contain many sensible, practical measures that will make a real difference to our citizens.
If we want to demonstrate the real value of the European Union, we now need to work together to deliver on those commitments.
I would like in particular to highlight the need for practical European Union support for intelligence-led operations and cross-border prosecutions, the development of joint teams to combat drug dealing and people trafficking, the sharing of information to facilitate joint work and the development of a European criminal intelligence model.
In the field of migration and asylum, I hope that in this Presidency we will succeed in securing significant European Union readmission agreements with certain countries such as Russia, Ukraine and Morocco, and develop pilot regional protection programmes.
In the field of civil justice, we will focus on the proposal to facilitate small claims and the establishment of a single European order of payment and other measures.
These are all important practical steps, which I hope will command widespread support from this Parliament.
But it is the third principle which I believe poses the greatest challenge in its modern application.
That principle is that we need to use intelligence effectively and intelligently to target, track down, identify and convict the criminals who, through terrorist violence and serious and organised crime, threaten the security and strength of our society.
Indeed I would go further: it is only through the effective and intelligent use of intelligence that in our modern world we can contest the criminality which attacks us.
Of course criminals and terrorists use modern technology â the Internet and mobile communications â to plan and carry out their activities.
We can only contest them effectively if we know what they are communicating.
Without that knowledge, we are fighting them with both hands tied behind our backs.
Of course the criminals know that and actively and consciously organise themselves to take advantage of our weaknesses.
It may seem obvious to state that we need to collect and use intelligence against the threats that we face. But the European Parliament and national parliaments throughout Europe need to face up to the fact that the legal framework within which we currently operate makes the collection and use of this intelligence very difficult and in some cases impossible.
The rules that currently govern our law enforcement bodies seriously inhibit their ability to protect us against criminals.
Information is the lifeblood of law enforcement operations and it is that information which enables our police and agencies to prevent crimes with the minimum of impact on our daily lives.
To tackle organised crime and stop terrorist groups before they carry out their activities, they need a clear picture of who the criminals are, what they are doing, where they are and how they communicate with each other.
Often that picture is pieced together after the fact.
But if we are to be effective in dismantling organised crime groups we must analyse intelligence and information so that we can target our efforts on the most dangerous criminals.
However, that need is not always reflected in the rules that we apply to our police.
This is not a sterile debate about principles; it is about practical measures to contest criminality and our opponents.
That is why the UK Presidency, following the proposals set out in the Hague Programme, has placed on the agenda proposals on the retention of telecommunications data, establishing a second generation of the Schengen Information System and putting in place a new Visa Information System.
That is why we argue that internationally consistent and coherent biometric data should be an automatic part of our visas, passports and identity cards where we have them â and I would even suggest driving licences as well.
That is why we will work strongly to agree with our international partners, including the United States, the best measures for consistent international use of passenger data.
These are all important and difficult measures.
They can only be achieved through international agreements, particularly in the European Union and between the European Union and its partners throughout the world.
They all require hard-headed discussions and practical agreement.
This Presidency accepts that, in considering proposals in these areas, it is incumbent upon the advocates of change, such as the British Government, to make the case that measures of this kind have the practical advantages against criminality that I believe they do.
That is why I am publishing today, as I promised the LIBE Committee in July in Brussels that I would, an explanation of the cases for some of these measures, in particular those relating to retention of telecommunications data.
I hope that Parliament will look closely at the case that we put forward.
My colleagues on the Justice and Home Affairs Council will be considering these issues carefully at the informal Council meeting in Newcastle later this week.
But I believe that the central point for us to remember, as we consider these issues together, is that we now possess many hard-won rights such as the right to privacy, the right to property, the right to free speech, the right to travel and the right to life.
Those rights are actively threatened by criminals and terrorists.
We have a duty and a responsibility to help protect them for our citizens through practical measures.
As we consider how best to do this, rights will always and inevitably have to be balanced.
What matters in each case is that the steps are proportionate and that the protection against abuse is effective.
I believe that our proposals offer that.
Let me just cite the example of retention of telecommunications data.
This is proving invaluable in the current investigations into the London attacks and in many cases in the UK it has proved essential to solving crimes, often months or years after they were committed.
Communications service providers already retain much information for business purposes, but data protection obligations in some countries pressure them to erase data that has no business purpose.
That means that catching a murderer or stopping a terrorist attack may depend on which mobile telephone company a victim, suspect or witness uses or has used, or which European Union country they were in.
Some argue that to require telecommunications companies to retain data they use for billing purposes is an intrusion into privacy, or that it imposes undue costs on business.
However, in the United Kingdom we have successfully established a system, in partnership with a major service provider, to retain essential data for up to twelve months for the cost of EUR 1.2 million.
Compared to the average costs for forensic work on a single murder case of over EUR 0.5 million, that is an acceptable cost for the state to bear.
Others have argued that we are asking for too much data, for example, that there should not be a requirement to retain unanswered calls.
In many cases, however, this is data that has already been collected by the companies for their own purposes.
All that we are asking is that it be retained and made available to law enforcement under national law.
There is perhaps a more general concern that the proposal is an unnecessary invasion of privacy or that it is disproportionate.
I do not believe that it is, because in many cases, some of which I have set out in the document I am circulating, the victimâs right to justice was only achieved through the retention of telecommunications data.
Similarly, with the Schengen Information System, the next generation enables our law enforcement agencies to exchange information about individuals wanted for arrest or to be refused entry to the European Union, as well as information on lost and stolen documents or other objects.
This is a critical tool for ensuring our collective security and for guaranteeing our rights.
Equally, without a new system in place, the new Member States will not be able to lift their internal borders with other Schengen states.
The Council and European Parliament will have to work together over the coming months to agree on the legal framework for the system.
In my opinion, we will need to do this quickly so that the system can be put in place by early 2007.
We all need to be sure that we are striking the right balance between our collective security and our fundamental rights.
In so doing, we need to be sure that we have thoroughly explored the question of whether the Schengen Information System II should be a control system or whether it can be used more effectively as a tool for law enforcement.
In making judgements about this, we need to reflect on the balance between the civil liberty being affected and the increased security being achieved, to ensure that any changes we make are proportionate and reasonable.
This also applies to the Visa Information System, where we need to ensure that those with a legitimate right to travel can do so, while those who seek to exploit our freedoms are deterred.
Increasingly, people use multiple identities to hide their movements.
Biometrics are the most effective way to ensure that we can prove someone's identity.
A comprehensive database of visa applications with biometrics matched to each applicant will mean that genuine travellers are able to prove their identity easily and travel more freely.
Governments will have a clear idea of who is entering and leaving the European Union, with the reassurance that they have the legal right to do so.
The use of biometrics also means that if people destroy their documents or are found overstaying we are able to identify who they are and where they come from.
The Council and European Parliament will need to work closely together to agree and adopt the Visa Information System regulation.
The Council aims to have the system up and running in consulates from the beginning of 2006.
Given the substantial lead-in time for the equipment of posts and training, there is real urgency to adopt this regulation as soon as possible.
Each of these examples is a practical measure that can enhance security and demonstrate the practical benefits of working together.
In each case they will enhance the sharing of information.
They will not lead â as some have argued â to the mass surveillance of our citizens or to unnecessary invasion of their right to privacy.
However, I understand concerns that data may be misused or abused or that some people will be wrongly identified.
That is why we need to ensure that in each case there is a clear legal basis for the exchange of information and that the basis should include the appropriate safeguards against abuse.
Of course the proposals that I have set out are an enormous agenda for this Presidency and we will do our best to promote it.
However, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government I also want to say that we believe that it is necessary to look very carefully at the way in which the jurisprudence around application of the European Convention on Human Rights is developing.
The Convention, established over 50 years ago in a quite different international climate, has led to great advances in human rights across the continent.
Its achievements must be fostered and developed and not undermined, but I believe that in developing these human rights it really is necessary to balance very important rights for individuals against the collective right for security from terrorist violence.
Our strengthening of human rights needs to acknowledge a truth which we should all accept: that the right to be protected from torture and ill-treatment must be considered side by side with the right to be protected from the death and destruction caused by indiscriminate terrorism, sometimes caused, instigated or fomented by nationals from countries outside the European Union.
This is a difficult balance to get right and it requires all of us, as politicians, to ask where our citizens â who elected all of us here â would expect us to draw the line.
I believe that they expect from us not only the protection of individual rights but also the protection of democratic values such as safety and security under the law.
The view of my government is that this balance is not right for the circumstances which we now face â circumstances very different from those faced by the founding fathers of the European Convention on Human Rights â and it needs to be closely examined in that context.
I intend to discuss with colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council how we might best address these issues in a manner consistent with our international obligations.
I believe most strongly that the peoples of this continent want to be assured that the legislative regime which defends human rights must be used to defend the rights of all our citizens in a balanced and considered way and that it is our duty to discuss this openly.
In conclusion, I believe that the ânoâ votes against the Constitution should be taken as a wake-up call to those who believe in and support the European project to focus on what matters.
The right to safety and security is a fundamental concern for all our citizens.
Here we can show that Europe can and does deliver real benefits to our citizens.
We in the European Union have a responsibility to rise to that challenge.
It is not an area where we can fail them.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot regard the despicable terrorist attacks in London on 7 July as anything other than yet another assault on our Western civilisation and on our shared ideals of democracy, human rights, freedom and peace.
On behalf, then, of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express to you, in your capacity as the British President-in-Office of the Council, our sympathy with the victims and also our profound sense of solidarity.
When the news reached us in the Conference of Presidents, where we were at the time, we were deeply impressed by the way the people of London responded with wise and calm determination and got back to something like normal life.
If terrorism is to be denied any chance of destroying our Western civilisation, that is what we need, and for that I pay tribute to the people of London.
The terrorist attacks on London are the latest in a series of appalling events â New York and Washington, Bali, Casablanca, Istanbul, Madrid on 11 March 2004, Beslan a year ago, as well as others.
Todayâs debate must, as it is intended to do, make clear that we will be unstinting in our efforts to wage war on terrorism with words and deeds and with the utmost determination.
Although the European Parliament, the Commission and the Member States have recently moved closer to a common approach to combating terrorism, the problem is that many of the measures adopted have not been properly transposed into the laws of individual Member States or have not been implemented by these within the time limits specified.
I therefore urge the Commission and the Presidency of the Council to do everything possible to ameliorate that state of affairs.
It was as long ago as 2001 that the European Parliament defined what role the European Union should play in the war on terrorism.
Mr Watson, who was at the time the Chairman of the relevant committee, drafted that report, as he did the 2002 reports on the European arrest warrant and the common concept of terrorism.
It was on 7 June, only a few weeks ago, that we adopted a very comprehensive package of eight reports on anti-terrorism.
We know â and both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner said so in their speeches â that Europe must act as one in combating terrorism from within and without.
That does of course mean that the Member States must work closely together, but also, and especially, that there must be action on the part of the institutions of the European Community.
The war on terrorism is above all else an intellectual and political struggle, for the object of terrorism is to destroy the free social order under which we live; it is for that reason that it cannot coexist with democracy.
If democracy is to fight back against terrorist attacks, that requires no more and no less than that we avail ourselves of all the legal means available.
I am profoundly convinced that the war on terrorism can be won only if we wage it within the bounds set by our democracy and by the rule of law, not least international law.
It follows that there must be no lawless areas when it comes to combating terrorism, but what that also means is that we must now regard it as our common task to guarantee the security of our citizens wherever we can.
In the aftermath of the Second World War, through the process of European integration, the European Union was very successful in bringing people prosperity.
One of the core tasks of this European Union of ours is now, by means of common action, to bring them more security.
The more we â by which I mean you, the British Presidency of the Council, the Commission, all of us together â succeed in guaranteeing that the public are kept safe from terrorism and criminal activity, the more the European Union will, in turn, be accepted.
Let us all, then, take action on a truly common basis.
What I have to say to the Islamic world is that terrorism, in the minds of those who spread it and engage in it, is often associated with, and justified by, religion.
To justify it in those terms is to pervert Islam.
Over recent years, I have visited something like twenty Islamic states, most of whose people, along with their governments, want peace rather than a clash of civilisations.
So can we please never fall into the error of identifying terrorism justified in Islamic terms with Islam as a whole?
We want, instead, to work together with Islamic states, in peace and as partners.
It is now our common task to do something real and tangible.
My colleague Mr Mayor Oreja, our coordinator Mrs Klamt, and Mr Kirkhope, will have more to say about that, and it will be very practical.
What matters now is that we should not content ourselves with words, but do what has to be done, with Parliament, the Commission and the Council acting together.
In so doing, we have to make it clear that we are willing to engage in dialogue with all those who seek to hammer out the issues peaceably, but we will wage war on those who do not seek peace.
There must be no doubt as to our determination, and so I hope that our common cause against terrorism â which, Mr President-in-Office, is yours, the Commissionâs and our own â will meet with success.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the speeches by Mr Clarke and Commissioner Frattini gives one the impression of having been transported ten years back into the past.
Ten years ago, in this House, we were having the same debates.
Mr Clarke is of course right; it is of course the case that the European public regards the European Union as very definitely competent to address such issues as the combating of criminal activity, terrorism and the trade in people and drugs.
Every Eurobarometer survey shows what the public think the EU ought to be doing, and high up the list are the effective combating of criminal activity, protection against the threats presented by terrorism and by trafficking in human beings.
Mr Clarke says, and he is right to do so, that we need to work together more, and I will quote him verbatim: âin our globalised world, no single nation can tackle these problems aloneâ.
How very true that is; it is for that reason that we need more cooperation, which must be founded on mutual trust.
Listening to Commissioner Frattini, though, we learn that it is this same mutual trust that is absent, and that, if the Member States work together, their 25 different legal systems mean that they do not trust one another, for one country will store data for five years and another will get rid of it at once.
What remains unchanged over ten years is that the EU Commissioner responsible for these matters declares that the European institutions need more powers and responsibilities, while all the governments, including your own, say that everything is just fine as it is, in the third pillar.
Until such time as we resolve this contradiction, we can hold as many debates in this House as we like, but we will not achieve a greater degree of efficiency.
That is what we in this House must spell out to both the Council and the Commission.
You, in both of these institutions, must get a move on!
Time is pressing upon us.
Having delivered what you, Mr Clarke, rightly described as a wake-up call in the referenda, the public want us to combat terrorism and crime in an efficient manner.
There are things that they want us to take seriously.
One is the idea that there is a European identity, the result of which might well be common and effective European policies.
In Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Finland, nobody saw the London bombings as merely attacks on London; they felt them as attacks on all of us, on every single citizen of Europe.
What is apparent, then, to me from what is going on politically is that there is a system of values that matters to all the people of Europe and that they want to join together in defending.
What that means, then, is that a values-oriented basis for this European Union of ours has been in place for some time, and so the EU can certainly be entrusted with the defence of these values.
That is an important point, and in two respects: on the one hand â and this is where I am 100% behind MrÂ Clarke â that we must not be squeamish.
I realise that that is a rather sloppy use of language.
Those, be they terrorists or criminals, who threaten our values, have no inhibitions; they have no respect for fundamental civil liberties.
It follows that we have to answer them in the same clear terms: on those who resort to violence, terror and criminal acts the hand of the forces of security and public order must come down hard.
There is no other way.
Another measure of a democracyâs strength, though, is that it is able, at the same time, to show itself tough and also to guarantee its upright and law-abiding citizens their fundamental civil rights.
You mentioned the principle of proportionality, and that is the solution to this problem; rigour on the one hand, and guaranteed fundamental civil rights on the other.
It is a solution we must achieve, but we will manage that only if EU institutions on the one hand and national institutions on the other trust each other and cooperate with one another.
The last thing I have to say has to do with the question of how we deal with fundamentalists.
No matter what sort of fundamentalism we are talking about, there is no room for it in Europeâs civil society.
What has to be said about Islamic fundamentalism is that no Christian society will succeed in isolating Islamic fundamentalists; that is the particular task of moderate Islamic societies that tend towards democracy, and one particular place where such a society is to be found is Turkey.
It is in Turkey that an Islamic government is engaged in establishing our western values on firm foundations; it was at that government that the attacks in Istanbul â to which Mr Poettering referred â were aimed.
We should not, then deny access to the road to Europe to governments like that â Turkeyâs in particular â or to a society like that, for if it turns out to be possible for our values to put down roots in an Islamic society, it demolishes the Islamistsâ thesis that such a thing is impossible.
That, too, is part of the active war on terrorism.
Â Â  . Mr President, no civilised person could excuse the indiscriminate barbarity which claimed the lives of 52Â innocent civilians in London on the morning of 7Â July, a city which had only the previous day celebrated the plurality, diversity and tolerance which had won the admiration of the International Olympic Committee and helped award it the 2012 Olympic Games.
Following the terror attacks in Istanbul and Madrid, nobody can deny that terrorism today is a serious challenge for Europe.
My Group welcomes the commitment of the UK Presidency and of the Commission to improve policies to strengthen security across the European Union.
We are concerned, however, that these policies should be measured, proportionate and value-driven.
We do not agree with the President-in-Office when he said in London that the human rights of the victims were more important than the human rights of the terrorists.
Human rights are indivisible; freedom and security are not alternatives: they go hand in hand, one enabling the other.
As Thomas Paine warned: 'He who would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself'.
Much as the public may dislike it, suspected terrorists have rights.
They have the right to a fair trial.
They have the right to be interrogated, not tortured, by the police.
They have the right to legal counsel and to representation in a court of law.
And, if convicted, they have the right to be imprisoned in a European jail.
There should be no exception for third-country nationals.
There is a worrying tendency in Member States to deport people considered to be threatening public order, national security or the rule of law, to countries where they may face torture or worse.
It is deeply troubling when the tools of justice and public order themselves violate the European Charter of Human Rights and well-defined international standards.
To suspend those values and invoke a form of summary justice would, in the words of the lawyer Cherie Booth 'cheapen our right to call ourselves a civilised society'.
The language of the war on terror leads too easily to the justice of Wyatt Earp and 'High Noon', a point illustrated by the tragic death of Brazilian JeanÂ CharlesÂ deÂ Menezes at the hands of the UK authorities on 22 July.
Governments have been all too eager to exploit the fear factor in this matter.
In Italy, stop-and-search powers have been given to the armed forces.
In Germany, police surveillance in public places has been stepped up.
In France, CCTV cameras cover the public transport system.
Any of these measures in themselves may be justifiable but, in a climate of fear without proper democratic oversight and control, they foster insecurity.
No wonder that faith-hate crime has risen across the European Union and many Muslims feel they are being criminalised.
It would be particularly ill fitting for those of us who were teenagers in democracies in the 1960s â sometimes called the 'freedom generation' â to deny our children the standards of justice for which our colleagues from central, eastern and parts of southern Europe fought so bravely.
Liberals and Democrats agree with the UK Presidency that anti-terrorism measures need to be implemented fully and rapidly.
Why are 7 of 24 instruments considered by Justice and Home Affairs ministers on 24Â May still not implemented in all Member States?
Why are six unratified EU conventions still occupying ministerial time, when framework decisions could be more easily implemented and enforced?
Why have Europol and Eurojust not been given the capacity to operate?
Why has the EU's antiterrorism coordinator not been allowed the cooperation he deserves from national capitals?
The Council sometimes laments Parliament's objections to security measures that it wants to introduce.
But the European Parliament would feel far more comfortable in agreeing to urgent measures if it was satisfied that the Council was operating in the normal framework of democracy.
A framework decision on data protection to accompany data retention measures, for example, would overcome the understandable fears of many colleagues that rights are being eroded.
A commitment to legislation in the first pillar, with transparent policy-making and guaranteed rights, would enhance the moral standing of Europe's response to terror.
A serious commitment to sharing criminal intelligence information â perhaps the biggest challenge â would be welcomed and supported by this House.
The nub of our dilemma is that the State is the main protector of both our security and our liberty.
If the European Union is to provide security against supranational threats, it must guarantee liberty supranationally too.
President-in-Office, Commissioner, if you are prepared to work with Parliament in that kind of dialogue, you will have the full support of Liberals and Democrats in this serious issue of tackling terror.
Â Â  . Mr President, one of the things that I noticed in the presentation from Council was that we were not only talking about terrorism but also organised crime.
I think that is extremely important when we are looking at some of the measures which are before us.
Because, if what we are saying is that the activities of what we acknowledge is a handful of people really have the power to sway and transform civil liberties within the European Union, then part of the battle that we always ascribe to terrorists has already been won.
I think that is an extremely worrying factor.
My Group would thoroughly agree with what MrÂ Watson has said to the effect that human rights are universal.
They are not divisible, they are not negotiable and they are not applicable only to certain groups.
We know from our own experience in the United Kingdom, when we were dealing with terrorism from the IRA years ago, that we could often see that convictions took priority over evidence and over correct police procedure.
That is something we need to be aware of and bear in mind.
I am more than slightly concerned when I hear the Minister talking about the need to re-evaluate the European Convention on Human Rights.
The debate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is already starting to refer to an 'inconvenient' ArticleÂ 3, which is the one that deals with inhumane and degrading treatment and which cannot be derogated from.
In the United Kingdom, we have already derogated from ArticleÂ 5.
I agree that we need to build on the European Convention, we do not need to dismantle it and we do not need to 'nuance' it so that it catches those that at the moment we are choosing not to support because, when we look at the history of certain of those terrorist groups, they have been supported in the past by certain of our governments.
We also need to be wary of creating a feeling amongst people that everyone is a potential terrorist or criminal.
We need a strong civil society, as Commissioner Frattini pointed out, one which is democratic, in which people feel they can participate and are not excluded on the basis of their race or religion.
My Group is concerned about the publication of the code of conduct for not-for-profit organisations and would be interested to know what the basis is for putting that within a context of terrorism and criminality.
People involved in not-for-profit are often some of the most active and constructive citizens that we have.
This feeling of suspicion is something which also feeds radicalisation and fundamentalism, which can be based on race as well as religion.
We look forward to further moves dealing with race hatred and xenophobia within the European Union.
We would also be interested to see what the foreign policy link is going to be in this discussion on radicalisation.
Much of what we are hearing this morning is based on the concept of a benevolent state.
We want to know where the safeguards are going to be, what the political oversight is going to be, how that is going to involve the European Parliament and our national parliaments and what redress is available for those who find themselves caught up and on lists that they should never have been on in the first place.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, none of us here underestimate the seriousness of the terrorist threat, none of us have forgotten or dismissed the terrifying and quite horrifying images from New York, Bali, Casablanca, Madrid, London or Sharm-el-Sheikh.
We are all aware of the need to strengthen police and judicial cooperation to destroy these criminal networks.
We â the Commission, the Council and Parliament, including, of course, our group â can agree on all of these points.
This consensus breaks down where the tightening up of security and the erosion of civil liberties start.
I will return to that in a moment.
I would add that we also disagree with this kind of excessively common Western conscience that prevents us from seeing the terrible flaws in our own systems.
I want to say a few words about that.
Finally, we cannot follow those who refuse to consider seriously the roots of the menace we are fighting.
I will start with the tightening up of security and the erosion of civil liberties.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, it seems that anything goes.
We were given a new illustration of this danger following the tragedy in London.
The shoot to kill policy recommended by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and adopted by certain Member States led to the worst case scenario this summer: the death of an innocent person.
We think that this method has no place in a state under the rule of law, whatever the circumstances.
The end does not justify the means.
That is why the concept of a war on terror seems to us to be so dangerous.
It is in this context that we will examine very attentively the content of the new draft directive on data retention.
Parliamentâs position on this matter was clear, and it must be respected.
Europeâs motto must not become, , âsupervise, suspect, suppressâ.
My colleague MrÂ Catania will discuss this point further during the debate.
Next, I referred to the endless references to our values and to Western values.
This leads, whether we intend it or not, to endorsing the idea that the world is divided into âthemâ and âusâ, with âusâ being the reference point and âthemâ being the source of the problems.
All of us here can still remember MrÂ Berlusconiâs appalling remarks following the attack on the World Trade Center.
We should, he said, be conscious of the superiority of our civilisation.
Commissioner Frattini has just used rather different language, and that is all to the good, because Western-centrism makes us blind to the injustice, oppression and humiliation spread throughout the world in the name of the West, from Jenin to Abu Ghraib or Fallujah, or from Grozny to Guantanamo Bay.
Then, suddenly, this blindness comes back to hit us like a boomerang.
This leads me to our third point of disagreement, in particular with the UK Presidency, which is refusing to listen to anyone who stresses the truth, even though it is becoming more and more obvious, namely that the war in Iraq, officially justified in the name of the war on terrorism, is, in reality, producing a continual stream of terrorists.
Even the Royal Institute for International Affairs itself, for pointing this out very clearly, was taken to task in no uncertain terms by MrÂ JackÂ Straw, who said: âthe time for excuses for terrorism is overâ.
If condemning this war equates to making excuses for terrorists, then MrÂ Straw should remember that he encounters such accomplices of terrorism in the very heart of the Council.
For example, his new Spanish counterpart, MrÂ Moratinos, who is well acquainted with the Middle East, declared after the Madrid attacks, and I quote, âthe strategy pursued by the American administration and other Western countries has failed in a devastating way.â
MrÂ Prodi himself, who has become more perceptive since he left the Commission, told the newspaper last year, with regard to the conflict in Iraq, that, and I quote, âterrorism, which should have been stopped by this war, is infinitely more powerful today.â
These are the issues -Â respect for freedom, dialogue between cultures, and rejection of the warÂ - that we must be able to discuss openly and from which we must draw the right conclusions.
Then the just fight against terrorism will unite us all and will take a huge step forward.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is a long-established principle in the European Union, established, in fact, by Jean Monnet himself, of the beneficial crisis: whenever something is going badly wrong, whenever national governments are concerned as to what to do, when the public are deeply fearful, then the answer, of course, is more integration and more central control within the European Union.
I have been watching this debate ever since the appalling attacks in New York four years ago, and that is what people in the European Union have tried to do at every attempt.
It is perfectly clear that is what Mr Clarke and the UK Presidency intend to do.
Of course, I understand clearly the argument that telephone communication information can help us to track down people.
But Mr Clarke said that we should share this information provided that there was a clear legal basis upon which to operate.
What clear legal basis is there inside this European Union?
There are no rules in the European Union; it does as it wishes.
It would be a terrible mistake to entrust this organisation with that amount of information.
We should be moving forward together by cooperating, but of course that is not the approach, is it?
No, we cannot have Interpol; we cannot have normal extradition treaties between Member States!
We have to have Europol; we have to have the fatally flawed European arrest warrant.
At every stage, cooperation between nation states goes out of the window and central control from the European Union comes in.
I was flabbergasted to hear you say, Mr Clarke, that this is not a sterile debate about principles.
I would have thought that at this, of all times, we ought to take a step back and have a real think about good principles.
In the case of the United Kingdom, is it worth us losing the presumption of innocence before guilt?
Is it worth us losing our right to trial by jury?
Is it worth us losing habeas corpus, our basic protection against the police state?
Is it worth us losing all of these things in the name of the war on terror and in the name of pushing yet more of our law-making ability towards the European Union?
I would say that it is not, and, in practical terms, none of what you are proposing will work â remember that the Madrid bombers and the New York bombers all had valid I.D. I am sorry, Mr Schulz, but there is no such thing as a 'European identity'.
We should be dealing with this at a nation state level and cooperating together, rather than thinking that the European Union can solve any of this.
It will not.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Clarke, and Commissioner Frattini for their speeches today.
I would also like to have put on the record of this House my absolute horror and condemnation of all terrorist acts, speaking as somebody who comes from the island of Ireland and who understands the effects and impact of terrorism, the way that it can undermine not only that very basic human right, the right to life, but can also undermine the power of the State, the power of the institutions and the right of good and free-thinking people to undertake opposition to political movements and go about their daily lives.
We can all point to individual examples and different times when terrorist acts have so horrified us that we have wanted to respond according to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
We have been very lucky in a lot of ways in that, at those times of crisis, many of our leaders have been able to stay calm and wait for the intelligence information to come through before responding to the threat.
In this debate today, we must likewise remain calm and not give in to the narrow jingoism that some people encourage, but rather focus on creating a better European Union, that European Union which is made up of a Europe of nation states, where those nation states with their own democratically-elected governments determine and decide what they will cooperate in, what they will do and whether they will have laws, directives, framework agreements or merely bilateral agreements.
That is the essence of the way democratic control should work in the area of liberty and security.
Because, when we look through the history books of the 20th century and of the 21st century, terrorism and its impact â and the human devastation it causes â are as great today as at the start of the 20th century.
But, likewise, the same mistakes that were made by governments at the start of the 20th century seem to be repeated today at the start of the 21st century.
When we hear talk about utilising jurisprudence in the work that is being done with regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and building on that, of course we should all be heartened to hear that our laws and our policies will be guided by those principles.
But at the same time, the actions that we see after those words sometimes appear to undermine those very basic core tenets contained in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Too often when we bring in special laws and new laws in response to these kinds of emergencies or situations, they stay on our books after the emergency has passed and can be utilised again and again.
Of course we must have cooperation.
Of course we must give the tools to our security services to ensure that they are able not only to prevent terrorism, but also to capture the perpetrators of terrorism, those who finance terrorism and those who are involved in other forms of criminality, whether it be drug-trafficking, money-laundering or people-trafficking.
We have seen the horrors of people dying inside container trucks in ports around Europe.
We have seen the horrors of people dying in boats trying to come into Europe because of the abuse of their human rights by people-traffickers.
Let me hasten to add that I am not one of those people who say that all governments are wrong and all opposition groups or all non-governmental groups are right.
There is a balance to be struck between the rights of the individual and the rights of the common good.
We must become the heralds of a new world, a world that recognises those fundamental and basic rights of freedom, the right to life, the right to liberty, the right to security.
With all of those rights comes a responsibility.
We enter into a social contract with our governments.
We abdicate some of our own individual rights and freedoms in the interests of the common good to make sure that our world, our countries, our towns are better and safer places.
But, in giving away those individual rights and freedoms, we also expect the same responsibility on the part of those in power.
We expect the same responsibility on the part of those who run our security forces not to abuse that right and not to abuse the tasks that we have given them.
The common good that the authority of the State serves is only as strong as the certainty in the minds of its citizens that their rights are protected and their responsibilities are clear.
Â Â  Mr President, Jihad networks are operating across Europe, and in mosques, a holy war is being waged against our European open society.
Following the cowardly attacks in London, it should be clear to everyone that it is time, now more than ever, for tough and comprehensive measures against the Trojan horse that Islamic extremism represents in our society.
I am therefore right behind a number of recent proposals and declarations that have been made in the wake of the events in London.
For example, the French Home Affairs Minister, MrÂ Sarkozy, is quite right to propose the introduction of much stricter controls on mosques.
Equally, MrÂ Beckstein, the CSU Home Affairs Minister of Bavaria, is quite right in stating, and I quote: âwe have to know what happens in every mosque and we must be present and gather intelligence where extremist ideas are being preachedâ.
Accordingly, the British Government will deport those who call for holy war, who incite violence and who gloss over acts of terror.
It is at last taking action, and the other Member States would do well to follow in Britainâs footsteps.
To return to the title and content of the declarations, I should like to make it clear at this point that the stricter controls of mosques do in no way entail a violation of the freedom of religion.
When John Howard, Australiaâs Prime Minister, said a few days ago that he is in favour of an infiltration of Islamic schools and mosques, he also made it clear in the same breath that his government does in no way want to interfere in the freedom of religion.
He did formulate the obvious message that his government has the right to know what sections of the Islamic community support, or incite, violence.
Indeed, that and that alone lies at the heart of the matter.
Our open society is entitled to defend itself against its enemies.
Freedom of religion can never be a licence for undermining our European society on European soil.
In that sense, I should like to praise the courage of the Czech President, Mr Klaus, who is the only Head of State or Government who dares establish the link between Islamic bombings on the one hand and, on the other, the multiculturalism by which our own values are diluted to the extent where they no longer exist.
We as Europeans must therefore put an end to lax immigration policy that allows the annual influx of 10Â 000 people who refuse to adapt to our laws, our standards and our values.
When a country like Spain amnesties 700Â 000 illegal aliens in one fell swoop, then that is a recipe for lawlessness and encourages new waves of illegal immigration.
It is high time we revisited a number of international treaties and assessed to what extent they need adapting to todayâs requirements.
The Geneva Refugee Convention springs to mind, that dates back to 1952, right in the middle of the cold war, a time in which we were faced with Europeans wanting to escape Communist dictatorships.
The same applies to the European Convention on Human Rights, which should be revised as a matter of urgency.
The intention is not to question the basic ideas of these conventions, only to ensure that they are no longer used by ill-intentioned people.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the United Kingdom Presidency for coming here to make this important statement.
Terrorists constantly seek to undermine our way of life, believing that we are weak and lack the strength to defend our democratic values, and we must always prove them wrong.
But it is vital that we prove the terrorists wrong by our actions, not just our words.
In this respect, is there not a salutary lesson to those of us who debate and legislate here?
We need to review the delicate balance of civil rights, â and I agree with that â but it is very important that those who go about their normal lives â their normal, innocent and lawful lives â should be protected.
I deprecate the sanctimonious twaddle of Mr Watson, representing the Liberals.
Of course each terrorist deserves justice; justice has to determine innocence and guilt.
But I believe that we have to understand that the nature of justice, as it is meted out to terrorists, and the standard of justice that is available to protect the innocent, must be of a different level.
I hope he understands that; hopefully, this House believes that â I and my colleagues certainly do.
On the actions that we need to take, it is of paramount importance that the law enforcement authorities be given the tools necessary to defend us, without being hamstrung by too much bureaucracy.
Flexibility and adaptability are vital in the face of mutating threats.
The terror threat is not new, nor does it recur in the same way each time.
Over the last three decades, we have seen Black September, the IRA, the Red Brigades, ETA, Bader Meinhof, animal liberationists, bombs on the Paris Metro, American Embassy bombings in Africa, then the attacks in New York and Washington in 2001, Madrid in March 2004 and, of course, in London in July this year.
Those are just some of them, there are others.
We have seen some successes, as targeted measures against some of these organisations have brought results.
Only recently, several members of ETA were arrested on the basis of a joint operation between French and Spanish authorities.
When I hear remarks like those from UKIP, it worries me.
Yes, some of us argue against harmonisation, but we also argue for cooperation between law enforcement authorities.
Without that, in an international setting, we cannot detain some of the worst criminal elements that go around the world.
I was proud to be the rapporteur for this House on joint investigation teams, as I know the Presidency-in-Office is aware, in 2001.
They are a good example of targeted, effective, cooperative effort across the EU, without excessive bureaucracy, and we must be prepared to develop this level of cooperation, particularly now that we have the advantages of technology.
President-in-Office, you mentioned the issue of data retention.
Since the advent of DNA testing and mobile communications of a world nature, we have available to us tools for good and for bad.
They can be used by criminals as well as to the advantage of a great number of people who want to pursue their business and private interests.
We must make sure that where criminality is involved, we use the new technologies to the greatest advantage.
One of my last jobs in the Home Office in the 1990s was to set up the Criminal Cases Review Commission.
Prior to that, I and colleagues had the onerous task of determining whether a case should be referred back to the High Court because of an alleged miscarriage of justice.
It was an onerous task, but one which I was prepared to undertake whilst I had the powers to do it.
I did refer cases back where I believed people might be innocent, where new technology â DNA particularly â was coming in to give extra evidence.
We should always remember that in the modern circumstances criminality does not stand still either.
We may have the technology now, and we must use it because if we do not use it, with the proper safeguards, then the criminal element will be ahead of us in that game, as they have been ahead of us in violence, in their lack of respect for democracy and in actions which are completely abhorrent and unacceptable â or should be â to all of us in this House.
Thank you for coming, President-in-Office. We will support you.
Â Â  I am particularly pleased to be able to participate in this debate under the key words of protecting order and security on the one hand, and providing guarantees aimed at protecting civil liberties and personal integrity on the other.
No one disputes the fact that peace in Europe depends essentially on effective coordination of security resources and cooperation among the Member States.
However, it does not depend only on this.
MrÂ PÃ¶ttering, Chairman of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats [PPE-DE Group], was right when he said that terrorism was of an intellectual nature.
Yes, terrorism is of an intellectual nature.
However, have we considered that the roots of terrorism are within us European citizens too?
Have we considered that every instance of exclusion engenders hatred?
Have we considered that the sense of being alien, the loss of national identity or the sense that oneâs religious identity is under threat create a void that fundamentalist brainwashing can seep into and invade? Have we considered that the roots of terrorism also lie lurking in insincere or empty political rhetoric?
And if we have considered these things, then let us speak out with a big exclamation mark!
There is work to be done, so let us take stock of the tasks facing us.
If terrorism is of an intellectual nature, then we must get to know each otherâs culture, and this duty of learning applies in both directions.
Those who are perhaps seeking to make a new home for themselves in Europe must get acquainted with Europe.
The citizens of Europe must familiarise themselves with the world beyond Europe, with its culture, its religion, its troubles, its history and its aspirations.
Irrespective of prejudices, we must coexist with the world beyond Europe, and children must learn what that world is like through stories, youngsters through school and adults through the Culture 2000 media programmes.
I am glad that this debate has laid emphasis on cooperation with religious communities, and I welcome the words of Commissioner Frattini.
Commissioner, You established the Conciliation Committee responsible for consulting with religious communities.
I merely ask you to conduct this dialogue not only with European Christian communities, but also to involve representatives of Muslim communities and put their desire for and love of peace to use in an effort to mitigate the intellectual roots of terrorism.
Fellow parliamentarians, security and freedom have been the key words in this debate.
We Hungarians know, we have learned from experience, that being free is the same as not being afraid.
I would like to thank the British Presidency for making a life without fear the focus of their Presidency.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Clarke, MrÂ Frattini, you have just reminded us of the need to respond to the threat of terrorism whilst, of course, still protecting citizensâ rights, and, whatever our conceptions of Europe, I think that the time has come, in the next four months, to show that the executive and the legislature will move forward together, and will not go down any other route.
I would like to apply this perspective to the very idea of the citizen and to the ambitious legislative programme that you have presented.
Indeed, allow me a slight digression.
A French philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, said something painfully applicable to today.
In the modern constitutional state, he said, a citizen is any person who, whilst being subject to the law, can at the same time consider himself to be the author of that law; subject to, but also author of the law, be it only through his elected representatives.
Is this true for European citizens in these painful and historic times, and indeed we cannot forget the courage of your people, of your fellow citizens, MrÂ Clarke, nor of course the direction taken by your governmentâs response?
Do the citizens consider themselves to be both subject to and the authors of this law?
Is it true for us, as Members of Parliament, when we are presented with texts on which we have to vote within imposed deadlines, of course, and when we adopt amendments that will not even feature in the ministersâ files during their deliberations?
This really has to stop.
I have my doubts and I cannot help but regret the lack of an adequate response from the Council to the recommendations put to it at its meeting in The Hague and during the assessment of the Tampere Programme.
You will therefore not be surprised, however willing you are to do everything necessary to progress, to see Parliament insisting so forcefully that its deliberations must be taken seriously and its prerogatives respected, particularly when the Treaty itself recognises the need for codecision.
With regard to the protection of data and of citizensâ safety, which are of concern to all of us, it is a matter of implementing the provisions both of the Treaty establishing the European Community and of the Treaty on European Union.
Therefore, in conclusion, can we expect the Presidency to take true account of the European Parliamentâs position and make a commitment, as soon as it wants and in a very short timeframe, to serious negotiations?
Finally, I would like to say to the High Commissioner that the Commission has stated that it is prepared to respond to Parliamentâs expectations, and it is in the process of preparing appropriate proposals that arouse our interest and justify our expectations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are seeing a growing and very worrying number of situations worldwide in which states are using the argument of the fight against terrorism as the basis for a policy of repression of other non-terrorist groups, or to violate the most fundamental rights of people assumed to be terrorists.
There are plenty of examples, in Pakistan, China, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen, Kenya and many other countries besides, and often the defenders of human rights, as the United Nationsâ Special Representative, MrsÂ Jilani, pointed out, are among the first victims of the fight against terrorism.
In Tunisia, for example, the government adopted an anti-terrorism law in 2003, a law that claims to support international efforts in the fight against terrorism, but that in fact attacks the basic rights of citizens, peaceful activities of civil society, trade unions and political parties.
With regard to the United States, we are aware of the violations committed in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, where hundreds of non-American nationals are detained indefinitely, without being subject to legal proceedings and with no likelihood of a trial.
Nor can we ignore the very serious accusations made, particularly against the United States, by international NGOs such as Amnesty International, according to which a number of individuals arrested as part of the war on terrorism are being detained in unknown locations.
These accusations are backed up by official reports discussing the situation of ghost prisoners, held secretly in prisons and transferred from one place to another to hide them from the attention of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
No less serious are the accusations made by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch against countries within the European Union Â the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and SwedenÂ  who do not hesitate to return alleged terrorists to countries such as Syria, Egypt or Uzbekistan, where the risk that they will be tortured or mistreated is very high.
Such practices are contrary to international rules on respect for human rights, particularly the non-refoulement principle.
The Member States of the EU, as we have seen, are not to be outdone.
We cannot fail to be concerned, too, by a draft Commission recommendation to the Member States relating, MrÂ Frattini, to not-for-profit organisations, which states in its introduction that there is evidence that not-for-profit organisations have been used to fund terrorism and other criminal activities.
A generalisation of that kind, such a lack of nuance in a Commission document, is particularly unforgivable and concerning.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we agree on the fact that terrorism is the enemy of humankind, and we are concerned that after the London attacks the matter is back on this Parliamentâs agenda, partly because in June it had been discussed in a number of reports and also in connection with the subject of data protection.
The fight against terrorism must not be associated with the fight against illegal immigration or with asylum policies, as it has been by Mr Clarke today.
Drawing such a parallel is specious and, at a pedagogical level, dangerous: does anybody seriously think that terrorists arrive in Europe on board makeshift boats?
In my opinion, victims should not be turned into killers: migrants are the weak link in a system that sustains terrorism, but they are certainly not the cause of terrorism.
Moreover, if the extent of tragedies can also be measured by the number of deaths, then terrorism should not even be considered a priority for the European Union: the real tragedy in Europe is the number of migrants who drown in the Mediterranean Sea because of our laws and practices that turn them away.
The number of those who go to their graves in the Mediterranean is a thousand times greater than the number of deaths caused by terrorist attacks!
A serious omission hangs over this debate: MrÂ Clarke and MrÂ Frattini represent the two European countries that have most contributed to the war and the military occupation of Iraq.
Their analysis is wrong if they do not see the relationship between the war and terrorism.
Their analysis is wrong if they do not see that the war and terrorism fuel each other, just as Islamophobia and Islamic fundamentalism fuel each other.
The phenomenon can be seen not only in Iraq.
According to a study recently published by a UN agency, over the last three years, that is since the military occupation started, opium production in Afghanistan has grown exponentially: the drug is the main source of funding for the terrorist organisations.
Terrorism will not be beaten by war or even by this obsession with security, so proposing an Orwellian system of surveillance of Europeâs citizens is unacceptable.
Data protection is a means of making security prevail over freedom and justice.
Stefano RodotÃ , a respected lawyer, has stated that data protection is like torture for the third millennium: the aim of both is to extract information.
I fully agree with that view and that statement.
Furthermore, it has not yet been shown that data protection helps to defeat terrorism, nor do I believe that the two examples that the UK Presidency put forward in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are sufficient.
Finally, I believe that certain initiatives require the consent of Europeâs citizens and that it will not be easy to build a consensus on this issue.
I do not think that the European Union should try to get out of its crisis by using this distortion of security.
The European Union will only succeed in becoming a strong and institutionally credible political force if there is popular consent for its model of society, and I believe that that is the lesson to be learnt from the French and Dutch referenda.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that terrorism cannot be fought by means of war, but it cannot be fought either by philosophising about rights and safeguards, as several speakers in this debate have done: we all know that the enemy is among us.
It is rather pointless and also specious, then, for a certain respected speaker to come and tell us that he has visited the so-called moderate Islamic states and found good people who do not want war or terrorism.
Well, I suggest he pays them a quick visit, for instance, at a different level, on a different issue, one associated with culture, the considerable cultural difference that exists between them and us.
He could go to Tunis, for instance, where a poor Italian mother had to take refuge in the Italian Embassy to protect herself and her young childâs right to return to Italy, as she was being pursued by the courts of that country, because in Islamic countries, even moderate ones, when a ruling has to be made in a dispute between a Muslim and a non-Muslim, the decision is a foregone conclusion.
It is just that the woman in this case has turned to President Borrell Fontelles to uphold her right, and this Parliament is certainly sensitive enough to ensure that that regime will hear what it has to say.
I was saying, then, that the danger is in our midst, and so I welcome those preventative measures that MrÂ Frattini has mentioned so opportunely.
This is what we must do: take preventative action, certainly; strike right where the danger lies, not among the bargeloads of wretched people reaching Lampedusa â they are certainly not the danger â but among those who recruit and organise them in not all but a great many mosques, not all but many prayer centres.
It is encouraging to see that the Italian Government is doing very well in that respect, by targeting those who disseminate hatred and tension, those who create and propagate that culture broth.
Here we continue to philosophise about data collection and so on â which means we are always a long way behind the Islamic networks, which are multiplying â and we investigate very little.
MrÂ Clarke did not even mention the problem of terrorist funding.
Fortunately there are those who have researched the subject more thoroughly, as we have heard.
It is a very important issue: just this morning the newspapers are saying that terrorist organisations in France â and all credit to French intelligence for having reported it â have even taken over a vast industry: sportswear and sportswear sales to young people.
Therein lies the danger of communitisation, which is the subject of so much demagogy.
The danger is in our midst; it is in our houses and in our cities in Europe.
That is where we must act with firm, targeted measures, without giving in to the indulgent attitudes of which we have heard too much in this Chamber.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, terrorism is the enemy at Europeâs gates, and has unfortunately become part of life in Europe today.
We must not remain defenceless in the face of these criminal activities.
It is for this reason that both individual countries and international organisations must use all the means at their disposal, even if these result in a temporary and partial curtailment of civil liberties.
This is a point I would particularly like to stress, and we should be open about the fact that these liberties should be deliberately sacrificed for the sake of the security of the European nations.
It goes without saying that this process must be subject to checks and monitoring, and that pressure groups, parties and governments must not exploit the fight against terrorism, which after all has widespread public support.
I should like to say to MrÂ Clarke that the UK Government deserves praise for its introduction of a simplified procedure for deporting individuals involved in terrorist activities in the UK.
One of the key proposals I would make to the UK Government and to other governments of EU Member States is that readmission clauses should be incorporated into agreements with Russia, Ukraine and the North African countries, in particular Morocco.
We should state quite firmly that Europe must show solidarity in the fight against terrorism, and that this will hopefully be the case both now and in the future.
I welcome the fact that the debate immediately following this one will focus on the situation in the Middle East.
Terrorism is also a problem in this region, where it is directed against the state of Israel.
Israeli citizens therefore deserve our praise, and we should learn all we can from their methods of fighting terrorism.
The Tel Aviv government should also be praised for its consistency in following the roadmap, for its vision of the future and for its efficiency in implementing its policies and getting them through the Israeli parliament.
At the same time, however, our sympathy should be with the thousands of Israelis who have lost their homes in the Gaza Strip, where they had lived for decades.
We should also acknowledge the efforts of the Palestinian Authority to achieve security in the region, even though these efforts have not always been successful.
The reason why I refer to this issue is that the fight against terrorism in Europe is not an isolated struggle, and that we are not cut off from the rest of the world in the war against terror.
Â Â  Mr President, the definition and specification of the rightful political role of the European Union and its institutions in the fight against terrorism is, I believe, an extremely urgent objective for this Presidency of the European Union.
What I am saying is not inspired by Europeanism, rather, it is a fundamental need for each of the nations suffering from terrorism.
It is needed in order to imbue the Union with real meaning, it is something we all need, all us Europeans, and it is needed because, if the European Union is not able to play a role in the fight against terrorism, the question âwhat is the European Union for?â will inevitably arise.
If, in the face of fear, there is no union, and that is perceived as the European Union's stance, then what is the European Union for?
That, of course, would not just be a disaster for the European Union, but would also be a wasted opportunity for the Member States, as they would be unable to use the value added offered by the Union to combat this phenomenon of terrorism.
The European Union must be an essential political element in the fight against terrorism, especially for the Home Affairs Ministers.
I know these Ministers face many urgent issues, they require many instruments and tools, but I believe one of the main urgent issues for the upcoming European Council is that you, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, need to be able to promote a European political project and that you need to find the European Union useful and effective in the fight against terrorism, because it is you who are going to need the Union most over the coming years.
I am talking about a European Union political project rather than about an exhaustive list of measures which, at the end of the day, we are not able to communicate.
It is clear that the European Union must promote measures on biometric data, which was mentioned by Mr Clarke or, undoubtedly, the retention of data or whatever the Home Affairs Ministers require, but we must place the emphasis on the political dimension, on a European political project.
We spend a lot of time in this Parliament talking about technical and legal measures, but very little time on the political effort the European Union requires in order to combat terrorism.
We cannot carry on putting the cart before the horse; we must provide the European Unionâs action with the essential political dimension.
So where can we find the European political project?
What I mean is that, in the face of Islamist terrorism, the terrorism of those who claim to defend Islam, the terrorism of Al Qaeda, the important thing is for us to understand that this is an emerging phenomenon, about which we know almost nothing.
We do not know its rhythm, its timing, or how it chooses which nations to attack.
We simply do not understand it.
We need a European political project based on information and on intelligence in order to understand the phenomenon and evaluate the organisation we are dealing with.
We must be able not just to take measures, but also to ensure that European citizens know and understand what we are doing.
We do not devote either time or political effort to explaining what we are about and European citizens are not aware of what the European Union does.
They only see national police forces.
As far as they are concerned, the European Union plays no part in the fight against terrorism, they do not recognise us, they cannot visualise what we are doing.
That is why it is so important to make an effort to create information fora for national police forces, led by the European institutions.
We need a European information centre, in which the security forces can access databases such as EURODAC, SIS or VIS.
In short, ladies and gentlemen, a political dimension is required.
It is not possible to fight against terrorism.
To say we are fighting international terrorism means nothing.
What we are fighting against is a particular organisation and I am therefore concerned that the leaders of the European institutions dare not call the organisation we are fighting by its name.
I do not care whether we talk about Al Qaeda, about Islamist terrorism, about radical or fundamentalist groups, or about groups which claim to defend Islam, but terrorismâs main advantage is its diffuse nature.
Clearly, therefore, the European Union must deal head on with a problem of this nature by adopting all the instruments of the rule of law and on the basis of our unequivocal respect for the defence of human rights.
That goes without saying.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, it is obviously necessary to rethink our fight against terrorism.
We must eradicate terrorism at the root, punish the perpetrators severely and hunt down the ringleaders without mercy: we are in agreement on that.
However, it is vital that we stop the âsticking-plasterâ approach and that we consider dealing with the root of the problem and new measures for combating terrorism.
It is worth repeating that these measures for combating terrorism must be in line with our legal rules, our rule of law and our democracies.
For example, we have raised the issue of the kidnapping of citizens and residents of Europe from the very territory of the European Union by the CIA.
Certain Member States have instituted legal proceedings to find out why their citizens have been kidnapped and taken to third countries where they have been tortured.
The Commission recognises that this constitutes a violation of fundamental rights, but refuses to deal with the issue.
It is the duty of the European Union, however, to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens.
How can we respond to their legitimate concerns?
Rethinking our fight against terrorism means dealing with its roots in poverty, exclusion, discrimination, in a word, all injustice.
We must find the means to combat exclusion, in our societies but also in less developed countries, and we must fight against injustice all over the world.
All advanced civilisations have understood that it is justice and equality that are most effective in countering violence.
On the other hand, we need to train, to educate, to develop critical faculties, to fight against blindness when there are human beings prepared to self-destruct, to kill themselves even when, for example, they have just created life as was the case for one of the London terrorists; we understand that we absolutely must act from the top.
Only early and effective integration into our societies can put an end to this brainwashing.
We absolutely must understand that integration must not remain purely superficial and that integration is not assimilation.
Every citizen of our countries must truly feel like a citizen, recognised and respected as a person.
As I said, where there is a feeling of injustice, there will be violence, there will be hate; and when we add to this climate the manipulation and indoctrination of the weak-minded, that is when we are faced with terrorists.
The range of measures is vast, but it is only by pushing all the levers that we will prevail.
In conclusion, I would like to return to your proposals, MrÂ Clarke.
We support you when you say that we need deeper cooperation.
We will certainly gain more by sharing our experiences, our information and our resources.
We will only succeed at European level, but the European Parliament wants to be fully involved: if we work together, then we will make progress.
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, I will say at the outset that I am in favour of the measures proposed by the UK Presidency to fight the terrorist threat and terrorist actions.
We must not choose the wrong target.
It is not the anti-terrorism measures you are proposing that form a threat, but terrorism itself.
Acting without excessive security, but also without weakness, is the best way of avoiding the traps set for us by the terrorists and of responding clearly to the expectations of the citizens.
The retention of data regarding telephone and Internet communications has already demonstrated its worth and must be encouraged, provided that it has a legal basis, that the cost problem is taken properly into account and that the period of retention and the conditions of use Â this is essentialÂ  are specified.
We are waiting for clear answers and new proposals that respond to the objections expressed by Parliament.
Urgent decisions, very urgent ones, involving Parliament and the Commission, must be taken without delay.
In addition, we must be able to use all the available technical measures such as, for example, surveillance cameras and biometric elements in identity cards.
Finally, I would stress the fact that the exchange of information between states, international cooperation, as you said, is an essential element.
There is no need, in this regard, to put forward new proposals.
Parliament was almost unanimous in adopting three reports that I had the honour of presenting, which aimed to promote these exchanges.
I would therefore encourage the UK Presidency to reach a clear conclusion, with our support.
I also call on it to demonstrate the political will to improve cooperation regarding intelligence, which is the main form of preventative action.
Ethically and politically speaking, we must also get sincere Muslims to condemn preachers of violence clearly, publicly and unreservedly and the responsible authorities to prosecute these preachers and deport them without any weakness.
There are some behaviours, some statements, some principles that are incompatible with our concepts of freedom, human rights and public peace.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we can no longer, without reacting, regularly hold three-minute silences in memory of victims of terrorism and hope that that will be enough to prevent the terrorists from acting from the shelter of the alibis they call on.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was only natural that we should begin todayâs debate by invoking the need for balance â a balance between security and the right to freedom, but pain, rage and a sense of powerlessness too, cause us all too quickly to lose a sense of balance in what we say.
I was very pleased to hear Mr Schulzâs criticisms of the Council Presidency and its preparedness for real European cooperation, but then he, too, was so carried away by zeal as to make the sweeping statement that we must not be squeamish and must respond to terrorists in the language they understand.
In what language, though, does terrorism speak?
It speaks the language of hatred, contempt for human dignity and freedom, and violence, directed without either discrimination or scruple, numbering even the innocent among its victims.
Such is the language of terrorism, and we will not respond to it in kind, but with language of our own.
The only way we can defend our values is to live by them; by adhering precisely to the law, by using force only with the greatest of reservations, by providing the utmost protection for the innocent.
That is our language, and, if we lose our balance under public pressure when we speak, we lose it even more when we act.
You, too, Mr President-in-Office and Home Secretary, spoke about balance, but you had nothing to say about the absence of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which closer cooperation in Europe depends, or about guaranteeing the right to freedom.
You utterly disregarded the Constitution and the fact that its rejection in France and the Netherlands was demonstrably not a rejection of the European constitution-making process, but an expression of disappointment at unfulfilled expectations.
Intergovernmentalism, too, along with the failure of European integration to make progress, had a considerable hand in it.
It is not the rules of war that we should be discussing but the determination to defend rights, freedom and democracy.
You said nothing about the way in which parliaments are being circumvented.
You had nothing to say about the precarious nature of democracy, about prevention and cooperation between secret services and police forces, any more than you had anything to say about this Houseâs criticisms of shoddy reports that fail to clarify whether the means used are proportionate, appropriate or necessary.
I do not believe that it is enough, if you want to get your hands on new policing resources, to throw around words like âterrorismâ, âpeople-traffickingâ, or âinternational crimeâ.
This Europe of ours will defend itself primarily by simply being Europe â a free democracy founded not upon hate, but upon law.
Â Â  Mr President, terrorism is nothing new.
It is an ancient phenomenon that is used to disrupt a society and foment unrest and instability.
Unfortunately, various Member States are already familiar with acts of terror that date back before Islamic terrorism, to, for example, the 1970s and 1980s, when the fight against terror went hand in hand with opinions on data protection that were held at the time.
Today, we require new ways and techniques of tackling terrorism, with due respect shown for the freedom of individuals and guarantees of security for our society.
I therefore wonder if, in the light of how terrorism used to be traced and fought, we might not have got our ideas about privacy out of proportion.
I gather that many Members are reluctant to endorse far-reaching measures, but the restrictions and objections presented here in Parliament do not make it easy to work with data, and so I would ask Commissioner Frattini whether concrete measures can be identified that could boost confidence in the Commission and Council proposals.
I am thinking of data storage in closed computer systems that do not communicate via the Internet.
I would urge you to make clear and concrete pledges that will remove Parliamentâs concerns.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Clarke, Vice-President Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, many of our Member States had, and are still having, problems with terrorist attacks.
In Germany, we had the Red Army Fraction, Ireland has the IRA, and Spain ETA, all of which tried to pursue their objectives by means of violence.
The attacks they carried out were cruel and lacking any justification, but the acts of terrorism we have seen so far were carried out for reasons of history or ideology and limited to one country or one region.
The â9/11â events in the United States gave terrorism a wholly new dimension, and it acquired an unequivocally European one with the attacks in Madrid on 11 March and in London on 7 July.
The conflict is no longer a merely national one; the Western world faces a massive threat.
What the atrocities in London showed was that the perpetrators do not pass through porous borders in order to carry out terrorist acts in Europe.
They are people living among us, who have taken our nationalities, attended our schools, people who go out to work and appear to be part of our society.
These were not people who were denied opportunities by being on the fringes of our society.
To all outward appearance, they were inconspicuous members of it, but they evidently did not feel any attachment to our lifestyles and values.
Far from it; these terrorists set out to kill indiscriminately as a means of turning Europe, our values and our lives upside down.
Some of them had been living in our midst, as our neighbours, for years or even decades.
That does not mean, though, that they were living with us.
The attacks on London in particular showed that the idea of the âmelting-pot societyâ has failed.
Tolerance, when misconceived as âdo as you likeâ, does not result in a colourful and fruitful, tolerant and open, mix of cultures, lifestyles and opinions.
What this misconceived tolerance does produce is parallel societies, groups to which we have no access, about whose activities we have scarcely any idea, and which function within our society with the aim of destroying it.
That is why there must be a response to this threat by the Member States and the European Union as a whole, using not only legislation but also the machinery of law enforcement.
Together and in cooperation with each other, we must protect our citizens.
There is a need for rigorous measures at European level, which need to be transposed at national level without delay, thoroughly and purposefully.
One of the measures we have already adopted is the European Arrest Warrant, the purpose of which is to extradite criminals from one Member State to another quickly and with relatively little red tape.
That can help to put terrorists and those behind them out of action more quickly.
In Germany, though, this essentially good European measure has proved a failure.
The courts were obliged to set at liberty a German of Syrian origin who was suspected of involvement in the terrorist attack in Madrid.
You may well ask why.
It was not for lack of any anti-terrorist legislation in Germany.
The current red and green Federal Government made such a botched job of implementing the European Arrest Warrant that German law had to give way to the German supreme court, with the result that a terrorist suspect had to be released from custody and the Spanish authorities can no longer prosecute him.
What this shows is that mistakes made in one Member State can affect the security of people in all the others.
If what happened in Madrid or London is not to be repeated elsewhere, integration into our society has to be taken seriously.
The right of permanent residence should be made conditional on a desire to really immigrate and the willingness to adopt a new manner of life, new forms and standards in a new homeland.
We have to make it clear that European society offers human rights, democracy, freedom, the equality of men and women, concern for our neighbours, social justice and much more, while, on the other hand, requiring people to adopt our democratic values, our conception of freedom and of its defence.
While action in the spheres of policy-making, the law and the criminal justice system are necessary, a European consciousness and sense of European identity must come into being to unite us, not merely economically as an economic and currency union, but as a community of values.
We must have something to set against ideologies that tend towards extremism and radicalism and find their ultimate expression in terrorist acts and suicide bombings, and that something is a society whose citizens live together and stand by each other because they live in a society that they share, that is worth living in and worth working for, and in the construction of which they had â and have â a part.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, I know from our numerous discussions that you are highly sensitive to the question of protection for citizens' fundamental rights and personal data.
However, it would have been a good thing if, instead of three, you had proposed five basic guidelines: not only international cooperation, not only the need for effective police cooperation, not only the need to use modern technology, but also laws and institutions for the protection of personal freedoms at the same time, together with political and social programmes to combat the phenomenon of terrorism.
Personal freedoms and the fight against terrorism are not mutually exclusive.
If citizens feel, even for no real reason, that they are being monitored excessively, then they censor themselves and that is a threat to democracy and a victory for the terrorists.
All this is important when it comes to examining proposals to keep records of European citizens' electronic communications.
Today you demonstrated to us that access to these data is extremely useful in all instances.
You also demonstrated to us that, in certain cases, it was necessary.
However, the Presidency has not yet tabled a study referring to all cases where access to these data, even if useful, was not necessary.
I would be obliged if you could do so.
The test, I would remind you, is not that the measures should be useful or even that they should be important.
The test is that the measures should be necessary.
They must also be proportionate.
We must assure citizens that records of their telecommunications which are kept for long periods of time will be absolutely safe, not only against abuse by the state, but also â and I would emphasise this â by private individuals.
Not everyone who works in a telecommunications company is an angel.
Consequently, there can be no legislative initiative on the matter without provision for and independent judicial, government and parliamentary monitoring in practice, in order to ensure that neither private nor government service providers can trawl through these huge databases for illegal purposes and that they are effectively protected against hackers.
Minister, today there is as yet no framework for data protection under the third pillar, under which the Council is promoting its initiative.
Withdraw it and let us all work together on the forthcoming initiative by the Commission and Mr Frattini.
You are right to refer to the negative results of the rejection of the Constitution by certain Member States.
However, the rejection was the result of the feeling of many citizens that their voice is not heard in Europe and denying Parliament a codecision role in decisions of such import obviously does not help.
To close, Minister, it says in the paper you circulated to us, and I quote:
'In the future, some criminals and terrorists will adapt their use of technology to make the retention of this data a less important tool for investigations.'
In other words,you foresee that in future these measures will not be necessary at all.
Have you made provision or will you make provision, when this happens, for the use of data retention to stop or not?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Frattini and Mr Clarke, Europe must provide its citizens with security, but real security, not just a false sense of security.
We do not need grand statements.
We urgently need action: closer cooperation and exchange of information; full and rapid implementation of agreed measures; not just more data collection, but also much better use of the available data.
Europol and Eurojust must finally be allowed to play a full role in combating crime and terrorism.
I welcome the coherent vision set out by Mr Frattini, with a proper balance between security and liberty, stressing the need for European cooperation for more effectiveness.
Frankly, I find it much more convincing than the one-sided wish list for tougher measures by the Presidency.
The Member States argue that they take these measures to protect our democracy, but they do so by circumventing parliamentary scrutiny because it is terribly inconvenient.
I also firmly reject any suggestion that the Convention on Human Rights should be watered down.
I believe that we are on a slippery slope here.
To speak of striking the right balance has become a commonplace.
No-one will say that the want to strike the wrong balance, but tellingly the Presidency's paper does not even have a chapter on civil liberties.
Let us not forget that people are nowhere safer than in our open, free and democratic society.
I should like to raise three specific issues.
With regard to passenger data, Mr Clarke insisted on legal safeguards against abuse, but we all know that the PNR agreement with the US lacks precisely that.
EU citizens have no proper means of redress in the event of mistakes and abuse.
No-fly lists are another concern.
On what basis are people included on such a list?
Who has access to these lists?
If someone is on a list for the wrong reasons, how can he be taken off the list?
The usefulness of data retention for investigations and prosecution is undisputed, but the need for blanket surveillance has still not been convincingly demonstrated.
Furthermore, much more needs to be done in the area of human intelligence, that is, the old-fashioned spies, rather than focusing exclusively on modern technology, even if that is sexier.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a completely safe society is no police state.
A police state is a suspicious and insecure society in which no one wants to live.
Constantly increased police powers will never prevent all terrorism and organised crime but only undermine democracy.
The best weapon is reduced recruitment to crime syndicates and terrorist groups, brought about through tolerance, social cohesion and lower levels of poverty and through permitting legal immigration.
When people do not feel oppressed or excluded, they are not such easy recruits.
Biometric passes are not as effective as you maintain, MrÂ Clarke.
Have you read the report by the American Court of Auditors?
Not all suspects are identified.
Innocent unskilled labourers with unclear fingerprints are in danger of being stopped.
The costs are .
For the EU alone, biometric passes would cost approximately EURÂ 10Â billion.
They are not worth the money.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I agree with Mr Clarkeâs remarks about the need to make the fight against terror one of the EUâs priorities.
Terrorism is one of the most serious threats to democracy, human rights and economic and social development.
The terrorist threat affects us all.
Any act of terrorism against a Member State should be viewed as an attack on the EU as a whole and on the shared values that form the basis of our civilisation.
The Union should therefore, in an expression of solidarity, take all possible measures effectively to protect the rights and freedoms of its citizens; let me stress, the rights and freedoms of its citizens.
Firm and effective responses are required, given the degree to which terrorist networks are organised and their capacity to operate across borders, and for that to happen there must be a high level of cooperation and coordination at both national and international level.
Issues of security have acquired fresh urgency in the light of the most recent terrorist attacks.
Measures must be put in place and then effectively implemented by the Member States, such as stepping up stronger international cooperation by means of checks at external borders, including the establishment of the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS); making travel documents safer and bringing in biometric data; blocking the financing of terrorism; stepping up exchanges of information and making the best use of information systems so as to enable Europol to be used more effectively; and setting up common measures, in areas such as prevention, preparedness and consequence management.
We must also fight for swift and fair ways of providing assistance to the victims of terrorism, who are the innocent hostages of inhuman violence.
Accordingly, we hope that the Commission will, at the earliest opportunity, present us with proposals on prevention, protection and the fight against terror.
I welcome MrÂ Fratiniâs statement on the forthcoming presentation of initiatives on critical infrastructure and the protection of personal data.
I should like to finish by stressing that the fight for greater security can only be pursued within the framework of the rule of law and provided that essential freedoms and the citizensâ rights are protected.
The recent case in London of a young Brazilian killed by the police serves to remind us that if our societies descend into barbarism, the terrorists will have achieved their objective â to destroy our societies and our framework of values.
Â Â  Mr President, todayâs debate on the measures we must take together to fight terrorism and terrorists is one that I regard as crucial.
I appreciate Mr Clarkeâs pragmatic approach and sense of purpose when he says that we should manage to achieve a few things in the six months of his presidency of the Council with responsibility for these things.
At the same time, I also very much appreciate the Commissionerâs remarks about the social context in which we should deal with the problem of Islam-inspired terrorism.
I should like to add my own comments about the partly political dimension to the fight against terrorism, because there is, in my view, an important connection between domestic and foreign policy where terrorism is concerned.
The threat of terrorism we are facing is a perfect example of external and internal policy being interlaced, not only in the physical sense when individuals and groups from outside the EU enter it with terrorist intentions, but even more so because we are dealing with networks and ideas that know no borders.
These ideas often explicitly deal with the relationship of Europe, or the west, with the rest of the world.
Moreover, terrorists wrongly justify themselves by reference to their religion, which is also the religion of many of our fellow citizens, and this causes tensions that, in turn, force us to face a very difficult and precarious task.
We cannot deal with those threats only by taking internal security measures.
We will therefore also need to accommodate them in our foreign policy, and that involves more than mere cooperation with police and security services in third countries.
We must also examine our relationship with, and our policy in respect of, the countries in the Islamic world.
It is time for a realism that is different from that which has determined our policy so far.
In many countries, corruption and misgovernment are far more likely to bring forth radicalisation than policy itself, and we must make democratisation and the modernisation of government into our policyâs key priorities.
While we share this objective with many Americans, we must also avoid the radical approach that many Americans, particularly neo-Conservatives, embrace with regard to the democratisation of the Middle East.
It would be useful for Europe to examine the example of the OSCE, whether this organisation that we have developed in Europe could also function in the Middle East.
Apart from that, it is vital to be consistent in our actions, both in terms of the various Member Statesâ policies and between what we say and what we do.
If we could help resolve the problems in that region in that way, this would also benefit the relationship between the different communities in our own community.
Our foreign policy should provide us and the moderate Muslim majority with arguments in the debate with radical elements.
We must translate the dialogue with the countries of the Islamic world directly into our dialogue with the Muslim communities within our own society.
Only in that way can we isolate within its own faith community the small minority that thinks it can achieve something by the use of extreme violence.
Our foreign policy is an essential piece in the internal security puzzle.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe can and must react firmly and adopt whatever measures are needed to respond effectively to terrorist crime, which is a new cancer in our society.
We therefore agree with the measures contained in the revised action plan on terrorism.
We must certainly maintain all the efforts and all the measures designed to implement and strengthen Eurojust and Europol, the European arrest warrant, cooperation and information exchange, the monitoring and tracing of bank transfers, the increased use of CCTV cameras and interception of telephone and telematic communications, and the freezing of assets belonging to suspected terrorists.
Of course, we realise that in doing so we run the risk of restricting the exercise of certain fundamental rights, such as privacy, but it is equally right and proper â and at this moment a top priority â to protect the rights of society as a whole, rights that are just as fundamental and under even greater threat.
We find ourselves in a genuine emergency situation, whether we like it or not, and therefore we must find the strength and courage to support measures which, in order to protect a higher collective good like peopleâs security, may exceptionally and temporarily, and at all times subject to authorisation from the competent judicial authorities, also restrict individual rights.
Zero tolerance on terrorism does not mean failing to observe the fundamental principles inherent in our legal systems, but it does mean always operating fully within the law.
We therefore strongly condemn the kidnappings organised by the CIA on the sovereign territory of Member States, as in the case of an Egyptian citizen in Milan on 16 February 2003.
We also regret the so-called licence to kill that is all too often issued to police officers on the basis of suspicions without being clearly justified on the grounds of self-defence, as unfortunately happened recently in a European country.
In conclusion, I say yes to the law on terrorism and yes to the resolute, determined fight against terrorism, provided that it is conducted within the law and in the name of the law.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we know that todayâs terrorists operate on an international scale, their violence crossing borders and destroying on a scale previously known only in time of war.
We also know that this is why we have, in theory, a new definition of security that combines elements of internal and external security, but we have to be clear about the fact that we have manifestly not yet succeeded in bringing together internal and external security in any practical and effective way.
It is also clear that there are some circumstances under which international responses are a better way of addressing this cross-border phenomenon, for example when the culprits are trained in country A, planted in country B, commanded by people in country C and the act is carried out in country D. That is why cross-border cooperation is needed; the President-in-Office of the Council himself quoted a number of examples involving neighbouring states where closer cooperation was needed, and I think that this closer cooperation should involve those involved with both internal and external policy.
It is more important to concentrate on this than to keep on tightening the screws at home and restricting the freedom of individual citizens.
Mr Wiersma quite rightly said that cooperation and exchange of data between secret services is much more important than the harassment of individual citizens of our Member States; it is also more effective.
It is also noteworthy that, whenever terrorist acts are committed, the Member States come together in Council to make fine statements, but nothing actually gets done.
This is true of almost all the Member States.
This ânaming and shamingâ list is impressive, and it is right to include my own country, which, as Mrs Klamt mentioned, has not implemented the Arrest Warrant; I might add that it has also, for example, failed to transpose into law the convention on judicial cooperation in criminal matters of 29 May 2000, the protocol to the convention on judicial cooperation in criminal matters of 16 October 2001, the protocol of 27Â November 2003 amending the Europol Convention, or to execute orders freezing assets or evidence dating back to 2003.
All these lists will be ineffective, and so I urge the nation states to at last do the homework to which they have agreed and get a grip on dealing with this cross-border phenomenon rather than constantly making new speeches to absolve themselves of blame whenever a terrorist act is carried out, after which â yet again â nothing happens.
In so doing, they are cheating the public, and we should make it clear that we will no longer put up with it.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that I wish to express my solidarity with the British people and my admiration at their fortitude.
I would like to make three comments with regard to the three approaches suggested by the President-in-Office of the Council.
Firstly, I agree with the fundamental point he made at the beginning in defence of the values we share, namely democracy and respect for human rights, which have enabled us to create a peaceful and united Europe.
It is on that basis that we have to respond to the apparent clash of civilisations, and each of us has problems with fundamentalists.
I believe that, on the eve of the United Nations Assembly, it is important for us to jointly defend the alliance of civilisations.
In this case, a proposal has been put forward jointly by the governments of Spain and Turkey, and I believe the British Government takes a positive view of it.
Secondly, I understand that, according to what MrÂ Clarke and Commissioner Frattini have said, we are seeking to consolidate a legal framework in the fight against terrorism and also against international crime, aware that the Constitution is not yet in force.
In this connection, I would say to Mr Clarke that although some people have said ânoâ to the Constitution, many more have said âyesâ.
I believe that during this period of reflection we must continue working to ensure that this Constitution provides us with a legal framework, and I believe that MrÂ Clarke, a committed pro-European, can do much within the British Government to convince it of the virtues of this Constitution.
I would urge him to make such an effort.
Thirdly, with regard to intelligence and cooperation amongst information services, which accounts for at least 70% of the fight against terrorism, I am going to make a single reference to a point MrÂ Clarke has discussed at some length, namely the issue of telecommunications.
When we talk about protecting privacy, we must bear in mind that there is a greater good that justifies an active policy.
MrÂ Clarke referred to the case of London.
I can tell him that in the case of the Madrid attacks, what allowed the police to ascertain the identity of the terrorists quickly was precisely the availability of mobile phone data.
Furthermore, this prevented many more victims, since the terrorists were ready to carry on killing.
I believe we must take this very much into account when it comes to protecting privacy and the common values of our society.
Â Â  Mr President, the consequence of adopting a shoot-to-kill policy in response to the terrorist attacks in London is that the UK is now directly responsible for the killing of an innocent man based solely upon his appearance.
He is, of course, a victim, but there is another casualty and that is the state of human rights and civil liberties within the EU.
Certain EU governments are targeting individuals through stop-and-search procedures based entirely upon racial profiling.
However, if the security services openly state that they are targeting young, ethnic-minority men, the rest of society may also begin to view those who fit this profile with suspicion.
Intercommunity relations will be devastated.
Our response to the terrorist threat must be intelligence led and, therefore, requires the contribution of the very communities that these policies are pushing to the fringes of society.
Only through a healthy, constructive dialogue can we root out and tackle anger and hatred.
The protection of the human rights of EU citizens who just happen to fit a particular description should not be mutually exclusive from the tracking of the perpetrators and prevention of these terrorist attacks.
Public security is of paramount concern, but the Presidency must acknowledge that undue restrictions on the liberty of our citizens simply fulfil the ultimate goal of these extremists.
If we do not avoid extremist responses, we may feed the very beast we seek to destroy.
Today, Europe has an opportunity to respond to extremist forces within our borders in an intelligent, strong, liberal manner, considering our citizens as equal, unless and until any one of them actually takes actions which threaten the security of our society.
Then our response must be united, relentless and firm, but always proportionate and based upon the rule of law.
Let us not allow our reactions to deliver that which the terrorists' actions can never achieve.
I hear much talk of the targeting of mosques.
I am a European Muslim.
I received my religious teaching in that very same mosque system.
It taught me to be a good, contributing citizen who is proud to be European and British.
Please do not confine millions like me to a second-class citizenship simply because of our appearance and by ignoring our contribution.
In conclusion, I repeat, President-in-Office, let us not allow our reactions to deliver to the terrorists that which their actions can never seek to achieve.
Â Â  Mr President, the balance between individual freedom and the security of society as a whole forms an essential element of our democratic fabric.
This balance, however, should never be beyond reproach or discussion.
I agree with MrÂ Clarke that, in this time of increased threat, this balance must be re-examined in a bid to protect our collective freedom.
It is indeed crucial that in this context, a cross-border approach be adopted in preference to any other because, as Mr Brok said a moment ago, a lack of security and crime do not stop at the border.
You made a comment on how the issues of asylum, human trafficking and drug smuggling should be tackled.
These are the very cornerstones of the Constitutional Treaty and I am pleased to hear you attach importance to this.
I hope that the British Presidency, at this time of â as you phrased it â a European wake-up call, will in any event commit fully to achieving those core elements of the Constitutional Treaty as yet.
I would now like to turn to the balance between freedom and responsibility.
As Mr Poettering, our group chairman, said, most Muslims in Europe are very attached to our European values.
If, however, you want to tackle the small individuals who cannot appreciate those values, we should have the courage to define the boundaries more clearly.
I would make two points in this respect.
First of all, we will need to dare extradite radical Imams who come from abroad, from outside Europe, to brainwash people over here.
Your government in England has tabled proposals to that effect at national level, as has my government in the Netherlands.
Do you not think, given the fact that we have open internal borders, that this clear policy should be adopted across Europe?
Would the Commission, in tandem with the presidency, like to promote this?
Secondly, canvassing for the Jihad is a problem, for we practise freedom of opinion.
We will need to clamp down on those who canvass people for the Jihad.
Is it not time we penalised the entire canvassing activity as such in our Member States?
At present, doing so is a nigh impossible task.
All too often, undesirable organisations also slip through the net.
Some countries ban organisations, others do not.
Do you not think that overtly undesirable organisations should be dealt with in the same way across Europe and that we should obstruct terrorist organisations that are on the European list in the same emphatic manner across the Union?
You only need to look at todayâs events.
Let me single out just one example, that of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a radical Muslim organisation that is opposed to democracy and in favour of radicalisation.
This organisation, that is active in Europe, is strictly banned in Germany while neither the Netherlands nor Austria, where this organisation is also active, put the slightest obstacle in its way.
Surely that cannot be the Europe of 2005?
Can we expect you to tackle organisations such as those at a more European level?
Can we also expect clearer policy to be adopted, and will you, with regard to terrorist organisations, such as Hezbollah, take a clear stand at long last?
My final point concerns the transfer of data.
You as President-in-Office of the Council have the right to ask our Parliament to revisit data retention, but could we then call you to account about something that the terrorism coordinator, Mr De Vries, says time and again, namely that the ineffective cooperation between Member States means that he is unable to get secret services to exchange data?
Let us lay our cards on the table here.
The problem, according to him, is that information held by the English secret service is not being exchanged at European level.
Can the President-in-Office at this point condemn this and state that the British Presidency will ensure that, in future, information between secret services will be automatically exchanged as a matter of priority when the security of us all is at stake, as agreed after the attacks in Madrid and New York?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Clarke, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament cannot fail to agree that we urgently need to respond to terrorism, and it also considers that this response must go hand in hand with strict protection for human rights.
When we speak of human rights, we mean a strict, pragmatic view of human rights, not merely an abstract, virtual debate.
If we agree to abandon that long-established level of protection for human rights and regard for these fundamental rights, we shall have given the terrorists their first resounding victory, that is to say that we shall have shown that our values â values on which we claim our Western civilisation is founded â are actually fragile, shaky and utterly partial.
MrÂ Clarke, allow me to put to you some questions that have arisen in part from certain omissions that we noticed in your speech.
Commissioner Frattini has appropriately spoken about prevention, and hence about seeking causes.
This Parliament would like to know whether it can have an answer to a plain and simple question: was the war one of the causes that led to the spread of terrorism on this planet, or not?
âReactionâ is the word MrÂ Frattini used.
Our question, however, is whether there is a limit to the use of forms of summary justice, as MrÂ Watson mentioned.
That is not an abstract or philosophical question.
A judicial inquiry is under way in several countries â we were talking about it just yesterday, Minister â in Sweden, Germany and Italy, regarding the responsibility of the US secret service and the compliance of European secret services in the kidnapping of a number of European and non-European citizens, who were taken to Egypt, Syria and other Middle Eastern countries to be interrogated and tortured, and in some cases killed.
What is the Councilâs position with regard to the inquiries that are under way?
We are aware of the Commissionâs position, which is very clear: it will not tolerate any further human rights violations of such seriousness.
Lastly, Minister, is the principle of proportionality still valid in the European institutions?
Many of my fellow Members have asked questions about data retention, and at the moment we have two radically different ideas, two different approaches.
On the one hand the Commission talks to us of specific purposes under the control of an independent authority; on the other the Council intends to collect all data without any kind of selection.
Where will the balance lie; what will the role of this Parliament be in establishing this balance; and more generally what will the political role of this Parliament be?
Will we only be called on to agree and ratify decisions, or will we also be able to fulfil our safeguarding role?
We would appreciate an answer to these questions, Minister.
Â Â  MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the acts of terrorism in London last summer showed again how vulnerable our open democracies are.
Again, innocent people are hit on the way to work.
How do we protect ourselves when our own fellow citizens, including respected neighbours and popular family men, are suddenly turned into ruthless death machines?
More than ever, cooperation is needed to help prevent, investigate, expose and arrest those who plan terrorist acts or other cross-border crime.
The culprits are well ahead of both police and politicians precisely when it comes to cross-border cooperation.
We must become much better at cooperating successfully to the same degree.
We talk a lot but, as fellow Members have already pointed out, very little has happened.
Our counter-terrorism coordinator, Gijs de Vries has of course pointed out on quite a few occasions of there being too much talk and too little action.
No one is inclined to put their money where their mouth is, as they say.
In particular, the intelligence work about which MrÂ Clarke talked with such commitment is really central.
Europol and Eurojust must be given many more resources and perhaps be developed into some kind of European FBI that can coordinate and lead preliminary and other investigations and perhaps even go in and make arrests.
It should be possible to coordinate information and intelligence from the various Member States.
The fight against criminality is always an important balancing act between the need for security and tough measures and the need for individual privacy.
Developments in recent years have forced us all in some degree to lower our standards regarding privacy.
For example, cameras in public places are accepted more and more.
They also played an important role in the work done by the police in London to identify the terrorist bombers.
Every measure must always be carefully weighed up.
I have so far not been convinced by the arguments for developing extensive systems for storing data, telephone conversations, e-mails and text messages.
Developing these would be a very major encroachment on privacy, with a high risk of the systems being abused in many ways.
The fact is that most of us, after all, are not criminals.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks of 11 September, Madrid, London and Sharm El-Sheikh and those that have taken place in other cities in Asia and Africa demonstrate that terrorism has acquired not only a new face but also new strategies, organisation and weaponry to strike at our democracies.
Therefore, confronted by the changing nature of the terrorist threat, we must update and adapt the countermeasures needed to defeat the enemies of freedom.
In order to defend its citizensâ right to security, Europe must make every effort to equip itself with the operational means and the legislation to forestall and to counteract Al Qaeda and its allies.
The Council, Commission, European Parliament and Member States must act fast to bring in joint measures, especially on sensitive issues that involve both security and the right to liberty.
Harmonised measures are needed, for instance, on the expulsion of those who preach hatred and violence and are a threat to security.
Italy â and I am delighted that the Netherlands agrees on this point â expelled an imam yesterday and is preparing to expel some more people in the next few days.
Harmonised measures and a sharing of political and economic responsibility are also required in the area of border controls and illegal immigration, as are harmonisation and coordination in the work of the police and intelligence services.
I therefore welcome the proposals put forward by the UK Presidency and by MrÂ Frattini.
I refer to the collection and retention of telephone usage data: if such data had not been used, one of the authors of the London attacks would not have been arrested in Rome.
Terrorism cannot, however, be fought or beaten just with a firm hand â with due respect for human rights, of course â that is, just through legislation and the work of the police and intelligence forces.
In short, just one hand is not enough: the hand of politics is also needed.
Strong action is required from Europe and from the Member States in order to involve moderate Islam in this fight: I am thinking of Islamic councils that can isolate the violent and the preachers of hatred and can ensure that the Muslims who live in Europe are not exploited by them.
We must not confuse Islam with terrorism, but we must condemn those who, in the name of extremism, try to stop young European Muslims from going to state or officially recognised schools in favour of Koranic schools.
That is a worrying trend â there is a blatant example in Milan â for it aims at preventing the integration of immigrants in Europe so as to create pockets of illegality.
Just as individual countries cannot overcome the current threat on their own, Europe cannot do so on its own either.
Broader cooperation is needed, certainly including the United States and also the moderate Arab countries, which also lie in Bin Ladenâs sights.
For all these reasons, the Forza Italia delegation in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will support the Unionâs actions in the fight against terrorism, since they will simultaneously protect both the human rights and the security of everyone who lives in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I admit that I am not neutral in relation to the fight against terrorism.
I fully support the approach and the priorities suggested to us today by Mr Clarke on behalf of the British Presidency.
I would therefore like to take advantage of his presence today in this Chamber, and that of Commissioner Frattini, to insist on the need for us to act and to take the political initiative.
Fighting terrorism means more than pursuing and arresting the criminals and comforting the victims.
It means more than police cooperation and solidarity.
It is not a matter of reducing the operative powers of the Home Affairs or Justice Ministries, it is a question of responding effectively and responsibly to the threat terrorism poses to democracy.
Terrorism is an option: a despicable, cowardly and cruel option.
Its actions are not predetermined by any ideology, any religion, any social or political situation, and nothing can justify them.
An effective policy must be capable not just of detecting and bringing the people directly responsible for the crimes to justice, but of acting to deal with the roots of terrorism too, and with those who legitimise terrorists' actions.
After all, it is not just those who place the bombs who are terrorists, but also those who, for example, instil hate into young people born and educated within a democracy, a hate that turns them into fanatics and leads them to murder their neighbours and terrorise millions of innocent citizens, as was dramatically demonstrated by the attacks in London or by the ETA attacks in Spain over 27 long years.
Europe needs a clear voice which the citizens can identify as our political position in this field.
European citizens, and also terrorists, must see that we are not resigned to living with terror.
The citizens must be aware that we are prepared to take every necessary decision and to use all the instruments available under the rule of law to safeguard their security, to ensure their liberty and to defeat the terrorist strategy.
In a democracy, security is an instrument at the service of liberty.
We all know that there can be security without liberty, but there can be no liberty without security.
Only a plural, democratic and secure society can guarantee the full exercise of freedoms.
Both rights are inalienable and we must make them compatible.
As well as expressing my support for the measures announced, therefore, I call for a transparent and agreed common European anti-terrorist policy.
Such a policy would strengthen democracy, restore the citizensâ confidence in their institutions, and make the terrorists lose all hope.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office â Home Secretary â I would like to add my welcome to you and my recognition of the enormously difficult challenges you face.
We support your emphasis on the need for implementation of effective practical measures and better international collaboration, but I have a cautionary word: I feel sure there are some useful contributions that the EU can make in the fight against terrorism, but it has a nasty habit of merely seeking to extend its own powers on the back of a crisis and not necessarily doing anything of real practical value.
I trust your antennae are sensitive to this tendency.
I am the last to imagine that terrorism will be defeated merely by more intensive security measures.
It has to be fought by every means, politically, diplomatically, financially, through the engagement of the communities from which terrorists draw their support, through sensible media coverage and through the education of public opinion.
To date, we have not been very good at any of these.
But before involving the European Union, Mr President-in-Office, let us put our own house in order.
We have constituents from East Anglia, from Cambridgeshire, in the Parliament here today and, like me, they wonder when the Government is going to appoint a minister for homeland security.
And it might not be a bad idea if we were to secure the borders more effectively in the United Kingdom.
We are not hamstrung by compliance with the Schengen Agreement, yet we have no idea who enters or leaves our country and at least half a million illegal immigrants should not be there in the first place.
We needed the Pakistan authorities to tell us that the London suicide bombers had been to Pakistan and probably on to Afghanistan, where they underwent terrorist indoctrination and training.
We know that the protections of our free society have consistently been abused by extremists who live in Britain while supporting, financing and recruiting for a host of well-known terrorist organisations.
No wonder London is widely dubbed 'Londonistan'.
UK-based organisations which support terrorism in Britain or abroad must be closed down.
May I just say how appalled I was at the view expressed by Mr Watson, the Liberal leader, that terrorists have the same human rights as their victims.
Mr President-in-Office, you have a lot to do.
You have our support for robust, effective and proportionate measures.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the statements from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the Commissioner.
However, I want to address my words to the Members of this House.
After 11 September, the bombings in Madrid, London and Turkey are a wake-up call.
We have heard the Council and the Commission being urged to act.
Of course they have to act, but so does the European Parliament.
Terrorists and organised criminals use modern technology while we, in this House, argue and debate whether our police and intelligence services should have access to the same tools and the same technology.
We argue in defence of the right of privacy whilst our citizens' lives are being physically damaged, undermined and sometimes terminated.
Ordinary men and women look to us to make their lives and their communities safer.
Yes, we must achieve a balance on privacy, on the retention of data and the use of data, but not to the point where we hand the terrorists and criminals an advantage that undermines our own way of life and gives them the opportunity to commit further atrocities.
In this House we must end the interinstitutional argument and act collectively with the Commission and the Council to achieve agreement, with checks and balances on data retention, the use of biometrics, passenger name records, Schengen Information System II, VIS, police and intelligence cooperation.
Balance is essential.
But remember this: terrorists have no respect for democracy and even less respect for human rights, except their own.
Political extremists will exploit the vacuum we create by our inaction and our prolonged deliberations, undertaken comfortably within our secure environments.
Our citizens fear that we have lost touch with reality and do not understand their fears, their needs, their lives.
Extremists will and do use the explosive cocktail of terrorism, immigration and asylum and the fear of the stranger to pursue their own agenda, which will diminish the rights of the vulnerable.
We must be practical and sensible in our approach, but we must act.
Freedom of movement across the European Union is seen as the biggest single benefit of being a member of the EU.
That new right has been acquired because we have ceded another right.
We have consented to the fact that information can be collected, retained and used on us.
Had we not ceded that right of privacy, we would not have freedom of movement across the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council started off by saying that the citizens of Europe were disappointed and dissatisfied.
They are indeed, but why?
It is because we, the European Union, are not making a good enough, credible enough or convincing enough job of doing what they expect of us.
Why are we not doing that?
It is not out of any lack of commitment or of the necessary will; what we lack is power, and what certain of the Member States lack is the will to back up words with deeds.
Some Members constantly deplore the mania for regulation, but I regret the lack of greater regulation of security matters at European level.
I call on the Council to give us the resources, to give us the tools, to give the Community the powers to do what Europeâs citizens rightly expect of us.
Let us have from you, at last, not only words, but also action!
If the European Union wants to be the answer to globalisation, we need more of the European Union and a common foreign, security and defence policy to give tangible form to the concept of political union without delay.
If the European Union wants to deliver a credible, serious and speedy response to the menaces of terrorism, drug use, people-trafficking, illegal immigration and corruption, we need more money and more of the European Union.
If we are serious in wanting more growth, more jobs created, more and better research and development, better social security and to fight more effectively against poverty, we need more money and more of the European Union.
What we do not need is for more demands to be made on the EU, more pious lipservice and buck-passing.
We need more policies, more of a will to joint action, more determination, more political action, more European Union.
The European Union goes the furthest towards solving all those problems for which national borders present no obstacle.
For terrorists, egoists, extremists and opportunists, an EU with powers returned to its Member States is the best of friends; a common Europe, a strong EU, is their most deadly adversary.
Â Â  Mr President, it has already been said that the two speeches that we have heard this morning differ somewhat in the approaches they reflect.
Mr Frattini spoke about attacking the political and social structures of terrorism.
He spoke about dialogue between cultures and religions and about the promotion of fundamental rights and freedoms, not just as a goal but as a strategy to combat terror.
MrÂ Clarke's words reflect a more practical approach: he outlines concrete and practical measures to strengthen the police and justice systems.
Both are necessary and both are equally valuable.
Terrorists have struck in New York, Madrid, London, Turkey and Amsterdam.
When I was in Morocco just after the terrorist strikes in Casablanca, the streets were dominated by enormous billboards with the text â do not touch my country, do not touch my neighbours, do not touch my fellow citizens.
This is also the response that we, as Europeans, need to give: 'do not touch Europe'.
It does not matter who you are or what excuse you think you have found for your perverse and nihilistic, violent ideology.
If you hurt our fellow citizens, we will find you and you will be punished.
Mr Clarke is right, the lack of faith in the European Union structure reflects a lack of trust in its ability to act.
In order to be effective, however, we need so much more than a strong police force.
We need a fundamental understanding of the problem we face.
We need a joint insight into the networks that recruit young men and women in our inner cities and in our prisons.
We need a common stance on democracy and rights and a common strategy on their promotion in Europe and beyond.
We need to abandon the simplistic idea that promoting security automatically means limiting fundamental freedoms.
We also need to forget the simplistic notion that limiting privacy automatically promotes security.
In order to convince European citizens of the value of our measures, we need to take the measures that we can prove are necessary.
The case for further data retention has not been sufficiently proven; the case for human intelligence and for understanding the problem has.
We need a dialogue on the place of Islam in society and about the future of multiculturalism â we need Frattini's approach.
However, we also need the down-to-earth approach that I read between the lines in Mr Clarke's words.
'Do not touch my country' â it does not matter who we are, what our religion is or where we are from: if you hurt our fellow citizens, you hurt us.
Do not touch Europe or the values it represents, the values that allow us all to live together in peace.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe the problem needs to be properly defined.
It should be defined as a sustained attack on our democracy, and it therefore seems to me to be of little use, in a democratic society, to place liberty and security on an equal footing.
In an exceptional and very serious situation we must put in place special measures that are appropriate for the current circumstances and have a legal basis, but this needs to be done with determination, boldly and without concessions.
There is another hidden side to this debate, which I would now like to mention.
I am referring to the much-discussed problem of the storage of data.
It has not been said, but I will say it now, that behind all of this there are pressure groups and unacceptable economic situations.
I must also add Mr President, that economic and security interests cannot set against each other and still less can they be camouflaged behind the guise of an apparent violation of public freedoms, even on a temporary basis.
Mr President, I am fully on the side of the victims, of the British people and their government, and I support it unreservedly.
I am on the side of democratic judges and police forces.
I shall end, Mr President, by talking about something I am very well aware of.
They can hear us, they have ways of hearing us, yet we do not want to know what they say, but when they say it and to whom.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are not in fairyland, we are engaged in a democratic and determined fight against terror.
Â Â  Â Â Â The subject of our debate today is liberty and security.
These two concepts are interdependent, since without freedom and fundamental human and civil rights there can be no security, whereas without security it is impossible to establish freedom, human rights and the rule of law.
I say this as a representative of a new Member State that was deprived of freedom and occupied by a foreign power for many decades.
One of the reasons why citizens of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and other countries were in favour of joining the European Union was because it would mean a strengthening of the rule of law, of human rights and civil liberties and, of course, of security.
The public is well aware of the fact that international terrorism, international organised crime and illegal migration cut across borders, and that in this age of globalisation no country is in a position to solve these problems alone.
What this means is that intensive cooperation is needed in all these fields.
It is for this reason that I welcome the comments made by MrÂ Clarke, who emphasised intergovernmental cooperation and cooperation between police forces, as well as the exchange of information between intelligence services.
I also welcome the initiatives launched by CommissionerÂ Frattini, such as the new rules relating to the common asylum and immigration policy and the proposal for a directive on the retention of telephone and Internet data.
All public opinion polls show that the European public wants Europe to cooperate more in the field of security.
I should therefore like to call both on the Council and, above all, on the Commission to step up cooperation, since the public believes that more Europe means greater security in this field.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody in this Chamber is unclear about the need to take more, and appropriate, action to combat terrorism and criminal activity.
What increasingly worries me, though, is that policy-makers at the national and international level can think of nothing better, when new problems arise, than to respond to them with new regulations, new directives and new measures.
I am all in favour of the police and the security forces being given new instruments, but I do think it important that the need for these new measures be demonstrated.
I think it matters that existing measures should be â as they are â effective.
How do things stand with cooperation between the Member States?
As Members have just said, that, after all, is the real problem as regards internal security and the fight against crime.
We have 25 legal systems, none of which are harmonised; our exchange of data is inadequate and not enough information is exchanged between the secret services.
Once measures are decided upon, what do we do with them?
Are they, or are they not, implemented in every Member State?
I really would like to see a list detailing where the gaps in cooperation are, what has been done about these measures and their implementation and just how well existing institutions function.
That is the sort of list we need if we are to be able to decide what else is necessary.
It is then that I â we â will be open to the possibility of considering new instruments, but I have to tell you, MrÂ Clarke, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that every single measure needs to be shown to be necessary.
It gives me pause of thought that this House has spent a year asking for proof of the need for these measures to retain communications data, and that it is only now that we are being given specific examples of why they are needed; even so, that is not evidence, but individual examples of cases in which it was of use.
That annoys me; grateful though I am that these examples were at least provided, I have to tell you that they are not enough.
Commissioner Frattini hit the nail on the head when he said, just now, that if we adopt new measures, it must for a start be clear that only certain types of data will be used for a certain period of time and only for specific purposes.
This is not about saying either âyesâ nor ânoâ to the whole lot, lock, stock and barrel, but rather about the vital importance of guaranteeing a discriminating and proportionate approach.
I also expect Parliament â which Commissioner Frattini has just said he wants to involve â to be taken seriously.
As things stand at present, the Council is not prepared to give Parliament a proper say as regards the retention of communications data, and that is not on.
Â Â  Mr President, following 11 September 2001, the United States, on the pretext of maximising security, have been waging an underground, and for a time secret, war.
It involves what we could call the ârelocation of tortureâ, made topical recently when an Egyptian citizen was kidnapped in a street in Milan, allegedly on the orders of the CIA.
The Italian Public Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for the thirteen American citizens involved in the seizure of the alleged terrorist, who was sent to Egypt to be subjected to special treatment.
Cairo acknowledged it had received him as a result of extraordinary procedures.
Those procedures are known in CIA jargon as âextraordinary surrenderâ, which is equivalent to the subcontracting of torture.
A person suspected of being connected to terrorism is kidnapped and sent to a country, normally an Arab country, specialising in that art. Secretly, and without respecting any rights, the individual is removed from the territory of the United States, and hence its native principles, which fortunately reject such behaviour, are not violated, since the interrogations take place on foreign territory.
To the question on these issues put by three Socialist Members, the Commission replied that it is impossible for it to take action since this involves kidnaps carried out by a third country on the territory of Member States.
I can understand that, but nevertheless, the Union does have close links with the countries responsible for the scandal I am referring to.
I therefore believe that, although the Community has no competence, the Council should be concerned to make it very clear that Europe acts differently in its international relations.
Â Â  . Mr President, we have had a very good debate this morning.
I am not in a position to respond to everything that has been said, but I simply wish to make four points for the House to consider.
Firstly, I very much welcome the style of the debate and the approach.
I appreciate the contributions by MrÂ Poettering, Mr Schulz, Mr Watson and Mr Cavada, in particular Mr Cavada's remark that the time has come to work together in the next four months to reach an agreement on how to proceed.
I welcome these indications of an approach, which were widely shared in the debate today, and, on behalf of the Council of Ministers, I can say that we want to work with you to resolve these questions in a positive way.
The second point, however, is that for me this debate has illustrated the dangers and the desire of some political forces to spread poison, malice and disinformation about these difficult and problematic matters.
I refer in particular to the contributions of Mr Claeys, Mr Farage, Mr Borghezio, Mr Karim â a particularly ignorant and ill-informed contribution â and Mr Van Orden.
It is very important that when we have this debate we look at the true facts and discuss them in a proper way, because unless we solve these problems others will use them for their own purposes.
My third point is a very important point of principle.
MrÂ Voggenhuber said that we must defend our values by working within them.
I agree entirely.
To avoid any doubt, I absolutely respect the legal framework and the rights that need to be respected.
I shall take one example that has been mentioned, the terrible, tragic shooting of Mr de Menezes by the police the day after the bombings in London.
In the United Kingdom legal system we have an independent police complaints committee which will investigate every aspect and report publicly and conclusions will then be drawn.
The police and security services are properly accountable to society as a whole, even when a very tragic error has been committed.
That is what should happen!
There is always a danger of errors and, of course, this Parliament is right to say that we have to ensure there is scrutiny and accountability.
However, I say â certainly for the British Government but also for the Council as a whole â that we commit ourselves to such a legal framework and the terrible killing in question is an illustration of being able to do just that.
