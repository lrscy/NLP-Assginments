Austria's unique position cannot continue, certainly not given the discriminatory nature of the old system.
Only 10% of the ton-kilometres driven on Austrian territory relate to transit traffic through Austria, while there are absolutely no requirements for national transport to tackle hazardous NOx emissions.
The entry into force of the directive on infrastructure charging and the end of the points system will therefore be linked only if the charging directive enters into force before the end of 2006.
I have two urgent requests.
The first is that the Commission should make it possible for the Council to put forward a supporting regulation for EURO-4 to Parliament without the risk of accusations of state support.
The second urgent request is addressed to Austria: do something from your side too, by increasing the number of trains and ensuring that they are cleaner.
Finally, get a move on with the Brenner Base Tunnel: 2021 is absolutely unacceptable.
I am firmly convinced that my colleague Paul RÃŒbig will agree with this support, which is also aimed at smaller and medium-sized transport companies.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Caveri report is excellent, although that does not prevent us feeling some unease as we approach the vote, unease - I should point out - at the Council's behaviour, which we feel to be formalistic and wholly inappropriate, deciding as it did in the space of a few hours at a meeting on New Year's Eve, on 31 December, on a majority solution which loses all merit before the senseless fact that it is a solution which has not been accepted, has not been endorsed by the countries directly involved, namely Austria and Italy.
We are also uncomfortable with the decision to offer two countries, Greece and Portugal, a free exemption for some categories of lorry, as if we were still at the very beginning of the integration process and it were necessary to proceed by means of derogations and exemptions.
My unease, Mr President, is also due to the great contradiction which this ecopoints system represents without resolving the issue which Commissioner de Palacio also mentioned.
Indeed, we are continuing to extend a transitional system which was only accepted when Austria joined the European Union on the basis that it was transitional, precisely because it is a derogation from the provisions of the Treaties on the free movement of goods and, in this case, also because it is a question of the Alpine arc, which is, in any case, a natural obstacle that penalises some countries in terms of the movement of goods.
As the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, the solution still has to be transitional, and this is the third reason for our unease - the slow rate of our progress towards the natural solution of the Brenner Base Tunnel, of intermodal transport.
However, it is already positive, as Mr Caveri pointed out, that the date for the construction of the tunnel has been brought forward a little from 2021, which was the uncertain date initially proposed to the Austrian Government for work to start.
Lastly, Mr President, our unease is also due to the heavy-handed attempt to make a rather over-simplistic distinction between those in Parliament who uphold and wish to safeguard respect for the environment and the quality of the environment and those who are concerned for the interests of road haulage companies.
This is not the case.
It is an unacceptable simplification of the facts.
Our group - and Parliament as a whole, I believe, which has not spared any effort in the quest for compromise amendments - has focused as a priority first and foremost on sustainable development and the quality of the environment in the Alpine arc.
The merit of the Caveri report, which is to the credit of all the Members who have contributed to it, is that it contains compromise amendments which reconcile and achieve a balance between the demands of environmental protection and the fundamental principle of free movement.
I will end, Mr President, by reminding myself that, in extending the ecopoints system, we are not adopting it as a solution but postponing the decision.
Now the governments must have their say.
Mr President, today I would like to argue for the Dutch polder ecopoint, the Scottish Highland levy and the Spanish Pyrenees tax.
Just for the record and for the translation: this is not serious.
The ecopoint system for the Alps, which aims to protect the local environment, sets the unjust local Austrian special position against the right of free movement of goods, and means that I am no champion of the current system.
I was therefore not enthusiastic when I heard that the Danish Presidency had succeeded in extending the system until 2006.
France and Italy also have Alps, and the Pyrenees are also very vulnerable.
My colleague Mr Caveri's report managed to bring this unexpected extension of a bad system by the Council back down to reasonable proportions.
If it has to be, then let it be like this.
The polluter must pay and the most environmentally friendly lorries must continue to be excluded from the full impact of the ecopoints.
I am also pleased with the approach that involves no longer regarding the Austrian Alps as a single entity but looking specifically at those areas where there actually are extremely fragile environmental conditions.
If Austria seriously wants to tackle transit traffic that pollutes the environment, she will have to invest in infrastructure, invest in railways, and invest in tunnels.
Passing the buck by pleading for a stricter ecopoint system seems to me not to be acting in solidarity with neighbouring countries.
It would just create extra traffic in these countries, with too little benefit to the European environment, as traffic would have to make detours.
I am fervently hoping for a good result in the voting tomorrow.
Mr President, Switzerland is trying to keep the heavy goods vehicles that pass through the country off the routes through the Alps, and to make those vehicles which do manage to pass through pay for rail improvements.
Austria would probably like to do the same for north-south traffic, but membership of the European Union puts obstacles in the way of this.
German and Italian road transport operators would prefer to have a free passage, as would the Dutch operators that are strongly represented in the sector.
When Austria joined the European Union, a compromise was reached on a distribution arrangement.
Since then, the country has been put under pressure to allow more and larger lorries through.
As a result, anyone wanting to protect those living in the area and their environment against the air and noise pollution from large flows of lorries now has cause to mistrust the motives for each new arrangement.
Because the solution that is now being proposed consists of a combination of quotas, bans and charges, the majority of my group will still give it the benefit of the doubt for 2004, but the problem cannot be solved without building a railway tunnel under the Brenner Pass.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to the ecopoints, public perception of Austria is often of a country with an obstinate desire to force through its own interests in the teeth of the EU.
This is a matter of concern for us all, and both the Austrian Greens and their counterparts in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in this European Parliament regard this as an area in which more information is needed.
This is not merely a problem for Austria alone; the whole of the Alps - a sensitive area - is also at stake.
This is where I disagree with Mr Vermeer.
We should not be playing off the free movement of goods against the balance of the ecosystem.
I agree with Mr Caveri that this is a problem for the whole of Europe, and so it is Europe that must make an attempt at resolving it.
Austria cannot solve on its own something that is a problem for the zone as a whole.
Opinions can differ when it comes to the ecopoints.
They were an instrument.
Austria is open to accusations of not having done its homework, of not having found or even sought out allies.
It may have been too cautious in what it did, in that rail capacity was not fully utilised.
That may well be so.
We are waiting, however!
We are waiting for a proposal from Europe.
Today's debate would not even have been necessary if we had got a grip on the complex issue of transport in good time, with a fixed tariff for infrastructure costs, and with the transport infrastructure costs directive that we are so keen to have; it is even rumoured that the document actually exists, but nothing is known about it.
Nor do we know whether there are measures specific to the sensitive areas in the Alps, or whether there are specific measures for sensitive zones in Europe.
I ask you to consider our amendments as an expression of our desire to thereby do justice to the problems with transport, the environment and health arising from both travel within the Alpine region and across it.
Without an upper limit, it will not work.
Limited and transitional solutions are not what we want.
We need an effective solution until such time - the sooner, the better - as a directive on transport infrastructure costs enters into force.
I ask you to consider our proposals within the complex framework of a common European transport policy, which, if it were to be along the lines of the Alpine Convention, could be a model not only for the Austrian - or any other - Alps, but for all of Europe's sensitive areas.
That would earn us the gratitude of all the Europeans who live in these regions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Austria is seriously testing Mr Jarzembowski's endurance today, but I crave his indulgence.
Ladies and gentlemen, crucial Austrian interests are at stake when we vote on the extension of the ecopoint system.
The objective, as formulated in the Transit Agreement, of a long-term and sustainable reduction in pollutants has not, as yet, been achieved.
In parts of the country from which I come, transit traffic has come to constitute an intolerable nuisance.
The proposals in Mr Caveri's report reduce the ecopoint system to an empty shell.
I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 18, which has been tabled by a number of Austrian Members from all parties and builds on the Danish Presidency's compromise proposal.
Even though I do not think this proposal goes far enough, it represents a middle way acceptable to all parties involved.
Austria does not simply want to keep its ecopoint system well into the distant future.
We, too, want a fair and, above all, sustainable solution to Europe's transport problems, but so long as one is not in sight, and pending the adoption of the new infrastructure cost directive, the transit issue requires a transitional arrangement that takes account of Austrian concerns.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the heavy goods vehicles that travel through Austria are seen by all Austrians as an important issue in home affairs policy.
It was important when what was known as the Transit Agreement was being negotiated between 1992 and 1994, a time when we even made our consent to membership of the Community conditional upon the finding of a sound and forward-looking solution to this problem.
Just as we did then, we see the Transit Regulation as a sort of leading issue.
Neither then nor now did we, or do we, want some sort of preferential treatment in the form of special arrangements for our country that would amount to long-term derogations from the Internal Market.
What we then wanted, and what we continue to seek, is an EU transport policy that points the way for others to follow by taking into account, along with the freedoms of the internal market, concerns relating to those parts of the environment affected by the traffic, especially in sensitive areas, and the concerns of the people who live near such traffic.
We regard these concerns of ours as being in harmony with the Commission's objectives as regards transport.
In its Transport White Paper, which we shall soon be discussing, it promises that the planned new transport infrastructure costs directive will include provisions on the imposition of charges for the use of the infrastructure as well as on the integration of the external costs, with such provisions reflecting serious consideration of the use of cross-subsidies to benefit more environmentally friendly means of transport.
We want all those things, too.
That is why it is so important that no gap should be allowed to occur between the expiry of the transit regime and the new directive entering into force.
That is also why we need an appropriate transitional regime.
The Danish Presidency of the Council, which worked hard to achieve a compromise at Council level between all those concerned with this highly touchy issue, came close to achieving its objective, narrowly missing it only because there were no longer sufficient transport ministers coming to Brussels.
Now, following our resolution in Parliament, we will be calling on the Council, at the meeting of its transport ministers, to pass a formal resolution adopting the compromise which has already been arrived at in this matter, and it would be important in view of this if we in this House were also to be able to express our belief in a joint, sound, and forward-looking solution to this problem.
On behalf of all the Austrian Members of this House, I therefore ask you to give every possible support to Amendment No 18, which enjoys the essential backing of all four of the political groupings in Austria.
The environment, and the people who live in the affected areas, will thank us for it.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, greatly though I respect Mr Caveri, I do not share his view that the proposal we are about to vote on is a very balanced one; at any rate, he does not take sufficient account of Austria's interests.
It is not, though, as an Austrian that I am disappointed by what we have in front of us, but as someone who has an especial concern for the environment.
I believe that we are right to start from the belief that we can achieve a lasting solution on transport, and, indeed, that we have to work on the basis of that assumption.
It just happens to be the case that transit traffic presents a particular problem, bringing as it does practically no benefits to the country, but a great deal of expense and environmental damage in its wake.
Despite that, I join with all the other speakers today in agreeing that we have to achieve an all-round and lasting solution applicable to all HGVs that pollute to the relevant degree.
I agree with the Member who said that we may well want environmentally friendly HGVs, but they do not yet exist; we know perfectly well that the Euro-4 lorry is scarcely yet on the market, and that is another reason why we need a transitional regulation.
Here and now, we say in the clearest terms that what we need is a transitional regulation!
Yes, indeed, the railways have to be developed, but, my dear Mrs Peijs, in 2000, on the Brenner route alone, 36 million tonnes of freight capacity were going free - and nothing has changed since then.
Railways are not being used to their fullest capacity.
The simple fact is that, so long as there is no proper system of tolls, they are too expensive.
There is one Member who has given it as his opinion that it is unfair to impose conditions applicable only to Austria.
We are ready and willing to stand in solidarity alongside the other regions of this continent, but it is surely not acceptable that only the Swiss are in a position to levy an appropriate toll and invest the money in tunnels.
We are also ready and willing - and I am unreservedly in favour of this - to make an earlier start on building the Brenner base tunnel, but we must have the means of financing it.
If, on the one hand, we fail to make the finance available whilst, on the other, asserting the need for railways to be developed, yet not even using them when they have been for lack of the necessary incentives, then the whole system cannot work.
We very much hope that the transport infrastructure costs directive will come into being, but I am already curious as to what the debate on it will involve and can see a number of people here in the Chamber who will say that environmental costs also have to be taken into consideration, that they do not add up to much, and that we have to be very careful with cross-subsidies.
I can already see the amendments to the next Izquierdo Collado report, in which a commitment will be made to cross-financing - at least in principle.
But our Members from the Group of the European People's Party are already rejecting the idea of following the Swiss example, as taking account of the environment in that way is too radical for them.
This leads me to believe that we should not only be doing united lip-service to sustainable development, but should also be creating the instruments for it.
We know all too well that an environmentally-focussed transport policy is one of the essential instruments for bringing about sustainable development in Europe.
So, rather than this being a special arrangement for Austria, it may be that our country is playing the part of an outrider, a role we will abandon only when an alternative is available to us, although we are willing to campaign for an alternative and to make full use of it.
Mr President, Commissioner, I note that a lot of the speeches here have been by Dutch speakers, but that is perhaps no coincidence, as there is a hit song in the Low Countries that goes something like this: 'I tear through the Brenner Pass in my 30-tonne diesel lorry, far from home but on top of the world'.
It makes no mention of the people of Austria and the Alpine region.
Whether or not they were on top of the world plays no part whatsoever in this song, but it does in this report.
This report epitomises European transport policy. Its significance goes beyond Austria and even the Alpine region as a whole.
It is a tool in the hands of sustainable development in European transport policy.
For this reason, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, via Amendments Nos 19, 20, and 21, is calling for a quick, lasting and comprehensive solution to the ecological, economic, social and safety problems which the traffic through the Alps has been causing for decades and of which the European Union is aware.
The end of Austria's ecopoint system is only acceptable if another kind of protection is brought in for the whole of the Alpine region and not just for Austria, one which has its basis in the Alpine Convention.
No time vacuum should arise as regards this protection.
There must also be some restriction of the number of lorries passing through the Alps.
Without a clear target, there is little point to all of this.
We are therefore calling for the imposition of a permanent 8% limit on growth compared to the figure for 1991.
We are unable to endorse this report until a solution is found in the medium term for the Alpine region as a whole.
Mr President, the Ninth Protocol to the Act on Austria's accession to the EU stipulated that, between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2003, the pollutants produced by heavy goods vehicles in transit were to be reduced by 60% on a long-term and sustainable basis.
That is primary legislation enacted by Austria and the EU.
Today, we have not achieved the 60% target, nor has any reduction in pollutants been either long-term or sustainable, facts observed both by the Commission and by the European Environmental Agency in its 68th technical report.
Instead, there has been a massive rise in the number of transit journeys, and the nuisance from pollution has increased by 52% in comparison to 1992.
The ecopoint regulation will lapse at the end of 2003, even though its objective, the sustainable reduction of these pollutants, has not been achieved.
As the transport infrastructure costs directive, often heralded by the Commission, has still not yet seen the light of day, a transitional solution was agreed on with Austria, having the form of a regulation on traffic from 2004 onwards.
This agreement must guarantee that there will be no further increase in emissions from transit traffic over against the 2003 levels.
Adoption of this report would have the opposite effect, that is, a dramatic increase in the levels of emissions from transit traffic.
The first thing to be said about the report is that it is worse than the Commission proposal, worse than the Danish council decision, and worse than the decision taken at the Laeken Council.
Secondly, the report entirely ignores the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which that body adopted by a large majority.
Thirdly, it goes counter to the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and of the Alpine Convention, as well as to the European Union's environmental goals in general.
It is the primary task of the European Parliament to defend the interests of Europe's citizens.
If we fail in this task, the hard-hit public will do as they have already announced their intention of doing, and use road blockades in an attempt to secure their rights.
Mr President, I cannot understand my Austrian colleagues.
After all, they should be satisfied with the way in which the Caveri report gives them another sensible transitional regulation.
I want to remind you of one thing, something previously approved by the Council and endorsed by the Commission, and that is the fact that this special arrangement for Austria applies just as much to those parts of the country that are not in the Alps and from which, indeed, the Alps are not even visible, parts that are quite simply flat.
I will remind the honourable gentleman and the honourable ladies that this is a special case, and a quite unjustified one at that.
Do you imagine we do not get transit traffic in the north of Germany?
Do you imagine that other parts of Germany, or of Belgium do not suffer from it?
They are even worse off.
What you are after is special treatment! In no way can you justify that!
Excuse me, my good sir, but why do not you behave like a parliamentarian for a change?
We are not here to represent the interests of Austrian citizens, but the interests of the European Union's, all 370 million of whom also have a right to avail themselves of the free movement of services.
This is not just about the Austrians' unilateral rights; the other 360 million citizens are also entitled to see Community law adhered to.
The great thing about the Caveri report is that in it, we are proposing that there should again be a three-year transitional arrangement for the Alpine region.
Just take a close look at that: in 2005, according to the Caveri report, even category 0 and 1 heavy goods vehicles are to be banned from passing through.
That shows that we are meeting your people and their interests halfway!
What you are doing here is constructing a fictitious bogeyman by claiming that the remainder of the EU is against you and the environment, which you alone allegedly care for. Ladies and gentlemen, that is intolerable.
The Caveri report proposed a sound compromise between the interests of 360 million citizens of the EU and those of fewer than 10 million other EU citizens.
That has to be weighed in the balance.
I believe that the Caveri report ends up making you a good offer, in the form of a transitional arrangement.
But it is not on for the Austrians to say that they want special rights, for, my good friend from the Austrian Socialist group, what has happened over recent years? You kept on wanting cross-subsidies.
The European Court of Justice took note of the way you exacted exaggeratedly high tolls, and yet, with all the inflated resources you acquired, you did not manage to build the Brenner base tunnel.
Those are the facts of the matter.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his patience and determination.
I too am convinced that the outcome of the deliberations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is the right solution, unlike that presented to us by the Council, and it is a good solution precisely because it reconciles two things which are difficult to reconcile: on the one hand, respect for and enhancement and stepping up of all the efforts to preserve the environment on both sides of the Alps - for there is an Italian side of the Alps as well as an Austrian side - and, on the other, respect for one of the fundamental principles of the European Union, if we really do believe in a European Union, in other words the internal market, the free movement of persons and goods, which are the minimum conditions necessary if there is to be a community of people as well as a community of economic principles.
It is therefore a balance which settles once and for all - and it could not be otherwise if we were to avoid making a mockery of the Treaties and the law - once and for all the question of ecopoints, while recognising that a transitional period is still needed, introducing a time frame which we feel to be preferable to that proposed by the Commission and which we would ask the Commission to evaluate.
I therefore fully support and endorse this approach, to which we contributed, moreover.
However, quite frankly, there is something I must say in conclusion to the Austrian Members. I am rather saddened by the fact that the Austrian Members receive great support in this House from their fellow countrymen, of all political parties, of course, but that they do not enjoy any support at all from the Members of other nationalities.
I invite them to reflect on this.
Ladies and gentlemen, as part of our responsibility as Members of the European Parliament at such a difficult time for the European Union - in terms of this and other matters - we have to explain to our citizens that belonging to a Union brings advantages and benefits but that it sometimes brings problems too.
We will not find a European solution by accentuating the problems.
I urge you strongly to think about that.
We too could have taken up a stance and refused to budge on this matter but we decided to adopt a more reasonable approach instead.
I feel that, for the good of Europe, your attitude should be more tempered and more conciliatory.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said already, and I can keep my speech relatively brief.
What is this about?
Firstly, Parliament accepts that Austria is entitled to have a derogation extended.
I consider this a quite extraordinary course of action, one which has not enjoyed my support for a long time, and one that, tomorrow, we will adopt by a large majority.
That is something of which we must not lose sight.
I warn, though, that we must not now start attaching a very high value to one section of the human race and a lower one to others.
I have the honour of representing an electoral district right on the border with Austria, that lovely country, and I would like, here and now, to make it very clear that I cannot accept that people in the Tyrol are worth more than the people on the estate near Lindau's customs house, who, every day, by night and day, have to endure traffic making a detour on the short route from Bavaria to Switzerland.
This has nothing to do with crossing the Alps or with ecology; it is because they would be liable to ecopoints if they went via the autobahn.
That is not acceptable; you simply must see that.
Having traffic doing such things as taking detours or going elsewhere altogether is just not on.
Only 11% of HGV traffic in Austria is liable to ecopoints.
It is not on when, in the Tyrol, representatives of citizens' initiatives tell me that they have no problem with this if the HGVs have Austrian number plates, but that they do have difficulties if the vehicles are registered elsewhere.
That is no longer acceptable, and I want to make that clear here and now.
These are not tall stories. I have had such conversations.
After all, I live there and have contacts there.
I cannot accept that a certain segment of Europe's population is being treated as being worth more.
You can see from the figures that what matters to the Austrians is that their own haulage firms should be put in a stronger position, and that is precisely what they have used the ecopoints regulation to achieve.
It cannot, though, be one of Europe's tasks to step in for the benefit of one region's economic interests.
Mr President, always supposing it is possible, I too would like to try and go back in time and start this debate again here in this Parliamentary Chamber, with rather a different tone from that which has characterised some of the speeches.
Mr Lisi, who spoke just now, has already said that we would have expected more generosity, at least in the exercising of our function as Parliamentary representatives of the European peoples - and I repeat, the European peoples - because it is possible to address problems of whose cause we are all, all aware without being hijacked by the martyr-like, exploitative or resigned attitudes of national interests.
We will make no progress at all for as long as we think that the sacrosanct protection of legitimate interests - the protection and preservation of the environment - can only be achieved by riding roughshod over and obliterating others.
We will make no progress at all!
I believe that the solution adopted, once again as a transitional measure, by the Caveri report is the best solution possible under the given circumstances.
We are now attempting to increase what needs to be encouraged rather than what needs to be reduced: on the one hand the use of less-pollutant vehicles and, on the other, what can only be a positive process towards the definition of long-awaited pricing systems which will allow us to provide an organic response to the problem, towards the solution which can further our cause, adopting an approach certainly of recognising European priorities, which, however, presuppose the consistent shouldering of national responsibilities, those investments which, in the future, will make compatible the sacrosanct need for environmental protection and the free movement of goods, the rights, not least, of producer communities which live south of the Alps and could not be fobbed off with solutions which they considered to be merely uncalled-for restrictions.
If we all decide to uphold responsibilities of this kind that the national governments have disregarded for too long and the committee's related proposals, I believe that the next debate on this matter will be more worthy of the collective role we have to play.
Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, like oranges from Italy and kilts from Great Britain, but it is quite unnecessary to transport, for example, potatoes from Germany right through Europe, have them peeled in Italy and then transport them back again.
That no longer has anything to do with the free movement of goods, nor indeed do the thousands and thousands of journeys by unladen lorries thundering at excessively high speed through Bavaria and Austria.
The Austria/Tyrol Transit Forum, one of Austria's largest NGOs, sums it up in precise terms: the fact is that, in 1991 and 2001, on the route through the Brenner Pass, NOx emissions from heavy goods vehicles increased by 18%.
The fact is that journeys undertaken by HGVs travelling through Austrian territory have gone up by 50%.
The fact is that in not one of the years since the Treaty was signed has any traffic been transferred from road to rail.
On the contrary, the tonnage on the road over the Brenner has increased from 15 million tonnes of freight to 26 million.
That amounts to an increase of 73%.
The people living along the transit routes are in despair.
Many of them are farmers whose families have lived on their farms for centuries.
It is not a matter of them being given a higher value, but they do live higher up.
I beg you not to rob these people of their last hope.
My dear Georg, the ecopoint system was always, in essence, a compromise.
I saw the Council's New Year's Eve resolution as the very last chance for us to find a common way ahead.
By contrast, I see the Caveri report as the devastating result of the work of a lobby that is as hard as nails, a group with financial clout and much other power besides, by which I mean the hauliers.
It goes without saying that, in Austria too, there are groups trying to get their justified demands incorporated into policy.
But the brutal and shameless way in which I saw this happening in the European Union was something really new - and I have quite a few years in politics behind me!
I could well name several Members of this House - do not worry, I am not actually going to - who told me that they understood us Austrians, and were also on our side, but asked what else they could do, as their hauliers would finish them off.
I beg you, I beseech you, to reject the Caveri report and adopt the Danish presidency's compromise proposal.
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commissioner.
Quite apart from my speaking time, I would like to correct the young man over there; if he wants to regard the Alps, this wonderful work of God's hands, as nothing more than an obstacle to transport, then that is his business!
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal before us for our consideration has to do with the extension of the ecopoint system applicable to lorries travelling through Austria.
I think it important to emphasise at this point that what it is proposed to extend is a derogation for Austria, a derogation to which Austria has been entitled ever since it joined the EU, to which was attached the condition that Austria was to improve its transport infrastructure in such a way as to have a positive effect on the free exchange of goods guaranteed by the Internal Market.
If we are now to discuss the extension of a derogation, it must be clear to us that one does not simply maintain the status quo for another three years, so that the decision we are about to take must envisage the derogation coming to an end by 2006 at the latest.
My electoral district in the southern part of Baden-WÃŒrttemberg borders on Austria, which is admittedly a very beautiful country, and, being well acquainted with haulage companies' complaints about the incomprehensibility of the ecopoint system, I agree with my group that the prevailing system has to be changed, and changed in the following respects.
The first thing I want to say is that derogations are justified in the Alps, which are a sensitive region.
The ecopoint system should therefore apply only, as was originally intended, to transit through the Alps and not also to journeys in the rest of Austria; the alternative would be that the ecopoint system would constitute an arbitrary measure, and other Member States would be able to claim the right to impose their own.
Secondly, the system of ecopoints must definitely come to an end in 2006.
Thirdly, the state of technological development means that HGVs in emission categories 3 and 4 should lose their ecopoint liability altogether.
In addition, I demand, specifically for what I will call 'HÃ¶rbrenz-Transit', which particularly affects my electoral district - that is, traffic passing over a connecting stretch, only 16 kilometres long, between the German A 96 and the Swiss A 14 - special treatment in the form of the provision of an adequate number of ecopoints.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must not forget that, although we are talking about the specific case of Austria, our perspective must be much wider, covering the entire network of Alpine passes, if we want to be objective and make decisions which suit everybody to some degree.
Indeed, what happens to one pass immediately affects all the others.
As far as the Brenner tunnel is concerned, recent progress has been spasmodic, to say the least.
I would point out that, apart from its natural appeal as a direct vertical line connecting Northern Europe to the Mediterranean, just recently, traffic going to the Brenner tunnel - in Austria, therefore, but in Italy too - has increased immeasurably for very long periods because of the closure of first the Mont Blanc tunnel and then the St Gotthard tunnel and because of the acute crises at the FrÃ©jus pass and the Swiss passes.
All this has helped to make the question of the environmental protection of Austria desperate, but we must not forget - and this has never been given any consideration - that there is another side of the Alps, the Italian side, and it will not surprise you to learn that that is where I live.
We have never received any recognition of what is exactly the same problem as that of Austria, whereas Austria has been allowed to use the ecopoints system and other systems mentioned by a number of speakers.
We have never been allowed to use an ecopoints system or tolls like those for the 'Ponte Europa' or the Austrian stretch of motorway, which are among the highest in Europe.
I have therefore reached the conclusion that the solution proposed by the Caveri report is fair.
It is right to apply the ecopoints system to EURO 1 and EURO 2 lorries and it is right to exempt EURO 3 lorries and all subsequent generations of vehicles, but it is also right to abandon ecopoints after 2006 and find alternative ways of offsetting external costs, and not just where Austria is concerned but with regard to all the critical and sensitive areas of Europe.
Lastly, it is right to focus on implementing major rail and intermodal transport projects, starting with the Brenner Base Tunnel, for now it really is time to get to work not just on projects but on implementing them too.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Caveri for the work he has done on an issue which - as we have seen here today - is very difficult and delicate.
There are a range of interests, all of them legitimate but entirely contradictory, which are in opposition to each other.
I would simply like to point out to certain Members that we need a quick resolution, because the current transitional situation ends on 31 December 2003.
Secondly, the current situation is transitional.
In other words, what appears in the accession Treaty, the protocol on which the whole system of ecopoints is based, lays down a limited time period.
Thirdly, we must be aware that the other fourteen countries of the European Union are accepting the idea of making an effort and an exception in order to satisfy Austria with regard to what is one of the essential freedoms of European integration - initially of the Common Market and now of the European Union - which is freedom of transit for people.
On this basis, the Commission presented a proposal which suggested an extension for a maximum of three years - year by year - of the current system, in order to allow time to seek general rules which of course will not mean for Austria or anybody the maintenance of the ecopoints system or any similar system.
I say this because it is obvious that it is not now a question of seeking a system which is radically different to the ecopoints system, since it is going to have a restricted minimal period in force.
I would insist that we are seeking a transitional system so that Austria, which participates in the ecopoints system, may arrive, together with the other 14 countries - 24 within a few months - at a common system and a better assumption of the external costs of the different infrastructures throughout the European Union, without exceptions for anybody.
It is therefore a transitional exception which must be based, in principle, on the current system because for two or three years it would not make much sense.
In Mr Caveri's proposal there are points which take the same approach as the principle for agreement proposed by the Danish Presidency on 31 December.
This represents a compromise and I am happy that there is agreement, for example, on the idea of banning the most polluting lorries; on the idea of freeing the least polluting lorries from the ecopoints system; on establishing an annual duration of a transitional system up to a maximum of three years.
However, there are provisions which we believe will make it difficult for the Commission to reach an agreement with the Council - I would make this very clear - and which would provide more problems than solutions.
This is the case with the reduction of the scope of the system to just the Austrian Alps, which are genuinely of the greatest sensitivity, because in the other areas of Austria the sensitivity - and many of the speakers were right - is identical to that of other areas of Europe.
However, while I understand this in principle, it would create enormous difficulties in terms of managing the project.
I would therefore ask that the general area of Austria be maintained.
Furthermore, in the Council we have debated whether or not to exclude the HÃ¶rbranz Pass, the Lindau-St.
Margarethen, which involves a stretch of road of less than 15 kilometres, a very short distance.
That would also raise problems.
I would therefore ask you not to retain this part, please.
The provisions of the system of contingents, which vary according to categories, would also raise difficulties.
Furthermore, the number of ecopoints set relates to the current Member States, and to apply the system now to the future countries would complicate matters even further.
Let us hope that before they join as full Members this problem has been resolved definitively.
Furthermore, we ask that you do not insist on the reintroduction of the 108% clause, because we cannot maintain and represent something which - I can tell you - the Council would never accept and which the Commission also rejected.
Furthermore, that clause did not appear in the proposal.
Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can accept six amendments, one of them a fundamental issue and, if necessary, with some modifications to the wording of the text, Amendments Nos 1, 5, 11, 12 and the first sentence of No 15 and of No 18.
I would like to say to you that the real solution is to build the Brenner, to build the Lyon-Turin, that intermodality truly be established.
Those are the solutions.
You must understand that we have to seek a compromise and that a solution is urgently required.
We do not have many months.
And the perfect is always the enemy of the good.
I say this to everyone. I would ask you to cooperate so that, amongst all of us, we can resolve this problem, which is very sensitive in one of the countries of the Union.
We must seek a response and achieve a result which allows progress to be made, while we present proposals which serve to provide a more rational system of charging for infrastructures throughout the European Union.
I would once again like to congratulate Mr Caveri on the difficult work he has done in trying to seek a formula acceptable to everyone and, in any event, the Commission will, of course, take very good note of what Parliament says as always and will try to include these elements in the basis of an agreement acceptable to Parliament and to the Council.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, Commissioner, the White Paper on Transport is dated 12 September 2001 and it may appear that we have spent too much time analysing this important report sent to us by the Commission.
However, I must say that we have made good use of this time, thorough use I believe, to debate and bring together positions between the different groups in the House.
At the moment these approximations are still taking place, and I would urge that we reach a thorough consensus for the vote tomorrow.
We have used this time to inform the sectors and allow them to participate.
I am sure that the Commission has held many contacts with all the sectors before producing the White Paper, but I must say that Parliament has not been left behind and that practically all the European associations representing the different modes of transport have been heard by Parliament and that many of their proposals have been incorporated into the approach we have been working on.
This approach is characterised by a fundamental fact: Commissioner, in this case Parliament is not opposing the Commission.
On the contrary, it is demonstrating willingness and carrying out a positive analysis of the Commission's proposal, of the proposals in the White Paper, and we believe that the enormous majority of its offers and analysis can be perfectly endorsed by this Parliament.
W are continuing this reflection, however, and providing certain constructive criticisms and specific proposals which should be analysed by the Commission as appropriate.
This is a crucial and decisive time for transport.
It is true that in 1992, in the last White Paper on Transport, certain objectives were set which have been fulfilled practically in their entirety.
We could say that the liberalisation of transport was the strategic and fundamental objective of that White Paper: the incorporation of technologies, the reduction in transport costs, the increase in competitiveness, objective achieved, but in this war, we have lost the battle of sustainability, and I am glad that the Commission is the first to clearly acknowledge the seriousness of this problem, and the fact that we cannot afford to delay decision making if we want to be operative.
The problem of sustainability in the broad sense, environmental, naturally, with the grave consequences of the pollution created by transport, which cancel out the savings made in the rest of industry with a view to fulfilling the Kyoto commitments, and with the impact, not only on nature generally, but on the health of the citizens who, according to certain reports, reaches levels practically as serious as transport accident levels.
As well as the actual environmental aspect, congestion is worrying.
We used to have a functional operative transport system which was competitive, but now the main routes are seizing up, cities are becoming grid-locked, kilometres of rail and road, approaches to airports, are showing themselves to be structurally weak in terms of competitiveness.
And therefore competitiveness is being seriously harmed.
This is not the time to give figures, I refuse to do that, we do not have time, but I must say that we are also moving in that direction.
Charging is a rough diamond in the White Paper which we must be able to cut from now on and which is essential.
We must promote modes of transport which are respectful of the environment, create synergy between the different modes of transport by means of intermodality and the logistical platforms necessary for creating transport as efficiently as possible.
The essential role of roads must be respected and valued, the railways must be liberalised, short- and medium-distance cabotage must be strengthened, etc.
Safety cannot be conditional.
There is a proposal from Parliament on the creation of the European safety agency for roads - the only one missing from the White Paper on Transport - and I hope that it is received well, as well as other problems relating to safety at sea, on the railways, etc.
Commissioner, the time has come for us to say very clearly that the European Union's transport policy cannot work without a consistent budgetary policy, and hence Parliament's proposal on the European transport fund that we need and on the financial instrument for transport.
It is true that European asymmetry is not properly considered in the White Paper, that urban issues have not been dealt with since they are considered subsidiary and not to be subject to the Commission's proposal, that public transport is not yet properly dealt with - and we are asking the Commission for complementary documents - that enlargement is not really taken into account in the White Paper, but if Europe wants to participate in the process of globalisation and not wait for others to implement it and, if it wants to be as viable as possible, it must have better transport.
You have cooperated in the White Paper in this respect and Parliament wishes to follow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado for the work he has done over a long period.
I believe his work has allowed us to hold the sometimes passionate debates which have resulted from the White Paper.
We are talking about promoting a transport policy, taking account of new elements, as has been said, in a clear and precise way, such as the aspect of combining sustainable development and growth, in other words, the incorporation of quality of life and the protection of the environment as factors which are also essential when it comes to drawing up our policies.
In this regard, the almost sixty measures proposed between now and 2010 are geared towards rebalancing modes of transport, which does not mean running down road transport - let us make this very clear - or sea transport, which are the two most competitive modes of transport, but simply preventing the future deterioration of rail transport or inland waterways transport in the north of Europe, which are absolutely essential forms of transport which must play a fundamental role in absorbing the new transport demands, and this is also true of the development of sea transport.
It is therefore a question of rebalancing modes of transport, removing bottlenecks, having a policy of safe transport - safety is an essential point when it comes to serving the users - and also tackling the globalisation which is today being experienced by many modes of transport, in particular air and sea transport.
The analysis we have presented in the White Paper has been debated in depth, also by the industry and the sectors mostly affected. Also by the Council.
In this regard, most of the measures proposed in the White Paper have been presented by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council.
Some have made significant progress, such as Galileo, accession to Eurocontrol, the creation of air and sea safety agencies - I will talk later about road safety, which Mr Sr. Izquierdo Collado has mentioned - including initiatives on working time in the road transport sector or the recent agreement in the Council on the single European sky and the Marco Polo programme.
With regard to the second rail package, the negotiations are at a very advanced stage and this Parliament expressed its opinion very clearly just a couple of months ago.
However, other important proposals are still at a preparatory stage, such as the trans-European networks.
As you know, despite the fact that this Parliament had expressed its support for the partial reform proposed by the Commission, the Council preferred to delay it and simply to go ahead with a more general revision.
Alright.
In this regard, I hope that the Van Miert Group, which is considering a global revision of the trans-European networks in view of enlargement, that is, a Europe of twenty-seven - because it includes the countries with which negotiations are either completed or at an advanced stage - will achieve a good result before the end of the Greek Presidency and that the document can therefore be presented during the Italian Presidency.
It should therefore also be discussed by this Parliament.
I would like to say that we are also at the final stage of the launch of the infrastructures package, which will contain three essential elements for the development of infrastructures: a methodology for charging - which Mr Izquierdo Collado mentioned a moment ago and which we discussed before the debate on the issue of ecopoints in Austria - as a preliminary stage before a directive on charging which will indicate how far the Council and this Parliament are willing to go on this issue and which lays down the forms, modes and limits.
Secondly, a system for incentivising public-private partnerships in the creation of infrastructures.
We need to incorporate private capital into the development of new infrastructures in order to speed up the implementation of these new infrastructures in a Europe of twenty-five - and soon of twenty-seven.
Thirdly, a European system of electronic pricing which furthermore will be accompanied by compatibility, in other words interoperability of practical, technical systems in the different countries of the European Union, with the medium-term aim of creating uniformity, establishing a single system based on the satellite control systems, that is, the Galileo system.
With regard to road safety, I am pleased to note that the honourable Members share the objective we have set of reducing the number of fatal road accidents by 50% by 2010.
The Commission has just adopted a proposal for a directive on the safety of tunnels and we will shortly present a global action plan in the field of road safety.
In this field, we will also present important proposals on the control of road transport in relation to the identification of motorway black spots.
I hope that these new measures will contribute to achieving this objective and they must be supplemented by measures established at national and local level, because here there is a very significant margin for subsidiarity.
In the field of maritime safety, ladies and gentlemen, we have held discussions for several years, following the tragic Erika accident, and again recently following the Prestige disaster.
However, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission can say that we have presented a coherent package of measures which enormously increase maritime safety in the European Union, which only need to be implemented, and that the remaining measures will be presented shortly. Some of them have already been presented, such as the timetable for the departure of single-hull oil tankers and their replacement by double-hull oil tankers, the requirement for safer and more modern oil tankers for the transport of the more polluting hydrocarbons and we will soon present issues such as criminal responsibility in the event of serious negligence.
We must insist on the maximum level of compensation funds in the event of pollution or in the proposals to promote with the countries of the Union modifications in the field of international maritime law, which is based on completely obsolete principles from the nineteenth century rather than the twenty-first century.
With regard to air transport, in 2003 we will concentrate our action on external relations, including the mandates for renegotiation of open skies agreements, which is an extremely urgent matter, beginning with the agreements with the United States.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have seen the proposals made by the rapporteur, in general terms, though I will discuss the different points in more detail later.
I believe we are working in the same spirit.
I hope that the approval of this Parliament, with the amendments it considers appropriate in a report on the White Paper, will help to speed up the measures being discussed, both in Parliament and in the Council, and that those yet to come will clarify the possibilities, the margins and the limits and will above all allow the discussion with this Parliament within this same mandate to be speeded up.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject for debate here is not simply a report on the transport of the future.
This is, in fact, one of the last ways out following a generation of production and mobility that has burnt itself out.
Who would still dare to speak of disaster-mongering or ill omens of charlatan ecologists on the environmental state of our planet, in the face of WHO studies which estimate the number of deaths caused by automobile exhaust emissions at 800 000 each year.
There is nothing we can do now other than try to curb the existing phenomena of environmental crisis.
What was urgent in a Union of Fifteen now becomes an imperative before a Union of Twenty-five, and any transport policy that failed to include the sustainable development aspect would be entirely ineffective.
The threats to our lifestyle are forcing us to instigate a genuine revolution in transport culture.
We have certainly realised this rather late, but now we are, at last, able to separate increases in transport volume from economic growth.
Far from previous traditions, this new transport deal should include environmental requirements first and foremost in its studies, place the transport-using citizen at the heart of its definitions and liase with NGOs in all of its deliberations.
Increasing urbanisation must go hand in hand with improving public transport.
For each new project, opportunities for intermodal connections between networks that already exist or are planned should be prioritised.
Furthermore, we must not oppose this new deal on transport in 2010 with financial quibbling.
An ambitious Community research and development programme must be carried out to counter noise pollution and harmful emissions in the transport sector and achieve the objectives of the Kyoto protocol.
In its report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy raised the issue of the impact of these kinds of pollution on human health.
Alarm bells are ringing everywhere, but that is no reason to simply announce that disaster is looming and cannot be averted.
We have progressed from realisation to warnings.
Now we must act.
Far from giving up, Commissioner, in the face of the ecological disaster that is forecast, the Union must change direction with regard to transport and require all agreements and programmes, and heaven knows there are many of them, to comply with environmental criteria.
Otherwise we are heading for a fall, with full knowledge of the facts.
Ladies and gentlemen, I now declare this debate suspended.
We will resume it at 9 p.m.
The next item is the communication from the Commission on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective to take account of enlargement.
Commissioner Schreyer has the floor.

Mr President, honourable Members, the Copenhagen summit was a great triumph, a success both for the new Member States and for the European Union, a success for all those who have worked for so many years to enable the enlargement to take place, adding the new Member States, the candidate countries in Eastern Europe, Malta and Cyprus.
It also made it possible to conclude negotiations on the financial package, which is not entirely straightforward.
With effect from their accession, starting in May 2004, the new Member States will be able to participate in all the support programmes funded by the European Budget.
Involvement in market measures will facilitate the promotion of agriculture.
Farmers will receive direct grants in aid, and the aid will be particularly important to farmers with small farms.
EUR 6.7 billion of Structural Fund resources are to be allocated to the financing of projects in the areas of employment, infrastructure, higher environmental standards and the improvement of transport routes.
The new Member States will participate to an increased extent in the research programmes, and in everything else - programmes to promote energy and the environment, student exchanges and the youth programme.
And, of course, progressively more and more staff from the new Member States will be working in and for the European Union in Brussels and Luxembourg.
And a new programme - an entirely new programme - is to be set up: the so-called Schengen facility, intended to co-finance controls at the external borders.
Financial planning will need to be adjusted in order to anchor these items of expenditure in the Budget.
What resulted from the Copenhagen negotiations was a balanced compromise between different interests.
The financial framework for enlargement remains within the framework fixed in 1999 by the Inter-institutional Agreement for the period 2000-2006.
Today, the Commission adopted its proposal for the adjustment of the Financial Perspective.
In it, the results of the Copenhagen negotiations are allotted to the individual headings.
At the same time, the Financial Perspective is adjusted in line with the prices current in 2004.
The Commission proposal on enlargement states that, when expressed in current prices, the resources for agriculture and the Structural Funds, for internal policies and administration amount in total to an increase in commitment appropriations of EUR 45 billion, an increase which is still within the Berlin framework.
To put it another way, the upper limits are being reduced by EUR 1.7 billion in comparison with the hypothetical upper limits in the Inter-Institutional Agreement for the period up to 2006.
At the heart of this, ladies and gentlemen, is the Commission's proposal relating to the category of pre-accession aid, category 7.
We propose that this be left unchanged.
In future, it is from this that pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania is to be paid, and we propose that these aid packages should, as against the 2003 amounts, be increased by 20%, 30%, and then, in 2006, by 40%, thus reaching, in 2006, an absolute maximum of EUR 1.4 billion.
I think that this considerable aid for both these states will then have the effect of enabling us to work intensively on helping them achieve their objective of becoming Member States of the European Union in 2007.
The Commission and the Council also propose that pre-accession aid for Turkey, funded up to now from the foreign affairs budget, should in future be funded from category 7.
We will shortly be presenting a proposal for a considerable increase in the aid given to Turkey.
I believe it to be in the common interest of the European Union that efforts at reform be strongly supported by resources for pre-accession aid.
A new category has to be created in the Financial Perspective for entering free-standing financial aid, the so-called lump sum transfers agreed on in Copenhagen, into future Budgets.
We propose that this category should similar in every respect to the adjustment of the Financial Perspective that was made when the EU was last enlarged by the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, when lump sums were also agreed on, thus requiring the insertion of a new category into the Financial Perspective as it stood at the time.
We in the Commission have decided on the following proposal as regards Cyprus: as the tables for enlargement agreed on at the Copenhagen European Council do not yet include feasible resources - in the form of financial aid - for Northern Cyprus, the Commission is now submitting to you two tables, one for the adjustment of the Financial Perspective with Northern Cyprus and one without it.
The significance of this in concrete terms is that, in the event of a political solution being found for Northern Cyprus, the whole process will not have to go back to the beginning and start again; instead, the adjusted table, with EUR 273 million more than that without Northern Cyprus, can become effective at once.
I believe, firstly, that this way of doing things sends out the right political signal and, secondly, that it is of course the simpler option from the procedural point of view.
In future, the Budget for the 25-Member European Union will no longer make any distinction between new and old Member States.
The next Budget, for 2004, can, in accordance with the proposal, amount to a maximum of 1.12% of gross national income - equivalent to EUR 115 billion - in commitment appropriations and 1.08% - that is to say EUR 111 billion - in payment appropriations.
In accordance with item 25 of the Inter-Institutional Agreement of 1999, this Commission proposal will now be debated and processed by both Parliament and the Council, as the Inter-Institutional Agreement states quite clearly that adjustment of the Financial Perspective in the course of any enlargement is a matter for a joint resolution by Parliament and the European Council.
The next trilogue is to be held as soon as next Thursday, when we will have the first opportunity to do interinstitutional work on the basis of the Commission proposal, in order to be able to create in good time the framework for the first Budget for a 25-Member European Union.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
We now have an opportunity for the Members present to put brief and precise questions as described in Rule 38.
We will follow the so-called catch the eye procedure.
That is always rather tricky if the President is short-sighted, but, as most of the usual suspects are present, it should work.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial effects are, of course, considerable, and so I would be interested to know to what extent the Lisbon Process - showing as it does the strengths and weaknesses of individual countries - has been taken into account in the planning, whether that will be shown in specific Budget lines and what strategies you are envisaging for this.
Mr RÃŒbig, the adjustment of the Financial Perspective does of course mean that we start by adapting the resources allocated to the new Member States to the categories in it.
That being so, your question relates to category 3 of the Financial Perspective, that of internal policies, including many individual programmes in support of the Lisbon process.
According to the Copenhagen resolution and the Commission proposal, the increase for internal policies will amount, in 2004, to a total of EUR 1.6 billion, then EUR 1.5 billion, then EUR 1.5 billion again, all at current prices.
Of these amounts, approximately EUR 1 billion per annum will be allocated to the traditional internal policy areas, that is to say, the category 3 programmes, and these resources will then be divided up between the individual programmes within the 2004 Budget procedure.
There will then, depending on the procedures, some of which will involve codecision, be a joint resolution on the extension of the financial framework in the individual programmes.
Mr President, this is really a debate for the initiated and we are using the twelfth language of the Community, the budget.
Commissioner, the Copenhagen figures, as I understand it, are budget figures, while what we are discussing now, in relation to your presentation, are financial perspective figures.
In other words, the financial perspectives - the headings - may be greater than the budgetary sums approved in Copenhagen.
Is this correct?
Is that what the Commission is going to say, that we should take the Copenhagen figures as a minimum and go further, in case the needs are greater than the Council's estimates?

Mr President, Mr Colom i Naval, the negotiations in Copenhagen were conducted in such a way as to result in the maximum amounts for enlargement; indeed, the Copenhagen resolution uses the word 'upper limits'.
It is again specified in the accession treaties that these are, as it were, the maximum amounts for the adjustment of the Financial Perspective.
Mr President, to follow on from that, the figures that we have been given - the Copenhagen figures - are actually lower than the figures provided subsequently.
Therefore, the Copenhagen figures could not have been maximum figures, since the figures that we have seen since are actually larger.
I would like to have the Commissioner's view of what will happen if the Council puts the Copenhagen figures into the accession treaties.
As you know, we will be discussing this next week with the Presidency in Athens.
But as a Parliament, we face the dilemma that the Council may put in these figures to make sure that we vote for the accession treaties.
If that is the case, what about Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement and what role will Parliament have in renegotiating or reassessing the financial perspective?
If the Council does that, how would the Commissioner assess the value of the financial perspective?
Mr President, the answer to Mr Wynn's first question, which related to the comparison between the figures incorporated in the Copenhagen resolutions and those tabulated in the Commission proposal, is that it has to be emphasised that all the negotiations in Copenhagen were conducted using 1999 prices, as we were guided by the Berlin resolutions, which were based on these.
Today, the Commission has also, at the same time, decided on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in 2004 prices, so this results in a difference.
Let me point out that we have also included Cyprus in one of the tables.
As far as your second question is concerned, I would like to say by way of reply that the 1999 Inter-Institutional Agreement was an agreement between all three institutions and so the Council, too, has to adhere to it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you are talking in terms of the method of calculation perhaps being defective, it is particularly category 3 that entitles one to ask whether the revision, which was obviously carried out using certain methods of estimation for the individual categories, might have given a rough ride to agreements in multiannual programmes set up by codecision, so that, where certain outgoings were agreed in the multiannual programmes, these methods of estimation might have a detrimental effect on decisions that had previously been taken in consultation with Parliament.
Before such figures are incorporated into the acts, then, one must therefore trace the reasoning behind the question as to whether and to what extent it is necessary to go much further in examining these matters in detail.
The answer given to Mr Colom i Naval's question obliges me to put a second one.
Where, in fact, does the Commission stand?
After all, it is perfectly clear that the tables and figures from Copenhagen are to be regarded as a minimum to be guaranteed only until such time as there is a policy on the basis of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
I would like to take this opportunity specifically to ask the Commission to do everything possible to prevent the Council from attempting to create precedents through the back door, and doing lasting damage to the institutional structure in matters of Budget law.
The procedure over the coming weeks will find the Commission also having to decide whose side it is on.
Mr BÃ¶ge, I cannot quite fathom what you mean by defective methods of calculation.
In Copenhagen, there were lengthy negotiations rather than calculations.
Figures were laid down for the internal policy areas as they were for the others, stating how much was allocated.
Let me also reiterate that there will be new programmes in the internal policy areas, the Schengen facility being one example.
None of the programmes that we have had in the 15-Member EU can be compared with it.
Even the programme specifically for supporting the decommissioning of atomic power stations is a new one.
In future, all the new Member States will of course be able to participate in the existing programmes - as indeed some of them already do - and approximately EUR 1 billion per annum has been allocated to the adaptation of these.
Further to your question about what is to be done in a situation where we have the Copenhagen resolutions on the one hand, the accession treaties on the other, and then, of course, the Inter-Institutional Agreement, which emphasises the need for a joint decision on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective, the Commission has constantly been committed to stressing this point to the Council.
This is again stated in the Copenhagen resolutions.
At that time the European Council stated that the Commission, in its proposal, had to take into account the table summarising the outcome of negotiations.
We now know that the results of the negotiations were not easily achieved.
The candidate countries, too, engaged in in-depth negotiations not only with regard to the amount to be spent, but also to the structure the expenditure should have.
I think this is something we have to respect.
It was for this reason, for example, that the Commission took on board these proposals and negotiation results as regards the amount of the Structural Funds in comparison with the lump sum transfers.
I consider it very important, and as a very good thing, that we will, as early as next week, have the opportunity to join with the Council in discussing how we should take matters further.
Commissioner, this is where I must again add something, as the fact of the matter will be that, when it comes to the accession treaties, this Parliament will have an approval procedure preventing us from saying anything more than yes or no.
These accession treaties are, of course, binding in international law, and they also stipulate sums of money that would ordinarily, had we dealt with them together and subject to the conditions of the Financial Perspective, have been decided on in the codecision procedure, so that we could have gained some influence over the negotiations.
If it is now assumed that the Copenhagen figures will be incorporated into the treaties and will be definitively laid down only in an approval procedure that is to take place very soon, there is, as you said, the de facto possibility of influencing the Financial Perspective in a codecision procedure involving the interested parties in the budgetary authority, or are we being thrown back on the 'do or die' position, in which we can only accept or reject?
This notwithstanding the fact that it would go against the overall thinking behind the modus operandi devised as long ago as 1999.
Now for my second question. You have announced your intention of creating a category of pre-accession aid that will, in future, include Bulgaria and Romania, and that aid will be increased.
Bulgaria and Romania have for the past ten years already been going through a quite specific process covering individual aspects such as the implementation of the acquis communautaire and other such things.
You have said that you have proposed that another state be included in this category of pre-accession aid, namely Turkey, which has not, to date, had a status comparable to that enjoyed by Bulgaria and Romania; nor are negotiations with Turkey anything like as far advanced as those with the other states.
Are you now putting these countries on one and the same footing?
Is the Commission proposing that we aim to give Turkey the same status as Bulgaria and Romania, and what can you adduce in support of this approach, involving as it does an assessment that goes far further than before?
If we are talking in terms of pre-accession aid - and we have, in the past, heard various things from various sources, including that President Prodi is an advocate of Croatia and other Balkan countries getting candidate country status - are these countries already included in the category 7 that you are now providing for, or, if not, how are we going to be dealing with them over the coming years?
Mr President, the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement also laid down the maximum by which the financial framework could be increased in the event of enlargement, and, to that extent, amounted to a limitation.
It was also the limitation within which the Commission proposal was drafted and the negotiations with the candidate countries were held.
I would, though, like to re-emphasise the fact that the judicial issue is of crucial importance as regards the significance of the approval of the accession treaties with their figures, as against the negotiations on the Inter-Institutional Agreement.
This is something to which we will have to give very careful attention in our discussion in next week's trilogue.
What has to be said about Turkey is that the Council has this year also adopted the proposal that Turkey should be included in category 7, thus becoming entitled to pre-accession aid.
We have a sort of pre-accession strategy where Turkey is concerned, and the legal basis on which category 4 aid - another very 'internal' debate - is paid includes precisely this expression, so that no new legal basis would be required to transfer Turkey - financially speaking - from category 4 to category 7.
Further to your question on the Balkans, I have this to say. As has, this year, emerged from many reports in the press, Croatia has decided to apply for membership of the EU.
It is now for the Council to consider what happens next; it will probably ask the Commission to examine the matter, with which request the Commission will of course comply.
It is not for us, at present, to consider whether another state is to be included in category 7.
I would, though, again like to point out that the Commission is proposing that category 7 be left unchanged and that adjustments be made to the financial programme for categories 1 and 2, covering agriculture, the Structural Funds, internal policies and administration to take account of enlargement.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
I would like to ask you to answer the questions from the next two speakers together.
Mr President, in Copenhagen categories 1 and 2 have been negotiated and in reality the internal and external policies have more or less been calculated.
Does this mean, following the explanations you have given, that the sums in categories 3 and 4 can be considered as indicative while the sums in categories 1 and 2 are established?
First of all, I should like to say that I, too, concur with what Mr Walter said.
Of course it is not very logical for the Copenhagen European Council to say that an evaluation will take place in 2004 as to whether or not Turkey can become a member, and whether or not the negotiations can begin, while at the same time saying that Turkey can be put in Category 7: the pre-accession category.
I have a question regarding heading 6 of the financial perspective.
If I have understood correctly, you have not said anything about this.
Has the Commission or the Council ever considered expanding the Guarantee Reserve in connection with the increased activities of the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, in the new Member States?
My second question is as follows: there was always a monetary reserve, which had to do with the CAP, and especially with those countries which were not members of the euro zone.
We are soon to be joined by ten countries, none of which is to be a member of the euro zone.
Is the monetary reserve now no longer necessary, and what are the reasons for this?
Mr President, I will take Mr Garriga Polledo's question on heading 4 first.
As you know, heading 4 was not on the agenda in Copenhagen, and as regards heading 3, there was the Commission proposal on the framework, as laid down in the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement, and there were the negotiations on the specific programmes that are now being brought in. As I said, they include the Schengen facility as well as the programme - which I consider to be of the utmost importance - to provide further help to build effective administrations, and the programme for decommissioning nuclear power stations.
Turning now to Mr Mulder's question about the monetary reserve, a decision was made in 1999 - and this is also laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement - to abolish the monetary reserve, which is why it no longer exists.
As far as the Guarantee Fund is concerned, the situation is that the Guarantee Fund has also had to be used to guarantee loans to the accession countries and for example for various EIB programmes.
Once the accession countries are Member States it will no longer be necessary to make the relevant guarantees available in the budget.
In other words, after enlargement the Guarantee Fund will have more scope to support loans to third countries.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0010/2003).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 36 by Didier Rod (H-0050/03):
Subject: Implications of tobacco advertising for Community competition policy
Following the statements to the press by representatives of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), it seems that the FIA is threatening not to allow any further Formula 1 races to take place at any track in the EU Member States because of the new European directive on tobacco advertising which the Member States are required to transpose in 2005 at the latest.
What conclusions does the Commission draw from this as regards competition law, particularly in the light of the agreements between the Commission and the FIA?
From the point of view of competition law, what is the Commission's view regarding the FIA's decision to leave it to the teams to decide whether to race or refuse to take part in races at tracks in Member States because of a law banning tobacco advertising during sporting events, in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice and the positions of the European Council, Commission and Parliament on sport?
Mr Rod has raised one of the most complex issues in the field of motor racing: the choice of Formula 1 circuits and the setting of the Grand Prix calendar.
According to the information we have at the moment, it was Mr Ecclestone himself, who represents the organisation responsible for promoting the Formula 1 championship, who declared publicly that the ban on sponsorship by the tobacco industry in the European Union, which is to come into effect before 2006, could lead to Formula 1 races being held outside the Union instead.
As regards the International Automobile Federation, Mr Rod is, of course, aware of the FIA declaration on the sponsorship of motor racing by the tobacco industry and an international agreement providing for an effective ban in 2006.
The FIA explains how Formula 1 races can be organised in France and the United Kingdom, even though these two countries have banned sponsorship by the tobacco industry.
In addition, the Commission has received a statement announcing the exclusion of the Belgian Grand Prix on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit from the 2003 championship calendar on the grounds, it would appear, that the Belgian law banning tobacco product advertising and sponsorship is to enter into force during the course of this year.
According to Mr Ecclestone's statement, it would appear that the Austrian Grand Prix in Spielberg will suffer the same fate as of 2004, the date of entry into force of a similar ban in Austria.
In terms of competition law, it is important for all the parties involved in the complex process of setting the Formula 1 championship calendar to stick to their own roles and responsibilities.
It would seem that the decision to organise Formula 1 races in one country rather than another is a question of economic considerations rather than legal considerations applying to motor racing.
The system developed by the various parties involved in Formula 1 racing through the agreements submitted to the Commission will continue to apply.
As regards the specific case of Spa-Francorchamps, the Commission is ascertaining whether Community competition law has been respected.
The Directive of the European Parliament and Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products, which was the subject of a political Council agreement in December 2002, provides for a ban as of 31 July 2005 on the sponsorship of events involving or taking place in more than one Member State or having other cross-border effects, including, of course, Formula 1.
The directive takes into account the fact that the laws of the different Member States on sponsorship linked to the promotion of tobacco products differ among themselves and that this could lead to distortion of competition.
The directive seeks to eliminate these problems and approximate the provisions on the subject.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your extremely clear response to this question.
We raised this question, which we consider to be important, because although today it concerns the circuit at Spa-Francorchamps, it will of course also concern others likewise affected by this directive on tobacco.
We personally, by the way, are strongly in favour of the directive banning tobacco advertising.
We feel it is very important for health problems to take precedence over the problems raised by banning tobacco advertising and we are extremely concerned about the International Automobile Federation's position in this regard.
As you emphasised, and as already discussed with Commissioner Byrne, the latter is currently examining the possibility of extending the ban on tobacco advertising worldwide, in other words, working with the WHO on this issue.
Naturally, the measures currently taken by the automobile federations are extremely worrying for those who are trying to limit any encouragement of smoking, which we all know is extremely harmful to health.
Furthermore, the automobile federations' measures will lead to distortions with regard to employment, and, in particular, in the field of sport, which will also be extremely damaging.
I would like to thank Mr Rod for his complimentary comments, which I do not believe require any further response from me.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the decision in principle to ban advertising for a product that is legally traded raises the question of what will happen in the future in competition law.
If further decisions are taken here to ban advertising for sweets, cars and other categories of products, we will be faced with a problem with the market economy itself.
You see, although these products are legal, it is not permitted to advertise them.
What impact do you think this will have on other sectors - alcohol, for example - which also make a substantial contribution to financing motor racing, for example?
This is a very interesting question, to which I will give a response which can only be brief and general.
What the Commission should do in terms of competition policy, on a case by case basis and in the situation you have imagined, Mr RÃŒbig, is see whether there have been specific violations of competition rules.
It is therefore not possible to give a general response; we would do so, if necessary, should specific circumstances arise.
Question No 37 by Anna Karamanou (H-0031/03):
Subject: Victim of sex abuse banned from leaving the United Arab Emirates
According to French press reports, on 15 October 2002 the authorities of the United Arab Emirates banned Touria Tiouli, a French citizen, from leaving the country.
The authorities of the Emirates have charged her with engaging in sexual intercourse outside marriage, which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of at least six months; this occurred after Touria Tiouli had herself lodged a complaint with the police that she had been sexually abused by three UAE nationals.
Does the Commission intend to apply pressure on the Government of the United Arab Emirates, in parallel with the efforts made by the French Government, to have the detained woman released and the men who raped her punished, bearing in mind that the protection of women's rights and the fight against sexual violence in particular are fundamental principles of the European Union?
. I want to make it absolutely clear that the Commission shares the honourable Member's indignation at the circumstances surrounding the detention of Ms Touria Tiouli.
She is a French citizen of Moroccan extraction, who has been held against her will in Dubai since 15 October 2002.
I have read the papers myself and I can well understand why the honourable Member has raised this issue.
The Commission is following developments extremely closely.
It is up to the competent authorities of the Member State whose citizen is affected to take all the necessary steps to support that citizen's cause.
As far as the Commission knows, the French Government is doing everything possible to put an end to this unfortunate situation.
The Commission is willing to lend its support should the French authorities consider it necessary and appropriate.
I can assure the honourable Member that we are reacting in the way the situation dictates, and that we will keep it under review.
Commissioner, I am partly satisfied with your reply; however, I was hoping that the Commission would use its authority to put pressure on the United Arab Emirates.
The good news is that the Emirates court has acquitted Mrs Tiouli of the accusations made against her by her rapists, but her troubles are not over yet because she still has to wait a fortnight from the date of the ruling.
The ruling was returned on 26 January; unless I am mistaken, that was a fortnight ago today and we are waiting to see if her passport will be returned so that she can leave the country.
I should like to ask you, Commissioner, if you intend to collaborate with the French Government and the French embassy in the United Arab Emirates and exercise the authority and powers you have as Commissioner of the European Union to put an end to the nightmare this French woman has been put through.
I can assure the honourable Member that it does not in any way detract from our concern about this case for me to describe once again the position we find ourselves in.
It is the competence of the French Government to decide how to handle an issue like this.
We stand ready to take any action within the European Union framework, if and when the French Government deems it appropriate.
We will therefore continue to follow this case, and if the French Government decides at any moment that it would be helpful for us to take action, we are prepared to do that.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the next questioner and the next Commissioner are not now in the Chamber and I am therefore going to stop the clock for 3 or 4 minutes so that Question Time can then continue.
Question No 38 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0054/03):
Subject: The MEDA Programme and women
In the context of Community funding for MEDA regional programmes and in the light of the conclusions of the Brussels Regional Forum held under the Belgian Presidency on 14 July 2001 on the role of women in economic development, the Commission was called upon to prepare the First Regional Programme for the participation of women in economic and social life and development.
Since then the Commission has not presented any specific proposals within the framework of this programme.
Can it give the reasons for such an unjustified delay?
Does it have any specific timetable which it intends to implement in 2003 to initiate this programme?
What are the principal orientations it wishes to give to this regional programme for women and what are the main needs it intends to meet?
I am delighted that the honourable Member is with us; it gives me an opportunity to answer a question about which I am concerned.
It must be said that my colleague, Commissioner Solbes Mira, is also very grateful that the honourable Member is with us since it gives him a couple of minutes to get down from the Commission meeting, which is still continuing.
Let me turn to the honourable Member's important question.
The Commission recognises the importance of enhancing the role of women in economic life in the partner countries around the Mediterranean.
That was why we welcomed and supported the meeting held in July 2001 on this subject under the Belgian presidency of the Council.
As a result of that meeting, the Commission included, among others, a regional programme on this subject under the MEDA Regional Indicative Programme for 2002-2004.
In the context of limited resources, the Commission has to make difficult choices among priorities.
Only about 10% of the MEDA programme is available for regional activities and this has to cover everything from supporting the rule of law and good governance to activities to promote regional integration and trade, plans for infrastructure interconnection and regulatory harmonisation, the dialogue of cultures and civilisations, support for judicial cooperation, the fight against organised crime and terrorism and activities related to migration.
In these circumstances, the programme on 'The role of women in economic life' has been programmed for the year 2004 within the Regional Indicative Programme, with funding of EUR 5 million.
In order to permit the launching of the programme in 2004, the identification and preparatory phase began in December last year and will end in April or May 2003 with a MEDA regional workshop.
In order to speed up the effective implementation of the programme, a call for proposals with a suspension clause will be published during the second half of 2003 on the basis of the results of that workshop.
The regional financing plan for 2004 should be presented to the Med Committee before the end of 2003 in order to permit the financing of the selected projects in the following year.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
I get the impression that, once again, you have said nothing new.
We know all about the programme from the Commission services; I wanted to ask if you believe that, what with the delays that have ensued and the tiny budget earmarked for this programme, the European Commission really is serious about the equal opportunities dimension and the participation of women in this ambitious and - to us - important plan of developing real Euro-Mediterranean cooperation?
Perhaps this programme, with its delays and miserly budget, is just an afterthought in the overall endeavour?
Do you believe that this commitment on the part of the Commission will suffice?
Should something more be done to integrate women economically, not just something more generous, such as small loans, proper jobs and training, but something to guarantee and fund mechanisms to monitor if these issues and challenges receive equal legal treatment?
I want to assure the honourable Member just how seriously we take this issue.
It is not just a question of focusing on this programme.
I am extremely keen, as we review our programmes for the future, to take on board the exceptionally important report which was recently produced by the UNDP.
The honourable Member may recall that the UNDP, under the direction of their distinguished regional director who is, as it happens, a woman, has drawn up a report trying to answer the question of why Arab League countries have not prospered as much as other comparable societies.
The answer to that question was clear: yes, there were problems of governance and the rule of law.
Yes, there were problems about education, but there was also a very substantial problem of undervaluing women and the gender issue as a whole in economic, as well as social life in those countries.
I am very keen that we should try to look at our programmes in the region through the prism of that report, which importantly was not written by Europeans or Americans, but by Arabs: Arab men and women, Arab policy-makers, Arab journalists, Arab academics.
They have given us an important wake-up call to look at these issues more seriously.
I can assure the honourable Member that I take them very seriously indeed and that the Commission takes them very seriously.
I am delighted that she has given me the opportunity of making that point - as are our subsequent questioners - and I am delighted that I have been able to speak at some length on it.
We will begin the second part of this Question Time, during which Commissioner Solbes will be replying.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Solbes
Question No 39 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0024/03):
Subject: Updated stability programme for Greece (2002)
In its conclusions on Greece's updated stability programme for 2002 (9 January 2003), one of the points the Commission makes is that, in a period of strong growth for the Greek economy, the pace of reduction in the public debt indicator is slow.
How does the Commission view the slow pace of reduction in public debt in Greece, despite the high rate of growth in GNP, which is mainly due to the third CSF and the Olympic games?
In the Commission's opinion, what will be the trend in Greek public debt after 2004, when it is probable that rates of growth in GNP will be lower?
The ratio of debt in Greece is one of the highest in the Community.
It increased up until the middle of the 1990s, reaching a peak of over 110% of GDP in 1996.
This was the result of increasing budgetary imbalances and low growth in GDP.
The stabilisation efforts with a view to participation in Monetary Union and the improvement in the main macroeconomic indicators have contributed to reducing the ratio of debt, although at a very slow rate.
The debt still represents 107% of GDP in 2001.
Three factors have influenced this development: the level of primary balance, that is, excluding financial payments, the nominal rate of growth of GDP and other autonomous or residual factors.
Notable amongst those are the financial operations which do not affect the budgetary balance but the volume of debt.
In fact, the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt, which reached 7.1% of GDP in 2001 - and is estimated as 4% of GDP in 2002 - meant that the evolution of the debt ratio does not entirely reflect the evolution of the budgetary situation of the public administrations, the achievement of increasingly high primary surpluses or the growth in GDP.
Furthermore, the evolution of public debt, as laid out in the Greek stability programme in 2002, has been partially affected by the review of the statistical methods used in different financial operations.
That review was carried out in accordance with the system established by Eurostat in order to comply with the conditions set in the ESA 95, in our European system of national accounts.
The statistical review which was carried out in 2002 led to an increase in Greece's debt ratio in 2001, which rose to 7% of GDP higher than the figure previously estimated.
Bearing in mind the new budgetary perspective arising from this review, the updated stability programme foresees a reduction in the debt ratio equivalent to 1.7% in 2002, forecasting an acceleration of this reduction after 2003, with a reduction of approximately 0.4% until the end of 2006.
In fact, from 2003, the modification of the debt ratio will correspond better to the level of primary surplus.
In accordance with the Commission's economic forecasts of last autumn, Greece's ratio of debt should decrease until the end of 2004, although at a slower rate than that forecast in the 2002 stability programme.
For the period following 2004, when the updated stabilisation programme allows a certain decrease in real production growth, it will be necessary to apply a credible strategy of budgetary adjustment in order to be able to guarantee this reduction in the debt ratio laid down in the programme.
In this regard, the greater transparency of the public accounts achieved as a result of their recent review has increased their credibility and also that of the strategy of budgetary adjustment, laid out in general terms in Greece's stability programme.
Mr President, my thanks first to you for your flexibility and my thanks to the Commissioner for his detailed reply.
However, when he talks of some sort of strategy to deal with any slowdown in GDP, what does he see as the main ingredients of such a strategy?
And how should any new factor, by which I mean the impact of a possible war with Iraq on GDP, be taken into consideration?
My reply will be very quick.
The strategy in the programme has clearly been drawn up without the assumption of a war in Iraq.
The strategy naturally anticipates an increase in the primary surplus and, to put it another way, using growth potential essentially in order to reduce taxes.
The problem of war is viewed in completely different terms.
It is not a scenario which I believe should be tackled at this point, but it is clear that the Stability and Growth Pact itself allows for the existence of exceptional circumstances and there is no question that war is one of these.
However, I believe it would be premature to consider at this point doing anything more in relation to this issue.
Question No 40 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0045/03):
Subject: Transfer of profits from Central Bank to State Treasury
On 17 May 2001, the Swedish Parliament decided that the Central Bank should pay an extra SEK 20 billion to the Swedish Treasury this year in addition to its normal payment of SEK 8.2 billion from its profits, which naturally broadened the scope for reorganising the national budget.
A similar transfer was made the previous year.
Would this type of transfer from the Central Bank to the Treasury have been possible if Sweden had been taking part fully in the third stage of EMU at that time?
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
The issue mentioned by the honourable Member was raised in the convergence report adopted by the Commission on 22 May 2002 and also in section 6.2 of the convergence report by the European Central Bank of 2002.
It should be observed that the comments of the Commission contained in its report stress the absence of detailed legislation on the financial transfers of the Central Bank to the Swedish Treasury, particularly in relation to the allocation of extraordinary benefits and payments.
That legislation should establish the rules and conditions for the carrying out of such transfers and should guarantee that the Riksbank conserves the financial resources necessary to comply with its obligations within the framework of the European central banks system.
In the absence of such rules, there is no adequate guarantee of the independence of the Central Bank and particularly its financial independence.
It should also be observed that the relevant requirements within the framework of the Treaty appear in Article 108 - the independence of the Central Bank - and in Article 109 - the compatibility of national legislation with the Treaty.
These articles apply both to the participating Member States and to the Member States with exceptions.
I would thank the Commissioner for that answer.
I should, however, like just one thing to be clarified in this connection.
I interpret the answer as saying that the Commission cannot accept, or considers incompatible with membership of the third stage of EMU, a situation in which large funds are transferred from the Swedish Central Bank's profits to the Swedish Treasury, as has been done by the Swedish Government.
We are talking here about a total of SEK 40 billion over two years.
I would ask you to confirm that this is a correct interpretation of what you have just said.
I believe that I have tried to be relatively clear in my reply.
The lack of precise rules on the way in which such transfers are carried out does not guarantee the independence of the Central Bank, a key element for participation in the Monetary Union.
That is my comment and that is the comment included in our report.
There is clearly time for implementation until participation in the Monetary Union, but this updating is essential for participation in it.
The essential point is to achieve financial independence, the key element for the independence of the institution.
Allow me first of all to say that the SEK 20 billion that Mr SjÃ¶stedt talks about could instead be used to reduce the Swedish national debt and in that way, of course, contribute to a stronger Swedish economy.
Moving on now to my follow-up question to the Commissioner: is it not shown by experience and by numerous scientific studies that an independent Central Bank and a common currency make a major contribution to strengthening the economy and, in that way, increase people's real wages and purchasing power; or, in other words, broaden the scope for the reform mentioned by Mr SjÃ¶stedt in his question?
Very briefly, as you know, the decisions relating to the use of resources fall to each of the national authorities.
The Commission is obliged to verify compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and that means monitoring decisions affecting stability programmes, or, in this case, the convergence programme.
The problem you raise goes a step further.
It is the problem of public finances, where revenue should be used and what type of expenditure we should carry out.
We have obviously produced certain reports on this type of decision, but nevertheless they are not of a binding nature, but they are simply an approximation of how we believe certain decisions should be managed.
The fall in coffee prices is indeed catastrophic.
I think we are all aware of the impact of these price changes on coffee-growers, which, as we have known for a long time, is only one stage of a general problem, namely the dependency of poor countries on a few basic products.
We have carefully noted the figures sent to us by Oxfam, which address in particular this vast difference between the retail price in supermarkets and the sum paid to growers.
We have not assessed all this and we are not in a position to say whether the trade margins applied by one company or another are reasonable, taking account of processing costs, transport costs and retailers' profit margins, amongst other factors.
This being the case, if non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam consider, for example, that the practices of certain companies might need to be subjected to an enquiry pursuant to competition rules - I am referring here to the European Union - they should provide us with the necessary evidence so that we can proceed as we normally do in this type of case.
What is the cause of this collapse?
It is quite simply a considerable imbalance between supply and demand.
What can we do?
It is a complex, multi-faceted issue.
We can, for example, help those who have invested in fair trade and are thereby trying to help producers in the poorest countries to obtain a higher proportion of the price paid by the end consumer.
In the Commission, we already help, support and fund various actions in this field.
We support, and I do so within the context of trade policy, projects aimed, for example, at the adoption of codes of conduct or social labels.
In this way, if I may say so, we support all those who have invested in fair trade.
In the long term, however, diversification is probably the key that will make it possible to reduce dependency and vulnerability among these countries and peoples in the face of fluctuations in basic products.
That is part of an integrated approach between development policy and trade policy, on which, as you know, we have already been working for several years, with Mr Nielson.
We are trying to achieve better coordination of the various instruments available to us.
For example, we began with the 'Everything but arms' initiative, which allows a number of countries among the poorest in the world to diversify their exports.
This is a policy that we have, if I may say so, supported and passed on, moreover, to various international organisations such as the World Bank.
We are also working along these lines in applying the Cotonou Agreement.
In addition, we have supported, within the International Coffee Organization, all the actions undertaken to improve quality and set minimum quality standards, thereby removing the poorest quality coffees from the coffee market, since these, as we know, have also had an adverse effect on prices.
More simply, we are currently working with a number of NGOs and Oxfam, in particular.
We have made contact with the main coffee merchants and we are in contact with a number of distributors.
We are open to constructive ideas on this matter, which, I repeat, is complex.
In any case, that is an example that should give pause for thought to those who advocate the total liberalisation of all agricultural markets.
Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Lamy for his answer.
I shall convey this to the NGO Intermon-Oxfam in the terms in which the Commissioner has expressed it to Parliament.
Question No 42 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0039/03):
Subject: Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)
Is the Commission aware that there is an ACP perception that, thus far, the EPA negotiations have an inadequate development focus?
What practical measures can be implemented which would be likely to convince the ACP that the objective of the negotiations is about more than just trade liberalisation?
Mr President, Mrs Kinnock's question concerns the progress of our negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries on economic partnership agreements.
These economic partnership agreements are part of an initial discussion stage.
They logically follow what was agreed at Cotonou and we are trying to ensure that our ACP interlocutors reorganise themselves into sufficiently large groups to remedy the current situation.
This situation, roughly speaking, is as follows: we gave them - or granted them, as we used to say - significant trade preferences, which, moreover, are causing problems for other countries as we have seen within the WTO, and they are not taking enough advantage of these preferences.
We must therefore change this.
Throughout this process, therefore, what is guiding us is the development aspect and we clearly intend, in this matter, to make trade considerations dependent on developmental considerations, taking account of the fact that this is our priority with the ACP countries as a whole.
I would therefore reassure Mrs Kinnock on this point, if that is needed.
It is not that businessmen hungry for access to extraordinarily attractive markets have taken control of these negotiations. The negotiations continue to follow the lines of what was agreed with Parliament and with the Council, in other words prioritising development.
It should, however, be recognised - and it may well be that Mrs Kinnock's question reflects this - that many ACP representatives still have reservations with regard to these negotiations on regional economic partnership agreements.
Many ACP countries are indeed asking us questions, for example on the degree of liberalisation or reciprocity we intend to achieve, as if that were the main objective of these agreements.
I will repeat, as many times as necessary, that the main objective of these agreements is not to open up the ACP markets further to Community products.
These economic partnership agreements are not, to our minds, simply free-trade zones that are nothing more than instruments for trade.
We want to make this a business, a process, a partnership to serve the development of these countries themselves, in particular in allowing us to address the problem of the many internal barriers to trade that still exist both in Africa and in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and also in allowing us to address the restrictions affecting the competitiveness of these regions, in order to turn them into poles of economic development.
We have also launched relevant studies on this point - we call them impact and sustainability assessments - to analyse the social, economic and environmental effects of these agreements which - I would remind you - are, first and foremost, agreements between these countries themselves, and we shall ensure that the results of these studies are taken into consideration throughout the negotiations.
I would also point out that we have made available to the ACP countries the financial resources necessary to enable them to carry out their own analyses and acquire the necessary technical assistance.
That is where we are up to in the negotiation process, which is in its initial stage, which we would like to extend to a second stage from September this year.
We have established various contacts with various ACP regions and we all know that some of them are more prepared to liase with us than others.
As far as they are concerned, they have choices to make within the ACP group.
We do not intend, and I do not intend, to make these choices for them.
We shall liase with them when they are ready and those that are ready first will begin discussions with us when they decide to do so.
Thank you Commissioner for acknowledging that you understand that there are these perceptions on the part of the ACP negotiators.
They could be based upon the fact that your representative said in a recent meeting that the EPA negotiations were not about development, but about negotiating new trading arrangements, and that was the mandate.
That might be at the root of the kind of perception they have.
The South Africans managed to get agreement that their trade negotiations would be renamed 'trade and development' negotiations.
That was a key element in the success of those negotiations.
Would you consider renaming?
Would that not be an act of good faith with the ACP?
There also seems to be resistance to making development an agenda item of the negotiations.
Would you confirm whether this is, or is not, the case?
Is it then the case that because you are not prepared to have it as an agenda item, that again confirms the perception that you are not willing to consider development as an integral part of these negotiations because you see it as giving the ACP more leverage in the negotiations as they go on.
In response to Mrs Kinnock, I think that feelings on the rhythm and perspectives of these agreements vary according to the regions we are talking to.
I do not want to go into detail here, but I know some regions within the ACP group that are ready to start negotiations tomorrow.
The objective of these negotiations must be sufficiently clear in their minds if this does not pose a problem for them.
With regard to the title, I find 'economic partnership agreement' perfectly appropriate.
It means that these are not only trade and free-trade agreements between the EU and the ACP countries, but also economic partnership agreements with the main aim, and I insist on this point, of leading the member countries of the ACP group to conclude trade agreements with each other in terms of investment, intellectual property, transport, infrastructure management and laying down standards, in order to establish economically-relevant zones themselves.
Is development the objective of these negotiations?
Yes, of course, but development cannot be negotiated, whereas trade can.
That is why we are introducing certain elements of trade negotiations, while keeping development as our objective and starting, as I said earlier, from a simple observation on which I believe you will agree with the Commission: the situation we have experienced for 20 years, based on granting unilateral preferences to these countries, is not, for a number of reasons, bringing about the transformation of this trade liberalisation, which we decided unilaterally, into a genuine instrument for development.
The relationship between trade and development is not that simple: in particular, the ACP countries must work together to create markets that are large enough to interest investors.
In any case, I assure you, this is a trade negotiation in which our objective is to make a better, more active contribution to development in these countries than we have in the past.

Question No 44 by Richard Howitt (H-0058/03):
Subject: Request from Thailand and the Philippines for preferential access to the EU for their canned tuna
In response to requests from Thailand and the Philippines to be granted preferential access to the EU for their canned tuna, the WTO Deputy Director-General submitted recommendations in December 2002.
If agreed and implemented by the EU, the recommendations will cause serious prejudice to the export of canned tuna of the ACP States and the Andean Pact countries.
Does the Commission agree that the provision of any preferential access to Thailand and the Philippines will displace ACP and Andean Pact countries' imports into the EU, thereby threatening the livelihoods of poor fishermen and EU investments in the ACP States with whom the EU has concluded 16 bilateral fishing agreements to access fishing resources in their waters?
Can the Commission confirm that it will not accede to the recommendations of the WTO mediator, but will instead examine the whole issue in the context of the ongoing WTO Doha round where a more balanced result can be achieved to the satisfaction of all the parties?
Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
, Mr President, Mr Howitt's question refers to the commitment made by the Commission at the time of the Doha negotiations to examine a request that was very firmly presented to us by Thailand and the Philippines concerning the pricing system applicable to imports of canned tuna from the ACP countries.
Very roughly, in summary, we apply to the ACP countries preferences that are not applied to Thailand and the Philippines, and these two countries considered it appropriate, at a time when we were trying to obtain WTO agreement for a general derogation concerning all these preferences, to make their own agreement conditional upon negotiations with us.
We accepted this request, mainly for the benefit of the ACP countries since their preferential system with us could only be validated by the WTO if we accepted the request.
We undertook to hold discussions with Thailand and the Philippines and, if necessary, to enter into a mediation procedure.
I repeat, to make this very clear, that, without this discussion/mediation procedure, the WTO derogation concerning the Cotonou Agreement would not have been obtained.
We therefore went ahead with these discussions with Thailand and the Philippines in December 2001, January last year and spring last year.
They did not lead to an agreement.
The demands regarding access to our market made by these countries seemed excessive to us at the time, and the offers we made seemed insufficient to them at the time.
We all, therefore, asked the World Trade Organisation for mediation last autumn.
In December, the mediator ruled and recommended that the Community open up a quota of 25 000 tonnes of canned tuna at an import duty rate of 12%, given that the normal rate, if I may say so, is 24% and the ACP rate is 0%.
So, ACP 0%, normal rate 24%, mediator's proposal 25 000 tonnes at 12%.
The Commission is in favour of the adoption of these recommendations.
We feel this is a matter of credibility and trust, and a way to manage our relations with a number of trade partners within the WTO mechanism.
We believe that recourse to mediation in this type of case is an honest procedure, that, in a way, it places on an equal footing mammoths such as the European Union and smaller creatures such as Thailand or the Philippines, and that this is part of our way of viewing our trade relations with a number of countries, in particular developing world countries.
We have analysed the mediator's recommendations and our analysis is that the quota of 25 000 tonnes in question will not have a significant impact on imports from the ACP countries or on imports from other countries which also benefit from generalised preferences.
I am thinking in particular of a number of Latin American countries.
This quota would represent approximately 9% of total imports of canned tuna in the Union and 4% of the total consumption of the Union.
Community imports of canned tuna from the ACP countries have undergone a significant rise over the past few years.
They currently represent approximately 60% of global imports and, given the very close, and often very welcome links between the industry in the ACP countries and certain sectors of the Community industry, we do not consider that imports from the ACP countries are seriously threatened by this mediation.
That is why we are supporting it and we have proposed the adoption of the mediator's opinion in the Council of Ministers.
Depending on the result of this consultation, we will shortly present a draft regulation to implement this quota.
I should like to thank Commissioner Lamy for that full answer.
I have three supplementary questions.
Firstly, although he was admirably clear, it would be clearer to us and to everyone if we knew the timetable for agreement in the Council of Ministers and what will happen if there is no agreement by qualified majority voting.
In relation to that, he kindly invited me and others to his Conference on Impact Assessment last week.
It was an extremely good conference, but a single statement will not have a major impact on the ACP.
It will need some backing up.
With Senegal responsible for 8 000 tonnes of imports and Ivory Coast 41 000 tonnes, the ACP believe they can be very seriously affected.
Finally, with regard to the earlier answer to a question from my colleague, Mrs Kinnock, about our obligations under the Cotonou Agreement to extend market access for ACP countries in terms of the trade negotiations, does this not fly in the face of those promises and call into question our commitment to development in those countries?
In response to your three questions, Mr Howitt, I shall begin with the timetable.
We are currently in contact with our Member States on a technical level.
I believe we shall achieve the necessary qualified majority.
If that were not the case, I would have to decide whether or not to take it further.
That happens from time to time.
It is a question of credibility for us.
The ACP countries were well aware, when we were together at Doha, why and how this derogation had to be obtained in order to cover our preference system, including on delicate issues such as bananas.
They are therefore fully informed of this.
Everything took place transparently.
Neither the Philippines nor Thailand have hidden their aim in this matter from the ACP countries, namely to benefit from a market share that they feel should logically be theirs.
Therefore, nobody was taken by surprise, and when we agree to mediation, we should - I believe that is the rule of the game - accept the results.
With regard to the impact on trade with the ACP countries, the reason why we consider that the impact would be minor is that this concerns canned tuna and, as you are no doubt aware, there is a slight difference between canned tuna and tuna not in cans: it lies in the industrial process, which takes place in networks and according to methods that closely involve our Community industry.
We feel that some water will have passed under the bridge before the Philippines or Thailand obtain this kind of comparative advantage, and therefore there is no serious threat in this respect.
That said, if any of the ACP countries wishes to discuss these technical aspects with us, we are fully prepared to do so.
Lastly, the third question: does this involve a derogation, a change from the market access commitments we made with regard to the ACP countries?
No, of course not.
This is not a change.
It in no way alters the preferences.
Quite simply, let us not forget that, had we not accepted this way of working with Thailand and the Philippines, the Union's entire system of trade preference regarding the ACP countries would have suffered.
That is what is behind this matter, and we should all remember this in order to evaluate fairly the results that are on the table today.
Mr President, the Commission has carried out a detailed impact assessment which is based to a large extent on information provided by the International Confederation of Temporary Work Businesses (CIETT), and on arguments put forward in a study which it prepared.
In assessing the impact of the proposal, it is also necessary to take into account the substantial degree of flexibility offered by the proposed directive.
Exemptions from the principle of non-discrimination are possible.
These include exemptions, for objective reasons, on the basis of collective agreements, and in cases of agency workers with open-ended contracts.
These exemptions and derogations are particularly important given the current heterogeneity of the sector.
The flexibility and diversity they offer make it impossible to come up with simplistic conclusions regarding the possible cost and benefits of the directive.
Despite these difficulties, the Commission has carried out a qualitative analysis of the possible impact of the Directive, based on all available information.
The following conclusions are very important in this respect.
Firstly, on the whole, the actual changes required by the directive should be very limited because it mostly codifies rules which are already common practice and are enshrined in national legislation, collective agreements or codes of conduct.
Secondly, even in cases where some changes may be required, the actual effect will be mitigated by the flexibility offered by the directive.
Thirdly, any cost induced by the directive would therefore remain very limited, and the proposed directive will be an important factor in the creation of an appropriate legal framework for the continued expansion of the agency sector.
In conclusion, the Commission considers that the proposal will help to realise the full employment potential of the sector in Europe.
It will improve the social acceptance of temporary agency work and will make it more attractive.
This point has also been underlined by the CIETT in its own study.
The availability, in particular, of workers with higher qualifications and more diversified skills will encourage more enterprises to employ temporary workers.
This will allow agencies to recruit their workers from a larger pool of candidates and to expand into new areas.
Lastly, as regards the United Kingdom, it is important to mention the regulatory impact assessment by the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK.
It estimates that the directive will have a positive effect on total employment and on temporary agency workers' productivity.
It also recognises that it could result in greater job security for agency workers and an increase in the attractiveness of agency work.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for that interesting reply.
However, I would like to put to her that in the real world, a Confederation of British Industry survey of over 200 companies in the United Kingdom, which has more temporary agency workers than any other country, indicates that her directive will result in 60% of these companies employing fewer temporary workers.
I also want to put to her the results of that survey which show that 40% of people entering temporary work come from the pool of long-term unemployed and 40% get permanent jobs within a year.
I would like her to tell me how her position on this directive and those findings square with the report from the Commission and the report that has just come out and which states that 'without additional efforts, the Union looks set to miss its employment rate target for 2005'.
I must point out to her that the UK already meets the 70% employment rate target.
How can her stance on this directive, and its practical application among businesses that employ temporary workers, in any way be squared with the target to reduce unemployment across the European Union?
It simply does not make sense.
As the Commissioner for Employment she must take notice of what people are telling her.
First, may I say - and I imagine you will agree - that the real world exists in every country, not just Great Britain.
It is not true that Great Britain has more temporary workers than any other country.
It has 3.2%, compared with 4.6% in Holland, 2.5% in France and far fewer in Germany.
This particular market, the agency work sector, is a law unto itself, but we can see from our analysis of each country that, in countries such as Holland which use exactly the same system as in the directive, not only are there no problems; the sector is becoming more and more dynamic.
In the United States of America, it is highly profitable and attracts a great deal of investment.
So we have a model that does not increase payment costs.
There is no interference whatsoever on our part in workers' take-home pay; all we are doing is securing their minimum rights and we can see that, so far, this model has been a success in the two countries in Europe which have applied it.
This legislative intervention affects a very small number of workers at present - 1.5% throughout Europe.
However, what is important is that it introduces a framework which secures minimum workers' rights for the future development of this sector.
Our research shows that this sector has a very poor reputation in the labour market because often the workers used do not enjoy even basic rights; they have no protection, they have no pension rights and they have no insurance rights.
If minimum rights - no more and no less - were protected, it would become a dynamic sector.
That is the view taken by Confederation itself.
As I said at the beginning, the CIETT has surveyed these agencies, which believe that a broad legislative framework will give better results and enlarge the market.
I can even quote figures to support this:
The most recent CIET? study concluded that, with the right legislative framework and with basic insurance for workers, these agencies could be employing 6.5 million people by 2010. That represents an increase of 4 million people.
I repeat, I shall be using the assessment by the agencies themselves, not just the Commission's assessment.
I am intrigued by your replies, Commissioner.
Firstly you say that a lot of your evidence is based on what CIETT has said to you.
Certainly CIETT have said to me that they are appalled by this directive, and I will be having further conversations with them on the basis of your reply today.
You also say how temporary work is flourishing in the Netherlands.
My information is that the temporary work sector in the Netherlands has declined since their domestic law changed.
The Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers, the VNO-NCW, wants to reintroduce flexibility.
It has had several meetings with me asking whether I can get further support for my amendments in that respect.
You say that the directive is based upon all available information.
Last week, Birmingham City Council, one of the major local authorities - not just in my region but in the whole of Europe - said that it will be reviewing its use of temps which currently cost EUR 20 million per year.
We are talking about thousands of jobs.
The reason for its review is your directive.
In the light of this latest evidence, will you agree to review once again this damaging directive before it does more damage to employment prospects throughout the European Union?
As you know Mr Bushill-Matthews, before the Commission made this particular proposal, this directive was the subject of discussion between the trades union and employers.
Neither the trades union nor employers are happy with the present directive, because it tries to strike a balance between creating a real incentive to employ temporary workers while abiding by the basic European principles and minimum protection for workers enshrined in the Treaty.
We have not added so much as a comma over and above the minimum protection for workers.
You said my evidence is based on what the CIETT has said to me.
I have not had any discussions with or received any verbal information from the CIETT; we used their study and written documents but I would be more than happy to discuss anything at all with them.
I am open to any information they may have to give me.
In Holland, the fact is that I have spoken to these agencies, which are developing rapidly and which, apart from a brief recession two years ago, are doing good business.
You referred to a cost in Great Britain which, of course, I can neither corroborate nor assess at this point in time; I imagine you are referring to the cost of insuring these people.
And, of course, I cannot argue, I cannot talk about no insurance, about no pension rights or any such contributions that have to be paid.
But apart from that, as far as payment is concerned, the directive does not interfere at all, it does not call for any sort of equivalence, except where the worker replacing the person off work has exactly the same qualifications, exactly the same seniority and exactly the same number of years' experience.
Only then does it call for identical working conditions and this, of course, is highly complicated.
However, I am more than willing to discuss the individual elements with any agency at all.
Question No 46 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0902/02):
Subject: The demographic challenge, families and work
In Sweden, the number of people written off sick has soared in recent years and there are also signs of a disturbing trend in other Member States.
At the same time, the birth rate in Europe is at a record low. Over the next 50 years, therefore, the population in Germany, Italy and France, for example, will decrease dramatically.
An ageing population creates a strain on the economy to provide pensions and a social safety net.
The EU summit held in Stockholm in March 2001 identified the demographic challenge as one of the Union's priorities for the future.
What lessons can be drawn from this serious trend and what initiatives has the Commission taken to foster a more integrated view of family formation, childbirth, the demographic challenge, rising numbers of sick notes and sustainable pension schemes?
Meeting the demographic challenge is one of the main problems facing the countries of Europe.
Naturally, any demographic policy has to be a combination of individual policies and economic and social incentives, most of which come under the Member States and their jurisdiction.
I should like to comment on European added value in this sector, given that the demographic problem is a problem which besets each individual country and Europe as a whole, where the population is both ageing and falling in numbers.
There are two parts to this problem.
First, the population is ageing and has a longer life expectancy; that people are living longer is a good thing and is due to better living conditions and medical care, but it calls for special policies to manage this ageing population.
In this sector, the sector of the ageing population, the European Union has important policies on public spending and on how to improve public spending and link it to health care, pensions and, of course, employment policies.
I would remind you here that the open method of coordination on employment, on poverty and exclusion programmes and on pensions is geared towards older workers; this is one of its basic lines of approach.
The second set of policies is designed to reinforce the family so that people can have more children, given that numerous countries have a very low birth rate.
It includes legislation, especially legislation to support parents with young children and basically help them reconcile working and family life, policies on gender equality and women's access to the job market - remember families often have serious financial problems - and of course social policies, especially social infrastructures.
Social infrastructures are the responsibility of the Member States, but I would remind you that, first, they receive a great deal of funding under the Community Support Framework in connection with employment and, secondly, the first specific targets were set in Barcelona a year ago, when all the Member States undertook to provide 95% of children between the age of 3 and 6 with a place in a state or private nursery by 2010.
This will do a great deal to help families.
I wish to thank the Commissioner most sincerely for her answer.
Might Commissioner Diamantopoulou be interested in actually having, parallel to the growth targets, ongoing statistics concerning the birth trend in the European Union?
Building a family is the great project of people's lives, and one which I got to experience myself during the nineties.
I believe we must do everything to express the positive attitude merited by the birth of children and the advent of a new generation here in Europe, signalling the vigour of our countries.
Yes, we are concerned here with economic needs, but we are also in actual fact concerned with joie de vivre and the spirit of the future within the EU.
Parallel to having growth targets set, might the Commissioner see herself using statistics in order very carefully to monitor the birth trend in Europe?
It was an oversight on my part in my first speech that I omitted to mention the fact that one of the Commission's basic jobs is monitoring demographic developments and this is presented in the annual social report supported by the European Observatory on the Social Situation, Demography and Family, which funds important studies.
This report, which maps the situation in Europe in the form of highly detailed statistics, refers to the indicators you mentioned on the number of births in each country, the number of births in each region and the ratio between immigrants and the population in each country.
These are detailed, accurate statistics which map the situation in Europe from one year to the next.
Commissioner Diamantopoulou, I too am very much in favour of increasing the birth rate in the European Union, as, moreover, is the Italian Government.
Indeed, Mr Maroni has announced that a law which has just entered into force will provide incentives for young couples.
I tell my pensioners to do what they can to increase the number of babies born too, and they have assured me that they will do their best.
The question I would like to put to you now is as follows. Do you think that just increasing the birth rate will be enough to resolve the problem of pensions and the huge number of elderly people, or is it not equally important to create new jobs?
As long as there are unemployed people, the existence of more young people will not solve the problem of the elderly: there will just be an ever-increasing number of young people who are unemployed, who are unable to pay for the pensions of the elderly.
Would it not be better to have more jobs as well as more babies?
I am afraid, Mr Fatuzzo, that if we link the number of new jobs to the number of births, we shall be in for some very unpleasant surprises.
All I need say is that, even if the birth rate increases significantly in Europe and even if the number of immigrants doubles, Europe's population will still not stabilise and its numbers will continue to fall.
Consequently, the demographic problem really is a burning issue for governments; as far as the labour market is concerned, a larger population obviously also makes for a more dynamic economy.
The example of the United States, where the population is expanding fast as immigrants integrate, is an important example.
So it is vital for us to realise that the situation as it is today will create serious problems on the existing job market, where we look set to have a shortage of workers under 30 from 2030 onwards.
Consequently, irrespective of how intensively we need to act on the problem of employment, and you are quite right that we need to create more and more jobs, we also need to act directly to increase the population of Europe.
Firstly, it is a great pleasure to have the Commissioner here.
I have been listening to the debate on the television in my office and I heard your answers to my colleagues.
I want to follow up on Mr Fatuzzo's question because it is in my report on information and communication technology and its impact on SMEs.
I hope you will agree with one of the recommendations I made in the report, which is that there are many older people who have retired at 55-plus who would be delighted to return to employment if there was some financial incentive for them to do so.
Information and communication technology is an area where we could use them, if there were financial incentives to train them.
Afterwards, if they were working, it would be important not to tax them on their income because they have a pension as well.
This would have two impacts.
Firstly, it would allow older people to work and still use their skills.
Therefore their disposable incomes would have an impact on rural economies because they would tend to spend that income.
Secondly, we would not be so dependent on imported labour.
Obviously a high birth rate is a good thing, but it would take years before this was reflected in the labour force.
My recommendation would provide a quick solution.
I should like to hear the Commissioner's view on it.
I agree that, at the moment, we urgently need to integrate workers over 55 years old into the European labour market.
The figures are indeed worrying.
Only 37% of people over 55 are still in work in Europe.
Early retirement has been used as a restructuring mechanism in most countries for years now.
It has put a large number of people out of work and of course, as the information society restructures, older workers are the first to go.
When we analyse pension systems and their problems, we generally talk of the need to increase the retirement age.
This is an economic approach which numerous countries need to take; at the same time, however, we cannot increase the retirement age unless there are specific policies and incentives, as you said, for these people to enter the labour market, which is why, at European level at least, one of the main priorities in our Employment Strategy and in our recent review of this strategy has been the over-55s.
Under the Barcelona target, every country undertook to have 50% of the over-55s in work by 2010.
Every country also undertook to include a percentage of over-55s in training and in training and lifelong learning policy; in other words, there will be incentives in the form of tax relief or subsidies to encourage these people to go back to work.
Of course, there is the major social sector you referred to, where you do not have full employment but you offer social services with certain specific incentives.
This is the active ageing policy we constantly support and which is included in our guidelines.
Question No 47 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0014/03):
Subject: Women's access to the armed forces and sexual harassment
With reference to Directive 2002/73/EC
It is my pleasure to be here, particularly when the discussion is so interesting and there are so many participants.
The provisions of the recently adopted Directive 2002/73/EC define for the first time, in a binding Community text, harassment on the basis of sex and sexual harassment as discrimination in the work place and, therefore, prohibit them.
Moreover, Member States have to take the necessary measures to encourage employers to prevent harassment and sexual harassment in the work place.
These provisions concern the private and public sectors and include the armed forces.
The new directive reinforces protection for victims of discrimination based on sex with specific provisions reflecting the case-law of the Court.
In order to comply with the provisions of this directive, all Member States, including Spain of course, will have to take implementing measures and bring them into force by 5 October 2005 at the latest.
By this date, these measures, including those on harassment and sexual harassment, should also cover the armed forces.
Member States should guarantee by this date that all necessary measures have been taken to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex in all matters covered by this directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for this reply, which is genuinely useful, and in view of it I do not know what action we can take to urge the Minster for Defence in Spain to deal with certain serious cases of rape and sexual assault, such as that of soldier QuiÃ±oa in the army.
Because a year ago now the Minister promised in the Spanish Parliament to fulfil certain commitments to speed up these cases, but has not done so.
There is a serious legal vacuum, however, because these sexual assaults are dealt with within military jurisdiction as abuses of authority and not as violations of human rights, which is what they are.
Commissioner, what measures could we take to encourage the application of this directive?
I would very much like some measure to be taken in this regard.
Perhaps a letter addressed to you which could be communicated to the Spanish Minister for Defence so that he may deal with this case of soldier QuiÃ±oa could have an effect, because for more than two years the victim has had no posting, relegated within the armed forces, while her rapist, lieutenant IvÃ¡n Moriano, is in the army, he is a persistent offender, and no measures have been taken.
This is a serious case of sexual assault within the army which is yet to be dealt with.
It is also a European issue, Commissioner, because I have investigated and there are other cases throughout Europe.
Therefore, if you will allow me, I would address a letter to the Commissioner which explains this issue, Mr President, and which you could communicate to the Minister for Defence, Mr Trillo, who should deal with this serious problem.
Mr President, because the directive has yet to be implemented, the Commission cannot operate in an effective way.
I believe that it is very important to tell the minister about a very specific instrument that he can use before the implementation of the legislation.
This instrument is the code of practice of the Commission, annexed to the Commission's 1991 recommendation.
It is a code of practice concerning the need to prevent sexual harassment or harassment in the workplace.
It envisages specific policy measures.
These include informing workers, communicating to workers the main messages; training them; training the middle managers on this issue and then taking responsibility.
The employer must take the responsibility for creating an environment which prevents sexual harassment.
The employer must give the employee the opportunity and the right to complain and to discuss with a particular person in management his or her particular problem.
They can put in place these first steps to prepare the armed forces for the implementation of the directive.
It will be a pleasure for me to send the code of practice to the minister.
It may be helpful to the armed forces in Spain.
We cannot ask any more questions, Mr Moraes, unless you ask a supplementary question to the question by Mrs Izquierdo.
A supplementary question.
I know the Commissioner has a personal commitment to anti-racism and the Article 13 package.
It is kind of her to take this supplementary question.
Very briefly, the Commissioner was unable to attend the UN World Conference on Racism but her commitment was conveyed there.
The concern amongst NGOs and many other players in this Article 13 package is that while those Member States with race equality legislation...
(The President cut off the speaker)
As the time allocated to Question Time to the Commission is at an end, Questions Nos 48 to 81 will be answered in writing
The next item is the debate on transport policy for 2010.
Mr President, together with the rapporteur, all the groups have done their best - indeed they have already come a long way - to reach a firm measure of agreement in this dossier, and my thanks to the rapporteur for his cooperation.
As we said this afternoon, it might have taken a long time, Commissioner, but, when all is said and done, we have still been much quicker than the Council.
A general point to begin with: the White Paper outlining the policy lines for European transport policy up to 2010 has one major shortcoming, in my opinion: it lays too much emphasis on rail transport, as if that were the only real means of transport of the future.
We must be realistic, however.
We cannot give the railways any greater role than they deserve or can cope with in view of their current performance.
It is imperative that the liberalisation of the railways on which Parliament decided recently results in increased safety for cross-border traffic, less red tape, more customer orientation and greater predictability; not, by definition, to privatisations.
Conversely, road transport, and, above all, water and air transport, quite unjustifiably receive scant attention in the White Paper.
The large degree of flexibility, efficiency and reliability that road transport offers have led to tremendous growth in that sector.
The quality of road transport is crucial, and it is this that supports the European economy.
We must therefore continue to invest in improvements, for example, by making the roads more intelligent and by developing the road network.
A competitive economy for Europe stands or falls on a healthy European transport sector.
Inland waterway transport, which, in some parts of Europe, has greater potential to relieve the pressure on road transport than the train, is given practically no attention in the White Paper.
That is very disappointing.
I am pleased, therefore, that Parliament, in its reaction to the White Paper, does consider the importance of inland waterway transport as an innovative, environmentally friendly and relatively cheap mode of transport that will soon connect Eastern and Western Europe with each another.
The scope for growth in this sector is still very great.
Combining this with short sea shipping makes inland waterway transport a mode of transport that is really to be reckoned with.
Funding the transport infrastructure for all modes of transport seems to be a major problem throughout Europe.
The train infrastructure, in particular, will cost citizens billions in the future.
All of this will have to be funded by passing on the external costs that have to be introduced at the same time for all modes of transport.
Cross-subsidising, as proposed by the Commission, is only acceptable in specific areas, such as the Alps and the Pyrenees.
We are not against this, therefore, Mr Swoboda.
We cannot have extra-heavy duties being imposed on road transport in order to then use the proceeds to finance the railways.
This goes against the principle of the free market economy, whereby all means of transport must enjoy the same conditions of competition.
It is not a good idea to use pricing as a tool, therefore, but, if it is used, it must be used fairly.
The consumer pays and the polluter pays, but each should pay for his own pollution and consumption rather than those of a competing mode of transport.
From this point of view, I really cannot understand Mr Bolkestein's suggestion that we start with new excise duties for road transport: on petrol and diesel.
I disagree, because in context, all modes of transport must be treated equally, at the same time.
We never promised that there were politicians who were going to impose even more duties on the trains.
We are resigned to that, so, then, let us not see it happening to the roads.
Mr President, I should now like to take up two important points: the European Road Safety Agency and the establishment of a European transport fund.
The majority of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is absolutely not rejoicing at the prospect of these two initiatives.
First, the agency.
It goes without saying that it is very important to increase road safety in Europe: every victim of a traffic accident is one too many.
The question, however, is whether an agency is an efficient means of tackling this problem for the time being, chiefly because authority in the field of traffic safety at EU level is almost non-existent.
A looser form of coordination seems to us a more suitable way.
Mr President, it seems to me that the transport fund is altogether too much for countries that cannot pay for their own roads and do not want to do so in other countries either.
Mr President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur for his work and also for his efforts to reconcile diverse positions, about which we have heard today.
I think that the White Paper gives European transport policy a great opportunity to draw the right conclusions from the ruthless analysis that it contains.
This must not be to do nothing; we cannot hide our heads in the sand, as this might well make a transport policy meltdown inevitable.
The analysis is harsh and cruel and, Mrs Peijs, we have to take it on board: every day there are 7 500 km of traffic jams on Europe's roads; between 1990 and 1998, CO2 emissions increased by 15%; the amount of freight transported by rail has declined in recent years from 21% to 8.5% and between 1990 and 1996 alone, ten football fields' worth of new motorways were constructed every day.
We simply cannot go on like this and a sea change in transport policy is the only answer.
That is why I say that the analysis in the White Paper no longer has anything to do with genuine mobility, which we want, or with a more environmentally friendly transport policy.
That is why we need a radical rethink, above all on freight transport, where we need a move to rail and waterways.
This is therefore about a shift to environmentally friendly modes of transport and about making sustainability our basis and our yardstick.
Economic growth and transport growth must not be taken as givens either, because as transport politicians we actually also need to consider whether it is also possible to cut some traffic out altogether.
In my view the White Paper tends to neglect this aspect.
I believe that the Commission has drawn the right conclusions from this analysis and that it has initiated many good measures.
We have made substantial progress in rail policy and we have also made progress on maritime safety, not least - unfortunately - thanks to the Erika and the Prestige.
One further very complicated area is still missing and that is internalising external costs.
Put into plain language, this means that not all of those who travel on the roads, by rail or on water pay the same price for what they actually use.
That is why I hope that a serious proposal will be forthcoming from the Commission very soon - that we will then discuss in detail - so that we can guarantee that all modes of transport bear a fair cost burden, based on true and transparent costs.
My final point, Commissioner, is one that you addressed in your speech earlier.
Enlargement is nearly upon us and I think that we need to do all we can to avoid repeating the same mistakes or again adopting the same unfortunate transport policies that we have seen implemented in the Member States over the last 30 or 40 years.
We must not repeat these mistakes with the new Member States.
That is why I believe that you have a very considerable responsibility to avoid these mistakes with the new Member States and also to work with them to put in place, at an early date, a good and fair European transport policy.
Mr President, it is clear to me that we could easily have turned the 150 pages of the White Paper on the Commission's transport policy into a 300-page vision.
Procedurally, we in the European Parliament are bound by this report.
I did not envy the rapporteur.
He had to integrate, reflect and summarise the different views on transport that are held in this House to enable the European Commission to derive a clear view or position.
A clear report on such a broad topic with its challenging title 'for 2010' seemed a huge task.
I was glad to be involved in the preparation with the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs to create the outlines of a vision that the European Commission can go on.
I am satisfied with the outlines and I believe we can move forward.
Sections to quicken liberal hearts are those in the area of infrastructure charging, the passing on of external costs of the different modes of transport, the relative separation of economic growth and transport growth, greater attention to multimodal transport developments and attention to inland navigation.
What I want is articulated wonderfully well and I am pleased with Mr Izquierdo's contribution.
Before I get bogged down in the Commission's details, I should like to make further mention of the Commission's methodology and also its objective in its White Paper.
The methodology of cross-taxation with a view to transferring the pressure away from road transport to the other modes of transport must not be allowed to lead to distortion of competition in the transport market.
What I want to say is that each mode of transport has its own comparative benefits, and this is what we must focus on in the first instance.
I can see good opportunities in the future for rail and inland navigation, but also for coastal navigation.
In short, I was pleased that Mrs de Palacio was also so positive about inland navigation this afternoon and I hope that there is sufficient attention to multimodal interchanges and quality with the use of ICT.
Mr President, apart from soldiers and sailors it used only to be the richest and most powerful of people who found themselves a long way from home.
Only a small, privileged group was able to buy goods that were produced a long way away.
Nowadays the economy has experienced such a colossal increase in scale that many people work somewhere other than where they live and spend their holidays even further from home.
Raw materials and semifinished and finished products are moved enormous distances from places where production is cheapest to other places where many buyers willing to pay high prices are expected.
The existence of the European Union has further reinforced this trend, in part through the introduction of a common currency, great freedom for tax-free aviation and the construction of cross-border motorways.
For a long time it was only the benefits of this increase in scale that were stressed. It was seen as a great leap forward that the transport required was becoming comparatively cheaper and cheaper.
The opinion leaders would rather not admit that growing traffic flows lead to a growing pressure on space, to air pollution, to noise pollution and to road traffic accidents.
More and more people are now experiencing the drawbacks.
We know now that it is important to reduce unnecessary traffic and to choose modes of transport that take up little space and pollute the environment less.
So it is time to choose.
Which is, coincidentally, the title of the European Commission's White Paper on transport for 2010 that we must evaluate today.
Are we really making a choice?
The Commission has at least tried to make a distinction on the one hand between the car and the plane, which are placing an increasing load on the environment, and on the other environmentally friendly transport by rail and water.
This involves a shift in existing traffic flows and a channelling of any further growth in a way in which people and environment can reasonably survive in an increasingly densely populated area.
The initial reactions of both organisations of interested parties and this Parliament were unfortunately negative.
