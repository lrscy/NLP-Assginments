I think that the donor conference makes this possible, or seems to at least.
The third point I would like to make here is that there are parts of Greece, yes, unfortunately Greece, for example the Prefecture of Pieria, a tourist province in Central Macedonia, which has suffered enormous economic damage because tourists no longer come to that area.
Such issues should be considered by the European Union as well.
Mr President, I am not about to start arguing the toss with Mr Swoboda over where the Balkans begin.
In fact, it was once said that the Balkans begin at the Rennweg in Vienna.
But leaving that aside, the fact remains that this Stability Pact is of course adversely affected by the heterogeneity of its States.
We have first and second wave candidate countries.
We have countries such as Croatia and Macedonia that are about to overtake candidate countries.
We have States such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania in which the State is scarcely functioning, and then the two decisive challenges, namely Yugoslavia, or Serbia, where it is a question of doing everything we can to foster democratisation and develop a long-term strategy for the Europeanisation of Serbia.
Secondly, Kosovo, where we will never achieve success unless elected political structures come into being there, along with a long-term vision of what is to happen to this region, which will never again be a Serbian province.
We cannot afford to hang about over this issue any longer; otherwise all we will be doing is tinkering about at the edges, as it were.
But that is not the only factor adversely affecting the Stability Pact, it is also suffering from a lack of credibility on the part of the international organisations and also the European Union, which owing to a confusion of competences, wastage, and mismanagement, are displaying traits that would be dismissed as being typical of the Balkans, were it not for the fact that this is happening in our own organisations.
We are losing a great deal in the way of credit and respect in this region, and this respect and credibility are fundamentally even more important than the promises of funding that are made and then not kept.
I truly believe we must put this situation in order in the European Union, primarily by strengthening the Commission' s role in the matter.
Commissioner, I have a great deal of faith in your work, but I must say that we as a Parliament must also ensure that you are able to give this work more in-depth attention than you have been able to hitherto.
What we need here is cooperation between our two institutions, so as to strengthen the EU and its credibility.
Mr President, I, too, consider this to be a satisfactory, significant report.
I would, however, stress certain points.
We know that the countries of the South-East are a priority, but we must be careful not to give ourselves more priorities than we can handle and not to establish conflicting priorities or we will lose credibility.
I refer to the Mediterranean policy and the Middle East peace process, which are also priorities.
We must be consistent, as I will remind the Council when we come to discuss the budgetary issues.
Secondly, it should be borne in mind that the regional approach is appropriate and important, and that it is important for the European Union to play a guiding role throughout this matter.
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to ensure, in the management of this extremely complex process, that the balance is maintained between the regional dimension of the Pact and the bilateral Association and Stabilisation Agreements, or we may end up sending contradictory signals to these countries.
Finally, I would like to mention two other points: the former Yugoslavia and crime.
With regard to the former Yugoslavia, I feel that we must follow the recommendations of the report and gradually reduce the embargo on the civil community until it has been lifted completely, because to continue to enforce it will only serve to postpone the fall of Milosevic.
The sooner we do this, the better.
Apart from anything else, the embargo is affecting other countries in the region, including several candidate countries.
It is causing serious harm.
And who can lift it if Europe does not?
It appears that even the United States are expecting us to lift the embargo.
We must find the courage to take this step.
Lastly, as other Members have reminded us, we must deal with society as well as infrastructures.
It might be interesting to meet with the chairmen of the three Working Tables to discuss these projects; maybe the Committee on Foreign Affairs could see to this.
Society is important, and that is why we must continue with information and culture projects.
For example, my city, Rome, is organising the young artists' biannual event in Sarajevo and funding the Sarajevo Concert Hall, precisely to give a sense of the reconstruction of a society within which there is dialogue, but which has dialogue with us as well.
Then there is the issue of crime.
My country, Italy, has a very high organised crime rate.
Puglia, for example, is a region which has to tackle crime organisations with a base in our country as well as elsewhere.
I would include this among the priorities I mentioned before, because investments will also be affected if this level of organised crime is maintained.
Mr President, I arrived in the Chamber this afternoon with an extremely good speech, which I would like to thank my cabinet for most warmly; but perhaps I can deliver it on another occasion because I would actually like to respond informally to this debate.
Members of the House will have noticed that the High Representative and I produced a report for the Lisbon Council, and I suspect that Mr Lagendijk might have noticed that it bore a striking similarity to his own report.
I am not sure which was chicken and egg, but I feel that in complimenting Mr Lagendijk on the report he will not take it amiss and think that I am really congratulating Mr Solana and myself.
Yet there was a great deal of similarity.
It is fair to say that our work for the Lisbon Council was very much motivated by the strong feeling that unless we can make a success of our efforts in the Balkans, the whole credibility of our attempts to construct a common foreign and security policy will be shattered.
It is enormously important that we rise to the challenge in the Balkans.
A point we made to the heads of government in Lisbon in our report - which was very much reflected in the week that I spent recently in the region - is that the stabilisation and association process has to be at the heart of our strategy.
To put it in a rather more demotic way, in the phrase used by my honourable friend Ms Pack, what it means is designing, helping countries along the road to Europe.
They want to be integrated with the Euro-Atlantic structures; they want that as an alternative to the traumatic disintegration of the last few years.
We have to make that a real process for them.
There were a lot of references to the Stability Pact conference the other day, which as several people have said was a considerable success.
The offers made by donors exceeded by a comfortable margin the expectations at the beginning of the conference.
There are a couple of points I want to make about it.
One, in response to Mr Lagendijk, it is true that some of the money going into the quick-start projects supported by the European Union was money from the 1998 and 1999 budgets.
There is a simple reason for that, which is that in some cases we had already carried out feasibility studies and made preparations for these quick-start projects.
In my book, new money is money you have not spent already.
Unfortunately, given the fact that our budget is based on commitments and payments, and not just payments unlike the budgets in almost all the Member States, that is a particularly important factor.
Committing money does not always mean spending it, the next year or the year after or even in the next decade.
It is important to be clear about that.
This follows up the point made by Mr Swoboda and it is a point with which I strongly agree.
We are not just talking about infrastructure in terms of hardware, we must also talk about infrastructure in terms of software.
That includes the rule of law, democratisation, the sort of civil society projects to which the honourable gentleman was referring; and it includes education - a point I will come back to in a moment.
I want to make one or two other points which arose at Lisbon and which we are following up.
First of all, we were charged in the Commission at Lisbon to bring forward a package of proposals on asymmetric trade concessions for the region.
It is worth remembering that the total exports from the Balkans to the European Union represent about 0.6% of our total imports.
For agricultural products the figure is about 0.16%.
So this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous.
We are also trying speed up our assistance and make it more effective.
I announced yesterday agreement in the Commission on a rapid reaction facility.
We will be coming forward to Parliament in the next few months with our new regulation for assistance to the West Balkans, which I hope will make it more rapid, more flexible and will, of course, have to include sufficient funding for projects supporting gender issues.
I can think of no single model of successful economic or political development which does not include at its heart sensible programmes to ensure that women can develop their full potential and play a full role in their communities.
One point on education: last winter, despite all the cynicism, our energy for democracy programme in Serbia was extraordinarily successful.
Alas, there are not many occasions when people cheer the European Union in the streets - all too few occasions in the country I know best.
But that happened in some of those cities last winter.
The Mayor of Nis has just written a letter saying that Energy for Democracy was a model of the sort of political support we should be providing in his country.
The winter is over, so there is not the same urgent necessity for oil at the moment.
We are looking at ways to extend that sort of scheme.
What we have been thinking of, among other ideas, is education for democracy: providing schools with equipment, school-books and other facilities, cash to carry out small improvements to classrooms and so on, and with sports equipment - all those sorts of things which can make for a better life for the kids in those towns while they have to wait with their families for the departure - sooner rather than later, I hope - of Mr Milosevic.
I hope we are at last going to see more progress on the cleaning up of the Danube, which is crucial for the region.
We had useful meetings with the Danube Commission last week and I hope that the annual meeting of the Danube Commission this week will see us managing to set all that in motion, with the European Union meeting about 85% of the cost of the clean-up.
I have spoken before of my concerns about Montenegro.
Following my visit there about a month ago, we have doubled our Obnova support for Montenegro from EUR 10 to 20m.
We are also providing a good deal there in terms of food security and so on. I very much hope that the European Investment Bank will lend some money within reasonable limits to Montenegro before too long.
Finally, the honourable Member asked about the scale of our financial commitments to the Balkans.
There will be other occasions when I can follow this up in greater detail.
For me one of the real tests is whether all those yards of Council communiquÃ©s and all those promises about Marshall plans and so on for the Balkans actually amount to a row of beans!
This year we will be spending about EUR 540m in the western Balkans.
Because of the front-loading of our commitments in Kosovo, next year we will need to spend about EUR 800m in the Balkans. About EUR 350m of that will go to Kosovo.
It must be said that it does not involve huge increases in expenditure elsewhere but we have to provide support in a country like Croatia where there is a good and decent government trying to do a difficult job in extremely problematic circumstances.
We have to spend money with those stabilisation and association countries which are negotiating seriously with us on the road to Europe.
For me, in public-spending terms, the crucial year is always year one - you are lucky if you get to year two or three.
Year one is actually the big year of expenditure for us.
Overall, at Istanbul, when we were asked how much we thought we could spend in the region, recognising that it was subject to the budgetary authority - I know all the theology of these matters now - we reckoned about EUR 5.5bn.
People say that is a crazy figure.
Well, I am keen that we should no longer be in the position we are in now where, despite the interinstitutional agreement, we are told by a lot of people that we have to find the extra money for Kosovo within the financial envelope agreed before Kosovo became a necessity.
One thing I have insisted on is a realistic figure in our budgeting for reconstruction in Serbia, because I do not want to find myself in two or three years time having to find additional costs for Serbia out of that same budget.
We reckon that applying the same sort of figures applied in Kosovo, we would need about EUR 2.3bn for a serious reconstruction programme in Serbia.
That could only start once Milosevic has gone.
However, in my view it would be thoroughly irresponsible for us to suggest figures to this Parliament or Council which did not include an element of what we think would be realistic for Serbia.
That is based on economists' figures and our assessment that we need to meet the same sort of a proportion of expenditure on Serbia that we have met in Kosovo.
The rest - EUR 3.2bn - over seven years does not strike me as being outlandishly generous.
That is how we reached the figure of EUR 5.5bn and I have slightly resented the implication in some newspapers that this is a figure we have plucked out of the air and does not make any sense.
I should be delighted to explain it not just in more detail to Parliament but I am looking forward in due course to explaining it in more detail to the General Affairs Council.
Who knows, if I was lucky enough one day, I might even be able to explain it to finance ministers.
I respond to the honourable Member' s well-intentioned question in that way.
This is not a figure plucked out of the air: it is an attempt to provide an honest assessment of what our rhetoric actually means.
People cannot resent the fact that they do it: they asked us to do it in relation to the Middle East - to give some idea of what the cost of a peace settlement would be for the European Union' s programmes.
So let us see the cost of it in the Balkans.
If we are going to have an argument about the relationship between rhetoric and reality, let us start here.
My final point: we are clearly talking in the Balkans about building peace and security, not just in our backyard but in our front yard too.
We are talking about building peace and security in an integral part of our European common home.
I hope we can do so in practice with the rhetoric, with the promises, with the optimism that we show in all those rhetorical communiquÃ©s.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0216/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 1, 2 and 3 will be taken together.
Question No 1 by (H-0255/00):
Subject: Flagrant violation by Turkey of the rule of law and human rights The leader of the People' s Democracy Party of Turkey, together with 17 other members of the party' s leadership, has been sentenced to a three-year and nine months' term of imprisonment for supporting the hunger strike that took place in solidarity with Abdullah Ãcalan when he was handed over to the Turkish secret services in Kenya.
Three mayors of towns in S.E. Turkey, who are supporters of the same party, were also arrested on charges of collaborating with the PKK.
Other Turkish parties besides HADEP have voiced their opposition to the arrests and sentences, arguing that they are a flagrant breach of democracy, freedom of expression and the basic principles of the rule of law.
Will the Council raise the matter of the arrest and conviction of democrats for their opinions, and call for unhindered freedom of expression in Turkey together with freedom of formation and operation for all political parties?
Question No 2 by (H-0286/00):
Subject: Human rights violations by Turkey In December 1999 Turkey became a candidate country for accession to the European Union.
Article 10 of the conclusions of the Helsinki Council Presidency states that Turkey must fulfil the general accession criteria, and in particular the Copenhagen criteria, if it is to become a Member of the European Union.
In February of this year three Kurdish mayors (of the towns of Diyarbakir, Siirt and BingÃ¶l) were arrested on their return to Turkey after they had signed the Aalborg Charter in Hanover in Germany together with 4 colleagues making their towns members of the 'European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign' ; they are still being held in prison.
Since Turkey is guilty of continuous and repeated human rights violations, what does the Council intend to do prevail upon Turkey to meet the EU accession criteria?
Question No 3 by (H-0299/00):
Subject: Continued muzzling of freedom of expression and violation of the rule of law by Turkey The leader of the People' s Democracy Party (HADEP) of Turkey and 17 other members of the party leadership have been sentenced to prison terms of three years and nine months on charges of supporting the hunger strike organised in support of Abdullah Ãcalan when he was handed over to the Turkish secret services in Kenya.
Three mayors of towns in south-eastern Turkey who are close to this party have also been arrested on charges of collaborating with the PKK.
Other Turkish parties apart from HADEP have expressed their opposition to these arrests and sentences, arguing that this move is totally incompatible with democracy, freedom of expression and the basic principles of the rule of law.
Will the Council say whether it intends to raise with the Turkish government the issue of the arrest and sentencing of democrats merely for making statements and to demand, as part of the pre-accession procedure, that Turkey give guarantees regarding unrestricted freedom of expression and allow all political parties to be founded and function without hindrance?
Mr President, the Council has already raised with the Turkish authorities the issue of the democratic rights of Turks of Kurdish origin, including those mentioned in the question.
It will continue to monitor this situation in Turkey as it develops and to act accordingly.
An Association Council meeting was held yesterday between the European Union and Turkey in which this issue was mentioned again. The Turkish authorities were told of the EU' s concern about this type of issue and of its hope that the Turkish authorities will end what is currently interpreted as a non-compliance with certain basic criteria of respect for human and democratic rights and the protection of minorities.
Turkey was named by the Helsinki European Council as a candidate country for accession to the European Union.
This status places Turkey in absolutely the same position as any other candidate country in terms of both obligations and benefits.
Therefore, Turkey is subject to the same requirements as those imposed on any other candidate country but also naturally has the same rights.
The European Union cannot make a special case of Turkey which must be treated exactly the same as any other candidate country.
Turkey is therefore currently involved in a process in which its situation must be assessed in light of the criteria of the Copenhagen European Council. These criteria are clear enough with regard to respect for the rule of law, democratic guarantees, fundamental freedoms and the protection of minorities.
These are a prerequisite for the opening of any negotiating process.
On the road towards this, a pre-accession strategy must be established between the Commission, on the EU' s behalf, and Turkey.
The preparation of this strategy involves non-governmental organisations, the Member States and the Turkish Government.
This accession partnership will define the priority areas for reform on which the European Union considers that Turkey must concentrate its efforts in order to comply, hopefully in a progressive, capable and complete manner, with the Copenhagen criteria.
Clearly it is in this context that the issues mentioned in the questions will be considered.
Yesterday we heard Mr Verheugen and today the Council' s representative acknowledging, even in small measure, some of the problems related to respect for human rights in Turkey concerning which, indeed, they expressed their sorrow.
Yet, both yesterday and today they underlined the supposed progress made by the Turkish regime in that area.
And we heard the representative of the Council telling us the same thing today.
The truth, however, is that contrary to what some people are claiming even in Greece, the Helsinki decisions on Turkey have emboldened the Turkish regime.
It is no mere chance that on the next day Turkey' s leaders declared that Turkey has become a candidate for accession without attached conditions.
It is not by chance that, while they have not complied with any of their commitments, they protest that they have not been given the appropriations provided for under customs union.
They also told us that Turkey intends to take steps.
But we have been hearing that in the Council of Europe for very many years, perhaps more than ten, without anything happening.
If anything, things are worse.
The campaigner for democracy and human rights who was shot was sent to prison again instead of his attackers being punished.
My question, then, is: specifically when does the Turkish regime intend to progress with democratising that country' s constitution and criminal code, to set free the leaders of HADEP and the Members of Parliament as well as all the political prisoners? Will the Kurdish issue ever be resolved, will all the political parties be allowed freedom of formation and operation and finally, will Turkey ever withdraw its troops from Cyprus?
With regard to the comment that Mr Korakas' question was not a new one, I must say that Turkey' s application for accession to the European Union subjects it to closer scrutiny of its responsibilities in complying with the basic criteria for accession. I believe that the Turkish authorities are well aware of this.
With regard to defining the pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership, Turkey' s problems will certainly be paid close attention, particularly in terms of respect for the basic criteria of acting in accordance with European standards.
In the past Turkey was a country in which we regularly and systematically undertook certain ad hoc initiatives according to the development of its internal situation.
But no more!
The internal situation is now becoming a strategic element in the progress made by Turkey towards approximation with the European Union.
In the specific case of Mr Birdal, I was able to meet him in Turkey in January of this year and I told him during this meeting of the EU' s solidarity with his situation. It is clear in this respect that the EU has already indicated its concern to the Turkish authorities, through the appropriate channels, about his status and in particular his return to prison.
For a long time we have adopted a foreign policy which we allege is based on moral rules. And not just that.
We have come to believe it ourselves and we claim to represent the world-wide moral conscience.
Already, however, we have reached an impasse, and not just in Turkey.
You see, morality must be applied towards everyone equally, regardless of risks and interests.
But that cannot happen.
You see, Belgrade can be bombed, but not Moscow, Beijing or Ankara.
Let us therefore acknowledge the obvious and return to tried and tested prescriptions.
In other words, let us speak of interests, the balance of powers and policy as the art of the possible.
If we do that we will certainly not be more moral, we will be more sincere and in that case we can all put our time to better use instead of play-acting as we are all doing now.
I am not sure that you have asked a question.
If there is no question, the Council is not obliged to answer, only to listen, as you know, Mr Seixas da Costa.
Mr Theonas wishes to rephrase his question.
I recommend to all of you that you begin with the question before making a declaration.
I have a comment and a specific question: would it not be better for the Council to give more specific answers when it asks for specific questions?
That was my comment.
Now, the question: if the pre-accession process for Turkey were to last twenty years, would all those who are imprisoned today have to wait those twenty years for the European Union to express interest?
Secondly, would the Council be prepared, in this whole process, to suspend or cancel obligations of the European Union relating to the pre-accession process as long as the people we are talking about remain in prison?
And finally, could some action ever be demanded from Turkey which would help resolve the Cyprus issue, granted that this is one of the issues which should be addressed as part of the pre-accession process?
Firstly, Mr Theonas, I do not agree with the comment that the Council presidency is not explicitly answering the questions raised by Members.
In fact, quite the contrary is true.
The ongoing process of Turkey' s approximation towards the European Union, which was started with its designation as a candidate in Helsinki, is one of progressive approximation.
The Member should realise that this process of progressive approximation is resulting in greater attention being paid than in the past by the European Union to Turkey' s internal situation and to the way in which this country acts with regard to the requirements imposed by the international community.
It is this point which really must be borne in mind.
Turkey is currently, on its own initiative and therefore as a result of its own political decision, the subject of close scrutiny in terms of compliance with the basic criteria.
This is not to be assessed over the next ten years but rather on a daily basis, usually within the pre-accession strategy process.
If there were a lack of progress on the fundamental issues under observation, the pre-accession process would suffer the respective consequences.
This is very clear to me.
Furthermore, the Helsinki conclusions, regardless of how they may be read, place the issue of Turkey and its relationship with Cyprus in a new perspective, which was in fact welcomed by the Cypriot authorities.
We must draw from this the appropriate conclusions about how the development in the Turkish position on the Cypriot issue may also affect the development of the Turkish position in its approximation towards the European Union.
A comment and question to the Council' s representative: is the answer he just gave us specific?
For goodness sake!
Mr Korakas, I must make a confession. In political life, people are used to reading between the lines.
On such a delicate issue as the interpretation of a serious situation, like the development in the Cypriot situation and Turkey' s approximation towards the European Union, we must be very careful in our choice of words.
However, I feel that I made it clear that there is a direct link between Turkey' s approximation process and its position on the Cypriot issue.
I cannot make this any clearer.
Question No 4 by (H-0294/00):
Subject: Blatant persecution and violation of the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldeans in Turkey Tens of thousands of Assyrian-Chaldeans in Turkey living in the south-east of the country have found refuge in Member States of the EU after being persecuted by the Turkish Government which has destroyed many of their homes, closed and raised to the ground their churches and banned the use of their language and teaching in this language.
There is a danger that, owing to the use of force, the remaining places of worship and even the traces of the existence of this minority will be lost for ever.
Will the Council say whether it intends to raise this matter as part of the pre-accession procedure, to call on the Turkish Government to respect the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldean minority in Turkey and, more particularly, to ensure that the Mar Gabriel monastery in Midyat and the Dayr Zafaran monastery in Mardin can continue to operate without hindrance?
Very briefly, what I said about the development of the situation in Turkey and the necessary changes in terms of respect for the rights of minorities also applies in this case which specifically involves the protection of Christian minorities.
The reinforcement of the political dialogue agreed in Helsinki requires progress to be made towards compliance with these political criteria, particularly on issues of human rights.
All the situations which have been brought to the Council' s attention during the pre-accession process will be tackled.
This particular question involves the problem of non-recognition by the Turkish authorities of the Assyrian-Chaldean community under the terms of the Lausanne Treaty of 1923.
Under this Treaty, the Turkish Government undertook to ensure full protection for the churches, synagogues, cemeteries and other places of worship of non-Muslim minorities.
At this point in time, the claims of the Assyrian-Chaldean community basically relate to the problem of restoring monasteries and the official teaching of Aramaic and the problem connected with the free movement of citizens from this ethnic group who live outside Turkey.
These are clearly administrative issues.
They do have a human rights dimension which obviously must be tackled - and we will be vigilant in this respect - but they are essentially administrative.
The Council will be vigilant and the Commission will also raise these issues during the pre-accession negotiations.
Mr President-in-Office, I cannot say your answer is satisfactory.
If the Council were truly concerned about human rights one would have expected a more specific answer.
We are talking here about two very ancient peoples who have been subjected to systematic genocide by the Turkish regime, a genocide perhaps not so impressive as in Armenia, but just as effective.
Several thousand people have become refugees or immigrants to the European Union and only a few tens of thousands remain in the area where they have lived since ancient times.
I would like to ask whether you can be more specific.
Of course, your reference to the Treaty of Lausanne is apt, but beyond that, the European Union also has a responsibility to stress certain things to the Turkish regime concerning the need to respect human rights, whether they stem from the Treaty of Lausanne or in a broader sense.
Is the Council going to take any specific action along those lines?
Mr Alyssandrakis says that my answer was not positive enough.
It would be useful to remind him of his question.
He asked whether the Council intends to raise this issue during the pre-accession process and to ask the Turkish Government to respect the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldean minority in Turkey and, in particular, to ensure the operation without hindrance of their monasteries. He specifically referred to two monasteries.
I have no idea what more positive answer I could give him than to simply say yes.
It is the Council' s and the EU' s intention to raise this issue with the Turkish authorities during the pre-accession process.
Once again, if this is not a clear answer, I have no idea what is.
Question No 5 by (H-0262/00):
Subject: Renewed tension in Kosovo The results of the 'peaceful' intervention by NATO forces in Kosovo are generally acknowledged to be deplorable.
Instead of the 'multi-ethnic' Kosovo which had been the UN' s objective, we have a situation in which the refugees have failed to return, ethnic cleansing has continued, but now directed at the Serb population, partition has taken root and the dispatch of increasing numbers of new military and police forces is considered 'indispensable' .
The current increase in tension is being fuelled by statements by NATO officials and major new military exercises by NATO forces.
Will the Council say what measures it intends to take to safeguard a 'multi-ethnic' Kosovo as part of the Yugoslav Federation?
What action will it take to defuse the crisis and tension in the region?
- (PT) Mr President, the European Union' s objective, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1244, continues to be the establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo within the internationally recognised borders of the Former Yugoslavia.
The Council accepts the urgent need to find a solution to the continued outbreaks of ethnic violence, particularly against the Serbs, gypsies and other non-Albanian communities in Kosovo.
The Council has been consistently supporting the efforts made by UNMIK and KFOR to prevent further expulsions and to allow the safe return of all those who abandoned their homes.
In response to an urgent appeal from the UN Secretary-General' s Special Representative, Doctor Bernard Kouchner, and from the High Representative, Mr Solana, the Member States have significantly increased their contributions to the UN' s international police forces with both financial and technical support and human resources.
Several Member States have also reinforced their own contingents in KFOR.
In the past in this House, we have deeply regretted the failure to meet these commitments, which has clearly hindered the action of the international authorities in Kosovo.
There are now new elements involved and some of these commitments are now being met. This is allowing this issue to be handled differently and more effectively, although we are clearly still a long way from achieving a minimally acceptable solution.
The Council has urged all the political leaders in Kosovo to adopt urgent measures to combat the escalation of violence, to reject expressions of extremism and to support UNMIK and KFOR.
It is very important that the Council manages to further develop the progress already made in the reconciliation between the ethnic groups and that Resolution 1244 can be put into practice.
We are committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence in Kosovo.
Only responsibility-sharing by representatives of the minorities can lead to the construction of a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
We should all ask ourselves whether everyone, particularly within Kosovo itself, is interested in the existence of a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
In this context, the Council repeats its appeal to the Serbian leaders to participate in the joint interim administrative structures.
The Council places great importance on the careful preparation by UNMIK and the OSCE of local elections to be held this year, including the provisions on voting by absentees and the participation of minorities.
We believe it is important to start creating legitimate structures with local authority in Kosovo. This is the only way we can guarantee that the political forces which are currently working in an unorganised manner, outside any institutions, will return to normal political life and end up working in Kosovo within a democratic society.
In terms of supporting this process of democratisation and coexistence, the European Union has been working together with other international partners to re-establish daily life for the whole of Kosovo' s population, whatever their ethnic background.
In addition to the important bilateral assistance given by the Member States, the European Community has allocated humanitarian aid for 1999 to 2000 to the amount of EUR 429 million for the Kosovar refugees, displaced persons within the country and those returning home.
The aid for reconstruction and the special financial assistance, including the support for UNMIK, will total EUR 437 million between 1999 and 2000.
This set of actions and the commitment shown by the EU in this respect have been recognised by the international community.
Unfortunately, at times the practical efficiency of these actions is not sufficient to end an unstable situation beset by tensions which we hope will decrease in the future.
Let me first comment that the President-in-Office of the Council is besieged by questions from Greek Members.
I think that expresses the great insecurity felt by a Member State, but I would also say the inadequacy of Community policy to address serious issues.
I want to thank him for his answer.
I take note of that position, which I find particularly positive and which we do not often see, namely that the European Union' s objective is a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo within the framework of the internationally recognised borders of the Yugoslav Federation. I think that is a positive thing and I have taken note of it.
I would like to ask a supplementary question regarding in particular those minorities suffering persecution today in a situation of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, whether they be Serbians, of Turkish origin or gypsies, who are, on the one hand, under such pressure from Albanian extremists and, on the other hand, living in a Serbia still subject to embargo.
Are there any special support and aid programmes planned by the European Union specifically for these people who are living in such misery and desperation?
Mr Alavanos, I believe it was clear from what I said and in fact you recognised yourself that the general objective of the European Union and the international community is to respect the terms of Security Council Resolution 1244, particularly on the establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.
I am not ignoring the major difficulties present on the ground in applying these decisions.
There is no point on this issue using euphemisms or diplomatic language.
The mass return of the Albanians expelled from Kosovo and the tension which has arisen in the meantime, particularly involving Serbian, gypsy and other minorities, have ended up creating a new and different situation. However, we should not only look at the present.
We must consider what happened in the past which was the cause of all this.
Perhaps by looking at the causes of this situation, rather than fixing on the present, we will have a fairer and more objective view of the partial responsibility of the Belgrade Government, particularly with regard to what happened to it subsequently due to its actions in Kosovo.
However, it is true that, for the Serbian minorities who have had to leave the country since the return of the Kosovo Albanians, the conditions have not yet been established to allow them to return. Those still living in Kosovo are having problems coexisting with the Albanian majority.
However, the Member must recognise the clear efforts being made by the international community to protect these minorities and to achieve a safe situation allowing them to coexist with the Albanians.
We cannot ignore the fact that this joint effort also needs the Serbian authorities to be involved in the consultative structures.
This would be one way of making its own actions in Kosovo credible.
Our only objective is to guarantee the continuation of multi-ethnic integration.
We realise that there is a long way to go and probably the situation of the Serbs living outside Kosovo, and who cannot return because it is unsafe, is unfair.
There is no point beating about the bush on this. This situation is unfair.
However, we must realise that the international community is doing its best.
Furthermore, we should always remember what happened before, in order to justify what is happening now.
Mr Alavanos said that until now all the questions we have heard have been Greek.
I would like to say that the Spanish and the Portuguese, as well as other Mediterranean people, are accustomed to speaking with the Greeks.
I believe that Lisbon, the ancient Olisipo, was founded by Ulysses.
The President-in-Office of the Council therefore comes from a country with a long tradition of Greek presence.
Mr President, could I ask the President-in-Office of the Council - all of whose good intentions for a multi-ethnic Kosovo I accept - whether he would not admit that the international community' s policy there in all its facets - the European Union, the United Nations, KFOR, NATO et al - is really an unmitigated and disastrous failure and getting worse by the day.
What is being done to get the KLA and the Albanian bully-boys, who clearly have no interest in a multi-ethnic Kosovo, under control?
There just seems to be an ineffectual permissiveness of the situation despite all these wonderful, pious good intentions.
Firstly, to comment on what the President said, I must say that I am very happy to be grilled by the Greek Members. I have some great friends in Greece where I have spent several holidays.
As for the situation you describe, Mr Purvis, I do not believe that the policy is disastrous. This is the only possible policy, as you know, and it is a result of everything that has happened in the region in the last few years and even in the last few decades.
We must realise that the international community' s position, which is not brilliant in terms of the practical application of these measures, is the only one which can resolve a conflict on which the international community was only called to act due to the total inability to find a solution within the Former Yugoslavia.
It was precisely the situation created in the Former Yugoslavia which caused this reaction.
You refer to the KLA.
Remember that the KLA only exists because the Albanian community in Kosovo was systematically persecuted and totally besieged.
Clearly the need to organise themselves militarily to respond to this threat led to the KLA' s action.
The problem now facing us is to try and ensure that the structures created outside the democratic process, simply because this did not exist in the Former Yugoslavia, allow an approach of solely political action to be adopted in a democratic Kosovo.
We are still a long way off from finding such an approach, but I believe that the international community' s action is very positive in this respect.
Mr President, if a mark between 1 and 10 were now to be given for success in pursuing the two objectives of the action programme, namely that Kosovo should be multi-ethnic and that it should remain a part of Yugoslavia, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council and I can probably agree that the mark concerned would be fairly low. We agree, however, that this is the result of a policy which has been pursued up until now, that is to say a result of what has happened.
My question is this: is the Council giving any consideration to how this policy can be changed in the future, or is the intention to go on using the same tools, that is to say military action and initiatives against troublesome areas in the region?
What is the basic idea behind setting up a 60 000-strong rapid reaction force when we all agree that a number of other initiatives are presumably required if there is a desire to solve conflicts in Europe and in neighbouring countries?
Firstly, I regret not having the opportunity to put questions to the Members. If I did I would ask them what other solution they propose.
As a specific example of what military forces can do, I would refer you to the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Just think what the situation was like there for several years.
Just think about the international community' s failure to act faced with this problem and then just look at the situation today. This is clearly unstable but it is one of peace due to the presence of the military forces.
It is clear that there are certain situations in which attempts to deflect ethnic tensions can only be successful by using mechanisms which involve the protection and separation of the waters.
This is very probably what is needed in Kosovo, who knows for how long, but hopefully for the shortest time possible. We should also bear in mind that the international community and particularly the Member States have no specific interest in intervening in Kosovo and in mobilising human and physical resources for an action of this kind.
In fact quite the contrary.
The international community and the European Union in particular were aware that it was their duty and responsibility to react to a totally disgraceful situation in terms of international standards of behaviour. It was the genocide and siege behaviour of Mr Milosevic with regard to the Albanian community in Kosovo which led to our intervention.
You say that the practical result of this action is not what was wanted.
I would point out, however, that the practical result is that today, with a few exceptions and despite everything, this situation is under control in terms of security.
We have made and are making efforts to achieve greater integration of the minority communities.
A more effective result has not been possible.
We will try to continue exerting pressure in this respect and we believe that renewing in some way the institutional organisation of civil society through independent elections may contribute significantly to this stability.
Question No 6 by (H-0279/00):
Subject: Protection of European undertakings in Kosovo Despite the fact that the Council is unaware of this (answer to Question E-2425/99), the above undertakings have indeed appealed to the EU to protect their interests, as this matter falls within the Council' s remit.
Given that UNMIK and its head, Bernard Kouchner, do not act of their own accord, but under international supervision in which the Council is also involved, the latter should scrutinise their actions more closely where they affect the interests of European undertakings, if it wishes to avoid raising doubts about its intentions though the answers it gives.
Furthermore, the proper management of the fourth Pillar entails a number of additional obligations for the EU institutions.
Since the Commission, which is unfortunately taking an unconscionable amount of time to reply, is well aware of the actions of the undertakings concerned, and in order to avoid any doubts about whether the Council is responsible for failing to act, will the latter say to what extent it is prepared to act in accordance with the obligations imposed on it by the Treaties and to support the interests of the undertakings in question?
. (PT) Security Council Resolution 1244 gave UNMIK, the interim administration in Kosovo, authority over the territory, including full legislative and executive powers, and control over the legal system.
The aim was to establish a transitional administration whose mandate was described in the resolution itself.
This mandate also includes the development of a phased economic recovery plan.
This means that the individual cases mentioned in the Member' s question should be dealt with directly by the UN Secretary-General' s Special Representative for Kosovo, who is responsible for the territorial administration of Kosovo, or by the Foreign Minister of the Member State in which the undertakings are established.
The Council assumes general political responsibility for the EU' s participation in UNMIK which is focussed on reconstruction and economic rehabilitation.
However, neither the European Union as such nor the Council has any competence or direct responsibility with regard to the administration of the territory and the protection of the individual interests of undertakings in the region. These elements are, on the one hand, the responsibility of the United Nations, as the administrator of the territory, and on the other, of the governments of each Member State which may act to protect these undertakings.
I have been waiting about six months for an answer on this.
There is a whole raft of questions and answers and we are becoming schizophrenic over the substance and content of the answers.
What is hiding behind all that?
Either the services are not doing their job properly and are giving you wrong information, or there is something rotten in the Kingdom of Denmark and there are many who say that there is something peculiar about Mr Kouchner' s administration.
My question is this: if the services are not doing their job properly, what are you going to do when they leave you high and dry?
If Mr Kouchner is not doing his job properly, what are you going to do about it?
And the third question: how can it be that the citizens of the European Union are being called upon to pay for the Stability Pact even though European undertakings established there cannot be protected by the European Union?
That does not happen anywhere, it is unreasonable.
We should therefore see things as they are, because my impression is that Mr Kouchner is not playing his part properly there.
That is where the problem lies and that is what we should all realise, as European citizens and people interested in developments in the Balkans.
The question raised has never been submitted to the Council of the European Union, particularly by the undertakings which are complaining.
The Council presidency has no knowledge of this issue.
Complaints are submitted to the Member States whose Foreign Ministries are responsible for dealing with this type of question.
It should be borne in mind that the administration in Kosovo does not come under the EU' s competence but under that of the UN.
There is a specific body responsible for this administration.
Each country is normally obliged to protect the actions of its undertakings within the international sphere.
Each country has structures to protect its citizens and undertakings internationally and for this reason there are specific mechanisms which we all use every day in our international action.
The European Union is not a country.
I do not know under what circumstances the European Union would have to have a global and specific action plan in this respect or why, as a Union, it would have to deal with this issue.
That is unless we reach a point at which national governments prove to be incompetent in protecting their own undertakings.
Mr President, an essential element in the reconstruction of post-war society is always that recovery of the local economy should be as rapid as possible, so that it becomes viable once more.
Local businesses in Kosovo now, however, have one substantial problem: a dearth of qualified and linguistically competent labour, as all those who can speak English, or nearly all, were recruited for reconstruction projects in Kosovo, and local businesses cannot compete with the high salaries being paid.
Many entrepreneurs are naturally very bitter about this consequent stagnation in activity.
Mr President-in-Office, I do not know if you have come up against this problem, but I would nonetheless ask you what you think can be done about it at EU level.
Doctor Bernard Kouchner has at times referred to the difficulty he has in recruiting staff, not only for the country' s administration but also for the normal structures of economic reconstruction.
It is clear that the cost of recruiting staff is high.
We consider that this type of question comes within the framework of Doctor Kouchner' s work which, as I have said, is outside the control of the European Union, although we are cooperating on this issue.
The Union as such does not therefore have a specific and direct response to this type of question.
We are ready to listen to and consider the requests made to us by Doctor Kouchner and to give him any possible answer within the commitments assumed by the European Union with regard to the extremely high costs involved in the region.
Mr President, my question is quite specific and is, I believe, of direct concern to the EU.
Is the Council aware that the Serbian government is planning to sell mines and mineral resources in Kosovo to EU companies and to portray this as privatisation?
Does the Council know that there are problems here associated with ethnic cleansing in one part of Kosovo, in that Serbs are being settled in one area, which is the area that is richest in raw materials, and there is a risk of the area being partitioned in order to safeguard these raw materials?
Mr Posselt, I have no knowledge of this issue. However, we will consider the information you have given us.
Question No 7 by (H-0274/00):
Subject: Joint efforts to coordinate IT development The Portuguese Presidency has commendably highlighted the need for development of the IT sector in order to promote competitiveness and employment.
Coordination at European level would be conducive to the further development of the IT sector.
What is the Council' s view of the need for coordination at European level to develop the IT sector and, in that context, of the need to set up a European IT agency?
Mr Andersson, to answer your question I should like to start by confirming that a coordinated approach at European level to the information technology and telecommunications sectors is essential for the future development of the European Union.
We have already discussed in this House the Special Meeting, which was held in Lisbon on 23, and 24 March. At this it was clear that improving the Information Society policy is central to achieving the objectives which this meeting set and which involve the issues of employment, social cohesion and reinforcement of Europe' s competitiveness at world level.
In particular the Special Meeting invited the Council and Commission to prepare an action plan on e-Europe, which will be presented, to the European Council in June.
The idea of launching an agency devoted to information technology was presented at the Lisbon European Council in the document provided by the Swedish Government.
This idea was not followed up but it responds to our concerns and will definitely be considered and developed in the future.
It was discussed, however, particularly in terms of possibly being added to the existing Community mechanisms, which include the Information Society Project Office. This has been producing a range of initiatives during the Portuguese presidency.
On the issue of a possible European telecommunications regulation agency, I would remind you that a study carried out for the Commission in October 1999 concluded that there was no immediate need for such a body. At the same time the Council concluded that regulation should be applied at the closest possible level to that at which the activities to be regulated are carried out.
This too involves the principle of subsidiarity.
I want to thank the Council for its answer.
I was pleased to see that the issue of information technology and its link to growth and employment were so high on the agenda in Lisbon.
What happens in the future is important.
The political task is not, of course, to set up IT companies but to build an infrastructure which stimulates development in this area.
We do, of course, have shortcomings within the EU.
Moreover, there are major differences between the EU' s Member States and also between different regions within the EU.
Different population groups have varying opportunities and knowledge when it comes to exploiting this technology, and this may lead to great inequality in the future.
I would therefore ask the question: how are we successfully to devise a form of coordination which enables information technology also to be used out in the peripheral areas so that we create greater equality between different regions and between different population groups?
Is there not a need for a joint authority to coordinate this work?
Mr Andersson, you have asked me two separate questions. The first concerns the substantive issue of democratising the Information Society itself, which was at the root of the concerns of the Lisbon European Council.
This involves the need to spread throughout European society, precisely in the area where it is less competitive and in order to give added value to the usual elements of its economy, all these new dimensions of the society of innovation and knowledge.
This effort is scheduled to use specific measures contained in the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, particularly with regard to the Internet and methods of apprenticeship and vocational training. In our opinion, these may be able to form a future action plan, which will be assessed every year at special meetings of the European Council, which will always take place in the spring.
This is the answer to your first question.
Your other question concerns the need to have an organisational structure and an institution to supervise this process and to pay specific attention to the similarity between these types of question within the European Union.
You rightly make the point that on many occasions specifying these measures may create and worsen inequalities.
This is a danger and risk to which we are alert.
In the meantime, the governments have decided that the creation of a new structure and bureaucratic mechanism with high costs is not necessary.
They in fact consider that the structures which currently exist for monitoring this process are sufficient for this purpose.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as an Austrian I am extremely proud of the fact that the Council Presidency has focussed on development in the IT sector.
I would be interested to know how the President-in-Office of the Council views the sale by auction of UMTS licences.
The proceeds from this sector could create a huge amount of impetus and, above all, boost the Portuguese programme accordingly, if, for example, we were to make the proceeds from the licences that are sold by auction available for research and development, education, training and further education, or for infrastructure.
What do you think to the idea of developing incentivisation programmes for the Member States, so as to enable the proceeds to actually be ploughed back into this sector?
The conclusions of the Lisbon European Council specify national actions which are therefore the responsibility of the national governments. These are objective commitments which the governments assumed in signing these conclusions and which involve the reorientation of the mechanisms and structures and action plans and programmes which exist within the European Union.
With the exception of the possibility of recourse to the European Investment Bank, there are no new elements in this respect for mobilising financial resources.
This was one of the objective concerns raised during discussions of this issue in Lisbon.
It was decided to try and achieve greater coherence between the current instruments for the simple reason that we believe that, rather than creating new instruments, we should reorganise the current ones.
Having said this, it is necessary, as we have done in the employment and macroeconomic policies, to try and achieve greater coherence between the national actions on the society of innovation and knowledge and to ensure that these actions are subject to a specific plan which each Member State undertakes to implement internally. This will occur in accordance with a set timetable of objectives and using benchmarking processes which allow us to see which are the best practices and to try, based on these, to encourage similar practices in the other Member States.
This process has this national dimension of a commitment on objectives and it is therefore obvious that there are no financial resources for this other than those available in the budget of each country.
In the other dimension, in which recourse to the European Investment Bank is possible, there is a set of actions within the competence of the EU itself, which not only complements previous actions but also ensures greater coherence between the EU' s programmes and actions in this area.
The Commission has been extremely active in this field and the e-Europe programme presented by the Commission and whose action plan will be approved at the Feira European Council in June provides new guidelines for this area and a new reorientation of Community policies on this issue.
Question No 9 by (H-0275/00):
Subject: Women in the new CFSP decision-making bodies Has the Council provided for any measures for women to be adequately represented in the new CSFP decision-making bodies, or made any recommendations to this effect?
How many women will there be in the crisis management bodies and the security and conflict-prevention political committee?
Will the Council be taking due account of the specific contribution women can make to working for peace?
- (PT) The issue raised by the Member is of fundamental importance. It concerns the involvement of women in the common foreign and security policy and the new crisis management structures, such as the security and conflict-prevention political committee.
The Member has asked whether the Council will be taking due account of women' s particular skills in working for peace.
It is quite clear that the contribution of women in working for peace and in other similar respects, particularly in mobilising civil society, is well-known and unquestionable.
We all know, without bothering to be diplomatic about this, that the role and representation of women in the decision-making process, either within the CFSP or generally within other structures, is inadequate.
We all know the efforts made by the international community in this area and we remember the conclusions of the Beijing Declaration of 1995 on this issue.
Next June there will be a Special Session of the UN General Assembly to draw international attention to the need for women to be involved in actions implemented within the Beijing Declaration. In particular, specific measures will be taken to encourage this involvement.
It should be realised that pro-active policies do not work in some areas of the decision-making process.
Greater involvement is needed in political actions, in the training process and in the administrative process in general.
We believe it is impossible to implement just one specific action, for example introducing quotas in the common foreign and security policy structures.
In our opinion, this is not appropriate and the Council has made no proposal in this respect.
However, it is the responsibility of each national government to carry out the necessary reforms of its own system of representation in order to guarantee adequate participation by women.
These issues are now being regulated at European level and recommendations are being made as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
We believe that, as all representation within the European Union is carried out by people from the Member States, it is the latter which are mainly responsible for mobilising as many women as possible who can rise within the decision-making process.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Seixas da Costa, very much for his reply, which gives us hope since it demonstrates that the Council understands the problem, is responding politically and perhaps even sympathises with the idea.
Nevertheless, I consider his reply to be basically too retrograde.
The Helsinki and Cologne Summits specifically gave the Portuguese Presidency the job of strengthening this new protection policy.
You have said that you are against quotas but in favour of references.
I would like to ask the Portuguese Presidency: do you not think it would be highly appropriate to include a reference, in the form of a recommendation, in this respect?
I believe that the role of the European Union should not be to remain behind the United Nations or to be content merely with a reference to what Beijing was about.
The European Union must be progressive.
Women must clearly be involved in political decisions - also decisions with regard to peace - and I ask the Portuguese Presidency to make some reference in this respect.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, thank you for the hope which you have placed in the Portuguese presidency. However, I am sure you are aware of the limits of what we can do, particularly in an area such as this.
I have no hesitation in saying this because in my own departments 80% of the officials are women, even in managerial posts.
It is therefore clear that hope must always be the last resort of political action and that equal opportunities and equal representation of the sexes must be the practical and specific goal in our daily life and actions.
To be totally frank and at the risk of being considered behind the times, I do believe that there are limits to what can be achieved by pro-active political action in this area.
Bearing in mind these limits, it will be rather difficult, when we set out to assess the new common foreign and security policy structures in terms of defence, to say to the Military Committee or the Military Staff that half of their soldiers should be female.
This is because it is up to the Member States whether or not they have female generals or brigadiers.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I cannot raise an issue like this just to appear politically correct. I must always be objectively honest.
Question No 10 by (H-0276/00):
Subject: Participation of research partners from the developing countries in environmental research programmes funded by the EU The key to the development of the developing countries is their ability to participate in development work themselves both as definers of problems and as seekers for solutions.
On the other hand, at EU level this approach is being poorly applied in relation to science and technology projects affecting developing countries.
The EU' s framework programmes do not extend to the developing countries.
This means that North African partners, for example, are not able to be involved in science and technology projects relating to the environment.
In fact no-one is preventing them from carrying out the research, but there are no funding opportunities, and thus the developing countries have no access to consortia as partners entitled to apply for funding.
Why is this not the case, given that opportunities have been devised for even Russia, for example, to be involved?
Has the matter been considered from the point of view of the extent to which, for example, desertification in North Africa or the problems of the Mediterranean affect the EU?
Is the EU prepared to provide greater responsibility in the form of funding to local researchers, so that research activities can combine even after the funding bodies have left, and to ensure that projects can be carried out without the investment of local researchers?
In 1998, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development to run from then until 2002.
One aspect of this Framework Programme is its four thematic programmes, which define priority areas for research, and its three horizontal programmes.
One of the latter is entitled 'Confirming the international role of Community research' and is intended to promote scientific and technological cooperation at international level and to help implement Community foreign policy in this area.
The general objectives of this international scientific cooperation are also set out in this Framework Programme and include support for the development of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership and a contribution to the economic, social and scientific development of developing countries.
In December 1998, the Council also adopted rules on participation by undertakings, research centres and universities and on disseminating research results in order to implement the Fifth Framework Programme.
With regard to the participation of legal entities of third countries and international organisations, all the indirect research activities under the thematic programmes are open to research bodies in Mediterranean non-Community countries and developing countries, in principle without Community financing. The only exception to this involves situations in which Community financing is regarded as absolutely vital to achieve the aims of the activity.
Article 6 of the Framework Programme authorises the participation by entities of third countries in specific research and technological development activities under the horizontal programme on the international role of Community research.
In January last year, the Council adopted the specific programmes for the Fifth Framework Programme which set out the objectives and activities for the various categories of third countries.
With regard to Mediterranean non-Community countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 55 million was established for research and development activities such as integrated coastal management in the Mediterranean, including environmental aspects, water management, natural resource management, conservation and restoration of the cultural heritage, socio-economic modernisation and so on.
With regard to developing countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 210 million was made available for specific activities such as those involving the adoption of innovations, the promotion of a sustainable relationship between population pressure, food safety and the use and management of ecosystems, the improvement of productivity and the prevention of damage to natural resources.
In addition, a grant system was created under a specific programme which allows graduates and doctoral students from developing countries and Mediterranean non-Community countries to work on European projects.
Funds were also allocated for coordination with Community technical assistance programmes, including the MEDA and EDF programmes, and also for Latin America and Asia.
The application of these three decisions is clearly the Commission' s responsibility, supported by the committees for the relevant programmes.
So far calls for specific proposals aimed at developing and Mediterranean countries have been made with a total budget of EUR 85.5 million.
Mr President-in-Office, I thank you for this reply.
I would, however, like a brief answer that is clearer and more precise.
Do we then have a situation where the developing countries may now apply for funds?
They were not able to before.
How is the situation different from, for example, that regarding the INTAS and Interreg programmes in Eastern Europe?
With regard to matters falling within the Commission' s specific competence, the only promise I can make, in answer to the Member' s supplementary question and her concerns, is that I will try to obtain a more concise answer which will probably have to be given in writing.
Question No 12 by (H-0277/00):
Subject: Common defence policy at the IGC There is a 'shortlist' of proposals for the IGC, according to which the Conference will confine itself largely to 'institutional' issues.
It is generally supposed that Portugal plans to expand the list at the June meeting.
Is this true, and will Portugal then bring the common defence policy onto the agenda for the IGC?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Helsinki European Council authorised the Portuguese presidency to establish the EU' s interim security and defence structures as from 1 March of this year.
These structures were established on this date.
Their activities are currently being developed so that they can assume a more specific and practical form and in particular so that the definitive model which we believe could start to operate next year can be agreed.
In parallel with the work on these practical aspects, a discussion is ongoing within the European Union on determining the mechanisms for participation both by EU Member States which are not members of NATO and by NATO countries which are not EU Member States. This discussion is occurring within the overall context of action on the Petersberg tasks specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The question which has arisen and which has also been raised by the Member - for which I thank you as it is my responsibility to chair the preparatory group of the Intergovernmental Conference - concerns the extent to which this issue may or may not fall within the scope of the IGC.
It will only be placed on the IGC' s agenda if and when it is confirmed that amendments need to be made to the Treaty on European Union in order to bring these structures into practical operation.
It is still not clear at this stage of our debate within the European Union whether or not amendments to the Treaty will be necessary.
As soon as this becomes clear, we will announce this.
The Portuguese Presidency will present a report to the Feira European Council in June giving an assessment of the state of progress and an opinion on whether or not these issues should be included within the IGC.
If these are to be included, this would only be confirmed during the French Presidency.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, European defence policy is at present being drafted, and different countries are involved in the task.
There are Member States in NATO and there are countries which are not in NATO.
Mr President-in-Office, do you believe that the European Union can frame a defence policy that would be independent of NATO, or will all the new arrangements be in harmony with NATO' s basic structures?
Mr SeppÃ€nen, your question indicates that you are clearly confused, unless there has been an interpreting error.
We are not talking about defence policy but about crisis management for which powers are now included within the Treaties.
The issue in question is not therefore a European defence policy or the creation of a European army.
The issue is crisis management and humanitarian actions which are commonly referred to in Community parlance as the 'Petersberg tasks' .
All the EU countries, including yours, can make a valuable contribution to this area.
We are trying at the moment not to create a European defence policy but rather a common culture of security allowing us to participate in crisis management.
In this respect, I can see no major problems.
We hope to ensure that all the various cultures which exist within the Union are compatible.
I would thank the Council.
I am nonetheless a little surprised at the answer.
I was under the impression that it was not possible to act if it was a national legal system which had pronounced judgement, because that would amount to interfering in national affairs.
In that way, Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam would really, of course, be revoked, that is to say if action were to be taken on the basis of national legal systems.
It can hardly be intended that a Member State should be able to do whatever it likes as long as it does so via its own legal system.
I would also ask if the Council intends to look more closely into this issue and perhaps examine it in more specific terms.
The crisis management and humanitarian actions specified in the Petersberg tasks to which the Helsinki European Council referred are actions which may be carried out by the European Union. However, our intention is to guarantee that these actions are totally compatible with what currently exists in the relations between certain EU Member States and the NATO countries.
The reason for this is that the mechanisms and means which exist for managing these crises are not extensive.
In fact, most of the time, these means belong to NATO.
As it is the means for military and security action which currently exist within the EU and NATO which will be mobilised, it is therefore essential to guarantee effective cooperation with all the NATO countries, including non-Community countries and particularly the candidate countries such as Turkey, Norway and Iceland.
It is clear that at a much wider level and bearing in mind the dimension of the operations, these actions will also require the involvement of the United States of America and Canada.
We therefore need broad cooperation which aims to guarantee the sharing of responsibility among all those countries which currently have a similar security and defence culture and objective.
Question No 13 by (H-0283/00):
Subject: Violation of the right to freedom of expression The Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, presided over by a single magistrate, recently banned from circulation a book by the author Mimis Androulakis, describing it as irreverent.
Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam states that the European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, Greece is a contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression and religious freedom.
In view of these considerations and given that the cornerstone of a people' s Europe is the fundamental commitment to freedom, pluralism and human rights, what view does the Council take of such a measure and will it intercede with the competent Greek authorities to put an end to the persecution of the author and the ban on his book?
Mr Papayannakis is asking the Council how it interprets this judgement of the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki banning from circulation a book by the author Mimis Androlakis which it describes as irreverent. He is also asking whether the Council intends to intercede with the Greek authorities.
I should like to explain that, under Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union respects a set of basic principles by reference to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The underlying aim of this article is to establish a kind of political supervision over the actions of Member States and to ensure that democratic principles and values are respected.
It is intended to guarantee the sharing of common values.
However, Article 6 cannot be invoked for the purpose of any type of interference in the administration of the internal affairs of Member States, particularly at judicial level.
The Union has no competence to intercede in the exercise of legal power by the Member States.
Therefore, the Council cannot interfere in the decision-making of the authorities.
The judgement delivered by the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, which is a judgement of a legal body of a Member State on a specific case, may be subject within the Greek legal system to an appeal to the higher national courts.
Having exhausted this recourse to the Greek courts, there would always be recourse to the Court of Human Rights.
My follow-up question is about how the decision at the Helsinki Summit about military, peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations is to be interpreted.
The decision provides an opportunity for the Applicant States too to participate in the military structures to be established by the EU.
Does this also apply to Turkey which has, of course, applied for membership?
Does this mean that a door has been opened for military cooperation between Turkey' s and the European Union' s forces in, for example, peace enforcement operations?
Mr SjÃ¶stedt, the Member States undertake to act within the framework determined by the Treaty.
This is why they signed the Treaty.
If a serious and persistent violation of citizens' rights were to be identified, according to the terms of these articles, then there would clearly be ways of interceding with the Member States.
The Union itself has ways of doing this but only in specific cases.
A case like this, in a democratic country like Greece, meets all the conditions to be judged and handled within the Greek legal system until the capacities for recourse within this system are exhausted.
If we were to intervene in a case like this, we would clearly be transposing to the Community dimension an issue for which there is a whole range of recourse in a country which fully respects human and citizens' rights.
Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 14 to 31 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Council.

Address by Mr Klestil, President of the Republic of Austria
Mr President, you expressed the wish to speak today at our Parliament' s formal sitting.
It has always been the case that any EU Member State Heads of State who express that wish are received among us with the consideration due to their person, the high office they hold and the nation over which they preside.
(Loud applause) It is in that spirit that I now welcome you on behalf of the European Parliament.
At the beginning of this year 2000, the constitution of the present Austrian Government has, as you know, given rise to some strong feelings in all the EU Member States, among their governments as well as their people.
(Loud applause)In the case of this Parliament, one question broadly transcends any political or national divergences between its Members, and that is their attachment to the values on which the European Union is founded and their determined resistance to the rise in racist and xenophobic ideologies.
(Loud applause)Mr President, we know that you were not in favour of this coalition, in which an extreme right-wing party has an equal share, and that you spared no efforts to find an alternative solution...
(Uproar on the far right)...and that, before agreeing to what you believed you could not prevent, you demanded and obtained from the political leaders concerned a strong commitment to the values on which the European Union are founded.
(Applause, and protests from the far right)It is in that context and in a spirit of profound friendship and respect for the Austrian people that we will listen carefully to the message you wished to pass on to the European Parliament.
We have no doubt, Mr President, that it will take account of the very serious concerns our Parliament expressed by an overwhelming majority, on 3 February last. Without further ado, I therefore give you the floor.
(As President Klestil prepared to take the floor, many left-wing Members left the Chamber.
Interjection from Mrs Muscardini: "So that is democracy, not to give a hearing to speakers..." )
Financial services and complementary pensions
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0059/2000 by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on implementing the framework for financial markets: Action Plan [COM(1999) 232 - C5-0114/1999 - 1999/2117(COS)];
A5-0053/2000 by Mr Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication "Towards a single market for supplementary pensions - Results of the consultations on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market" [COM(1999) 134 - C5-0135/1999 - 1999/2131(COS)].
Before we begin I would like to advise you that, since this is a night sitting and we have a lot of work to get through, I am going to be very strict in applying time limits.
I therefore also ask Members to show an appropriate degree of self-discipline so that we can finish at a reasonable time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if I had to point here and now to two complex issues in the economic field, I would no doubt choose the following: the consolidation of the financial markets and the approximation of the direct taxation regulations - specifically tax on savings - which is under discussion.
The debate which we held recently on the bodies for collective investment in transferable securities and the reactions to the report on pension funds, which we will hear shortly, demonstrate the complexity and importance of these issues.
These two issues, the liberalisation of the financial services market and taxation, are dealt with in the action plan which is the subject of my report.
It is therefore appropriate to thank all the groups for their cooperation and confirm once again to the Commission that it can rely on the active cooperation of the European Parliament in the implementation of this plan, and we will not disregard our duties, but exercise them responsibly.
The complexity of the action plan also reflects the ambitious nature of the report presented by the Commission, which contains 43 measures and involves all the sectors in the field (stock exchanges, banks, investment funds, insurance, etc.) and which applies to what has come to be called the 'new economy' , which is - according to the Lisbon Summit - one of the elements which will help to put an end to unemployment in Europe.
What is included in these measures?
What is intended through these measures?
In my judgement, to sum up, it is the following: the liberalisation of the financial sectors and the updating of the regulations on supervision and control in order to achieve a European financial market which is at least as competitive as the United States financial market.
In the explanatory statement, I offer a detailed comparison of the two types of market.
In order to achieve these two objectives, the Commission proposes a truly arguable and risky formula: the speeding up of the legal process, which, in turn, would involve three actions.
Firstly, a reduction in the standards which need to be included in a regulation or directive, that is to say, which require the participation of this Parliament.
Secondly, limiting those standards to the definition of the general approaches and basic principles which must be established in this field, allowing the Commission the possibility of implementing them.
Thirdly, granting the Commission broad powers of interpretation.
I do not doubt that we have to speed up the process, Commissioner, but this Parliament is not prepared to relinquish the powers which it has taken so long to acquire.
Therefore, one of the first tasks which we will have to undertake together is to find a model which will satisfy both objectives.
With regard to liberalisation, the first of the tasks which the Commission proposes, the Commission starts from one premise: the consolidation of the single market in financial services requires the removal of the barriers which hinder its operation.
We could not agree more.
The consequence is that, in order for the market to function, these barriers must be removed.
Again we agree, but we know that there are difficulties in this approach resulting from the need to reconcile the objective of liberalisation with the objective of protecting investors.
Firstly, the barriers are not identified.
Commissioner, it is not sufficient to be able to deduce what they are from the measures proposed by the Commission.
Personally, I would have liked to have seen a list of those national measures which, in accordance with the Directive on financial services, are hindering the operation of the market in each country.
Secondly, the solution proposed by the Commission still raises difficulties.
It is ridiculous that a financial company has to operate while being subject to, and having to have knowledge of, fifteen different legislations, but it is at least as ridiculous that an investor - especially a non-professional investor - should end up needing to contract services, bound by regulations which he or she does not know, from companies whose solvency is unknown, and, in the event of legal dispute, he or she has to take action in a foreign country, with foreign jurisdiction and procedures.
Liberalisation must therefore be implemented in parallel with the increase in measures relating to control and taxation.
With regard to control measures, we have a new problem: the need to adapt the competence and jurisdictions of authorities which are still national and which, on the whole, apply differing models, to a different world affected by globalisation, international competition and free movement of capital.
Finally, Mr President, my personal conviction is that, if we do not want liberalisation to give rise to distortions in competition and the flight of capital to more beneficial climates inside and outside the Union, the correct operation of the market in financial services will not be possible without a certain degree of approximation of the laws which regulate savings.
These are the concerns which are raised in my report. These concerns reflect a constructive attitude towards cooperation with the Commission, which I have always considered to be a loyal ally of this Parliament, in the development of an issue which is so very complex.
Mr President, I am referring, as you have said, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to the Commission communication on the action plan for the implementation of the framework for the financial markets.
As the main rapporteur, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, has pointed out, in this regard there are two questions which are, firstly, taxation - without fiscal harmonisation it would be very difficult to establish Community financial markets - and secondly, a legal framework.
With regard to the legal framework, I believe that there is a paradox in this sector.
The more liberalised an economy is, the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets.
The American economy, which is probably one of the most liberalised economies in existence, is the economy which lays down the most detailed regulations for the financial markets.
The Commission, in its proposal, on page 18 of the Spanish version, after recognising the competence of Parliament by means of codecision, in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, tells us that we should move towards very flexible procedures by means of comitology.
Comitology in these cases usually means taking away with one hand what is given with the other.
In this respect, I am in total agreement with the conclusions of the rapporteur.
I believe that we need some very specific legislation and I am sure that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in the drawing up of this legislation.
As the rapporteur said a moment ago, we cannot expect confidence on the part of investors, consumers and, ultimately, the financial markets, if they do not have a specific legal framework in which to operate.
The only way to do this is to replace the current rigid regulations with a set of specific Community regulations which will produce certainty in this very delicate sector of the economy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy deplores the fact that the action plan for the financial markets does not take into account the problems which industry, small and medium-sized businesses in particular, is facing with regard to financing cross-border activities.
Many businesses, ranging from small businesses in border areas to large multinationals, would like to treat their accounts as one national account.
For example, they would like to use funds in their euro account in country A to settle an account in debit in country B. In this way, they would pay less interest.
Existing legislation, however, prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique.
The world of banking has already driven this problem home to you on numerous occasions.
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would now like to ask the Commissioner whether it would be possible to set up a forum group which carries out market research into the legal and fiscal obstacles for businesses, SMBs, in particular, when they finance their cross-border transactions within the euro zone, in order to solve this problem.
I would appreciate a reply to this.
Mr President, in view of the Resolution of 3 December 1998, to which the Kuckelkorn report does not appear to contain a reference, Parliament once again is obliged to request that the Commission produce as soon as possible a directive or, as Mr Medina Ortega appropriately suggested, a Community law coordinating the various national laws.
The Commission appears to be somewhat apathetic in this regard, and seems to be concentrating rather on producing a directive on prudential rules for pension funds, which is easier to achieve but less effective in terms of decision-making in relation to the elimination of barriers to labour mobility and the coordination of taxation systems.
The legal bases are very important, and, clearly, different: in view of the various judgements delivered by the Court of Justice, pension funds could be governed by Article 47 and Article 55, the removal of barriers to labour mobility could be governed by Article 42 and the coordination of national tax systems by Article 94.
However, I would stress the need and the desirability to develop a single package, because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which tones down the extreme positions contained in certain proposals for amendments.
I refer, in particular, to biometric risks, which are a very important factor but which should be dealt with on the basis of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Indeed, making cover for biometric risks obligatory would be likely to make the system very inflexible.
I therefore feel that funds which cover biometric risks should receive privileged treatment, and that any inflexibility of the system could, in effect, result in negative imbalances for the beneficiaries.
Mr President, we see the reality of the situation all around us.
If 23% of Europe' s population is over 65 years old today, this figure will have reached 40% by 2025, and the proportion of four working people to every retired person will have become two working people to every retired person by 2020.
This demonstrates the pressing need to allow the development of supplementary self-funded high return pension schemes in the European Union to usefully supplement state contributory pension schemes.
As we all know, our Member States are working towards ambitious structural reforms, but it is also up to the European Union to intervene in the area of pensions, particularly supplementary pensions, in order to facilitate the free movement of workers in the context of the single market, to establish a genuine single capital market and also to ensure that equality between men and women is respected.
With this in mind, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been concerned to reconcile the security and efficiency of supplementary pensions for future pensioners as it is true that the guarantee of a high level of security for beneficiaries encourages healthy and desirable competition between European pension funds.
This is why our Committee feels that the proposal for a directive on Community prudential regulations applying to pension funds must be tabled and adopted as quickly as possible, bearing in mind our discussion today, with proper guarantees for the external and internal supervision of the funds concerned and for the calculation of their prudential commitment.
Furthermore, in order to encourage the free movement of workers, we felt it essential to quickly improve the transferability and the acquisition of pension rights from supplementary schemes from different European countries.
This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
. (FR) Mr President, I would like to say first of all in this debate that we are expecting to see a proposal for a framework-directive very soon, which will guarantee the development of a genuine single market for supplementary pension funds under the second and third pillars, given that the first pillar, which covers all biometric risks, must remain the cornerstone of the European Union' s social protection system.
This directive must in particular establish a framework to remove obstacles to the free choice of a pension fund, to the free movement of people, to the free provision of services and to charging double taxes.
We recommend a solution based on the principle that contributions should be tax-deductible, and that supplementary invested income should be taxed in accordance with the income tax law in force in the country of residence.
On the controversial issue of whether supplementary pension schemes should cover biometric risks, I wish to state that from the point of view of taxation, pension funds that do not cover these risks will not be discriminated against in relation to those that do.
With regard to prudential regulation, this should not be disproportionate, so that the security of the fund is guaranteed.
That covers the general framework.
I am grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having included all the relevant conclusions of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities in the motion for a resolution.
I now come to the report by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil.
With regard to the action plan which seeks to deepen the internal financial services market, I would like to issue a warning about certain strategists who are attempting to hold the liberalisation of the financial services sector hostage, because the work that has been undertaken on the taxation of savings has not made the progress they would have wanted.
As matters currently stand, we should remember that a single market for capital and financial services can function perfectly well without tax harmonisation.
Faced with proposals that confuse ambition and reality, I wish to emphasise that establishing a European Committee for stock exchange operations is certainly not the number one priority and, as I have no speaking time left, Mr President, I will give an explanation of vote tomorrow to say the rest of what I still wanted to say, because as draftsperson of the Committee' s opinion and as a speaker on the second report, it is really impossible to say everything in two minutes.
Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, Mr Kuckelkorn, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the Commission for the sterling work they have done.
The communication from the Commission is liberal-minded and forward-looking.
Why should Parliament now adopt a less liberal position and vote in favour of stagnating structures?
We should not define the form and scope of the directive too narrowly. What we need to do instead is to view the issue openly and from a wider perspective.
It is essential that we do not define the nature and scope of the risk coverage in a restrictive way.
Instead, we should be open-minded and look at the issue from a wider perspective and encourage a framework which is based on liberal markets and vigorous competition between different types of pension schemes.
What we should promote is the freedom of choice of the employee and the employer to choose the kind of scheme that best suits their interests
The question of biometric risks has proved to be of a controversial nature.
My firm opinion is that all the different pension schemes should be covered by the same directive in order not to protect certain types of schemes from competition.
Consumers and employers must have the right to choose the most suitable form of pension scheme and, therefore, schemes covering biometric risks should be treated under the same directive as schemes not covering these risks.
Both form a pension scheme but focus on different competitive benefits.
Mr Kuckelkorn, no-one in this Parliament is of the opinion that supplementary pensions should not cover the longevity risk, through the purchase of an annuity or by some other tool.
It is not the task of the European Union to define the nature and scope of the risk coverage concerning other biometric risks.
But it should be determined individually by each employee, as the Commission proposes.
Leaving this kind of decision to the individual is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.
Allowing supplementary pension scheme managers the freedom to invest in a diverse range of instruments increases the security of the overall investment portfolio.
Increased freedom promotes the functioning of the capital market and has a significant impact on the growth of venture capital in Europe.
I am committed to the idea that we, as the European Parliament, should encourage healthy competition and the freedom of choice of the individual.
This must not only mean a single market for supplementary pensions, but the whole package of legislation concerning the financial services.
Mr President, the Socialists support the Commission' s efforts to establish a transparent and fluid internal financial services market.
It is in the interest of economic operators and all consumers that the costs of capital and financial intermediation should be as low as possible.
European financial markets are currently suffering from compartmentalisation along national lines, even though, following the globalisation of the international financial system, we are seeing the widespread phenomenon of mergers and internationalisation.
The action plan aims to make the European market equal to the American market.
The success of the American market is basically due to 'king dollar' .
It is paradoxical in this context to note that some of the most ardent supporters of financial liberalisation at the same time oppose the euro.
The real introduction of the euro in 2002, however, will result in transparency and competition, which will force the national markets to adapt more quickly than they had anticipated.
The problem is that the legislative bodies, both national and European, are taking a long time to adapt the law to reality.
Personally, I would not be opposed to an accelerated legislative procedure, on condition that it does not end up as a mere exercise for non-accountable technocrats.
The Commission could make a useful contribution in the form of proposals simplifying and codifying the 11 or so directives that govern the banking sector, the 8 directives on investment funds, and the 21 directives dealing with the insurance sector.
There is not only a problem of coherence in the various legislations on the different sectors of the financial world, but in particular there is the problem of supervising and protecting the public interest.
John Kenneth Galbraith condemned the mistaken idea that there is any link between money and intelligence.
The lure of profit is such that the financial world tends to create a form of collective euphoria, which often leads to financial crisis.
The free movement of capital must be accompanied by an efficient regulatory and prudential framework, because supervision of the various markets is divided up according to country and sector, but at the same time, as a result of mergers, acquisitions and amalgamations, boundaries between banks, insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds are disappearing.
Finland and the United Kingdom have drawn conclusions from this and have established a single prudential authority for the whole sector.
Article 105(6) of the Treaty stipulates that the Council can entrust the ECB with specific tasks relating to policies on the prudential supervision of credit companies and other financial companies, with the exception of insurance companies.
Should the Council not use the Intergovernmental Conference to establish the necessary legal basis for the Council to be able to entrust the ECB with certain specific tasks relating to the prudential supervision of insurance companies too?
I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, for the tenacity with which he argues in favour of supplementary pensions and for these to become in effect a second pillar of insurance for old age.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by pointing out that it amounts to saying that whilst we should not discard insurance products we must favour products which cover biometric risks.
Mr President, Commissioner, if Europe is to grow, attract capital and create jobs, the single market for financial services must be turned into a reality.
Up until now, it has mostly been a matter of words and all too few concrete measures.
At present, the financial services market and, through this, Europe' s power to grow have been impeded by countless national regulations and administrative complications.
These are detrimental not only to companies but also, of course, to Europe' s citizens.
The development of the Internet is, and will be, of great importance to the provision of financial services across national borders.
Above all, it is consumers who will benefit from this development because they will have greater choice and access to lower prices.
We Liberals do not regard tax harmonisation as a prerequisite for bringing the single market for financial services to fruition, even if a degree of harmonisation may prove to be necessary to avoid harmful competition over taxes.
The euro has stabilised economic development and provided better opportunities to reduce the costs of acquiring capital, something which benefits both companies and private households.
It is my conviction that, if the EU is to be able to provide Europe' s citizens with growth and strength, then all Member States must participate fully in the EU project, that is to say, be members of EMU.
Mr Romano Prodi' s statement today in a Swedish newspaper to the effect that Sweden could stay outside EMU is therefore both surprising from an economic point of view and doubtful in terms of the Treaties.
The Commission' s Green Paper on liberalising complementary forms of pension protection is something we welcome.
It is nonetheless important to emphasise that pension cover in Europe is characterised by national diversity and that there is no need to harmonise the various systems in order to create a single market.
It is important that a large number of systems should exist side by side. This increases choice and diversity.
However, it is desirable, in order to avoid double taxation, to introduce a minimum degree of harmonisation in regard to the Member States' treatment of supplementary pensions for tax purposes.
I also consider that the Member States themselves should be able to determine what the system should look like, for example whether or not the care of relatives should be covered by pensions.
This is an issue which can be resolved better at national level.
In committee there was lively discussion on biometric risks.
Views were put forward to the effect that only those systems which cover risks of this kind are to be included under the directive.
We do not believe that this should be the case, especially in view of the need for small and medium-sized companies to be able to do business.
Freedom of choice is emphatically a good thing.
Finally, I want to congratulate Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn for two important reports designed to create a competitive Europe.
Mr President, where supplementary pensions are concerned, the crucial issue is whether one wants to provide pensioners with security in their old age or to reinforce Europe' s capital markets.
These are not only two quite different goals, but it is also difficult to combine them in one and the same system.
The Commission' s proposal and both the reports we are debating today give priority to the needs of the capital market.
The hope is that the market-based pensions will then also prove to be good for pensioners in thirty or forty years' time.
How matters will turn out, however, we do not know.
If one considers how Europe has changed during the last thirty to forty years and acknowledges that circumstances are going to change just as much in the future, then one can see how uncertain such forecasts are.
There is a large deficit when it comes to security and solidarity in the pensions area because the risk is so great and because there can never be enough security and solidarity.
Supplementary assurances are therefore a problem.
They are, of course, much less secure than a system of basic pensions which has been financed on the basis of solidarity.
I also believe that supplementary assurances and supplementary pensions may be needed, but then their managers ought to be obliged to invest in such instruments as provide solid savings in the long term, instead of having short-term rates on the stock exchange and global financial capitalism determine how matters will stand for pensioners in the future.
I also believe it would have been commendable if these supplementary pension systems could have been run as pension funds on the basis of solidarity under the aegis of trade unions, as happens in certain Member States.
Even if these too are market-based, they offer much more in terms of stability and security than the privatised pension assurances.
It now looks as if we are to have a liberal arrangement in the pensions field in Europe, and I shall therefore advise my voters to invest their surplus funds in safer instruments than private pension assurances.
To young people I would say: pin your hopes on education and on developing your skills. And to older people I would say: acquire a nice, inexpensive place to live in the autumn of your years.
We politicians ought to be putting our faith in a good, sound system of basic pensions.
Mr President, the European Commission' s Green Paper has caused many to reach for their pens, so much so that in the motion for a resolution, the objective of the Green Paper has been lost almost completely.
Similarly, the intention of the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, who has carried out a vast amount of work, for which I would like to thank him, is not expressed very well in the motion for a resolution.
It is now up to us to see that an acceptable document is produced tomorrow during the vote.
The principal aim is for workers, when they move to another Member State, to be able to transfer their supplementary pension schemes and continue to pay into them without forfeiting their pension rights and with a guarantee that their accumulated pension rights will retain their value.
Unfortunately, the Commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish.
We have a long way to go before the compulsory transfer of value between Member States will be a reality.
The first obstacle we need to negotiate is the mutual recognition of supervisory rules.
It is then important that an adequate distinction is drawn between pension funds and commercial insurance companies.
A pension fund has an obligation to be generally acceptable.
A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks.
Insurance companies do offer their participants a choice, and their products do not cover biometric risks.
Since the risks covered are not identical, government inspection will also vary for pension funds and insurance companies.
On account of this supervision, complete freedom of investment is justified in both cases.
This leads on average to higher returns.
We need to avoid creating a situation where the individual is forced, on account of significantly lower returns on pension funds, to enter the wild investment woods in search of their supplementary pension schemes, where the big bad wolf is after their money.
The second obstacle is the levying of taxes within the Member States.
Taking into account the fast approaching ageing of the population, it is desirable for fiscal systems to promote the development of supplementary pensions.
The EET model, where premium payments are tax-free and the retirement payout is taxed, meets this requirement and is also common in most Member States.
I hope that Parliament and the Commission will make the internal market for supplementary pension schemes a reality along these lines.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to express my opinion on the single market for supplementary pensions.
Firstly, I would like to express my agreement with the model based on the intergenerational solidarity of the basic state systems, to which are added the supplementary capitalisation systems.
On the other hand, I would also like to express my agreement with what Mr Kuckelkorn says in relation to the correlation established between pension systems which cover biometric risks.
We are not talking about systems for financial investment but about pension plans.
On the other hand, we are also in agreement with the participation of workers and the urgent harmonisation of the tax provisions.
Nevertheless, we have to clarify the basic concept of pensions in a way which includes the supplementary pension schemes which cover biometric risks.
It is necessary to clarify, on the other hand, that the single system applies to every type of worker in the European Union; there are not only workers who work for themselves in the European Union but also many cooperative workers, fortunately.
We must opt for collective systems, but not only company systems - something which is mentioned in the report - but also sectoral ones, taking particular account of SMBs, which have been mentioned by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel.
We must take account of the great difficulties which exist within the Union with regard to the development of supplementary systems.
We therefore understand and support the regulatory and supervisory systems for the protection of the rights of participants, but we must put the emphasis on the areas where systems are still underdeveloped, in aspects such as providing information or implementing new plans.
Finally, I would like to underline our support for the creation of a European pension fund with the participation of the different economic sectors and the pension providers.
Mr President, the ageing of the population and the reduction in the numbers of people of working age, while real enough, have been put forward by the Commission and other Members as a reason to open up the way for pension funds for supplementary pension schemes.
The dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course.
The capitalisation mechanisms mean adapting retirement pensions to the single market and the introduction of the euro.
Moving in this direction entails the risk of a system based on private insurance, which would gradually replace social security.
Welfare and retirement pensions would no longer be rights but would be commodities subject to the laws of the market.
The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets.
A system of this type is very dangerous and deeply unfair as it benefits the richest people, those who can save money, and leaves the poorest with a pittance of a retirement pension.
Mr Kuckelkorn' s initial report considered the retirement pension primarily as social insurance against certain life risks, rather than a process of accumulating capital.
It has been radically changed, however, by the adoption of amendments unreservedly supporting the mechanisms of capitalisation.
I cannot, therefore, approve this report which makes the Commission' s approach even worse.
On the contrary, we think that a high level of social protection must be maintained, based on solidarity, regardless of financial profitability.
The contributory system guarantees the rights of the employed and provides them with a pension, in the framework of national solidarity between the working population and the retired population, between generations, between men and women, between the public and the private sectors.
The objective should be to obtain new resources and to upgrading the purchasing power of retirement pensions from contributions which could be raised from taxes on financial products at the same level as those which apply to wages.
Employers' contributions should be linked to companies' employment policies and taxes set up on those which make people redundant.
Mr President, as medical advances contribute to a steady ageing of our populations, the burden of pension provision throughout the Union becomes ever more costly.
In the UK, as in the US, Chile and Singapore and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, the burden on the state and succeeding generations has been significantly eased through the successful provision of supplementary second and third pillar private and occupational pension schemes, involving funds which grow to provide pension benefits following the retirement of the individuals.
Both pillars have the advantage of being resistant to demographic change, and third-pillar portable schemes, in particular, which are not restricted to single companies, enhance labour mobility and choice for the investors and are much more affordable to small and medium enterprises.
I welcome the fact that there is widespread recognition in this House to extend these supplementary schemes throughout Europe, even if there are disagreements over their precise nature and the way that the funds are to be invested.
The problem needs to be addressed urgently in my opinion, with demographic pressures in recent years already generating deficits in the pay-as-you-go schemes in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
It is even predicted that if the current trend continues some countries will be facing costs of up to 20% of their GDP in the next ten years for their pension liabilities.
There are, of course, many risks with equity investments, but there are even greater risks to Europe with stagnant economies.
Growing pension funds will dynamise our economies by providing large additional capital funds for investment not only in the EU, but also in developing markets, with greater prospects for future growth and returns on investment for our pensioners.
In the case of defined contribution schemes, which give the investor a direct stake in the overall health of the national economy, there will also be a sense of participation in the country of that individual.
The state scheme will of course remain the primary mechanism for basic provision in old age.
But personal responsibility and choice will become the watchwords of success if the demographic challenges of the coming century are to be met successfully.
That is why we should not be too prescriptive regarding the issues of biometric risks or investment strategies.
We need a light-touch regulatory framework, with bilateral tax agreements, which will ensure the portability for those EU nationals wishing to work abroad throughout the Union, achieve a genuine single market in financial services and provide maximum choice to the European investor.
Mr President, this report seeks to harmonise supplementary pensions in Europe.
In fact, it seeks nothing less than to open up all European pension schemes to the financial markets.
Indeed, it recommends the development of a truly single pension fund market by referring to the inevitability of resorting to capitalisation.
It should be noted, by the way, that when the financial interests of the most powerful are involved, they are not slow to forget the principle of solidarity and to propose a single model.
This report puts forward cynical arguments and seeks to give credence to the idea that only capitalisation would ensure better protection of low incomes.
The truth is that it is not an attempt to supplement state pension schemes, but rather to gradually empty them of all substance.
Those who are employed know full well, however, that a pension is theirs by right.
They fought for this right, which is based on intergenerational solidarity.
That is why they do not, under any circumstances, want to see their pensions gambled on the stock exchange.
In several countries, powerful social movements have already opposed similar attempts.
Their threats have to this day prevented the French government, for example, from introducing pension funds.
This is in perfect harmony with past, present and future struggles, and it is in support of them that we shall be voting against a report that reduces this Parliament to the level of a lobby for high finance.
Retired people need an adequate, stable and safe pension.
Pension funds and the stock exchange will never be able to guarantee that.
On this issue, as on many others, a choice must be made between increasing the profits of a few or satisfying the needs of all.
Mr President, I would like to start by paying tribute to Mr Kuckelkorn, because he has drafted a courageous report in my opinion, given Germany' s rigid and inflexible pension situation.
He clearly wants to take steps towards developing a European internal market for supplementary pension schemes.
I think he deserves tribute for this.
I myself come from a country where a very extensive second pillar of supplementary pensions exists.
Almost 90% of the professional population in the private sector are in pension schemes which guarantee a wage-related pension.
This also includes small and medium-sized businesses.
With a capacity of over EUR 150 billion, the pension fund of Dutch civil servants is the largest institutional investor of its kind within the international capital market.
Pension funds in the Netherlands are daring to take increasing risks in their investments.
In 1999, nearly half of the pension money was invested in shares, albeit under strict prudential conditions.
But the average return over the past five years has been around 15%, instead of the usual 4%.
It has been shown that it is precisely the compulsory nature of participation in collective pension funds which encourages these excellent results.
The fact that funds are spread over generations and risks means that the funds can invest in shares to such a high level.
On balance, this yields a far better return for individual members, much better than they could ever achieve on their own via a savings plan or investment fund.
Therefore, I must open Mrs Kauppi' s eyes and disprove her reasoning that individual workers would be better off making their own choices, even if they belong to the fortunate ones who do not have any hereditary diseases, who are young and male, because, unfortunately, Mrs Kauppi, we women are even worse off under individual schemes as we live longer than men on average.
Consequently, I would strongly discourage you from formulating a principle of free choice at European level.
If I were you, I would leave this to the Member States and the free market.
As for biometric risks, other speakers have already talked enough about this.
I fully endorse Mr Kuckelkorn in this respect and would argue that such a definition is very important because we are expecting a number of additional directives from the European Commission.
Mr President, we are voting against this report advocating self-funded pension schemes.
This system restricts employees who want to guarantee a retirement pension for themselves that will give them enough to live on, to make their money available to investment funds, trusts, insurance companies or other private financial groups.
At the same time, it makes the value of pensions subordinate to the financial markets, in other words, to speculation.
What is more, all those whose salaries are too low for them to be able to pay into a pension fund will be entitled only to a very meagre pension.
Referring to demographic changes in order to justify this is a swindle.
Productivity has increased tenfold in the last fifty years and if company owners and shareholders had not transformed the fruits of this productivity into purely private profit, it would now enable salaries to be higher and would guarantee appropriate pensions for everyone.
If contributory pension schemes are having problems, it is only because there are fewer employed people in proportion to the number of retired people, because there are too many unemployed and because salaries are too low.
So, if there is a shortfall in pension funds, States should take over by deducting the necessary amounts from the profits of industrial and financial groups.
Mr President, the ageing of the European population means that we will have huge problems when it comes to footing the bill for our statutory pension schemes.
Member States where supplementary schemes are under-developed compared to statutory pension schemes will feel the pinch most.
Unfortunately, we are forced to note that this is the case for the majority of Member States.
A developed collective system of supplementary pensions, compulsory if so required by the relevant Member State, considerably reduces the dependence on demographic factors and enables the pension fund, in the role of investor, to derive maximum benefit from the possibilities which financial markets have to offer.
Needless to say, the objective of making employees more mobile and flexible within a large single European market and the euro zone will inevitably lead to interest in supplementary pension schemes.
One of the philosophies underlying the European Union and the Monetary Union requires that the internal market should be used to the full.
As such, you, as a worker, should be able to take your accumulated pension rights with you to another European country.
To this end, we need to develop a legal framework at European level at the earliest opportunity.
Why should a German employee, for example, have to wait ten years before he has built up a pension and a Dutch person only one year?
As such, this German person suffers a considerable handicap with regard to mobility.
What is more, the fiscal treatment of pensions at the time when contributions are made and at the time of payout should be brought into line.
Commissioner, you deal with taxes, what is the latest on this score?
I have to say that this parliamentary discussion seems to be more about a complete harmonisation than coordination.
This, unfortunately, is at the expense of Member States which already have their house in order.
One such country is the Netherlands, initially presented as a role model for all other Member States and gradually relegated to curiosity status.
But the Dutch system is a worthy system which accepts old age, surviving dependants and vulnerable groups within the labour market as they are.
The supplementary pension scheme is based on collective feeling and solidarity.
This enables SMBs - and specifically SMBs with reference to the UK MEPs - to cover biometric risks at relatively low cost.
Top of the list are payability and security, which is not the case for the proposals submitted by some MEPs.
Mr Bolkestein, how do you intend to bring the discussion back to the crux of the matter, namely mobile pensions for mobile people?
Mr President, firstly can I say that the EMAC report is pretty good and I hope we do not amend it too much.
The key word is "supplementary" pensions.
We are not trying to relieve poverty or provide a basic income in retirement.
The second point is that it is important that we provide decent pensions to enable citizens to move around Europe.
So I welcome the emphasis on removing the restrictions on the investment of pension fund portfolios and support the objective of removing barriers to labour mobility.
The key is to keep it simple or it will not work, it will not remove the obstacles.
As Mr Tannock has said, there are demographic pressures upon us and it is in our interest to facilitate the development of supplementary pension schemes both around Europe and also in many countries within Europe.
On the issue of biometric risks, which we have heard a lot about, clearly a pension by definition has one biometric risk, which is longevity.
Once you start building on top of that, you are on dangerous ground if you make it a condition of a passport.
What we need is to have a very simple proposition, and then let the market sort the rest of it out because that is what the market is for.
The biometric risks problem means many different things to different people.
We must try and get a simple product which is marketable and can be moved around this market, because if we do not, we will end up with a product that does not work at all that the different Member States cannot make use of.
So the key is to keep it simple and make it work.
Mr President, for how long will workers be forced to sacrifice one-third of their salary to government and state pension funds, in the hope of receiving a pension in their old age, while those government and state funds are so designed that they make pensions vanish faster than Houdini himself could have done?
Mrs Laguiller, the people trusted the states and the governments, especially the pledges made by left-wing governments, but they have been left with peanuts.
Every day, thousands upon thousands of elderly people reach retirement age and ask their governments, "Where are our pensions?" And the governments reply, "You are living too long and there is no more money left to give you" , concealing the truth.
And what is the truth? The governments have squandered the funds and made off with the workers' salaries.
Shame on the Socialist governments for failing to provide for workers in their old age!
Despite the fact that there may now be a way of safeguarding this capital - the sweat of the brows of the workers - by capitalising pension funds, we are told that we must not do this, because the national governments want to get their hands on private pension funds as well.
It is time to change the tune. We must give to Caesar what is Caesar' s and to God what is God' s.
Mr President, we are facing a difficult issue, as evidenced by the large number of speakers.
I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Kuckelkorn as rapporteur, for the huge effort he has made to achieve this report.
I am slightly less pleased with Mr Kuckelkorn' s tabling of amendments, because he has tabled a great many and they go beyond the requirements of the current objective.
I think that we should differentiate between the two Kuckelkorns.
I believe that the systems we should pursue in Europe should be based on two principles.
One of them is simply the statutory pay-as-you-go system and the other is the system of capital cover which is an extension of the former, it is just that the only problem we are facing is that all countries have very different starting positions.
It is true that a country such as the Netherlands has managed to strike a fine balance between the two.
Other countries have managed to do this to a lesser extent. Also, for example, countries where nearly all pensions are capital cover systems, such as Great Britain, do not meet expectations because, although the risks for the government are reasonably small, the cover for the retired is extremely modest.
In England, if there is a hard frost, for example, people are unable to pay their bills.
I do not think that this is the right way forward.
First and foremost, we need to remember that this is about people and based on this, we must develop a system which makes sound pension schemes possible, and we must, as far as we can, leave this task to the Member States.
We should keep intervention to a minimum.
We need to bear our starting point in mind, namely that if people move from one country to another to work or retire, it should be possible for them to take their pensions with them.
The Commission has always attempted to do this and I do believe that it has succeeded in its aim.
I think that two issues still need tackling.
Firstly, risks tied in with the second and third pillars should be sufficiently covered, because far too little has been said about this.
Secondly, the first pillar should at long last be defined, as the first pillar in one country is quite different from that in another country.
And if we could bring all of this a bit closer together, we would perhaps have far fewer problems than we have at the moment.
Mr President, may I start by extending warm thanks to both rapporteurs, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Kuckelkorn, for the reports they have drafted and the efforts they have made.
In fact, could I also warmly thank all other speakers this evening - nearly thirty of them - for the comments they have made and questions they have asked.
This is an important matter, both the action plan for financial services and the pension issue, and it is heartening to see so many speakers take part in the exchange of opinions.
As far as Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil' s report is concerned, I would like to note that, according to the Commission, it is an even-handed report which strikes the right balance between an important political vision and the technical measures required in order to make progress.
Perhaps you will allow me to make a few observations in this respect. I hope, at the same time, to comment on the amendments which have been tabled.
The Commission welcomes the attention which the report pays to the need for capital markets to function to optimum effect.
In this context, I would also refer to Parliament' s request for streamlined rules for stock market access, market manipulation and revision of the investment services directive.
The opening up of financial markets should, naturally, go hand in hand with an adequate level of consumer protection, and this was also requested this evening in this debate.
They are thus parallel processes, with liberalisation on one side and consumer protection on the other, and these are the two objectives which you will find wherever financial markets are at issue. These are the European Commission' s twin objectives.
We also have a few specific proposals in this respect.
Firstly, we would propose the provision of better information on financial products for citizens.
Secondly, we would like to see better and clearer dispute procedures for citizens who are dissatisfied with foreign financial dealers.
Thirdly, we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules.
The fourth proposal concerns electronic commerce, or e-commerce for short.
Policy and legislation should make provision for e-commerce without creating unnecessary barriers.
Our citizens, on the other hand, must experience the same level of confidence and protection for transactions on-line as they do off-line.
Finally, an adequate supervisory structure is essential to guarantee the financial solvency of our institutions.
Does this mean that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will be given a central supervisory role?
The ECB itself is of the opinion that this is not necessary.
There is in fact an alternative, to wit, a coming together of supervisory systems.
At this juncture, Mr President, I would like to bring up a remark made by Mrs Randzio-Plath.
It is an important remark.
Mrs Randzio-Plath has picked up some noises from the OECD and mentioned the word mega-risk.
Indeed, I think she is right to indicate the risks which can be inherent in financial movements.
She has referred to large mergers which are taking place and, without necessarily sharing her view regarding these risks, I would also like to refer to statements made by Mr Lamfalussi, who is well-known within the European financial system, and who has also indicated the need to be able to cope adequately with the financial risks and system risks which are heading our way.
This is a very important matter.
I still believe that coordination, cooperation and harmonisation of supervisory systems are enough to withstand the risks, but, once again, in the interest of the case itself, I would like to draw the attention of Mrs Randzio-Plath and other members of this meeting to a report recently drafted by Mr Brouwer, second-in-command at the Central Bank in the Netherlands. This report was commissioned by the Economic and Financial Committee, which, as you are aware, is the gateway to the ECOFIN Council, and the report deals with financial stability.
The report will be made available shortly.
No doubt you will be able to find it on the Internet.
This report deals with the issue which is close to Mrs Randzio-Plath' s heart and once again, I would strongly recommend all members attending this meeting to read it.
Well, most of the points I mentioned a moment ago can be found in the draft report of the rapporteur, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, and also in many of the tabled amendments.
In sum, I would like to say that we will undoubtedly continue to discuss the nuts and bolts but as far as the main points are concerned, I do consider Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil' s report as welcome confirmation of the Commission' s vision.
I would now like to say a few words on the way in which a number of these measures need to be implemented, the need to take a close look at our legislative ethos and the way in which legislation is established.
Everyone is currently in agreement that we need to drop over-complicated, fossilised legislation, in other words, rules which cannot keep pace with fast market development.
Accordingly, the process by which the European Union, i.e. the concerted efforts of Commission, Parliament and Council, lays down rules should be quicker.
But how exactly can this be done?
There are quite a few different ideas and quite a few misconceptions, because if Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil tells me that the European Parliament does not want to give up any of the powers it has only recently acquired, then I naturally share his view.
I myself have been a Member of Parliament for a long time, so I fully understand where Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil is coming from.
In fact, this is not the Commission' s intention, even if it was authorised to take decisions in this respect, which is not the case.
Nonetheless, we need to proceed faster in order to lay down the necessary rules.
I would invite the Members of this Parliament to come up with any ideas as to how we could speed up and enhance the process.
Should we make more use of comitology procedures?
Should more weight be given to agreement reached between the institutions upon first reading?
At any rate, the Commission intends to keep Parliament and the competent committees informed of the agendas more quickly and more effectively, so that these agendas can be better harmonised and we can speed up the drafting of the required legislation.
In any event, I would like to keep this Parliament informed of all the developments regarding the action plan. Every six months, we send a progress report to the ECOFIN Council and it seems to me that these reports could be used to exchange views with Parliament on this matter.
Mr President, most speakers have expressed their thoughts on the issue of pensions and I would like to say the following on this matter.
In its communication on pensions, the Commission has included proposals on three fronts.
The first area is prudential rules for pension funds, and protecting pension scheme members should take centre stage.
There is no question that rules could be introduced which could threaten the rights of future pensioners.
This is beyond dispute.
However, this does not detract from the fact that investment and management rules can also serve the interests of people other than pension scheme members.
In fact futile provisions that inhibit the results of investments, do pension scheme members no favours and must be repealed for this reason.
Secondly, the coordination of national tax systems is a condition for cross-border participation.
Mrs Peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people?
Other Members too, such as Mr von Wogau and others, have talked about the need to enhance the mobility of workers within the European Union.
As already stated, this does not require harmonisation (a word we need to use with discretion because it conjures up incorrect associations in certain Member States) so much as coordination.
So it requires the coordination of tax systems which differ in terms of tariffs.
This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility.
The Commission is in the process of drafting a proposal, a general framework, intended to facilitate the payment of contributions by occupational pension institutions which are located in other Member States.
This general framework has also been requested, of course, in this meeting by Mr Medina Ortega, for example, while Mrs Peijs has also indicated the need to set up this general framework.
Moreover, I would like to refer to the constant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. This jurisprudence has demonstrated that the restrictions which apply to cross-border contributions and premiums are at odds with the Treaty.
The Commission' s third objective is to remove the obstacles which migrant workers are faced with.
More than anything, and this is also underlined in the draft report - rightly so - we should facilitate the transferability of rights from one Member State to another, and this is also very much in the interests of employee mobility, of course.
Mr President, concerning the motion for a resolution, I would first of all like to remark that this Parliament' s support is crucially important if we want to translate these proposals into specific measures.
It was with great interest that I read the sterling report of the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, and the competent committees, a report that so far has covered an extensive and technically complex area.
I did not fail to notice that Parliament is backing the lines of policy proposed by the Commission.
With regard to the motion for a resolution, I would like to make the following brief comments. The motion presses for the general introduction of the tax levy model that relies on the taxation of the pension payout whilst providing for tax exemption for contributions to the fund and returns on the fund.
The desirability of this model was once again underlined this evening by Mr Blokland, among others.
Mr Blokland pointed this out and I share his view on this.
This is also echoed in the motion for a resolution.
Agreement on this approach would solve the problems of either double taxation or no taxation, which is what citizens and Member States are struggling with at the moment.
However, I would like to point out that this issue, as is known, only and exclusively concerns the competences of the Member States and, as such, falls outside the scope of the European Commission.
The Commission should ensure, however, if different systems continue to coexist in future too, that this does not have any adverse effects on workers exercising their right to mobility within the Union.
Regarding the amendments tabled, I would like to stress one point in particular, namely the scope of the future proposal - as the directive is not yet finished - for a directive regulating the activities of occupational pension funds.
In other words, the question is, and many Members attending this evening' s meeting have spoken about this, Mrs Kauppi, in particular: should this proposal, which we are about to disclose, provide for all forms of pension schemes or should it simply be restricted to pension scheme products which cover the members against biometric risks?
My answer to this is as follows, I hope it is clear: we need European prudential standards for all forms of occupational pension schemes.
These standards will differ in certain aspects according to the risks actually covered by the institutions.
But there is not one single technical reason why these different types of savings schemes could not be combined in one and the same directive.
It would, in my view, be incorrect - and the European Union would impose artificial restrictions on itself - if the Commission were to restrict the directive to be proposed to pension schemes which only cover biometric risks and if it were to exclude other pension provisions which, although they are full pension provisions because they cannot be collected before pensionable age, should nonetheless still be excluded from the directive, according to a number of delegates.
I believe that this is not right.
I think that the European Union would not do itself any favours if the subject of the directive were to be limited to biometric risks and I can honestly see no reason why other forms of pension schemes could not be included in the same directive, as I pointed out a moment ago.
Well now, Member States are thus given every opportunity to give certain pension products preferential treatment by using tax incentive measures, for example.
They can also demand that the products offered on their market, even if the institutions offering the service are based in another Member State, meet certain social criteria.
Employees and employers within one company or one sector are free to choose, according to the benefits and drawbacks of the products available on their market.
In other words, there is still a large degree of freedom for the Member States to arrange the pension systems within their own country as they see fit.
This freedom remains.
The Commission' s ambition is to create, I repeat, one framework which liberalises the setting up and scope of pension funds for the benefit of all the members of such pension funds.
Accordingly, we need to set up this legal framework within the European Union which enables businesses and future pensioners to choose the products on offer within a transparent market by institutions which are adequately supervised.
Adequate supervision is crucial, as is liberalising the scope of pension funds.
It is not up to the Commission to specify a pension product in every detail. Indeed this is a matter which falls under the subsidiarity principle, and the European Commission would not wish to do anything which could compromise this principle.
Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he could also reply to my question.
I have been waiting for a reply for one and a half hours now.
I would, at long last, like to have a response to my question on cash management and the solution to this problem which is particularly hitting small and medium-sized businesses.
Mr President, I would prefer to address Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel' s issue when I respond to the report on the internal market.
This would, however, mean that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would have to stay even longer at this meeting.
This is not such a bad thing, in my opinion.
In the final analysis, many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, but since she has reminded me of this question, which, as I have already said, I would have addressed at a later stage, let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market.
It is true that small and medium-sized businesses are facing obstacles in their cross-border activities.
The Commission is acutely aware of this.
Needless to say, the scope of the internal market is intended to facilitate cross-border activities for small and medium-sized businesses.
The new strategy for the internal market comprises one hundred or so measures, many of which will be beneficial to small and medium-sized businesses.
But if Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel would like to approach me with specific problems relating to small and medium-sized businesses which are not covered in the new strategy for the internal market, I shall make every effort to address these points to her satisfaction.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Strategy for Europe' s Internal Market
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0098/2000) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: The Strategy for Europe' s Internal Market [COM(1999) 464 - C5-0212/1999 - 1999/2167(COS)]
Mr President, Commissioner, the report which I have the honour to present is the result of an extraordinary collaboration - which I am grateful for - between people and committees.
Allow me to make two observations: the Committee on Legal Affairs has not accepted all the suggestions of the committee asked for an opinion.
We were in complete agreement with most of them and they seemed to us to be very interesting, but we consider that this resolution was not the right place for them and that, by incorporating them, its message would be less clearly expressed.
That has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this House.
I therefore insist - and the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries is a good example of this - that they have not been included in the resolution, not because I reject their content, but because the message in relation to the internal market strategy had to be clearly expressed.
What was that message?
That message stems from the position adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs in our resolution of 4 November 1999.
If you will allow me, Mr President, I will concentrate on three ideas.
The first concern of the Committee on Legal Affairs -and I hope this House will ratify it tomorrow - is the concept of the situation of the internal market.
What does the internal market mean to European construction?
These days we hear the siren song of globalisation and together with that goes the idea that we are international.
The internal market appears to have become very small in this new globalised economy.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
This document on the strategy for the internal market expresses this very clearly.
The internal market is Europe' s platform in the world.
The internal market embodies the key principles of a globalised economy with advantages for Europe in terms of competition.
That is the first message of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
We need to put the emphasis on the principles of the internal market: the principle of proportionality, the principle of mutual recognition, the principle of control of origin.
These must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built.
We will not make the headlines with this, but it is important nonetheless.
The application and control of Community legislation is also important. The Member States must cooperate in this application.
We must oppose procedures which are used too frequently, such as 'gold plating' .
We need to strengthen our infringement procedure, we need to consolidate it, make it more transparent and more accessible.
We ask that decisions on the outcome of infringement proceedings be explained and that Parliament be informed of them.
We ask that infringement cases be processed more quickly and that they be more effectively presented to the citizen.
The second message of this resolution is that we need to make the present, rather disorganised laws, which the citizens see as a burden, into a genuine legislation, a coherent and clear framework of rules and regulations, without any overlapping or contradictions.
These contradictions are seen by the citizen and by industry as burdens, as a lack of clarity in the message regarding the direction we are taking.
Lastly, the third message is a change in the business culture in Europe.
We need businesspeople who are more willing to take risks.
To this end we will have to change certain laws, such as for example the European laws on insolvency in general, on the suspension of payments and bankruptcy.
We need to put the emphasis on the creation of a genuine capital risk market.
We need to convince young Europeans, as young Americans are already convinced, that the best option is not to join a large company, on a long-term basis, but to create new companies.
In all of this, electronic commerce, the Internet and new technologies must offer a good platform.
Finally, Mr President, to sum up, I hope that tomorrow, on voting for the resolution, Parliament will send a clear message.
We are behind the Commission in this initiative and of course we want to participate in the whole process, permanently, cooperating, offering ideas and monitoring the situation.
Mr President, once again the European Parliament must express its opinion on the Commission communication on the construction of the internal market, in this case, a new version of it.
A proportion of its content affects the competences of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
It is these points which I wish to discuss specifically.
Firstly, I would like to say that, in general, one of the criticisms levelled at previous versions of this documents no longer applies.
The European Parliament' s resolution of 4 November 1999 said that the document was rather unspecific, that it did not contain specific actions.
This new version does contain specific measures and proposals.
Let us then analyse the content of these proposals, albeit in general terms.
With regard to taxation, the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is that the Communication is not ambitious enough, especially when compared to previous documents.
We are aware of the stumbling blocks encountered in relation to the tax package and that some of its chapters have been blocked, but in situations such as this large doses of political courage are necessary to push proposals forward.
We notice a lack of such political courage in this document since the chapter on tax simply reproduces previous Commission commitments, and even leaves aside some of the European Parliament' s proposals.
Secondly, in relation to the rules on competition, the Communication opts for deepening the process of reform underway, and this deserves our support.
Finally, in the chapter on financial services, it should be highlighted that up to now important progress has been made but, as indicated in the recent single market scoreboard, there is still a lot to be done.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is natural that I should speak about the problems which the strategy for developing the internal market may pose from a social point of view.
We are starting with a European social model - which is a national model - and we are transforming the economic structure of that society.
In doing so, we are concerned that the effort to liberalise should not transform the essence of the current European social model.
An example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport.
If urban transport is not subjected to political considerations and the intervention of local authorities, for example, straightforward liberalisation could make it practically impossible for us to reach our workplaces.
We have had examples such as the case of Venezuela where a strictly private system of public transport led to a profound social and political crisis in that country.
Liberalisation presents other difficulties.
For example, when public services and public companies are privatised and those public companies come to be controlled by a private sector which in reality replaces the state monopoly with a private monopoly, liberalisation may not come about effectively at all.
Liberalisation by means of privatising public companies may end up consolidating dominant positions and private monopolies which in my opinion may offer fewer benefits than a monopoly conceived in the public interest.
Another aspect - which we referred to in the recent debate on the Kuckelkorn report - is the need to coordinate social protection.
Social protection in a single internal market cannot simply be left to subsidiarity.
Lastly, cohesion also seems to me to be important.
If there is no economic and social cohesion, if we do not balance the quality of life in the different regions of the Community, we may find ourselves in a situation where the European Union is an unfair European Union in which some regions will make more progress and others will be left behind.
This is the basis of the amendments which Mrs Berger and I are presenting, representing the views of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
