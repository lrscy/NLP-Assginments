The citizens believe that the European Union has its own personality, yet the governments in these Conferences have had no desire to provide it with one.
The European Union has existed since the Treaty of Maastricht, which is some time ago now, but neither at that time nor since has it wanted to expressly take on a legal personality; the latest example of this was the Treaty of Nice.
The issue is on the table. Why have governments refused to act?
Under these conditions, the EU continues to act like a child living under the legal authority of its parents: the European Communities.
The question I would like to ask is the following: can we really uphold this contradictory and barely understandable situation for much longer?
The answer to this question is becoming more and more clear - 'no? - because the current situation causes legal confusion, political confusion, international and internal confusion, institutional confusion and, above all, as I said at the beginning of my speech, confusion amongst the citizens.
I would now like to give you three examples of this in an international setting. We could go to a country such as Equatorial Guinea and see that the Commission delegation there is the Commission of the European Communities and not that of the European Union; we can listen to our representative in the United Nations and notice that he or she is from the European Communities and not the European Union, or, we see that a commitment made by a united Europe to very speedily endorse the Kyoto Protocol is not in fact endorsed by the European Union but the European Communities.
Furthermore, this report has been produced at the same time as the start of the Convention on the future of Europe, which this Parliament hopes will produce a constitution.
This will therefore be our first contribution to the Convention after it has been set up.
It is logical that this issue should also be dealt with.
We hope that the Convention and subsequently the Intergovernmental Conference, taking on board the issues that came to light at Laeken, will tackle the issue of giving the European Union a legal personality, which will have advantages that cannot be denied: firstly, legal clarity; secondly, the improvement of the Union's image and its capacity to take action on the international stage; thirdly, it will be a key element in establishing a system for the protection of fundamental rights at Union level; fourthly, to give Union policy a higher profile and make it easier for citizens to identify with the Union and, fifthly, to help remedy the dysfunctions caused by the pillar system.
We also think that a legal personality is needed to bring the process of political union to a conclusion and that the process of the constitutionalisation of the Union will also require it to have its own legal personality.
In fact, this is a necessary prerequisite to achieving these objectives in a coherent way.
If this is not the final outcome, what will be the objective of the future constitutional text? Which body will take on the leading role in the European Constitution?
The Union, the Communities, one of which is due to expire next Summer? For this reason we ask that legal personality be given to the European Union in the future European Constitution.
We ask for this in the report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for which I am honoured to be the rapporteur, in agreement with the opinions of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which I think are very positive contributions.
I believe that this request for the Union to be given a legal personality was also apparent in the last Presidencies-in-Office of the Council, a desire expressed by both the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies.
This, Madam President, is not an issue for legal experts, but a point that can be easily understood by any citizen: to know that he or she is a citizen of a European Union with its own personality, which can and should govern democratically and transparently, and they demand it fulfils its responsibilities.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has explained the position as regards the three Communities and the European Union.
This subject is particularly problematic when it comes to foreign policy.
For example, in international organisations, in the FAO, we have full membership for one of the Communities, and a seat and a vote on United Nations bodies, but this does not apply across the entire foreign policy spectrum.
Let us consider in particular the changes that have taken place on the international scene over the last three years, with Mr Solana taking office in 1999, which represented a political step change in European foreign policy, the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 and the objective of a common foreign and security policy by 2003.
These are ambitious targets which, however, are no longer rooted in the legal basis provided by the treaties.
Today, Articles 24 and 38 provide a legal basis for concluding agreements, but they make one of the Communities or the Member States as such responsible.
And this House also needs to be aware that agreements are entered into at present without Parliament having a chance to approve them beforehand.
Budgetary commitments are made in international agreements which then have to be honoured by Parliament at a later stage because of our particular role.
That is why I believe that this issue of the legal personality of the EU needs to be put on the agenda of the Convention again.
We need this legal personality in order for the European Union to make a stronger contribution to the United Nations, for example, especially following the events of 11 September.
This is in addition to the role of the Member States and is no substitute for individual Member States' membership of the United Nations, but it would give our foreign policy a higher profile, it would increase our scope for action and above all be more transparent to the public.
That is the goal that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to see included in the discussions of the Convention.
Mr President, the resolution on the legal personality of the European Union is one of Parliament's contributions to the Convention charged with drawing up the European Constitution.
The Carnero GonzÃ¡lez report stresses that the attribution of its legal personality is an essential step towards the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and improves the coherence of the various European policies.
Opponents of the Union speak of a superstate, a Europe that has fallen into the hands of a stateless bureaucracy.
In reality, Europe is not a threat to national identities, and national identities are not a threat to Europe.
Political unity is the only way to prevent the individual countries from being overwhelmed by untamed globalisation or to prevent difficulties from making the ghosts of nationalism re-emerge.
Anyway, we are not starting from scratch.
In the past the Treaty has attributed legal personality to the European Communities, but with the birth of the Union there is a legal void to fill.
The Council has addressed this several times, without, however, reaching clear conclusions.
Public opinion and all countries that have relations with Europe are convinced that their relations are with an autonomous and unitary system.
Moreover, in the sphere of foreign policy, defence and security, the European Council can deliberate on procedures that represent the beginnings of a legal personality.
One has to recognise the benefits for European citizens and for the Union's international image.
It is not true that we are trying to build our common house from the roof down.
Construction by pillars reveals a problem, which Mr Carnero's proposal remedies by taking up a 1997 Parliamentary resolution on international law, Community law and the constitutions of the individual Member States.
This resolution made express reference back then to the need to give the Union a legal personality.
We cannot, of course, pre-empt the Convention, but this resolution gives a great boost to a constitutional process to which, in our opinion, the future of a democratic Europe is bound.
Mr President, the Carnero GonzÃ¡lez report raises a fundamental and timely issue, an important aspect of which is the problem of the Union's legal personality.
It is easy to say what the issue is: the European Union needs at last to be given a face, a clear profile.
Look, quite recently we were told to be careful: the building of Europe has progressed under wraps, without revealing its features and its intentions, playing on calculated ambiguities to disarm resistance and dodge the stiffest opposition.
Thus for decades there was a succession of partial achievements and de facto solidarity, to borrow an expression dear to Jean Monnet and enshrined in the Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950.
Things went forward like that, without too much definition of the political and institutional individual that was growing up, without too much pretence at coherence in the building of Europe.
Well, we reply, the time has come for clarity, the time has come to explicitly characterise the supranational body that has gradually been taking shape until now we have a single currency.
The Convention must say who we are and what we want.
The fact that the European Community may have been an original construction, without historical precedent or pre-established models, cannot mean that it should remain inexpressible or indefinable, and certainly not that it should remain incomplete.
We must respond to the citizens' legitimate questions and present ourselves as a union that has its own plan, that equips itself with clear institutional checks and balances, that recognises itself through a Constitution, that wants to play a strong international role, and therefore endows itself with a legal personality.
Hence the coherent, convincing argument of Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez's report, which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has fully endorsed.
Mr President, most people would now say that they want the European Union to play a stronger role in world affairs, but they appear sometimes to be uncertain as to the ways and means.
This evening, in the splendid Carnero GonzÃ¡lez report, we have part of the answer.
The acquisition of an international legal personality would be a powerful instrument for the Union.
First, it will raise its international profile.
Second, by giving the Union more respectability, it should encourage us to act more responsibly.
It will open the door for a more proactive part for the Union inside the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank. It will consolidate our role and the functions of the Commission in the field of trade and the environment.
But international legal personality cannot simply be asserted unilaterally.
It must be earned if it is to win recognition under international law.
What will assist us in winning this acceptance is for the Union itself to become a contracting party to the Council of Europe's Convention - a move that will complement the development of our own fundamental rights regime funded on the Charter.
This report prepares those of us in the Convention to take the lead.
We are grateful to the rapporteur for his sterling work.
Mr President, giving the European Union legal personality as well as the European Communities, which already have it, would change very little, at least if we consider it in isolation.
In order for it to radically change the institutions, it would need to be combined, as Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez suggests several times in his report, with several other much more significant reforms: merging the pillars, the power to conclude treaties on its own behalf, generally incorporating decision-making into the Community sphere and adopting a supra-national constitution.
This is why the report is right, in a sense, in saying that this reform would not in itself imply transfers of powers to the Union.
It is true that a simple association of States making unanimous decisions could have legal personality.
However, it is wrong to say that this alone could bring about the characteristics of coherence, unity of representation and visibility that the report ascribes to it.
In other words, this reform is nothing, or if it is to be something, it has to be accompanied by a merging of the pillars, an incorporation into the Community sphere and a constitutional process, which whatever we choose to call it, would be the distinctive signs of a superstate or of something that would strongly resemble one.
That is why I have drawn up a minority opinion, which is included with the report.
And that is why I am proposing a deal to Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez.
I am happy to accept the legal personality of the Union if, in exchange, Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez agrees to say that, if a European constitution came into being, it should first and foremost acknowledge the superiority of the national constitutions, the freedom of choice of the Member States on the world stage and unanimous decision-making or variable geometry in the third pillar.
If you agree to say all of that, Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez, I would perhaps vote for your report, but you will not say this because your report is in fact hiding something other than what it claims.
Mr President, on this report the British Conservatives will abstain.
Within the delegation there is deep disagreement.
Some believe that what is proposed is a step in the direction of a European superstate.
Some, after considerable reflection, really do not know; and some believe this is a proposal that will create an entrenched bulwark against a superstate, and so are in favour.
These views are individually deeply and honestly held, as indeed are my personal and private ones.
In these circumstances, trying to compel one's colleagues to vote against their views on this kind of topic, in these kind of circumstances, is not only unlikely to work, it will not change their views either.
All it does is cause trouble.
While the subject matter of many of the non-legislative resolutions of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is very important, Parliament's resolutions themselves are, in the world of real politics, some of the less important items we vote on; it is therefore folly, it seems to me, and shows lack of judgement, to engage in civil war about things which do not matter all that much.
Hence we are approaching this and other similar topics here within the framework of a broad church, which has the overriding advantage of being sensible, which I am not sure can be said about any other course of action open to us in the circumstances.
Mr President, Mr Carnero's report to this House is an important one, and if this call for the EU to be given a legal personality is acted upon, that would be a qualitative leap forward in the unity that Europe represents for the citizens of our countries and also for the EU's partners throughout the world.
No one understands the difference between the European Community and the European Union.
It is complicated and confusing and also has many drawbacks.
Mr Berthu is quite right in saying that this request forms part of the major overall reform that we want.
Merging the three pillars and streamlining the decision-making structures are all things that we have already approved in the Leinen-MÃ©ndez de Vigo report and in various other reports.
The question of legal personality is a cornerstone that is needed to bring the whole thing together. This cornerstone was missing and we are providing it now with Mr Carnero's report.
I very much support this.
The Convention is an excellent opportunity to do this work.
We need Europe to have a single voice in the world.
Mr Laschet and others have already mentioned examples of this absurdity: in some cases the Community is represented, but not the Union.
It really is very complicated.
But it is also important for justice and home affairs policy.
I just asked him to say that we have agreed to make EUR 5 million available for Europol.
That is a good thing, because we want Europol to function, but the funding cannot be accepted, because Europol cannot accept money from the Community budget, but only from the Member States.
This demonstrates the absurdity of this situation, and I hope that our representatives and others involved in the Convention will take a step forward as regards legal personality and that the rights of our citizens will finally become binding, so that they can take the Union to court.
On that note, I wish this proposal every success and say thank you to Mr Carnero.
Mr President, with your permission, I feel I must point out that one person is still listening to the debate from the gallery.
That deserves our full attention, given the hour.
The Commission fully supports the terms of the proposed resolution.
It comes at the right time because the Convention to prepare the next IGC has just started its work.
It is very important that those who will be taking a position in the Convention and during the next IGC should be aware of the importance of this question for the effectiveness and the credibility of the Union and of the need to find an appropriate solution.
We know the weaknesses of the current system and how difficult it is for outsiders to understand - just like the other solutions resisted by the Commission in the past, such as the addition of yet another legal personality to the current set-up.
We have to convince people that it is essential to accord a single, full and complete personality to the Union.
For this, it is obviously essential to have the active support of the European Parliament, together with the measure of agreement now seen in several parliamentary reports such as the Carnero GonzÃ¡lez and Lamassoure reports, and in the opinions of the various parliamentary subcommittees consulted.
The European Parliament can count on the Commission to support the terms of this resolution in the forthcoming debate.
Commissioner, on behalf of our sole but very attentive spectator, I thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0050/2002) by Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2001 (2001/2012(INI)).
Mr President, every year the European Parliament presents a report on the activities of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly.
Since 2000, however, the Cotonou Agreement has brought about a new context that profoundly changes the very nature of this report.
The Cotonou Agreement made profound changes to the cooperation objectives, with the new goal being a renewed partnership that is more balanced and more effective.
This means that there have to be changes in the JPA's modus operandi.
More than just changes in the modus operandi, it requires a real cultural change.
Where are we in this process?
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly is at a watershed.
After 2000, which had raised great hopes of a new era in relations between the EU and ACP States, 2001 did not fulfil all its promise.
The working group did undertake a massive adaptation of its working methods, but many delays and a great deal of resistance hindered progress.
Here are three examples of this: firstly, the European States' inertia in the ratification process.
Only three countries have ratified the agreement: Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and us, the European Union.
Although we are aware that the procedures are long in many European countries, this sends out a political message and a negative signal to the ACP countries.
All European Member States must ratify the agreement before the end of 2002.
The second example is the untimely use of voting by separate college in the Assembly.
This is detrimental to its parliamentary nature.
I propose limited use, and in particular I propose a moratorium on its use among Europeans.
The question of voting rights is fundamental, and the debate over Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure has led to numerous controversies.
The principle of representation by parliamentarians alone must be forcefully reaffirmed, and the compromise drawn up by the Working Group, which specifies limited cases of difficulty in which voting by non-parliamentarians is permitted, is the final position that we can accept here.
We need to get through this bad patch.
This report proposes a few paths that we could take.
I will only mention some of them, such as a specific instrument to contribute to democracy: the democratic bonus, financial or material aid to improve the functioning of democratically elected parliaments and a better representation of the opposition.
For the ACP countries, the principle is one country, one vote.
In fact, each country speaks with just one voice.
It is impossible for opposition Members of Parliament in the ACP countries to make themselves heard.
In order to remedy this, we need to have an open debate, without taboos, on the re-weighting of votes.
For now, the proposal of three delegates per country, put forward by my fellow Member Mr Martinez last year, is heading in the right direction.
As a result there is the question of funding.
Following a rigorous financial assessment by the Commission, a special fund would be reserved to cover the travel costs of ACP parliamentary representatives only and for the organisation of sessions.
From a more general point of view, the JPA is the only assembly that has no budget.
It should be given new powers to enable it to exercise financial and political control over the funding of cooperation.
Finally, my last point: the European Parliament should devote special attention to the work of the ACP countries in a comprehensive debate, at least once a year, here in the European Parliament, on the different aspects of cooperation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Carlotti for her excellent report.
Mrs Carlotti, your report represents a kind of political road map indicating the route to a genuine parliamentary and democratic assembly.
It contains many helpful proposals for modifications.
So it is a good thing that it is to be adopted before the plenary session in Cape Town and can be taken on board in the discussions there.
Mrs Carlotti has already gone into many of the recommendations contained in the report just now.
As shadow rapporteur, I would like to comment briefly on a few points.
The Cotonou Agreement led to a fundamental reformulation of the goals of cooperation between the EU and the ACP States.
Some of the key substantive and political improvements to that agreement are the result of proposals made by the European Parliament.
Mr Corrie has done excellent work in this area in recent years as co-President.
The result is an ambitious agreement that opens up new horizons for cooperation.
But it now needs to have life breathed into it.
The working methods and procedures of the JPA need to be streamlined and to correspond to a genuine parliamentary, joint, democratic assembly.
This process was initiated last year and needs to be continued.
These new powers should make it possible for the Assembly to exercise tighter financial control over the expenditure of EU development aid.
Stricter monitoring and budgetary control combined with regular contacts between the Members of the Assembly and Members of Parliament from the recipient countries could help to ensure proper use of EU funds in line with the actual needs of the ACP countries.
The report calls for enhanced cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organisations.
In view of the political dimension of the Cotonou Agreement, it seems desirable to establish a dialogue between the public and politicians in the ACP and EU States.
The obstacles in the way of making the JPA a genuine joint parliamentary assembly need to be eliminated as soon as possible.
It is very regrettable that ratification of the agreement in the EU Member States is moving forward at such a sluggish pace.
The risk that this will send the wrong signal to the newly industrialised countries with which the EU has strong historical, political and cultural links should not be underestimated.
Mr President, Mrs Carlotti's excellent report is both an optimistic declaration of confidence in the potential of the Cotonou Agreement and a call on the responsibility of each and every one of us to make sure that this potential does not end up as yet one more lost opportunity, but rather that the most ambitious plans of the agreement come to fruition.
The report underlines that Cotonou is a major step forward in the process set out some decades ago for cooperation between the European Union and a growing number of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, with the aim of aiding their development.
It reminds us that we are facing a process that has matured and that has also adapted to the current situation.
Europeans have not granted this new agreement to our partners, but have fully and rigorously negotiated it with them.
This is, therefore, an association agreement between partners that are equals in their mutual respect, recognition and rights.
It is an agreement which, in addition to its economic and commercial component, introduces an innovative political dimension that should allow the ACP-EU Community, united in its proclaimed democratic values with a great capacity for influence in its pursuit of a just, balanced, free, lawful, peaceful world where prosperity is reasonably divided and shared, to burst onto the world stage.
However, all the confidence expressed in the report is naturally conditional upon our responsibility to take advantage of the provisions of the agreement.
Hence the appeals of the rapporteur, first of all, to those Member States who do not consider the ratification of the Cotonou agreement a priority.
She also calls on the European Parliament to give the implementation of the Cotonou agreement the attention it deserves.
She calls upon those MEPs who act as Parliament's representatives in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly to act responsibly.
She also calls upon us to make sure this Assembly is truly parliamentary and well balanced, and to commit ourselves to acting in a way that shows solidarity, and is fully democratic within this Assembly.
The report also highlights our ACP partners' responsibilities to achieve what is set out in the agreement so that the Joint Assembly can be set up once and for all.
They will then need to adjust themselves to democratic standards, the respect for human rights and the Rule of Law, as guarantees for their own progress and to effectively contribute to a world of stability and peace which is the objective of the Cotonou agreement.
Mr President, I too should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Carlotti on her report.
This is a fine piece of work, and it is also excellent that the work has been completed before the next meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly takes place, which is as early as next week of course.
It is an important report, and Mrs Carlotti has also put forward a number of theoretical observations.
I shall examine a couple of them more closely but, before I do so, I should just like to emphasise that it does not of course help a great deal to stand here and talk about the Cotonou Agreement if we cannot get it ratified, and we must once again call upon the Member States to make such ratification possible.
I believe that, in the course of the last few months, only one additional country has come on board.
And even if there are many countries that have planned to ratify the agreement, we have still to see the final signatures.
The situation is a little better where the ACP countries are concerned, but the overall number of signatories is, of course, still by no means large enough.
The second thing that can be said is that such an agreement is not really, of course, worth very much if we do not arrange for proper aid.
Here, too, there are, no doubt, difficulties, and I hope that the Commissioner - or whoever he now has to help him - will succeed in getting a process under way before tomorrow's formal meeting of foreign ministers.
The target I should like to have seen, namely one of 0.7%, will certainly not be adopted, but I have to acknowledge that this target is impossible to achieve at the present time.
Simply getting a binding process under way will, however, be of absolutely crucial importance.
I should like now to address two points in Mrs Carlotti's report.
The first is the issue of our own working methods.
On that issue, I definitely do not think that we have made enough progress.
I think we have too many resolutions and too little debate.
The second point is the composition of the ACP-EU delegation, which is not of course particularly appropriate.
The fact that the delegation includes only one person from the ACP countries introduces a distortion, democratically speaking, and I therefore also think that we should look again at the composition.
Should we, for example, have twice as many delegates from both sides and then only meet once a year in order to obtain greater representation? Or can we come up with some other solution?
Mr President, I should like to warmly welcome this report by Mrs Carlotti and congratulate her on her very thorough and far-reaching work.
I am struck, in particular, by how strongly the theme of genuine partnership shines through; how the EU/ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique relationship in modern political life and - imperfect as it is - it can stand as a model for new and innovative relations between North and South, which are perhaps today needed more urgently than ever before to build a more peaceful and sustainable world.
That does not mean that there is not room to improve the workings of that relationship.
I commend Mrs Carlotti for the proposal she makes in that regard.
I would like to expand on a couple of them.

First, if a partnership is a genuine one, then it must also be a consistent and coherent one; one that manifests itself not only in the EU's development policy but also in the EU's trade and economic policy; not only a partnership within the confines of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, but a partnership that extends into other international institutions like the WTO, the World Bank and the UN.
At the WTO in particular, there is enormous scope for the EU and ACP working more closely together.
On trade there are some huge political challenges ahead, not least the negotiation of the regional economic partnership agreements.
These have the potential to have damaging effects on some of the poorest ACP countries who are simply not ready to open their markets to the EU and who do not have the negotiating capacity to engage not only in this process and the WTO process but also in the process of their own regional cooperation agreements.
It is therefore essential that the JPA plays an active role in shaping and monitoring this process.
Greater involvement of civil society will also be key.
I appreciate the proposals in the report which would enable the views of NGOs to be heard far more systematically in the JPA's proceedings.
Finally, a partnership must be a partnership of equals.
We urgently need to find the means and the resources to fund it, to address the basic imbalance between the representation of the EU side, reflecting Parliament's political make-up and spectrum of political views, and a system of representation of the ACP states based on one country, one vote, which prevents different political views being expressed.
The JPA is a unique instrument of cooperation and solidarity, North and South.
We need to value it, improve it, and build on it as a model for North-South cooperation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Carlotti's report, a very important document on ACP-EU cooperation, has taken on a new dimension because it also presents the new possibilities open to us following the Cotonou Agreement.
ACP-EU cooperation has gained a new democratic aspect, and that means that we also need to provide a new democratic dimension in shaping this cooperation.
That is why the emphasis on the parliamentary nature of the Assembly presented in this report is so important. Flesh needs to be put on the bones of this idea.
And that is also why it was so important for this report to be approved by this House before the session in Cape Town, so as to give us moral support for the reform of this cooperation process.
We need a following wind if we are to strengthen the parliamentary dimension and to achieve what we have pledged to do.
We have been told that the work on the new Rules of Procedure has not been totally without conflict - that is why it will be very important for us to have the support this report so that the negotiations in Cape Town can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
I am sure that we will be able to agree on a structure for the standing committees, which will accordingly change the nature of cooperation in this parliamentary assembly.
The standing parliamentary committees make it possible to work continuously on problem areas, whereas up to now it has only been possible for us to work in ad hoc working groups.
I hope that this form of cooperation will facilitate far more intensive work on various themes and closer cooperation with our colleagues on the ACP side.
The regional meetings will also lend new weight to our work.
They will also give a voice to other people involved in ACP cooperation who have not so far had an opportunity to have their views heard.
Mr President, the dominant theme of 2001 for the ACP countries was the entry into force of the Cotonou agreement.
Its ratification by the European Parliament in January will encourage the Member States to follow that example, thus enabling the financial part to be implemented.
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has adapted its work according to the new role that it has been given, in particular to promote democratic processes.
As a forum for the expression of the will of the people and of democratic values, it has a central role to play.
But its powers are limited.
It remains just a platform for political expression, without any decision-making or executive powers.
It should therefore be given new powers, both political as well as financial and operational, and the logistical resources to go with them.
A working group responsible for evaluating the involvement of civil society in the partnership should therefore be created.
In the same way, parliamentarians should be involved in the forthcoming negotiations on the future ACP-EU trade regime.
We will therefore vote with conviction in favour of Mrs Carlotti's report, which makes excellent proposals on the other points, as she set out a while ago, while pointing out that the way that the ACP countries will become democratic is by making the associated institutions and development cooperation more democratic in general.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on her report, which is a reflection of her unflagging dedication to relations between the EU and ACP countries.
Our current partnerships with 77 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific should set an example for relations between the European Union and the United States, and also EU candidate countries, which we have been very enthusiastically debating in the recent past.
If EU Member States do not show much interest in these partnerships, which is borne out by the aforementioned fact that only four Member States have ratified the Cotonou Agreement, Parliament should do so, particularly because relations with these countries are based, according to the new agreement, on political dialogue, of which the Parliamentary Assembly is a fundamental pillar.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to ask the Member States, particularly my own, Spain, which holds the Presidency of the Council, to speed up formalities so that the agreement can be ratified.
The Joint Assembly, like this Parliament, is deeply involved in a process where its Rules of Procedure are being reformed, having, as its aim, the true democratisation of ACP-EU relations.
Our efforts are directed, first and foremost, towards improving the functioning of the Assembly, converting it into an assembly which is effectively balanced and parliamentary.
At the moment it is not balanced because, whilst on the European side the range of ideologies and political sensitivities that make up the European Parliament are represented, the ACP countries have only one vote per country; a vote which obviously represents the authorities' opinions; it is not balanced in terms of equality between the sexes either.
Nor is it parliamentary, because the representatives from ACP countries are not, on the whole, Members of Parliament.
The credibility of our cooperation with ACP countries, which is far from negligible, is in doubt if it is not accompanied by reforms and the strengthening of the institution that is the most representative of the association, that is to say, the Joint Assembly.
Last week, in a seminar, we said that 'without democracy there can be no development' and this is a priority objective of the international community and the European Union.
I would ask the Commission and the Council to make resources available to ACP countries to improve their institutional capacity, especially with regard to representative institutions, and to promote the organisation of civil society and their participation in cooperation programming.
I think this is a good report whose content should be applied.
Mr, President, let me first add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Carlotti, for the good work she has put into preparing this report and also thank those who have contributed to the discussion tonight.
I note that in her report, Mrs Carlotti emphasises the importance of the parliamentary nature of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the role it should play in achieving the objectives set out in the Cotonou Agreement.
I fully endorse this, and can only encourage the Assembly to reinforce its own legitimacy and democratic nature, for example by ensuring that it is composed purely of parliamentarians.
I have noted what has been said by a number of people about the need to broaden participation to allow for a more representative reflection of views.
This may prompt something of a discussion, in fact, since such matters are defined in the Cotonou Agreement, but I sympathise with the attempt to make room for opposition parties to express their views within the work of the parliamentary assembly.
Another important point concerns a revision of the rules on financing to ensure the full participation of ACP parliamentarians in the Assembly's sessions and other meetings.
The Commission is, of course, concerned that ACP parliamentarians should play their full role, on an equal footing with their European counterparts, to ensure parity between ACP and European members.
We are prepared to look into a possible revision of the agreement governing our contribution to the fund for the participation of ACP members.
I hope that we will soon receive the financial forecasts we need from the ACP Secretariat to allow us to do this.
Mrs Carlotti suggests that a special fund should be set up to finance the Assembly.
If I understand correctly, such a fund already exists, and is mentioned in the Declaration on the Joint Institutions annexed to the Cotonou Agreement and is, in fact, specified to be in the region of EUR 4 000 000.
This fund covers financing of the Joint Council and Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and is managed by the ACP Secretariat.
The Community's contribution to this fund cannot be increased, but with a little planning there should be no problem as to the amount of money available to cover ACP participation.
We will have to look at this in a practical way.
Basically, given the relatively large strategic effort to strengthen civil society and to fund directly civil society NGOs in our ACP partner countries, it would appear unfair to leave the work of parliaments somewhat weakened while strengthening the political work of non-elected bodies in our partner countries.
Hence my sympathy and understanding with regard to the need to ensure that this can actually operate smoothly.
Mrs Carlotti also suggests that the Assembly be more actively involved in scrutiny of the management of EDF funds.
I agree with the spirit of her argument, and everything should be done to ensure that the Assembly fulfils the consultative role given to it by the Cotonou Agreement.
However, I am sure you will understand that this should not lead to the establishment of new complicated procedures and reporting requirements that will add to the problems we already have in making the whole system function.
I can promise that we will provide information on the implementation and functioning of the EDF, and of course discussion of this theme in the Joint Assembly is to be welcomed.
All the more so since in launching the Cotonou Agreement and the preparatory work for the country strategy papers for the 9th European Development Fund activities we have reached out and included parliaments and public in our ACP partner countries in a way that intentionally raises expectations.
For that reason, it is even more relevant and natural to engage the parliamentarians closely in specific discussions about the overall functioning of cooperation.
Finally, Mr President, it is true - several Members have pointed out - that we are lagging behind in the ratification process.
Four or five Member States have completed ratification.
They are Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UK - and I think France has also completed its ratification process now.
Technically speaking, this has not raised any real problems until now, but it will do so if we have not completed the process before the summer recess.
I would not like to see a situation emerging where we have a slowdown in the real disbursement and real level of planning activity because of a failure of one or more Member States to ratify.
That would simply be too embarrassing.
I very much appreciate what has been said tonight and urge Members of the European Parliament to encourage completion of this process in their own countries.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0049/2002) by Mrs Carrilho, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation extending and amending Council Regulation (EC) 1659/98 on decentralised cooperation (COM(2001) 576 - C5-0509/2001 - 2001/0243(COD)).
First of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, and thank her for the efforts she has made in this field.
I know that the negotiations with the Commission and the Council have not been easy and that, above all, the time available was very short, which brings me to my first point.
I have the impression that the Commission and the Council, certainly since the European Parliament was granted codecision powers in Amsterdam in the field of development cooperation, have a tendency to try to rush proposals of this kind through Parliament.
And due to lack of time, there is, in fact, little opportunity for us to discuss these matters in any great detail.
And if you ask who will ultimately be responsible for how the money is spent, it is not the Council, nor the Commission, but we, the people's representatives.
It is thus regrettable that there is so little time available.
I should now like to turn to the report on decentralised cooperation.
As you know, to us, Christian Democrats, civil society is not just a hollow phrase.
And we are pleased that other groups are also gradually beginning to recognise its importance.
Needless to say, the involvement of NGOs and social organisations in granting aid to developing countries is of key significance.
It is an important step on the road to greater independence and a higher level of self-sufficiency for the people in the affected areas.
What we should bear in mind - and various NGOs with whom I have been in contact concerning the report remind me - is the importance of a well-defined framework for decentralised aid in order to prevent this aid from becoming fragmented.
This brings me to the amendments I have tabled on behalf of our group.
In order to provide targeted, decentralised aid, it is important for the Commission to give us the expected notification about civil society promptly.
Mrs Carrilho made reference to this as well.
The organisations on the ground, those who are actively involved in the countries themselves, would like to know where they stand.
And the promise was that the Commission would have this notification ready under the Belgian Presidency.
The Agreement of Cotonou underlines the role of civil society.
However, it is important for non-ACP countries too for a preliminary debate to be held about this, so that decentralised cooperation can be placed in a more strategic framework and so that we gain more clarity concerning the future of this Regulation; in other words, on what is set to happen after 2003.
This is why I wanted the Commission to be explicitly reminded of this promise in the report.
We are all watching the events in Zimbabwe unfolding with sadness.
We notice how a country which, to a large extent, relies on aid from the EU, treats all appeals from the same EU for fair and democratic elections with contempt, and even forces us to withdraw our observation mission.
Is this not the ultimate proof that the traditional model of development cooperation does not work?
Personally, I am convinced that development from the bottom up, which directly involves small groups of citizens, has a far more positive effect with an eye to the fair, democratic and self-sufficient society which we hope to build.
Mr President, the European Parliament was behind the creation of a budget heading for decentralised cooperation in the 1990s.
The LomÃ© Convention Section 4a also incorporated this idea, thus departing from the principle of cooperation between States.
Now, according to the Commission, the concept has gained ground and proved that it is valid and effective.
The Commission is therefore proposing that its application should be extended by two years.
We can only approve that proposal, although we have reservations regarding its form.
As well as the fact that it is transitory, the Regulation remains vague.
It contains a little of everything: decentralised cooperation, civil society and NGOs.
Could it be that there is a lack of Commission strategy in this area?
In the same way, the Cotonou Agreement dedicates the participation of civil society in the ACP countries to the partnership, at the expense of decentralised cooperation, which seems to have disappeared.
The communication on civil society in developing countries promised by the Commission several months ago should have clarified these notions and set out a coordinated approach for the European Union in this area, but we are still awaiting it.
The two areas of 'aid for decentralised cooperation' and 'aid for civil society' go hand in hand.
In both cases, the goal is to support local dynamics, avoiding the cumbersome nature and sometimes the lack of transparency of implementing national programmes.
The Commission appears to have realised this, as it plans to merge these two budget headings, but the limited adjustments that are being made, without consulting the European Parliament, are not sufficient.
The transfers of funds from one budgetary heading to another demonstrate a lack of an overall perspective and show little consideration for the budgetary authority.
We are, of course, in favour of direct aid to projects on the ground.
But we are somewhat irritated with last minute action.
This reform of the budget can only be done as part of a thorough review of the concept of decentralised cooperation and of relations with the NGOs of the North and the South.
These two extra years should therefore be used for in-depth discussion on the European Union's cooperation with local players in developing countries and their contribution to sustainable development.
We should look at the definitions: what is decentralised cooperation, cooperation between sub-national entities in the North and South or aid to local and regional authorities in developing countries?
What is civil society?
This question is becoming increasingly urgent with the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement.
The real question is in fact the more general one of governance and democracy.
In order for the countries of the South to develop they will have to become democratic, which means that citizens need to become involved in directing the country.
They can take part in several ways: by voting for local, regional or national governments.
In this respect, support for elections and increasing institutional capacity at the different levels of decision-making and administration are essential.
They can also take an economic and social role in companies or associations.
Direct aid to NGOs and SMEs is therefore equally important.
These two aspects are not contradictory but do in fact complement each other.
The Commission must continue the debate and continue to push it forward as it is high time that we provided the local populations with the resources for development.
Mr President, I wish to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Carrilho for her work on this proposal and especially for the efforts she has made to conclude the legislative process at the first reading.
The objective of our proposal was simply to extend the legal basis for the decentralised cooperation budget line for an additional period of two years.
This will ensure the continuity of the budget line and give time for a thorough discussion with all the partners concerned on the role the budget line should play in the strengthening of local actors in the South.
In his speech, Mr Rod suggested that we have not been engaging in proper consultation, but the fact is that by doing what we are doing, we are, in fact, ensuring that consultation takes place.
The outcome of this discussion should then provide the basis for a revision of the strategic guidelines for the decentralised cooperation instrument.
I understand Parliament's concern that the various instruments to strengthen local actors should be integrated into a coherent strategy on the involvement of civil society in the South in development cooperation.
I agree that there is a need to have a debate on this.
A communication on a strategy to support civil society in developing countries is planned for the second half of this year.
As has been mentioned, we had promised this communication earlier, but we started out on too narrow a basis, which did not offer a global perspective.
And has been said here, we have systems which vary quite a lot among the ACP countries and the rest of our partner countries.
We expect the debate on civil society involvement to feed into the discussion on the continued promotion of decentralised cooperation and the future of a specific budget line in this area.
I would like to make one more comment on this: the support we can give to NGOs and non-governmental actors in the future in ACP countries is something that goes far beyond the power and potential of this budget line.
For countries outside the ACP, the situation is different and much more dependent on the individual strategy that we agree with each country.
This does not rule out the possibility of similar action if it is agreed with the partner country.
Furthermore, there is broad agreement on the benefit of urging European NGOs to work in partnership in the South.
This was, in fact, the main idea behind this special cofinancing budget line.
In a sense, this budget line could be deemed a phenomenal success because we have brought it into the ACP philosophy and we are now also urging NGOs in general to engage directly with partners in the South.
This is the background against which we think it useful to have a broader and more open discussion about the virtues of a specific budget line for this item, but my own decision is that we need a broad, open discussion and should give ourselves enough time to allow everybody to participate in the discussion.
This is exactly what is being made possible by the report we are discussing at present.
The proposed amendments are mainly intended to ensure compliance with the latest comitology procedures and coherence with other recently adopted regulations in the area of development cooperation.
They also clarify the eligibility of some civil society actors.
The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments.
They reflect well the fruitful discussions between the rapporteur, the Council working group and the Commission services.
I hope that the Council will also agree to all Parliament's amendments and that the regulation can thus be adopted as soon as possible in terms reflecting this first reading.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is oral question (B5-0009/2002) to the Commission, by Mrs BerÃšs and others, on behalf of the Parliamentary Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on parental responsibility.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the lateness of the hour, I would particularly like to mention the ladies and gentlemen in the interpreters' booths.
Our thanks are due to them.
They are always there and help us in Europe to understand each other better, and to get on better with each other.
We now have before us the question on parental responsibility that we have tabled.
We as a legislature should not lecture people about how to run their lives, but we do need to help them find the right path through life.
We need to make that right path possible.
That is why the European Union has pledged itself to honour fundamental rights, both in the treaties and in the Charter.
The Member States have now been co-existing very well for over 50 years.
Peace has reigned between very different societies, but within families there is often conflict when love is shattered.
Generally, it is the children who suffer.
In such cases we then read in the newspapers about children being kidnapped by their own parents or being unable to develop properly because of the pressure they are under.
We should not pretend that these things are not happening, and we have to recognise that what are apparently merely family arguments between a few individuals indicate problems with a European dimension.
Ultimately, it is the rubbing points in cross-border judicial arrangements that grind down families and children.
That is what we need to put a stop to.
That is why our question to the Commission includes points that we have identified in conversation with the people affected.
Our question includes proposals for solving the legal problems and facilitating judicial cooperation for the benefit of children.
I do not want to read out the details again here, Commissioner.
You have had a chance to read them and I would be pleased if you could agree with each of them.
You would be doing a great many people a service if you were to do that and if you were to make it clear to even more of our citizens that Europe is more than a legally defined area of freedom, security and justice.
Please take this opportunity to make it clear, together with the European Parliament, that Europe is an area in which people can feel secure outside their own borders, even if there has been conflict between partners.
That is why - and our question relates to these three things - we need clear and comprehensive legislation, properly motivated lawyers who jointly implement legislation with a common understanding for people, and, last but not least, good common fundamental concepts.
I hope that you can also satisfactorily answer this question for us.
Mr President, I will, of course, do my best.
The Tampere European Council identified visiting rights as a priority in the creation of a single judicial area where decisions can circulate freely from one Member State to another.
This priority responds to the social reality of people increasingly relocating from one Member State to another with families breaking up and reforming.
As the honourable Member has said, the Commission is now working on a new proposal that brings together the Commission proposal on parental responsibility of September 2001, the French initiative on rights of access of July 2000 and the Brussels II Regulation. We expect to be able to present this proposal in April 2002.
As was the case with the Commission proposal and the French initiative, the aim is to fashion solutions that build on the mutual trust inherent in a common judicial area to best protect the child.
This means going beyond the balance struck in the Hague Conventions while, at the same time, recognising their value in addressing international situations.
To this end, in November 2001, the Commission presented a proposal on the signature of the 1996 Hague Convention.
The Commission fully shares your concern about making progress fast.
This now appears possible, especially in the light of the recognition during the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Santiago de Compostela in February 2002 of the need for a Community-specific solution giving the final say in cases of child abduction to the Member State of the child's habitual residence with the Member State to which the child has been abducted being able to take provisional measures only.
We trust that this work will continue to benefit from the support of the European Parliament.
Honourable Members are perfectly correct in pointing out the importance of mutual trust between national judges for the execution of decisions issued in another Member State.
For several years the Commission has, through the Grotius and Grotius-civil programmes, continuously supported projects aimed at bringing together judges from different countries to improve mutual understanding of legal systems between Member States.
A significant number of these projects have focused on family law.
Support for such projects will continue to be available through the new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters, to be adopted by the end of March.
The new programme, which will apply from 2002-2006, will be endowed with higher budgetary means than the previous programmes.
You may wish to know that, as concerns the implementation of the new programme in 2002, the Commission is considering giving priority to training for legal practitioners on Community instruments in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters, including, for example, the Brussels II Regulation.
Moreover, the new programme will also allow for direct actions taken by the Commission to ensure the sound application and implementation of Community law.
Such actions will, needless to say, also cover instruments in the family law area.
Mention should be made of the European Judicial Network in civil matters, which will be operational towards the end of the year.
The network will also facilitate mutual understanding of the legal systems of the Member States, as well as providing a means of identifying and solving problems related to judicial cooperation in civil matters.
Consequently, the Commission considers that the necessary instruments - as concerns judicial cooperation in civil matters, including the family law area - are already in place to reach the objectives the Members refer to.
Building on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all actions relating to him or her.
As has been pointed out, the 'best interests of the child' is a fluid concept that is open to different interpretations and ultimately rests on the appreciation by the judge of all the elements of the case at hand.
A multidisciplinary project that sheds light on the state of play as regards the different conceptions of the 'best interests of the child' would usefully complement our work by promoting mutual understanding of legal systems and thus reinforcing the requisite mutual trust for the free circulation of decisions.
Such a project would be eligible for financing under the above-mentioned new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters.
Mr President, Commissioner, you have listed a lot of very worthy projects.
As rapporteur I hope very much that I will receive the tidied-up proposal which is due in April.
It has been mentioned in the question as well.
The problem is that there are quite a number of serious practical problems that we have to deal with.
For example, Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs BerÃšs sit on a particular committee in France dealing with these issues.
I understand that there are, at this very moment, about 50 outstanding cases.
The biggest problem - from the case-load I have - seems to be where parents are denied visiting rights by the custodial parent.
I should like to list, for the record of the House, the active cases I am working on at the moment.
Mr Eric Comet, whose children are in Finland, was granted custody by the courts in Finland.
This custody he could never exercise.
His children no longer wish to see him.
In Sweden we have two cases of fathers seeking visiting rights to their children: Philippe Paquay and Kevin Willoughby.
In Germany, believed by most people who work in this area to be the country where most of these difficulties exist, we have Mr Guy Foster and Mr Chris McMullen; and probably one of the best-known cases of all, Lady Catherine Meyer, the wife of the British Ambassador in Washington, who has seen her two sons for precisely 24 hours in the past six years.
In the Netherlands we have Mr Morales-Gouvenne and in Austria we have NoÃ«l Dumont.
The problem is that particularly in Germany, social workers seem to be able, under German law, to make decisions about access and custody which, in some cases, take no note of decisions made in courts in other countries.
In very many cases, the judges involved have perhaps only one case of this sort throughout their working life and are therefore unfamiliar with what the Hague Convention and hopefully now this new regulation will entail.
We still see - and unfortunately this is at the heart of most of these cases - parents using their unfortunate children as weapons in the war between the sexes.
Commissioner, you mentioned the Hague Convention of 1996 which, thankfully, was recognised last November.
However, it has not been signed by any Member State, nor by the Community.
This is causing serious problems because at the heart of that legislation is the recognition of the right of every child to know and have access to both its parents.
Mr President, I hope that you will be able to tell Commissioner Vitorino to what extent the MEPs here are rallying on this issue, that they want to make it a political challenge, because children are not capable of making as much noise as bombs, but that they too need exequatur procedures to be abolished.
They need policies to be implemented.
If the Commission indeed wants to make the mobility of European citizens one of its priorities in order to harmonise and promote the European labour market, it should face facts: we will also need European family law within the European judicial area.
Experts have been working for years on drawing up these texts and are despairing of ever being able to mobilise policies.
We need to take this task in both hands, and I think that this oral question can contribute to that.
What European law should we draw up?
There are the mechanisms of the Hague.
There is certainly a particular place for Community law, for law of the members of the European Union.
From that point of view, I would like to draw your attention to a few difficulties.
The first is that through European law we should not call into question the principle of the authority of the judge of the resident country.
This is an inviolable right if we wish to face up to the reality and resolve conflicts in a harmonious manner.
There is the possibility of developing networks of trust.
This is essential, otherwise automatic return, which is what should be standard law in the European Union, will never come.
You mentioned some programmes for developing those trust measures.
Use them.
We need them in order to promote exchange, so that when a French judge rules on a child custody case, on return after abduction, he will not be tempted by the nationalist reflex.
Neither the French judge, nor the English, Irish, German or Finnish judge.
There is also the hope that came from the Informal Council meeting in Santiago de Compostela, which was a positive sign.
But as it is the details that cause the problem, it is essential that the conditions for the return of children be respected.
Whether it is after an abduction or after exercising rights of access or rights to have a child to stay for a limited period, the return should take place according to the law of the country of residence.
Finally, I would just like to ask you for clarification on the third part of our question: what do you think of the idea that the Commission could launch a working group in order to have a discussion between Europeans of the tricky notion, which pollutes many of the judgments, that of the interests of the child, which we have included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his attendance at such a late hour.
We have heard a reference to abduction, but of course abduction takes many forms and can be subtle.
Mrs Banotti has raised the issue of a constituent of mine, Mr Guy Foster; and allow me to summarise the case because it concerns real human lives.
Mr Foster has been denied access to his child ever since his German wife returned to Germany with the child following their divorce.
The agreement was for the mother to have the right of abode over the son and for Mr Foster to have full visiting rights.
However, once in Germany, the mother neglected the child and spent time in psychiatric care, and the child was subsequently placed in the care of its maternal grandmother.
Despite Mr Foster's persistent attempts to contact his son, he has been cut off from him ever since, unable to speak with or visit him because the mother and maternal grandparents have withheld information.
A court made a decision on this case, but he was given information about the court appearance after the date.
Documents were served in a foreign language.
The handing over of care to the grandmother was thus allowed to proceed without Mr Foster being able to represent his views.
I believe he has been denied and is still being denied the fundamental right to see this child and has been denied access to justice.
This is surely wrong in the eyes of those of us who believe that we should always serve the best long-term interests of the child.
Mrs Gebhardt referred to two key words: help and enable.
We are fifteen different Member States with different languages and different cultures, but we must never use language as a means of excluding people from the debate or denying them their rights.
Therefore, I urge the Commission to take action, to be imaginative at Community level and at Member State level to ensure mutual recognition and judicial cooperation, and to put an end to these tragic human cases, which have consequences beyond our own time.
Mr President, Mrs Gebhardt began by saying that Europe is an area in which people feel secure.
Indeed, security was the raison d'Ãªtre for what has become the European Union today.
The pioneers sought to make a peaceful Europe and they, of course, succeeded.
Nowadays, we are at peace and people expect to be safe, but too often the European Union is accused of meddling in things that are not important and too much of what the European Parliament appears to do is irrelevant to ordinary peoples' lives.
Sometimes we discover a real area that needs legislation and yet we are powerless to act.
As Mrs Banotti and Mr Cashman have pointed out, this is an area that needs legislation and where, I believe, European action would be positively welcomed.
The cases of access we have heard about; in which parents are denied access to their children, are desperately distressing.
They make the misery of separation even worse.
Being separated by time and space, by hundreds of kilometres and expensive flights, is painful and distressing for parents and children.
President, Commissioner, over the years Parliament, the Council and the Commission have all worked to secure a common market for goods and capital, fair trade and free trade for those with money.
Now we need to make certain that we have, a fair market and a free trade for people so that families and children can work and move around with rules that are fair, rules that work and European institutions that enforce them.
Mr Cashman said that the European Union is fifteen countries.
He is right, but with the addition of ten or twelve more countries in the pipeline, I shudder to think of the possibilities in this area if we do not act and do not succeed in getting legislation that works - legislation that will make the European Union safe and secure for all its citizens, children and parents alike.
Mr President, I only need to make a few comments.
Mrs Banotti asked if the proposal the Commission has announced for April will be available.
It will be.
Any other course would definitely not be in the interests of the Commission, so we look forward to presenting it and discussing it.
This is how we shall proceed.
Mrs BerÃšs asked whether I had forgotten the third part of the question concerning the child's interests.
I repeat the final phrases of my first contribution, namely: A multidisciplinary project that sheds light on the state of play of different conceptions of the best interests of the child would usefully complement our work by promoting mutual understanding of legal systems and thus reinforcing the requisite mutual trust for the free circulation of decisions.
Such a project would be eligible for financing under the new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters.
We see this as a way of moving the issue forward.
I have noted with great care and interest the different contributions in this discussion and we have moved it another step forward this evening.
Thank you, Commissioner, on behalf of all the Members present, for your answer.
(The sitting was closed at 12. 05 a.m.)
Nuts and locust beans
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for adopting this report by unanimity.
In addition, I should like to recall Parliament's considerable institutional support to the nuts and locust beans sector. This is evidenced in a number of resolutions testifying to the significance of this sector within the Union.
At the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July 2001, Commissioner Fischler announced that a detailed study of the Community nuts sector would be undertaken. The Commissioner also stated that if appropriate, specific proposals to benefit the sector would be made, to follow on from the improvement plans expiring in 2001.
In the light of this situation, the Commission has proposed an additional one-year extension of the improvement plans.
I have certainly welcomed this.
Nonetheless, I would like to make it clear that I trust it will be the last transitional instrument, to be followed by a permanent proposal. Such a proposal must ensure the survival of the sector and put an end to the difficulties and uncertainty European Union producers are experiencing.
The main aim of our report was to settle the issue of permanent support measures once and for all.
The nuts sector is very important to the Union from a social, economic and environmental point of view. Over a million hectares are devoted to these crops.
They extend across the Mediterranean countries, and the land is mostly located in very disadvantaged areas where agriculture is difficult. Much of the soil is hillside or arid.
These products therefore have to overcome many difficulties to remain on the market and be economically viable without direct support from public institutions. The difficulties are exacerbated by strong outside competition.
For instance, there are hazelnuts from Turkey and almonds from the United States.
In both cases the conditions of production bear no comparison to those in Europe.
In addition, the outside products benefit from tariff concessions under international agreements.
The nuts sector is an example of multifunctional production and is essential to the socio-economic survival of many families in rural areas of the Union. This is because of its role in regional planning, since no alternative crops exist, and also because of its part in environmental conservation.
It helps prevent erosion and is important in combating fires. It also preserves indigenous genetic material, which is of great organolectic value.
In the light of this difficult situation and lack of competitiveness in 1989, the Commission adopted a package of specific measures. These were aimed mainly at raising the quality and competitiveness of the products.
The ten-year improvement plans were due to expire in 2000 but were extended until 15 July 2001.
The results of the plans proved positive. There were notable improvements in production and marketing.
Unfortunately the same was not true of competitiveness, due to the difficult structural conditions at the outset.
The Commission's present proposal would allow these last plans to be extended to 15 June 2002 with the Community contribution decreasing from 82 to 75%.
Taking the specific case of hazelnuts, the payment per kilo is retained for the 2001-2002 harvest. Payments will only be made, however, to members of producer organisations not eligible for the extension.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has attempted to introduce considerable improvements to the executive committee's proposal through its amendment.
Regarding the restrictions on support for hazelnut production, we believe that it is not acceptable to withhold it from those producer organisations wishing to benefit from the extension of improvement schemes.
This would amount to discrimination between producers' organisations, giving some of them an unfair advantage.
As for the level of national cofinancing, the increase on the current commitment proposed for the extended plans cannot be justified.
In this connection, the percentage relating to nuts is minimal and does not justify the proposal.
As for the areas covered by the plans and entitled to aid, the percentage should be retained on the basis of the area certified in the last year's plans and not the area for which aid has been requested.
The Committee on Agriculture is of the opinion that in order to improve awareness and production monitoring, provision must be made to set up a geographical information system.
The committee is also on record as advocating the need to establish a permanent framework for aid to the sector. Further, the committee has argued for ongoing support in the form of aid per hectare to guarantee maintenance of the producers' income in a situation of sustainable exploitation.
Hence the advisability of linking this latest extension to permanent aid, the ultimate aim being to consolidate a system of ongoing aid channelled through the producer organisations.
I must not conclude without mentioning the Committee on Agriculture's specific request that chestnuts be included in the nuts sector.
The protection of this tree and fruit associated with forested areas and ancient culinary traditions is crucial to preserving a very important ecosystem that is obviously being encroached upon. It also has a bearing on the related environmental issues.
Finally, I should like to point out that two identical amendments have been put to plenary. They both aim at increasing support to hazelnuts by means of an additional marketing season.
I am unable to support these amendments although I appreciate and share concerns over the difficulties currently experienced in marketing hazelnuts.
The request for a permanent regime implies that support to hazelnuts would be covered by that regime. It is therefore not appropriate to extend still further a temporary arrangement with a set expiry date that has merely generated uncertainty.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I trust we shall be able to continue enjoying the best desserts, the best nougat, and all those products manufactured with the best and most delicious hazelnuts and almonds in the world.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should first like to warmly congratulate Mr Carlos Bautista Ojeda, the rapporteur, on his excellent work.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should also be thanked for its almost unanimous support for this sector.
The rapporteur has already described the importance of the fruit and vegetable sector for the countries of southern Europe, so there is no need for me to do so.
Almost two years ago, the Council requested the Commission to undertake a specific assessment of the situation of the nuts sector in the framework of the report on the operation of the COM in fruit and vegetables. This problem has yet to be finally resolved.
We are still trying to provide a remedy in extending the improvement plans. What is actually required is a final and immediately applicable definition, along with the implementation of support mechanisms to replace the present improvement programmes as they expire.
The Commission is adamant on resolving the extensions through this draft Regulation.
A reduction in Community cofinancing is involved, however. In addition, aid to hazelnuts is proposed, but only for farmers not eligible for the extension.
The European Commission's proposal to extend the improvement plans for a second year is positive.
Nonetheless, it does not allay all of the producers' concerns. As I stated, the latter are calling for a permanent solution, so they can continue to resist the strong competition by almonds from the United States and hazelnuts from Turkey.
The report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deals with the gaps in the Commission's plan.
The amendments adopted call for specific aid to hazelnuts for all organisations requesting it, not just for those participating in improvement plans, as the Commission suggests. The amendments also call for the retention of current cofinancing levels for these improvement plans, whereas the Commission wishes to increase the Member States' cofinancing from 18 to 25%.
The deletion of a reference to gradual transferral of financial responsibility to the producers in recital 2 is also requested. Finally, there is the call to introduce a permanent regime based on the award of aid per hectare, subject to the implementation of good agricultural and environmentally friendly practice.
Commissioner, these are the main requests from the Committee on Agriculture.
The Committee also calls for this aid to be extended to chestnuts, a product not currently covered by the improvement plans.
The key factor is that the European Parliament is in favour of a permanent solution for this sector in the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables. Parliament calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal for the implementation of a definitive support regime for the sector before 1 June 2002.
Efforts to find a solution to the situation of the nuts sector in the European Union within the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables must therefore be intensified.
Madam President, I must first congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.
You will be aware, Commissioner, that on numerous occasions the European Parliament has expressed its institutional support for the nuts sector in the European Union. It has done so conscious of the fact that they are essentially a multifunctional crop which contributes to environmental conservation and helps combat erosion.
It also has a part to play in regional planning, as it is one of the few activities keeping people on the land in places where other forms of agriculture are not viable. As most of the producer regions in the European Union are disadvantaged, it has economic and social significance too.
We are not in a position to oppose the Commission's proposal to extend these plans for improving aid to the sector.
We certainly support the rapporteur's view that it is not acceptable for the Commission to propose excluding producer organisations wishing to benefit from the improvement plans from eligibility for the specific hazelnut aid. We cannot either go along with the Commission's intention of reducing Community cofinancing from 82 to 75% in these extended plans.
Commissioner, we are bound to say that we would like our request for permanent support to this sector to go on record. Such a solution would provide stability and make it possible to produce the crop in Europe.
This can only happen if we succeed in setting up permanent support targeted at producer organisations and within a stable framework, namely the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables.
The Commission should pursue this objective and approach during the extra year for which the plans will be extended.
Madam President, I must first join with the previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur on his report, which has been unanimously endorsed. In particular, I am grateful to him for showing such sensitivity to the needs of the sector.
The latter is obviously very important in Catalonia. I would also like to thank Mr Bautista Ojeda for being so receptive to the suggestions made by the Catalan regional government.
I think it is worth recalling that clearly we are not dealing with one of the major agricultural or livestock sectors central to the common agricultural policy (CAP). Nonetheless, this sector extends over a million hectares and makes a specific and significant contribution in the immediate vicinity.
It has considerable social impact too.
In my view therefore, the request for maintaining support during 2001 and 2002 must lead, as previous speakers stated, to a permanent support regime per hectare.
Consequently we are against Amendment No 10 tabled by Mr Fiori, because requesting support for 2002 and 2003 at this stage would essentially invalidate the report's main objective.
We therefore believe that as outlined previously and in terms of hectare as in Mrs Ayuso's amendment adopted in committee, namely certified areas, this report presents an approach the Commission should certainly consider.

Madam President, I should first like to thank Mr Bautista Ojeda for his excellent report. I am sure he knows he can rely on total support from my group.
It would be hard to name an issue preceded by more Parliamentary initiatives during the last twelve years.
The House has witnessed the same debate time and again during this period.
The principles are unchanged, but the situation on the ground has worsened.
Turkish economic policy recently caused an artificial fall in the price of hazelnuts and other agricultural products in response to internal pressures.
This is not a new problem, but it escalated because the Commission failed to tackle it in its proposals.
I do not believe the Commission's suggestion, namely transferring the nuts problem to rural development, is realistic. This might have been said in the Committee on Agriculture.
A problem related to the market should be dealt with using the appropriate tools.
It is unwise to keep resorting to the second pillar to solve all our difficulties.
For the last twelve years, the House has been advocating an honourable solution for this sector of production which is experiencing very specific problems. The Commission's response has been simply to grant extensions to a regime that does not deal with the problems the sector needs to overcome.
The permanent solution put forward by the House on a number of occasions has been ignored.
One might well wonder whether sometimes the nub of the problem is not in fact the Commission's lack of resolve when it comes to proposing effective measures to deal with the difficulties facing the nuts sector, rather than the difficulties themselves.
For my part, Commissioner, I hope that is not so on this occasion.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by thanking you for your report, Mr Bautista Ojeda, and for all the time and trouble which you have taken in working out the 16 proposed amendments.
Before I comment on these proposed amendments, I should like to say a few words about the proposal itself. As you probably know, improvement plans have been implemented for some 600 000 hectares sown with nuts since 1989.
The European Union spent a total of EUR 900 million on these plans up to 2001.
The purpose of the improvement plans was to enhance the economic basis for nut growing by pooling supplies, improving quality and building up a production and marketing infrastructure.
These plans were limited to ten years, after which financial responsibility would revert solely to producers.
However, when the first plans ran out, a one-off extension was granted in Council Regulation No 558/2001.
The eleventh year of these plans ran out last year, as did the 10-year deadline for a further series of plans and the plans for the remaining 35% of land sown with nuts will run out by 2006/2007.
On 23 July last year, the Council asked the Commission to launch an in-depth study into all aspects of this sector and called on it to submit the conclusions of the study and any proposals as quickly as possible.
The study is well under way and will be presented in May of this year.
The Commission was conscious of the fact that something needed to be done in the meantime and that this interim period needed to be bridged, which is why it suggested that the Council and Parliament approve the proposal for a regulation extending the improvement plans by a further year. This draft also makes provision for special aid for hazelnuts.
Now to the 16 proposed amendments.
The first group of amendments deals with general issues.
Amendment No 1 refers to Regulation No 1035/1972, the proposed amendment to the Commission report to the Council on the common organisation of the market.
Of course we can no longer change the wording of a regulation which has been abolished, but Amendment No 2 is acceptable in principle.
I also agree with Amendment No 3 highlighting the ecological importance of the nut sector.
The second group of proposed amendments contains proposals for fundamental changes to the existing proposal.
All these proposals impact on the budget, some considerably, which is why the Commission cannot agree to them.
This applies to Amendments Nos 4 to 6, 10 to 12 and 15 and 16.
The third group relates to the future of the sector.
Amendments Nos 9 and 13 highlight the need for a permanent support regime for nuts, while Amendment No 8 calls for the benefits achieved with the improvement plans to be preserved, mainly by channelling supplies through producer organisations.
Amendment Nos 7 and 14 call for knowledge on production and control to be improved using the Geographical Information System.
All these proposed amendments have repercussions which go beyond the framework of the proposal submitted, which merely recommends a year's extension, which is why I cannot accept these amendments within the context of this proposal.
However, I can assure you that we have taken good note of your proposals and shall take proper account of them.
As I have already explained on previous occasions, we are all agreed that there is a chronic lack of competition in this sector and that it does not therefore make economic sense to hang on to the belief that EU producers can hold out against free competition with Turkish hazelnuts or American almonds in the long term.
In my opinion, therefore, we need an answer to the following questions.
First, does the European Union need to produce its own nuts?
Secondly, do nuts fulfil a multifunctional role?
Thirdly, should the EU continue to invest in maintaining nut production?
And fourthly, if so, in what form?
I feel that support measures should also help to promote the sustainability of rural areas and protect the environment and should not just be geared to making the sector economically competitive.
Finally, I should like to thank you once again for your contributions.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0065/2002) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 harvests and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 (COM(2001) 684 - C5-0678/2001 - 2001/0276(CNS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this proposal, the Commission is seeking to amend the basic regulation on the common organisation of the market in tobacco (Regulation (EEC) 2075/92), fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 harvests.
On this basis, one might assume that the Commission proposal is of a fundamentally technical nature and is confined to adapting the main instruments of support for tobacco production, in accordance with changes in supply and demand in the market.
Furthermore, this adjustment is made necessary by the current arrangements, since producers must be notified about quotas before 15 April and the relevant contracts be drawn up before 30 May.
Nevertheless, with the excuse that Regulation (EEC) 2075/92 needs technical updating, the proposal goes much farther.
In fact, it indirectly introduces a reform of a much broader political scope and goes so far as to set the phasing out of tobacco subsidies as the ultimate objective (see recital 5).
In doing this, the Commission is in actual fact determining the scope of the decisions which have been proposed and which, in due course and subject to the relevant proposals, will have to be taken by the Community institutions.
There are two reasons for this: first of all, the Commission launched an evaluation study of the COM in raw tobacco, which should enable an assessment to be made of the effects of current Community policy on the sector, and its conclusions will only be available at the end of 2002; secondly, it was the Commission itself that undertook to submit proposals on the new tobacco policy at the beginning of next year, but only on the basis of the studies that are now being carried out.
Of course, this proposal will have to be consistent with society's growing demands for sustainable development and high-quality products and, in the same context, must provide an adequate response to the official statements issued hitherto concerning the sector's future.
Your rapporteur is of the view that the European Parliament cannot allow the Commission to pre-empt and make assumptions about the decisions that both the European Parliament and the Council will be taking in the coming months, on the basis of the evaluation studies and the latest data recorded in this sector, which I have already mentioned.
In this context, the rapporteur's amendments are confined to improving the Commission's proposals in an essentially technical way and explicitly rule out the possibility of entering into a far-reaching political debate on the future support arrangements for tobacco, which can only be tackled rigorously during 2003, taking into account the studies and reports mentioned above.
It must be considered, however, that this position of the rapporteur does not simply mean accepting the status quo, which, furthermore, he feels is unsustainable.
To this end, the rapporteur tabled Amendment No 23, in order to regain the original spirit of commitment towards the Community Tobacco Fund.
This amendment has two implications: firstly, not only accepting financing by the Fund of actions to prevent nicotine addiction and of experimental action to encourage tobacco producers to switch to other crops and economic activities, but also maintaining the financing of agronomic research into varieties of tobacco that are less damaging to the environment and to health; and, secondly, increasing the levy on producers' premiums from 2% to 3%, thereby rejecting both the present figure of 2%, and the Commission's proposal of 5%.
And, in order to ensure consistency with this vision of commitment, the rapporteur proposes that we also reject Amendments Nos 9 and 13.
The around 130 thousand tobacco producers in the European Union, most of whom live in the least-favoured regions of southern Europe, deserve to have the competent Community institutions concern themselves, in a responsible way, with their future.
Hence, also, the importance of having sufficient evaluation and impact studies of the current situation so that we can make responsible and realistic proposals for the future, but only once we know exactly what the effects of the current policy are.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tobacco is the mainstay of the economy of large rural areas of southern Europe.
Production of this crop is hardly mechanised, so it has considerable social significance and an impact on employment.
Tobacco is grown on small family plots in regions classed amongst the poorest in Europe.
I shall give you an example affecting my country directly. Tobacco represents 25% of final agricultural production in the region of Extremadura.
The argument linking the end of aid to tobacco and consequently the end of its production with health considerations is quite mistaken, unfair and regrettably also hypocritical.
Nobody would dream of suggesting stopping the cultivation of plants used to produce alcohol through distillation because of the health problems caused by alcohol. Nobody has suggested closing down the factories manufacturing cigars and cigarettes either, or banning the sale of these products.
It is certainly the case that the withdrawal of aid would put an end to tobacco production in Europe. This would not, however, improve the health of European consumers because the gap left by Community production would be filled by imports from third countries.
Anyone wishing to continue smoking could do so. What is at issue is simply commercial interest.
The only way of tackling the health issue is to pursue the approach launched some time ago by the European Union. This involves developing methods of cultivation and introducing less harmful varieties whilst also boosting information campaigns designed to reduce consumption.
The opinion of the Committee on Budgets is that agronomic research financed by the Tobacco Fund should be intensified. The European Commission, on the other hand, wishes to stop research and promote conversion, though no viable alternative is suggested.
The Commission is exceeding its competence on this issue.
Its role should be to extend the aid regime, in a spirit of continuity.
We therefore request the deletion of recital 5, and we believe the legal service of the Council of Ministers agrees with us on this.
Madam President, Commissioner, whenever we debate the question of tobacco, I always wonder, even if we are all anti-smoking, why do we need to be anti-tobacco?
These are two separate issues and I think that the Commission should realise that, as should many of the honourable Members.
We are against smoking and we must do all we can to stop it from spreading and reduce it.
I have no objection to that.
But if we abolish tobacco growing, all we shall do is condemn a number of European citizens to financial ruin and give a fillip to tobacco farmers in third countries.
All we shall do is reduce our exports and increase our imports.
All we shall do is increase the dole queues in the European Union.
Is that what we are trying to do?
Is that our objective?
In other words, do all those who maintain that, if we grub up tobacco farms in Europe, we shall help reduce smoking, mean to tell us that we need to grub up vineyards in order to fight alcoholism?
Do they mean to tell us we should close our car factories in order to reduce the number of fatal road traffic accidents?
It is time we stopped being two-faced, faced the facts and dealt with things in the proper manner.
It is time we sat down together, with an open mind and our eyes wide open, called a spade a spade and worked out a strategy to drastically reduce smoking and its harmful effects and a strategy to develop the economy of the European Union.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating and thanking rapporteur, Mr Cunha, both for the careful and serious approach which he has taken to the subject of tobacco in his report and for the sensitive and understanding manner in which he dealt with the interventions of the members of the Committee on Agriculture.
For the rest, however, as he himself has said, the subject of tobacco as dealt with in this specific proposal for a Council regulation is a purely technical matter concerning the 2002, 2003 and 2004 crops.
The Commission was wrong to try and introduce political criteria into the debate; apart from the fact that they have nothing to do with the aspects of the issue at debate here, they are also completely groundless, premature and even, I would say, provocative as regards the more general working of and prospects for the common agricultural policy.
We all know that tobacco is a prime example of a very labour-intensive crop grown on family-run farms and poor, barren soil, meaning that, apart from anything else, it allows man to live and work in areas which, if deserted physically and ecologically, would have incalculable social and environmental repercussions.
The Commission knows all this and it was the Commission which used to take every opportunity to reiterate it.
Lately, however, motivated perhaps by the expediency of supporting its misguided intervention in Gothenburg, it has omitted to repeat its earlier references and is in danger of putting the debate on this issue on the wrong footing.
The right footing is exactly as suggested by Mr Cunha in his report with the support of the Committee on Agriculture, which plenary is called on to endorse and which the Commission is called on to respect in any future action.
Madam President, we too welcome the Cunha report, which we support.
The statistics show that approximately 130 000 farmers and around 400 000 seasonal workers are involved in tobacco growing, in addition to all those involved in the production chain.
This is therefore a serious matter which we feel requires greater analysis on the part of the Commission, not least in the light of Communication No 264 of 15 May 2001, which contains a clear statement to the effect that, should the Commission decide on a political proposal for action, all the repercussions and implications of this strategy for tobacco growing and the reduction of aid to growers would, indeed, be assessed.
For this reason and also for the reasons expounded by other Members regarding the limited actual effect the measure would have on cigarette consumption, as regards the issue of smoking, it is therefore important, moreover, to preserve the research fund, particularly for agronomic research on broad-leaf tobacco, for that represents our only hope if we are to reduce the harmful effects of smoking and contribute to the right of all consumers to health too.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Cunha quite rightly said, this report is an extremely political document, despite the fact that it appears to be technical.
It raises the key question as to whether we should continue to subsidise the cultivation of a plant, the main use of which is in the manufacture of a product recognised as being extremely harmful to human health.
Tobacco, I am sorry to say, is a hard drug, and we must have the courage to say this.
The problem dates back a long way and the Commission is using this proposal for updating the regulation to clearly say that we must move away from the system of tobacco subsidies.
However, as we must give farmers the time to change activity, the debate initially focuses on the time they are given to do this. And Mr Cunha's proposal was, from that point of view, very reasonable.
It is natural to allow them time - but not too much time - for the planned assessment.
The Greens believe that the current situation must be tackled now, whether or not we are continually told that these are poor farmers.
As far as I know, Alsace and Andalucia are, in terms of farming, fairly prosperous regions.
The question is to determine whether, at this point, we must subsidise, in other countries, growing dangerous products such as cannabis, for example.
And we must, at this point, have the courage to say so.
There are two points to the second question which is that of the Community Tobacco Fund. The first point is the level of the deduction to be introduced as of 2004; the second is the tasks given to researchers who are funded in this way.
We believe that an increase from 3% to 5% for this Fund is a positive step; in this area, the Commission's proposal has very wisely used the carrot and stick approach in order to refocus these tasks over the long term and to replace agronomic research into making tobacco slightly less harmful with measures to support specific initiatives that encourage tobacco growers to switch from tobacco into other crops.
We must not forget, however, that products other than the cigarette can be produced from tobacco.
It can be an aid to medical research, for example.
It is also an excellent natural insecticide.
But these are specialist niches, and there is a great deal too much cultivated tobacco for these uses.
The Greens will not, therefore, vote in favour of the amendments which have undermined Mr Cunha's patient work. Instead, we will support the Commission in this area.
Madam President, I must first thank Mr Cunha for his excellent report.
It is a considerable achievement, if we take into account that he has had to cope with a scenario created by the Commission, which, as stated by a previous speaker, is plainly hypocritical.
We might agree that tobacco is a danger to health.
Taking this argument to the extreme, one could suggest banning the import of tobacco.
I suspect, however, that few Members of this House would be prepared to vote in favour of closing our borders to tobacco from the United States.
Treasury Ministers are delighted with the income generated by tobacco, whilst Health Ministers rail against it.
Just now, for the first time, charges of smuggling have been brought against multinational companies bringing tobacco into the European Union and attempting to avoid paying the duty due.
There are a number of lessons to be drawn from that and from the prohibitionist experiments conducted in Europe and elsewhere. In the first place, ceasing cultivation without stopping imports has no impact on the availability of a harmful substance.
What it does is make the Community market more attractive to goods from third countries.
Secondly, prohibition does not stop consumption. Instead it boosts smuggling, to the detriment of health checks and of the Treasury.
Thirdly, tobacco production generates more employment and stimulates more economic activity than many other agricultural practices such as meat production. Yet the Commission often displays undue leniency towards these other practices.
In conclusion I also believe that the confusion the Commission may create between the documents submitted to the European Council at GÃ¶teborg and the conclusions of the Council is totally unacceptable, and drastically alters the institutional balance.
In my view therefore, the Commission's assessment of the GÃ¶teborg European Council destabilises the principles and operation of the Community institutional relationship. I trust the European Parliament will reject it, taking account of the Council's Legal Services' contribution to the work of the COMIT.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is taking the opportunity provided by the reform of premiums and guarantee thresholds for the period 2002-2004, to make a change that spells disaster for producers and for the social and economic balance of entire regions.
This change involves paving the way to phase out tobacco production without providing an alternative.
However, tobacco production is valued by disadvantaged areas and by many small- and medium-sized growers.
The workforce employed underpins the economic activity of rural areas.
The European Union produces 5% of the world's tobacco and imports 70% of its requirements.
By ceasing this production, Europe will be dependent on imports and consumption will not be affected in any way.
Tobacco has serious implications for public health and our approach to this subject must take this into account.
Our priority must be to educate young people to deter them from smoking.
Manufacturers also play a part in prevention by financing the Community Fund, which should have been used to inform consumers and also to make progress in research into the harmful effects of products.
Unfortunately, no calls for tenders have been issued since 1997.
By maintaining production in Europe, we are giving ourselves the means to control the quality of tobacco production and processing.
We are also giving ourselves the means to develop less harmful varieties.
Producers will not agree to increases in levies on the premiums to finance something that will lead to them being put out of business.
Our group can do nothing other than to reject recital 5 of the Commission's proposal, which spells disaster for small- and medium-sized growers that help to maintain an agricultural activity throughout the Union's territory.
Commissioner Fischler, like everyone, we obviously share the Commission's concerns regarding the dangers nicotine addiction poses to public health.
But, given the European Union's tobacco deficit, our action must, of course, be based on demand and not on supply.
Let us bear in mind two figures: we consume 800 000 tonnes of raw tobacco and produce 250 000 tonnes in the European Union.
Europe imports 70% of the raw tobacco it needs, and so the European Union is far from being the world's biggest importer.
It is therefore obvious that any action that seeks to reduce production would only increase our dependence on imports.
It is, however, the social effects of such measures that give me cause for concern.
Need we point out that tobacco growing is very labour intensive and involves 130 000 growers and 400 000 seasonal workers, which amounts to more than 500 000 jobs?
Need we point out that the first processing stage provides 18 000 permanent and 40 000 seasonal jobs in rural areas?
Need we point out that tobacco growing is carried out on small family-run farms of between one and two hectares of tobacco, and, on average, tobacco production makes up 60% of the family's income?
Need we point out that most of these farms are situated in disadvantaged regions which many people have left to go to live in towns, which have experienced rural depopulation and problems farming the countryside in rural villages?
Need we point out that tobacco growing, which brings in a steady income, greatly assists in maintaining the farming population and therefore trade and public services?
That is why we must take an extremely careful approach to changing the set-up of the COM in tobacco.
When the reform of the COM in tobacco was approved in 1998, Parliament and the Council planned to carry out an assessment of this reform at the end of 2002.
This assessment alone will provide a basis for an appropriate consideration of the future of tobacco growing in Europe.
I therefore share the view of the rapporteur that no decision should be taken on the future of the existing tobacco regime until we have the results of the studies that are currently being carried out.
And I would point out that the Commission must submit a new proposal on the tobacco sector in 2003.
For these reasons, I am pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has refused the planned quota and premium reductions which would have severely affected farmers' income, would have hampered the restructuring of plantations and would not have encouraged farmers to switch to other crops.
We also oppose the plan to increase farmers' contribution to the Community Tobacco Fund, given that this Fund - which has an annual budget of EUR 20 million - has been substantially under-utilised.
Lastly, we also rejected the Commission's plan to refocus where support from this fund is directed.
To sum up, Madam President, the Commission has put before us a flawed reform, one that, let it be said, also has a tinge of shallow populist rhetoric and hypocrisy, and could have serious social consequences for this sector.
The Committee on Agriculture supported the wise recommendations of our rapporteur who has drafted suitable and solid proposals which do not confuse tobacco and nicotine addiction, and I hope that the House will follow suit.
Madam President, Commissioner, we have read the Commission's proposal with some concern and I must pay tribute to Mr Cunha and the Committee on Agriculture for producing the very balanced report before us today.
It is always difficult to talk about tobacco, for we always end up falling into the trap of populism.
We know that today's report is only one of the stages in the discussion, for the real debate on tobacco will start with the Commission's proposal next year.
However, there are three fundamental points to note.
Firstly, apart from some rare exceptions, tobacco is produced in the poorest and most depressed areas of Europe.
The populism we talk about is also a characteristic of conversion plans: in those areas - and I am referring to the situation of my own country, Italy, but the same applies to parts of Spain or Greece - it is not possible to convert production.
And this populism continues to confuse production with consumption.
As a great French writer said, although it is certainly possible to kick a habit, it is very difficult, for superhuman willpower and, above all, a great deal of time are needed.
Well then, when it comes to smoking, it may well be that we should invest heavily - and this could be part of the Committee on Agriculture's proposal - in an educational process which starts with schools.
As regards this sector of agriculture, we must endeavour to realise that entire family networks are dependent on tobacco for a living and that sudden decisions such as those contained in the Commission's proposal would lead to social and economic collapse that we cannot afford.
Madam President, I too welcome the work done by Mr Cunha in the Committee on Agriculture.
As an aside, it was stated that Andalusia is a very rich agricultural area.
I have to say that I would be delighted with an income from agriculture as high as that enjoyed by the citizens represented by Mrs Auroi, and so would my Andalusian constituents.
I side with those in favour of retaining aid to farmers, although I do not smoke myself and advise everyone not to take it up or to stop.
I believe it would be a mistake to reduce the cultivation of tobacco or do away with it altogether. My reasons are that this would entail a high social cost and that no suitable alternative crops have been identified.
It should also be remembered that those who advocate cutting off aid to the sector on the grounds of health protection fail to take into account that subsidising European production would have no impact on consumption.
This is because the European Union imports 70% of its raw tobacco.
Nonetheless, we have already been presented with a proposal providing for gradual elimination of tobacco without the relevant studies to ensure alternative sources of income following replacement of this crop.
There are no such alternative sources of income at present.
Discussion of reform can only begin when the results of assessment of the COM in tobacco are available, not in any event before 2003.
The Commission aims to replace agricultural research with action to support the development of specific initiatives encouraging tobacco producers to change to other crops and engage in alternative economic activities generating employment. Deductions from the producers' premiums are to be implemented progressively starting in 2004.
The Community Fund financed by deductions from the subsidies has been underused. This was due to serious mismanagement by the Commission.
If the latter handled the existing budget so badly, I have grave misgivings as to whether it would do better with a significantly larger sum. It should be recalled that there have hardly been any calls to tender so far.
The Fund must of course continue to serve its purpose and pursue research into varieties more suited to demand and causing as little harm as possible. Obviously it must also investigate alternative uses for raw tobacco and its environmental impact.
Increased deductions should not be an excuse for covert reductions of the producers' premiums.
I should like to conclude by emphasising the important social and economic role played by tobacco cultivation. It calls for a sizeable workforce on family plots.
The debate on tobacco and public health should not therefore be restricted to the agricultural context, targeting the weakest link in the chain of tobacco production.
Madam President, we should like to express our opposition to any attempt to abolish or gradually reduce aid to tobacco, as proposed by the Commission, because it will wipe out tobacco production in Europe.
We disagree with any proposal which is based on the premise of abandoning tobacco production and tries to gild the pill by allegedly seeking alternative forms of employment and income for producers.
We all know full well that tobacco is grown in disadvantaged areas in the south, mainly barren mountainous areas, and that it is a crop traditionally grown on holdings on which nothing else will grow. It is the sole source of income and means of survival for people living in these areas, for whom there are no alternative forms of employment.
It is infuriating that proposals such as this are being made at a time when smoking is on the increase and 70% of the tobacco used is imported.
Consequently, any reduction in tobacco growing in the Community will wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized holdings and increase imports and merely serves the predatory interests of the huge tobacco industry and distribution monopolies, at the expense of producers and consumers alike.
The only thing we should be reducing are imports, not the income of European farmers, and every suitable measure should be taken in order to do so.
Any other proposal is anything from hypocritical to highly suspicious and a smoke-screen for unlawful interests.
As far as the Cunha report is concerned, it contains a number of good points, but it too accepts the objective, albeit with reservations, of reducing tobacco growing in the Community, perhaps over a longer period of time.
This is clearly illustrated, for example, in Amendments Nos 7 and 12, calling for tobacco growers to be encouraged to switch into other crops, which is why we shall be voting against it.
Madam President, there were a couple of dissenting voices in the Committee on Agriculture about a subsidy for tobacco and I was one of them.
I make no apology for that.
I support the Commission very much on what they are trying to do in phasing out tobacco subsidies and I would encourage them to continue at a faster pace, rather than a slower one.
We cannot justify European taxpayers' money being spent on tobacco production.
One of the key objectives of the common agricultural policy is to produce good, wholesome food for the consumers of Europe.
I cannot quite see how tobacco fits into this scenario.
I have a great deal of respect for Mr Cunha, the rapporteur, but on this occasion he has got it wrong.
He is a little like King Canute, who wanted to stop the tide coming in but was unsuccessful.
The Committee on Agriculture did not face up to the realities.
Over the past ten years we in Europe have spent GBP 6.5 billion or EUR 10 billion - GBP 2 for every citizen in Europe - to subsidise tobacco.
One third of this tobacco is of very low quality and is seldom smoked at all.
Another third is dumped on Developing World markets which then destroys their markets for tobacco.
Is this a role of the common agricultural policy?
It is a role we have tried to avoid.
Only one third of this tobacco is smoked in Europe.
We cannot, therefore, justify the support that we are giving.
We all accept the need to support farming in rural communities, but we have to find different crops and different ways of supporting them in the future.
The final point I wish to make is that, of all the areas of this support that I dislike, the continuation in Amendment No 17 of the support for very low-quality tobacco is the most wrong.
If anything should be corrected it is this.
I urge the Commission to phase out the growing of this very low-quality tobacco immediately.
Madam President, I have one very brief question to ask Commissioner Fischler.
Today we received the opinion of the Council's legal services, questioning whether recital 5 of the Commission proposal is legal.
The Council's legal services question whether recital 5 is legal.
My question to Mr Fischler is this; does he intend to withdraw recital 5?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking you, Mr Cunha for your excellent report, which is obviously based on an in-depth analysis of the Commission proposal.
This proposal fixes the premiums and guarantee thresholds for the next three years, changes the scope of the Tobacco Fund and slightly simplifies the common organisation of the market.
As far as premiums are concerned, the Commission proposal is that the current amounts should remain unchanged, with the exception of variety group 5, which Mr Parish referred to earlier, where we propose a 10% reduction.
This being the case, we cannot accept Amendment No 17; the reduction in premiums for this variety group has only been proposed because the market situation is now totally untenable, with prices in free fall and very high stock levels which will affect future developments on this market.
As far as guarantee thresholds are concerned, the Commission proposal is that they should gradually be reduced by 2.6% to 334 000 tonnes by 2004.
This figure more or less corresponds to quantities produced in the 1999 and 2000 financial years.
Amendments Nos 18 and 19 are not acceptable to the Commission because the suggested guarantee thresholds and the way in which they are broken down bears no relation to current production demands and efforts to encourage varieties for which there is greater demand.
Recital 5, which the honourable Member referred to earlier, reflects the political framework underlying the proposal as regards the Tobacco Fund.
This proposal is a twofold proposal. First it amends the scope of the Fund, by dispensing with funding for agronomic research in order to support producers switching to other crops and, secondly, it gradually increases the amount retained to 5%.
The Commission has created a new political framework in its communication on a strategy for sustainable development.
We are working towards phasing out aid for the tobacco sector because we are required under Article 152 of the Treaty to guarantee a high level of human health protection in all Community policies.
We too are aware of the fact that there is no direct relation between tobacco production and smoking levels, that is, people will not stop smoking because we provide less support for tobacco growing.
The political question lies in Article 152, which quite clearly states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in all Community policies, that is, including all aid policies.
Which means that the other question no longer applies. The deletion of this recital suggested in Amendment No 2 is therefore unacceptable.
Nor is the suggested reference to the European Parliament's resolution in Amendment No 3 acceptable because it has nothing to do with the proposed regulation.
Amendments Nos 4 to 6, calling for an assessment of the social and economic impact have already been overtaken by events.
We are already carrying out a comprehensive assessment which also deals with these aspects.
The Commission cannot therefore decide on a timetable for abolishing aid here and now, as called for in Amendments Nos 25 and 26.
The Commission is aware of the potential impact of phasing out aid to tobacco growing, especially in various production areas such as Greece, Spain and Italy, where the social and economic structure is particularly fragile.
The Commission communication therefore makes provision for measures designed to create alternative jobs and profitable economic activity under rural development plans to support producers switching to other crops.
Amendments Nos 7 and 11 calling for continuing aid for agronomic research are unacceptable because promoting measures to switch into other crops is now a strategic priority and we must move decisively in this direction.
The Commission takes the view that tobacco producers must be offered new ways of diversifying into other crops or other sectors.
Funding can be provided for research under the Community research policy.
Information campaigns on the harmful effects of tobacco consumption need to be extended and new information campaigns need to contain more comprehensive information on the harmful effects of smoking.
That is why we propose gradually increasing the amount retained to 5% by 2004 and why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 or 9.
Amendments Nos 22 and 23 calling for an additional 5% to be retained are unacceptable because they will overstretch a great many enterprises financially.
Amendments Nos 7 and 16 are unacceptable; they are superfluous because the assessment due for completion by 2002 also deals with these aspects.
The same applies to Amendments Nos 10 and 24.
Amendments Nos 1 and 8 are unacceptable because the derogation for cooperative undertakings is difficult to justify.
However, may I remind you that the auction procedure is optional for producer Member States and they are free to decide whether or not they consider it advisable to introduce this procedure.
Finally, I should like to point out that the individual components of this proposal, by which I mean maintaining premiums at current levels, adjusting thresholds to current production levels, the three-year period of validity and promoting diversification, form a balanced entity which is tailored to producers' requirements and takes account of new prospects.
In the first quarter of 2003, the Commission will present new proposals to the European Parliament and the Council for the future of the sector thereafter, based on the results of the assessment, which should be available by the end of this year.
Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify what he just said.
Commissioner, you stated that the Commission is proposing certain measures and alternative employment opportunities in the context of rural development.
That at least is what I understood you to have said.
May I therefore enquire, Commissioner, whether you could provide tobacco farmers with assurances on alternative employment?
Are you in fact guaranteeing jobs?
I would be grateful for clarification.
Mr President, it all depends on what the honourable Member understands by the term guarantee.
What we are doing in this proposal is as follows, as I have already explained: in order to be able to take account of the Commission communication to the European Council, we must develop alternative forms of employment for people at the same time as phasing out tobacco subsidies.
We do not just want to apply a wait and see policy here; we want to test out various alternatives in a sort of pilot stage and see what the best and most promising alternatives are.
Some of the 5% funds which I referred to will be used for this.
If you take a close look at the Commission communication on sustainable development, you will see that what we are starting to do is to phase out tobacco subsidies and develop suitable alternatives in the areas affected at one and the same time.
That is what I explained and that is exactly what we want to do.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0045/2002) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the fish processing industry [2000/2303(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to extol the virtues of fish as a healthy food.
With food scandals left, right and centre, there is surely nothing wrong with highlighting the benefits of healthy eating.
Which is where fish come in.
It is an established fact that an ever increasing proportion of the pro capita consumption of fish is in the form of processed products.
That includes not just canned fish but the whole range of fish on offer, from smoked to frozen fish.
In terms of turnover, the fish processing industry in the European Union is almost twice as large as the fisheries sector.
Given the financial clout of this industry, with turnover in excess of EUR 10 billion, and its vital contribution to the food supply in the EU, I am surprised - with all due respect, Mr Fischler - that the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy pays such scant attention to this sector, especially when the statistics are as follows.
First, it provides almost 100 000 jobs throughout Europe.
Secondly, it involves thousands of enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, often located in structurally-challenged regions with few alternative forms of employment.
Thirdly, it has a long tradition of added-value processing in its many and varied forms.
All this clearly illustrates that the few sentences on the fish processing industry in the Green Paper are far too little and fail to take proper account of this sector, which is why I proposed this own initiative report, to draw attention to this neglected sector and, more importantly, to test out the room for political manoeuvre here in the run up to the reform of the common fisheries policy.
A hearing on the subject in the Committee on Fisheries gave us an interesting insight into the many and varied working conditions, production methods and problems in Europe.
There are a few problem areas which I should like to highlight.
First and foremost, the supply of raw materials.
The fish-processing industry depends on imports for over 50% of its supplies.
Admittedly, these are raw materials which the EU fleet cannot supply, which is why we need to improve conditions and guarantee security of supply.
That includes reducing customs tariffs.
Secondly, environmental measures.
The profitability of the processing industry, with its piecemeal structure, has been drastically reduced in certain cases by the environmental measures taken by the EU.
Environmental protection is important, whether it concerns waste water, packaging or emissions.
But we need to avoid unnecessary distortions as the result of specifications coming too thick and fast.
What good is the cleanest water to us, if there are no jobs left in coastal regions?
Thirdly, food safety.
One thing is clear; the fish-processing industry does not cause pollution and toxins.
Rather, it is the victim of these, which is why it should not be left to shoulder the burden alone.
Surely the purpose of consumer protection is not to set limit values on the basis of the principle: 'Value XY might be dangerous, so let us stick a 150% safety margin on top of it'.
Reliable, toxicologically proven limit values make sense, rush jobs and thrashing about in the dark do not.
I should like the Member States in particular to take good note of that.
Fourthly, enlargement.
The candidate countries are knocking at our door.
Some countries have done exemplary work on hygiene and health protection.
But there are still massive problems to be resolved before adequate standards can be reached.
Fifthly, fundamentals.
We need more information on this sector, which is why we have called for an analysis from the Commission.
The impact of aid from the FIFG must also be examined carefully, because we do not want a sector which is drip-fed by the EU, we want an industry which is vital and can hold its own in the twenty-first century.
Waiving aid in favour of self-help should relate at most to areas which are highly dependent on fisheries in future.
The moral of the story is that the fish-processing industry needs a higher profile in Europe.
This was the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, with just one vote against.
I therefore trust that I can count on your full support for this report when we vote on it at 12 noon.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the proposal of the PPE-DE Group that an own-initiative report should be drawn up on the fish processing industry was a good one.
And, in light of the magnificent report that has been produced, I also welcome the fact that it was drafted by our rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, whom I wish to congratulate once again on her work.
As our rapporteur said, we feel that the Commission is not addressing the issue of this industry with the appropriate seriousness.
The Green Paper is a clear example of this.
This is why we expect more from the Commission in terms of its proposals, and I would say that this report is apt for that very reason.
The Langenhagen report addresses the problem as a whole.
In 1998, we drew up a specific report on the canning industry - for which I had the honour of being rapporteur - but this report provides an update and, furthermore, encompasses the entire industry, including frozen products and the marketing aspects, as well as the products of aquaculture.
From Mrs Langenhagen's report I should like to highlight her observations on both the global and European frameworks, taking account of enlargement.
In the first case, she considers the liberalisation of imports of raw materials, which is very important, and makes specific exceptions for sensitive products such as tuna loins.
She also refers to quality, to the environmental and health and hygiene standards of European products compared to imports, in order to protect European consumers from labelling fraud, which has occurred in the cases of sardines and tuna.
At European level, as has been said, plans are being made to deal with the consequences of the candidate countries' accession, but in a way that does not damage the industry in regions which are behind in economic terms, and which are currently experiencing difficulties.
Lastly, the report calls for our fisheries products to be promoted more vigorously and for more assistance with R+D to be given to our companies.
I wish to conclude by stating, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, that we will be supporting the three amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists but that we shall be voting against Amendment No 4 by the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, because we feel that the text submitted by our rapporteur is better.
Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to say to Mrs Langenhagen that we fully support her report and that we congratulate her on her excellent work.
We socialists have tabled two amendments, to which I should like to ask the rapporteur to give her express support, on the social aspects of the processing industry, urging the Commission, the Member States and social operators to boost the collective negotiation designed to improve the quality of employment in this industry, especially bearing in mind that the majority of these jobs are performed by women, who have very little social protection and who, furthermore, commonly work on a highly casual basis.
It is our view that adopting this approach would bring us closer to the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit to improve the quality of employment.
We believe that improving the training of these nearly 100 000 workers in the processing industry and its conditions of employment, together with this sector's own capacity for innovation and its dynamic, will help to ensure that this industry remains viable and that it has a future.
Indeed, this initiative is sound, and so is the report. Yet, I would still like to make a few observations.
In the original recital G, it is stated that the import of fish and fisheries products from outside the EU by the processing industry could lead to conflicting interests.
This is not always the case. Such imports often provide good incentives for the processing industry and can thus help maintain a good price level for European fishermen.
Such a misconception is indicative of a general problem which, in my view, we are facing in our committee.
There are many areas where we - to a greater or lesser extent - lack sufficient insight into how matters stand.
Unfortunately, we frequently have to make new policy without having all the relevant information on which to base it.
We must therefore try to obtain more insight into how things are.
I am of the opinion that, with regard to research, the emphasis must be on reliability and speed.
I would ask the Commission to ensure that we can have concrete, up-to-date information at our disposal, so that we can take the right decisions in all these areas at the right times.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her report.
The fish processing industry employs 18 140 people in the UK, that is, 20% of the EU jobs in this sector.
The majority of these jobs are in Scotland, and in some of the most peripheral areas of Scotland.
These jobs provide a lifeline to so many people living in rural areas.
Much more than that, they provide us with the finished fish product.
Without the workers in this industry we would not enjoy the fish we take for granted.
That is why the Committee on Fisheries held a hearing and saw that the priorities for the industry were supply, continued employment, the environment, food safety, imports and also the consequences of enlargement.
We know that some of our stocks are at seriously low levels, and therefore when there is a ban on cod fishing, it is not just the fishermen, but the processors that lose out too.
We have to work towards availability of supply, but balance this with high hygiene levels and sustainability of that supply.
The processing industry is an important one, which we should never lose sight of in any fishing debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating you, Mrs Langenhagen, as rapporteur, and the Committee on Fisheries for this own initiative report.
Like the European Parliament, the Commission also sees the European fish-processing industry as an important sector of the economy.
This sector of the economy supplies quality fish products and creates jobs, especially in regions which depend on fisheries, and we are well aware of the challenges which it has to cope with.
There are four main problem areas.
First, the inadequate supply of raw materials from EU waters, secondly, import restrictions on raw materials, thirdly, strict health, hygiene and environmental standards in the EU compared with third countries and, fourthly, increasing international competition.
Now to the individual points in your report.
You complain that we have forgotten this industry in our Green Paper.
May I remind you that it is addressed in our structural policy, especially in items 4 to 7, 14 and 22 and have already supported measures to modernise the European fish-processing industry.
The structural fund for fisheries has earmarked EUR 637 million for this purpose for the period from 2000 to 2006.
I wholeheartedly agree, however, that we need the results of the study into the impact of structural funds on the sector as quickly as possible.
This study will be available in time for the interim review of the structural fund period in 2003.
Now to the supply situation. I fully agree that we need to develop our supply policy.
In the final analysis, it is the competitiveness of our own processing industry which is at stake.
We shall submit a proposal along these lines before the end of this year.
I expressly welcome your call for the liberalisation of port services in the EU to be harmonised to promote fair competition in the processing industry.
The Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on this in May last year.
On the question of health, hygiene and consumer protection inside and outside the Community, I should like to remind you that the relevant provisions of Community law obviously also apply to imports from third countries and we have a comprehensive inspection programme in place in the Member States and third countries in order to ensure that this is the case.
We want to improve these controls still further and the relevant provisions are being revised as we speak.
In addition, the European Food Safety Agency will provide us with substantiated scientific opinions on food and animal food safety in future.
Another question closely related to that of consumer protection is labelling, which was set on a new legal basis in last year's new regulation and which also applies to a whole range of processed products, including smoked, dried and frozen fish.
As far as preparations for enlargement are concerned, the SAPARD and PHARE programmes include measures to ensure that candidate countries quickly come up to our standards in fisheries.
Finally, I should like to point out that the new common organisation of the market makes greater provision for cross-sectoral producer organisations which allow the various industries in the fisheries sector, from fishing to processing and sales, to make use of their common synergy potential, for example, by adapting products to market requirements, improving product quality, developing quality labels or environmentally-friendly production methods and so on. So you see, we have already addressed certain aspects of your initiative, although much still remains to be done and you may be sure that we shall put your proposals into practice as best we can.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2002) by Mr Lage, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1587/98 of 17 July 1998 introducing a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guyana and RÃ©union as a result of those regions' remoteness [COM(2001) 498 - C5-0446/2001 - 2001/0200(CNS)].
. (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Regulation No 1587/1998 introducing a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guyana and RÃ©union as a result of those regions' remoteness, like the regulations that preceded it, has proved to be a fisheries policy instrument of enormous and undeniable use in economic and social terms and even for safeguarding certain cultural values associated with fishing activities.
Nevertheless, pursuant to Article 6 of the same Regulation, the Commission should, by 1 June 2001 at the latest, have presented the European Parliament and the Council with the evaluation report on the measures adopted in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions, which, as we all know, should receive special aid, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, which granted them a special status.
The Commission failed to fulfil that objective by not meeting the deadline set and by using as an excuse for this omission the need for a more detailed analysis using external consultants, against the backdrop of the global revision of the common fisheries policy on the basis of the Green Paper, which has already been opened to public debate.
The results of these studies determine when this report is to be presented, with the Commission proposing to delay its presentation until 1 June 2002, and, as a logical consequence, to extend the scheme in force by one year, until 31 December 2002, thereby guaranteeing the continuity and stability of the current scheme of compensation for additional costs.
In short, there is nothing to worry about.
This is just a pause for thought.
I therefore proposed that the Committee on Fisheries deliver a favourable opinion together with some appropriate amendments to the regulation.
First of all, the scheme of compensation for additional costs must clearly be permanent, with an end to time limits, because the disadvantages faced by the outermost regions as a consequence of their distance from consumer centres are not factors that time and progress will alleviate, being of a structural nature, unless we wish to see the total disappearance of the fisheries sector in these outermost regions one day.
I should like, in order to make these debates a little less formal, to use the powerful metaphor that JosÃ© Saramago, winner of the Nobel prize for literature, worked into his novel 'The Stone Raft', in which he imagines a split occurring between the Iberian Peninsula and the European continent and the peninsula consequently drifting away from the continent.
I do not think that anyone would dare, even ironically, to imagine that the outermost islands could, even at some point in the distant future, become close once again to the European continent, thereby rendering the current concept of remoteness redundant.
It is now, therefore, proposed that we maintain indefinitely the scheme of aid for the additional costs of marketing certain fishery products, maybe allowing them to be gradually adapted.
The future regulation must, therefore, take account of this requirement.
As far as I am concerned, there is no reason why it should not change at some point in the future to become a model of income support for the fishermen in the outermost regions based on the model that is being adopted and developed to support farmers.
Whatever the case, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishing activity in the Azores, which employs around 8 000 people and has a huge socio-economic impact on the Archipelago, the 1 500 fishermen of Madeira, the fisheries sector in the Canary Islands, which employs around 13 000 people, as well as the thousands of fishermen from French Guyana and RÃ©union, cannot be subjected to uncertainties or to the whims of fate.
They need security and stability, all the more so because they have faced some tough challenges recently, with the failure of the agreement with Morocco, which dealt a cruel blow to fisheries in the Canary Islands.
I therefore think it is crucial that we increase aid for fishing activities in the outermost regions and are even more generous than we are at the moment.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that the compensation scheme for additional costs incurred by outermost regions in the marketing of certain fishery products - incorrectly referred to as the 'Fish POSEIDOM' - is based on a simple principle, namely to support the marketing of species that are most commonly sold outside the European Union, in conditions similar to those in which the economic agents in Europe operate.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which meets the expectations of the representatives of the European Union's outermost regions.
However, as shadow rapporteur, I would like to make two additional comments.
In the comprehensive list of disadvantages facing the outermost regions, the rapporteur has failed to mention a difficulty which, in my opinion, is of utmost importance, namely the problems of reaching these areas as a result of the transport links between the regions and the continent and the prices charged for this travel.
And for us in the far-flung regions, this problem can increase prices by around 30%.
I also note that the rapporteur bases his report - and this is obviously something that I welcome - on Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which recommends that the special characteristics of outermost regions be taken into account in each of the European Union's policies, especially in the case of fisheries.
I think, however, that it would have been more logical to refer in full to Article 37 of the Treaty, which represents the very foundation of the fisheries and agricultural policies, had this Article not proved lacking as regards the EU's outermost regions.
It turns out that it is totally inappropriate in its current form since it takes into account continental fishing conditions only and fails to consider situations related to remoteness.
Lastly, I fully support the rapporteur's proposal which calls on the Commission to forward to the European Parliament a copy of the report carried out for the Commission by external consultants on the impact of all Community measures adopted to date in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions.
If we were familiar with the content of this document, it would certainly give us more accurate information to consider when taking into account the specific problems of the outermost regions of the EU.
Mr President, the outermost regions have a special status, recognised in Article 299(2) of the 1997 Treaty on European Union, but I would say that this status has existed since the founding of the first European Economic Community, in 1957, because this Treaty laid down special provisions for the French Overseas Departments.
When Spain and Portugal joined the Union in 1986, the Act of Accession of these two countries included special provisions and what Article 299(2) does is to acknowledge a situation that already had a legislative identity, by means of all the special provisions of the various programmes and specific options dealing with the outermost regions, known for short as COP 6.
The Community Treaties and legislation, therefore, recognise the reality of the enormous distance of these regions from the continent, making it impossible for them to be competitive, which is what we are always calling for in the European Union.
One only has to visit these territories, which on the face of it seem to be paradises, but which have a host of economic and social problems, to realise what this means.
And Commissioner Fischler is one of the few people to have made the effort to go there.
And I repeat; it is an effort to visit, because although these territories are beautiful, the lack of time and space and our knowledge of their situation make it clear that they are far from being a paradise.
This report by the Committee on Fisheries is an acceptable proposal; the rapporteur has done a good job and has tabled some very reasonable amendments and, in my view, Parliament can approve the report.
Of course, the Socialist Group gives its support to the report by Mr Lage and we hope that the Commission continues to develop these special approaches to the fisheries sector.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again in this House we are debating European regional diversity; in this case, the dimension of remoteness, as a result of the report by Mr Lage, whom I congratulate on his work, and which affects one of the most characteristic sectors of production in the outermost regions: fisheries.
I hope that, once the report is approved, we can find a permanent way to address the structural costs of remoteness in the marketing of some fisheries products from these regions which, as you know, are by and large far off, remote and fragmented, where natural energy is scarce and where there is a high dependence on the outside world.
In my opinion, however, the most important aspect of this report is its recognition of the fact that the legal base for adopting this type of measure has been Article 299(2) of the Treaty, acknowledged at the Amsterdam Summit.
I am therefore grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Lage, to the Committee on Fisheries and to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for understanding and accepting my amendment, which was, in fact, intended to consolidate the unique legal code that applies to these outermost regions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Lage for his support for our proposal.
It is true that fisheries play a very important role in the economic and social development of remote regions and a system of aid for marketing specific fishery products from these regions was introduced back in 1992.
This aid helped producers to offset the additional costs of transporting their products to mainland Europe.
What we are now proposing is to extend the present scheme by a year, that is, until the end of 2002.
Why a year?
The Commission will be submitting a report to the European Parliament and the Council in June of this year on the implementation and efficiency of the measures which currently apply, together with a detailed appraisal of these measures.
We can then make any adjustments needed on the basis of this appraisal when the common fisheries policy is revised.
Now to the proposed amendments: Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern the legal basis.
We have suggested Article 37 of the Treaty because these measures are no different from the provisions of the Treaty on Community policy or general principles.
However, we cannot agree to extend the scheme indefinitely.
The whole point of the extension, as I have said, is to give us time for a detailed appraisal of the measures taken so far.
I must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1 and 3.
Nor can I accept Amendment No 2, because the Commission report will not just reflect the results of the study; the report which we present will also need to take account of the impact of the measures and their application by the Member States.
Amendment No 6 is problematic because, as I have said, the study is just one of numerous documents which we may need to take into account in a proposal for a new regulation.
It would not therefore be appropriate to mention it separately in the regulation.
However, I can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5. Thank you for your attention.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0040/2002) by Mr Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic on fishing off the coast of Gabon for the period 3 December 2001 to 2 December 2005 [COM(2001) 765 - C5-0040/2002 - 2001/0301(CNS)].
First of all, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the fact that he has succeeded in reaching an agreement within the framework of Gabon at a time when it is increasingly difficult to conclude fisheries agreements.
This illustrates the fact that fisheries agreements and the European Union are a matter of particular concern.
They are partly based on historic schemes, and they now offer not only financial compensation to the countries involved, but simultaneously provide very specific development aid in a large number of African countries.
With regard to the Gabon agreement, the European Union has earmarked EUR 5 million for a four-year period; 30% of this is financial compensation and 70% is spent on education and structural aid for the coastal region.
For the sake of clarity, this therefore shows that these agreements contribute greatly towards development cooperation with African countries.
Incidentally, the amount in annual terms is 70% higher than the current agreement or the agreement that has just lapsed.
This increase is partly due to the acquisition of additional fishing options in the 6 to 12-mile zone.
And indeed, the question then arises - and this is also addressed to the Commissioner - to what extent the relevant fisheries organisations in Gabon are actually involved in this agreement.
Gabon is required annually to submit a written justification for 70% of the amount.
