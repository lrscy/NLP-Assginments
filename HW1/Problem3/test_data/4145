It is confined to cattle only in the counties of Cumbria and Devon. Other species would not be vaccinated but pre-emptively killed in a certain radius around infected premises.
In contrast with the present policy in the Netherlands, the vaccinated bovines would not necessarily be killed and destroyed.
However, there would be very strict restrictions on the movements of these bovine animals, by and large dairy cows, which would effectively confine them to the regions concerned.
There would also be important restrictions on the movement of their milk and milk products and, when eventually slaughtered, of meat and meat products from these animals.
It is a measure of the consequences of vaccination that the UK has not yet decided if it will avail itself of the Commission decision in the circumstances in which it has been requested.
The Netherlands for its part is considering a request for a revised scheme similar to that approved in the UK.
As we speak, the Standing Veterinary Committee is discussing that particular request.
I fully appreciate that vaccination is a very emotive subject.
It certainly appears as an attractive alternative to killing and destroying animals.
But the reality is far different.
This reality is that there are important limitations to vaccination and there is still no widespread support for such a policy.
Generalised vaccination has not been asked for by the Member States, including the Netherlands and the UK.
It has not been asked for by the European Council which discussed the crisis in Stockholm recently.
And it has not been asked for by the farming community at large, nor have I heard any demands for its introduction in this, my third appearance, in this Parliament.
The reality is that it is a complex issue with formidable challenges.
I have spoken to you before of some of these challenges.
Let me now repeat them.
There is no approved test to distinguish individually vaccinated animals from infected animals.
This allows the disease to continue to persist in the animal population.
There are seven serotypes of FMD, each with several sub-strains.
Vaccination is only effective against the targeted strain and for a limited period only.
As the disease is not endemic in the EU, the selection of the appropriate vaccine strain would be a pure lottery.
There are over 300 million susceptible livestock - cattle, sheep and pigs - in the EU which would need to be vaccinated to give full coverage and it would jeopardise our trade between the Member States and with certain countries which insist on imports only from FMD-free countries which do not vaccinate.
In the light of these circumstances, there is still a consensus that eradication of the present outbreak without the use of generalised vaccination is the best course of action.
Before concluding I intend that, when this outbreak has been eradicated, we will carry out a very thorough examination of all the contributory factors to the current outbreak and the consequences.
These will include issues such as the following which fall within my own area of responsibility: weaknesses in traceability of animals, especially of sheep and pigs; animal transport and especially measures which allow live animals from different Member States to cross-contaminate one another; vaccination and whether there needs to be a departure from the current policy of 'no' to generalised vaccination and, if so, in what circumstances and in what conditions; sanitary controls on imports, bearing in mind that the existing EU provisions are adequate if respected, not only to keep out the virus but also to ensure public health requirements are fully and properly respected.
But there are other wider issues which will also need to be considered.
Costs: the present outbreak already has a full potential cost to the Community budget of up to EUR 170 million on disease eradication measures alone.
Research into new marker vaccines and discriminatory tests which will allow vaccinated animals to be easily distinguished from infected animals thus giving much greater scope for protective vaccination.
There has already been good progress in this area and it needs to be intensified.
Further discussions in the relevant international bodies, especially in the OIE on the current approach towards the virus and perhaps, most importantly of all the issues raised, our current systems of animal production and their interaction with the non-farming rural community which has suffered hugely in recent weeks.
However, these issues can only be addressed when the current crisis has been brought under control.
I hope that this will take place sooner rather than later.
Thank you for your attention and I now look forward to hearing your views.
Commissioner, I notice that you have in any event made some moves towards a policy whereby infection and vaccination do not immediately lead to the removal from farms.
This might be a first step, but in my own opinion, and that of my group, it is probably not sufficient.
After all, we cannot deny that the current line of attack with regard to foot-and-mouth disease is unacceptable in real terms, and also from an economic, social and ethical point of view.
The disease is continuing to rage out of control in Great Britain, which is leading to huge mass graves and enormous losses.
In the Netherlands, twelve cases in a limited area have now led to the slaughter of almost 100 000 animals.
In addition, social life has been disrupted to some extent over a large area, and other sectors, such as the medium-sized and small businesses, are suffering huge losses too.
In my own country, we are now talking in terms of more than EUR 100 million.
This also applies to the rural areas which are far removed from the affected area.
For that reason, one could claim that the remedy, namely control by means of destruction, is worse than the disease itself.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following questions.
Why are the Commission and Council not drawing from experience in South Africa and Argentina, among other countries, where outbreaks were successfully brought under control by means of comprehensive vaccination schemes?
Why is the Commission not putting the report published in 1999 on the testing of vaccinated animals to good use?
Now that the enormity of the economic impact outside agriculture has become apparent, and there is - with good reason - widespread dissatisfaction among the public, who refuse to accept animal suffering, what is the Commission intending to do about this in the light of a thorough overhaul of the present non-vaccination policy?
Does the Commission really condone the fact that for each animal infected with foot-and-mouth, tens of thousands of other, often still healthy, animals are being killed and destroyed?
My question also falls within the scope of fighting BSE, for it is a well-known fact that we have a surplus of beef and veal.
I would like the Commission to confirm, in plain language, that this approach of the foot-and-mouth outbreak is not related in any way to the BSE policy, where it is taken for granted that animals have to be removed from the farms and destroyed.
Mr President, on this basis, I believe I have to conclude that the current policy of controlling foot-and-mouth can, both ethically and economically, no longer be justified, and I eagerly await your answers.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very detailed statement which, without wishing in any way to put aside the devastation of the impact of this outbreak, will have counteracted some of the hysteria that we have encountered.
There was complete agreement that slaughter and containment was the most effective policy when this disease broke out.
But for the rapid action of the United Kingdom Government to ban exports and impose movement restrictions and alert other Member States, the impact on the Continent and in Britain would have been far greater.
Sound-bite television has not been helpful to public understanding of this complicated disease - as you may have experienced a few moments ago, Commissioner.
Vaccination is not as simple as some suggest.
I congratulate the Commissioner for making that clear and destroying some of the myths that have been bandied about.
The Standing Committee has only agreed to vaccination with the proviso that quarantine, slaughter and disposal remain the most effective means of eradicating the disease.
That clear message should go out from this Parliament.
There is no threat to human health.
The vast majority of Britain's countryside is disease-free and open for business, subject to sensible precautions about staying away from farm land and farm animals.
This outbreak will continue for some time and must, as the Commissioner said, be followed by a full inquiry.
There is little doubt that the virulence of the virus and the extensive sheep movements just before the outbreak have been important factors in the spread of the disease.
But we need to know more about the incubation period, the epidemiology of the virus and how farming practices have been contributing factors.
I welcome the commitment of the Commissioner to look at all these and other factors.
Pontificating on instant solutions in advance of an inquiry will not be helpful.
Mr President, in some EU Member States, and particularly in my own country, the Netherlands, this is the most serious agricultural crisis we have known in years.
I would like to express my sympathy to the farming families affected by this, and also to other people who are suffering the effects.
The liberal group is backing the policy of emergency vaccinations to restrict the outbreak and spread of the virus.
We are of the opinion that, ultimately, this will need to lead to complete eradication of the foot-and-mouth virus throughout Europe.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the major doubts which pervade Europe with regard to the non-vaccination policy.
What the Commissioner stated this afternoon can be applauded, but the message must be made clearer to the public.
What would the implications be if we were to abandon the current policy?
What are the effects on markets in Europe?
What would be the implications on the income of the farming families if we were to abandon this policy?
This message must be driven home.
I would now like to draw your attention to another aspect.
At the moment, we are exercising extremely strict control at airports and other entry points.
This should not be a temporary but permanent measure.
We must follow the lead of the United States and Australia, where such controls have been in place for years.
The Commissioner talked about the transport policy in Europe.
We must consider whether we cannot set up certain quarantine zones throughout Europe, so that animals can no longer contaminate each other at the so-called resting points which are being used at the moment.
I would like to finish off on a minor point.
Farmers have been unable to deliver milk for some days in various countries.
Is it possible that the Commission could revise its decision to adjust their quota downwards?
They must be given an extra milk quota, so that they are not suffering more damage than they already are.
The days on which they were unable to deliver should be added to their quota.
Mr President, Commissioner, you have given us a most impressive overview of the measures adopted by the Commission.
We have the impression that it comes rather too late.
Perhaps these measures should have been adopted in "peace-time", if I can call it that.
But the Commission - and some Member States as well - showed a striking lack of concern about the danger posed by the disease, and it would also seem that no one took the precaution of developing a common strategy to combat it.
We had the impression that the politicians were falling over themselves with radical demands and instructions, but none of them offered a particularly effective response to the outbreaks.
But, of course, the key question now is: culling or vaccination?
Let me make it clear to the House that it is not a matter of resuming a regular programme of preventive vaccinations. No, the question is whether the outbreak can now be contained through emergency "ring" and suppressive vaccinations.
And what happens to the animals after they have been vaccinated?
That is another question. You have authorised the vaccinations, but only on condition that the animals are slaughtered afterwards.
You were rather circumspect in your speech today, so let's be frank about it: this is an absolute scandal.
Healthy vaccinated animals do not need to be slaughtered to curb the epidemic, they can be returned to the economy.
There are a number of countries which have proved that it is possible to pursue an export policy even though they have cases of foot-and-mouth disease at home. Argentina is a case in point, with its trade with the EU and other countries.
But they do not export the disease.
What we expect from you - and I hope that tomorrow's resolution will bear this out - is that you will not present us with endless arguments about why the cull is necessary: I have heard quite enough of them from your subordinates.
Endless imagination is used to justify the culling - yet in reality, very little imagination is needed to break away from this fixation with slaughter.
I expect you to explain to us how you intend to negotiate at international level in order to enable us to achieve a sensible policy on how to combat the epidemic while continuing to trade with third countries.
We must finally overcome this contradiction: the two things must be possible, trade and a sensible policy on the disease.
Vaccination is not just an emotive issue ....
(The President cut the speaker off) (Applause)
Mr President, the foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain and its spread to mainland Europe clearly demonstrate that the disease apparently cannot be halted with the current strategy.
I do not believe that we are out of the woods yet.
Ever since the first case of foot-and-mouth disease, the Commission has supported the slaughter of lambs and the blazing pyres, and has been reluctant to approve other methods of tackling the disease which might have been agreed at national level.
In my view, this is a major political risk, as the costs and benefits are very difficult to quantify.
Putting our money on the economy from the outset would have been the right approach.
A vaccination programme at the very start of the foot-and-mouth outbreak would have saved a great deal of money, but above all, it would have saved a great deal of personal suffering.
It is estimated that around 200 million livestock are moved around the EU every year.
Traceability in this commercial chain, especially in the necessary chronological order, is always problematical and uncertain.
Even in normal years - without BSE and foot-and-mouth crises - the error rates are high.
The common agricultural policy has its own powerful momentum, and it is difficult to halt it once it is under way.
That is why it would have been necessary to identify a number of viable and practical alternatives to the current strategy to combat FMD.
The present approach is mediocre and irrational - so I am delighted that it is to be changed.
Beef consumption has decreased by 50 per cent.
Prices have hit rock-bottom, and the monthly wages bill can no longer be covered from beef production.
Commissioner Fischler's compensation programme is to be enhanced with an eighth point, namely the removal of the penalty bonus for the milk quota.
This makes sense, as cattle sales have been stopped.
Jobs and livelihoods in agriculture, food production and processing are at stake. There is no longer any rural tourism, even in areas which are free of FMD.
Even relatives are staying at home.
Patching this up through a "rural renewal" programme could take years.
After all, cattle cannot be produced overnight.
Vaccination must be utilised more effectively throughout Europe as a normal instrument to combat the disease.
It must be ensured, in this context, that vaccinated animals and their products are commercially viable, in other words, that they can be marketed without any trade barriers.
Discriminatory tests must be developed as a matter of urgency in order to allow vaccinated animals to be easily distinguished from infected stock.
This should also make it easier for the Commission to give the Member States more scope than before to have their say in decisions on measures to prevent and eradicate the disease.
Mr President, we have heard what the Commissioner has to say regarding the situation which has come to pass in the United Kingdom: 900 cases and the situation still does not appear to be under control.
This is the situation that has been described to us.
I therefore feel that the initiatives implemented to date are not sufficient.
Moreover, we have heard, in the Committee on Agriculture and elsewhere, that, also in the United Kingdom - as some farmers have said - interventions are not always timely enough considering the fact that as long as three weeks have been known to pass between the occurrence of a case of foot-and-mouth disease on a farm and slaughter of the animal.
We must therefore create the right conditions for the Commission to intervene through all the channels open to it and ensure that timely measures are taken, apart from anything else in order to make the need for vaccination clear at last.
Although vaccination will not provide a definitive solution to the problem, it will certainly be an indication of the will to stop regarding slaughter as the only possible reaction.
There is therefore a clear need to create the right conditions for tighter controls and thus to prevent foot-and-mouth disease from spreading to other countries as well.
Mr President, it is high time that the political world sent a clear message of support to the agricultural community, which has been severely affected by one crisis after another.
They often have the finger pointed at them, but farmers are, in fact, victims of the system.
Mass slaughter, carried out in the name of the much-vaunted precautionary principle, is becoming much less acceptable, especially because consumer confidence has not returned as a result of this sacrifice.
Confidence cannot be bought by decree - it has to be earned.
An appropriate media campaign should be launched to restore this confidence.
Our exports are paralysed by poorly targeted embargoes.
The Commission failed in its negotiations with the United States.
Only a few regions are affected by foot-and-mouth disease, but the whole of Europe is being punished - this is an unacceptable situation that must be redressed.
The Russian and Japanese markets are also out of bounds.
What did the negotiations achieve?
The European Union must adopt a strong position on regional policy.
With this background of economic and social disaster, why is preventative vaccination not being carried out, instead of resorting to a pre-emptive cull?
Systematic culling causes both the ruin of the farmers involved and the destruction of genetic heritage.
Europe has a wealth of local breeds authorising their vaccination will enable us to protect them.
With regard to compensation, this must be paid to enable farmers to buy new livestock, and payments must be made quickly, since administrative red tape would be unacceptable in this crisis.
Compensation must also be paid out to those working in farming-related activities and other rural businesses, such as poultry and game farming and the many tourist activities. Although the tourist industry is not affected by the disease, it has lost revenue due to the prevailing hysteria.
Furthermore, psychological counselling facilities should be set up as soon as possible.
Apart from the financial aspects, who at the present time is concerned about the distress experienced by farmers who have had part of their heritage destroyed?
We must show unwavering solidarity in the light of this human tragedy.
Mr President, Commissioner for Consumer Affairs, yes, I said 'for Consumer Affairs' and not 'for Agriculture' , our current concern, the foot-and-mouth crisis, has arrived just in time.
Foot-and-mouth disease has arrived just in time for eastward enlargement and for the WTO negotiations.
First of all, it is in time for eastward enlargement, since we must, of course, cut our agricultural expenditure because the annual budgetary pie for agriculture will have to be cut into 21 slices instead of 15 and everyone' s piece will, therefore, be smaller unless the number of farmers is reduced.
And it has arrived just in time for the WTO negotiations, since we must make room in our marketplace for goods from the southern hemisphere, for goods from the Cairns Group as we already have for wine, fruit and vegetables - but there is also New Zealand and Australia, which, as if by chance, produce lamb.
So, how can we now cut agricultural expenditure for Western Europe and make room in our marketplace for goods from the South?
Quite simply by cutting our numbers of farmers and livestock.
And how can we cut our numbers of farmers and livestock?
Quite simply by making a drama of an everyday occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease, blowing it out of all proportion subjecting it to Apocalypse Now-type media treatment, turning it into a spectacle, with butchers, mass graves, diggers, bulldozers, cordons sanitaire, the armed forces and mountains of burning sheep, cattle and pigs.
For months now, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has been warning of foot-and-mouth disease prevalent in Anatolia, Korea, Japan, in South Africa itself and in Greece last year.
The world is on red alert and yet the European Union does not flinch.
Foot-and-mouth disease breaks out, and it breaks out, as luck would have it, in Great Britain, which has the most livestock in Europe.
What we should do is vaccinate.
So, what do we do?
We do not vaccinate.
And we do not vaccinate firstly because we have to come through this unscathed and vaccination would involve three million pigs, sheep and cows, secondly because this would cost EUR 100 million, and finally because we could no longer export anything even though we are not exporting anything at all. And so the disease spreads further.
And what is the outcome of all this? Farmers aged 55 and over, whose herds have been slaughtered, are forced into retirement.
Farmers who suffer unavoidable financial problems due to a fall in sales go out of business.
But then, although farmers leave farming, the budget savings that we need can be achieved.
Although British herds are haemorrhaging, there is room in the marketplace for lamb from the southern hemisphere and then New Zealand and Australia will, as a result, agree to sign up at the WTO.
Eastward enlargement can go ahead, since, in terms of the budget, agricultural expenditure has been slashed.
In the wake of the BSE crisis, foot-and-mouth disease has given rise to a total of three miracles.
The first miracle is that there are fewer budgetary obstacles standing in the path of eastward enlargement.
The second miracle is that the Cairns Group is satisfied with the sacrifice of European livestock and is happy to sign up to the WTO.
The third miracle is that we can also reform the CAP at the expense of our farmers, who are made out by the media to be poisoning cows and infecting sheep.
All of this happened by chance, of course.
It was also by chance that Stephen Dorrell admitted in 1996 that BSE could be passed on to humans, at the exact time when there was the scandal of US hormone-treated beef.
It is by chance that we have allowed the disease to spread.
It is by chance that, for ten years, we have done nothing to combat BSE.
It is by chance that the United States has a stranglehold over the world' s media.
So, Mr President, you must appoint Mr Chance European Commissioner alongside Mr Pascal Lamy.
Having given up on soya at the Blair House negotiations, he will be successful at the WTO negotiations and next on the list will be the farmers.
Mr President, Commissioner, on the occasion of this debate on the foot-and-mouth epidemic, I would firstly like to express my unwavering solidarity with all those working in the farming industry, who have already been dealt a cruel blow by the BSE crisis which threw the markets into disarray, and especially with all cattle farmers, most of whom work to rigorously high standards, using methods which respect both the environment and the animals on their farms and who have now been severely affected by this latest crisis which has left them feeling totally helpless.
I would like to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the urgent steps that must be taken in order to combat this disease, in this situation which is extremely difficult to control, since vaccination was stopped in the European Union in 1991, and, on the other hand, the subsequent measures to be taken once the disease is under control, so that a disaster of this kind can never happen again.
What will need to be done?
First of all, we need to initiate an in-depth discussion of the developments in farming which have allowed such diseases to occur.
Were we right to allow such intensive farming to take place and become increasingly widespread and specialised, employing processes that were increasingly artificial?
Were we right to have so few abattoirs, which caused local abattoirs to close down, and which encouraged intensive farming and made it necessary to systematically transport animals over long distances?
We will then have to thoroughly re-examine the international rules laid down by the World Organisation for Animal Health which, in their current state, seem absurd and obsolete.
Currently, if a living animal is vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease within a particular country, that country will lose its status as a foot-and-mouth-free country, and is therefore banned from exporting.
Who cannot see that this arbitrary rule blatantly favours the United States?
We must also deal with bilateral trade exchanges, as each country can freely negotiate the conditions governing exports with Russia, Japan or other countries.
We must also take a regionalist approach.
There is no reason why any Member State, even the whole of the European Union, should be considered as a homogenous entity in this area.
There is no reason why a case of foot-and-mouth in Brittany should affect Alsace, nor why a country that has 1 000 cases of infection such as Great Britain and a country that has two cases such as France should be treated in the same way.
Furthermore, we will have to give serious thought to whether it was the right decision to ban a preventative vaccination that has been used in the Community since 1991.
Should we not at least authorise the vaccination of rare animals, reproductive animals, and even milk herds?
To enable this to be done, it is imperative that we encourage research and development into marker vaccines which enable a vaccinated animal to be distinguished from an infected animal.
Finally, we will have to find the resources required to encourage holdings, especially small and medium-sized holdings where rearing and fattening are carried out in the same place, which reduces the risks of spreading diseases since integrating birth, rearing and slaughter at the same holding is a vital factor in preventing the spread of disease.
This role must be fully acknowledged under the common policy.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, Commissioner, it is quite clear that no one can give serious consideration to a generalised vaccination programme at present, for one very good reason: the vaccine is not available in sufficient quantities.
I would also like to add that vaccination must not be used to cover up poor hygiene and disease prevention.
But it is also quite clear now that the first real test of the strength of the new FMD policy since the introduction of the internal market is about to end in disaster.
However, let me add a further point in all seriousness, Commissioner: international agreements - restrictions, even self-imposed restrictions through the IOE criteria - mean that no one in Europe, neither the Commission nor the other European institutions, can bear to continue the current policy.
The endless culling of herds is neither intelligent nor appropriate in the long term.
Indeed, it raises a number of issues concerning animal welfare, guaranteed property rights, and even the principle of proportionality, which is part of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.
So I welcome the fact that those affected are starting to clarify these issues at the highest judicial level.
So how do we proceed with a new strategy which will not find it easy to dispense with tried and tested methods of disease prevention? This automatically raises a further question: what has the Commission done to implement the report by the Scientific Committee in March 1999 as regards the regionalisation negotiations at international level, the validation of testing, and the evaluation of the criteria determining when emergency vaccinations are necessary in "at risk" regions too?
A last word: the general abhorrence of vaccinations, both on a Europe- and worldwide level, must end.
And we will push for this with all our energy and determination.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during Parliament' s last part-session, I expressed the concerns of my region, which is fighting an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth virus.
I would today like to express our general feeling of relief that we have on a local level managed to contain the infection and that we are able to announce that the situation is under control with regard to the second holding in France where foot-and-mouth was discovered and treated, approximately 300 kilometres from the first site.
Although there have only been these two outbreaks in France, we can, of course, deduce from this that the Community strategy to combat the foot-and-mouth virus is effective and very suitable since it is implemented in a most vigilant and strict manner.
Despite our pleasure in having won the first battle, I do not think, however, that we can draw any firm conclusions.
I would also like to stress that we will have to wait for the disease to be completely eradicated before we can accurately weigh up its impact in terms of health, the economy, as well as its psychological and budgetary impact.
However, before we reach that stage, I would like to mention the problems that we need to deal with now.
Farmers have fulfilled their role as a shield, with their herds being sacrificed in order to protect the community at large.
The European and national community must now treat the farmers' psychological suffering and ensure that their economic losses are totally compensated.
The industry is destabilised and under threat.
Member States and the European Union must deal with this situation as a matter of urgency and in a way that matches people' s needs.
On several occasions, the general public has said that it does not understand the mass slaughter of animals when the virus poses no danger to humans.
A specific statement should, therefore, be issued in order to clarify the health and economic issues of this disease for the benefit of citizens and on the possible direction of our health strategy, moving towards the use of technology to carry out vaccinations, for example.
Commissioner, this is an exceptional situation.
We must deal with it in an exceptional manner.
Mr President, the previous speaker, Mr Garot, said that the disease is gradually starting to be brought under control.
I hope it is.
We therefore have to look to the future.
Animal diseases spread with animal transportation, and so for this reason animal transport across borders should generally be avoided.
At least there should not be any kind of financial incentive for it.
Moreover, animal transportation must be properly monitored in each EU Member State and candidate country.
One problem concerns animal auctions, especially those involving bull calves.
I think these should be abolished altogether.
Animal sales should be carried out, in this age of modern technology, directly between one farm and another, or between farm and abattoir.
I would also like to stress the importance of a policy of prevention.
Strict adherence to legal provisions on hygiene and transport is the undisputed basis for all agricultural trade and, consequently, for the production chain.
The EU should embark on an eventual vaccination programme so that countries free of infection and disease do not have to unduly suffer.
Mr President, in the wake of the implications of FMD for communities directly and indirectly affected by the outbreak, it is vital that we learn the lessons of the mishandling of the outbreak which has caused such devastating knock-on effects for many sectors of society.
The consequential loss to those directly and indirectly affected by the disease has so far been enormous: hauliers, abattoirs, tourism, cultural events, schools and the small business sector are all bearing the brunt.
Farmers whose stock is not affected directly by FMD, but who are unable to move their stock to markets, are also facing massive losses, further exacerbated by the ban on the sale of cattle over 30 months following the BSE crisis.
Commissioner, I learnt from one of my colleagues last week that if the UK were to offer state aid to those affected by the crisis, this would not contravene European Union competition policy.
I would appreciate clarification by the Commission on this point.
We must also call again for the re-establishment of local abattoirs and a reduction in animal transport over long distances, which undoubtedly acted as a catalyst for the rapid spread.
Mr President, recent developments in connection with foot-and-mouth disease in a series of countries in the European Union prove that the systems for guaranteeing that animal diseases are efficiently controlled are in a parlous state.
This is because of the EU multinational companies' demand for complete freedom to move goods within the Community, a demand which has been met by establishing the single internal market.
The border veterinary and sanitary controls required in order to move animals and animal products between the countries of the European Union have been abolished within this market. As a result, diseases are easily transmitted and it is difficult, if not impossible, to stop diseases moving from one country to another.
At the same time, the certificates testifying to the state of health of the animals and animal products being transported are a symbolic rather than a substantive measure - witness the unacceptable impression created by veterinary services nowadays which do not have even the most rudimentary structure needed in order to cope with the increasing demands, both quantitative and qualitative, of the internal market.
This is the natural consequence of the multinationals' demand that all obstacles be removed and that controls, which are basically left to the companies themselves, be minimised, as we have seen from other recent problems such as dioxin, BSE etc.
The present situation is therefore the price we have to pay for creating a internal market and bowing to the demand for fewer and fewer controls.
It merely proves that we need to reinstate border controls at internal frontiers in order to prevent the emergence and spread of epizootic diseases and to compensate livestock farmers for their losses.
Any such compensation should not be linked to cuts in Community funding for other agricultural products, especially from countries which have no part in the causes or dimensions of the current problem.
Mr President, Commissioner, last month in the emergency debate on foot-and-mouth I indicated that it was not a time for apportioning blame and indeed I sympathised with the plight of British farmers.
In the meantime, I have not altered my view other than to say, regretfully, that the dreaded virus has since spread to my country with devastating consequences for farmers within the control zone of Cooley Peninsula, and with worrying implications for Ireland's farming and rural communities.
With such a dreaded virus one is somewhat reluctant to talk about success, other than to say thankfully Ireland's quick response, sometimes regarded as extreme, has so far been successful in containing the disease to one outbreak.
But Ireland is paying an enormous price for this single incident.
It affects not just the farmers but the broader economy such as tourism and employment.
However, I am left with some questions about the effectiveness of the controls up to the point of the outbreak of the first disease.
It is obvious that Britain's first outbreak originated outside the Community, and I now question whether third countries which export to us are complying with the conditions we have imposed.
This is something on which the EU Food and Veterinary Office must focus in the immediate future.
Secondly, we must question whether the meat being imported into the European Union is being fraudulently misrepresented on importation.
Are the inspection procedures and sampling arrangements at import points into the Union adequate?
I ask the Commissioner today, who has been doing an extremely good job, to consider increasing the level of sampling as an initial step.
In my contribution last month I called for an EU taskforce to police the implementation of the control measures in Member States.
I ask today are we satisfied that enough is being done?
What about the method of disposal - have we reached any scientific conclusions about the necessity for incineration as against the safe burial of dead animals?
Do we have a view on the psychological impact, not just on farmers, but on the entire EU population, young and old, of the non-stop display on our television screens of truckloads of dead and decomposing animals?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, foot-and-mouth disease was found on a farm in my municipality last week.
Emergency vaccination is now taking place in a radius around that farm, and 90 000 animals will be slaughtered in the next few weeks.
This is a disaster of unknown proportions which is affecting 200 farming families, as well as many others, in this village.
Given the permission for emergency vaccination, I had hoped that the Commission would have begun to appreciate the ethical side of agriculture.
But emergency vaccination is only putting off the evil hour for healthy animals.
This level of destruction is not acceptable, and there are alternatives available, such as those included in our resolution.
Cows, sheep and pigs are more than production units.
They are God' s creatures in relation to which we need to act as responsible stewards.
The measures which the Commission is taking are based only on dubious economic motives, that is to say retaining remote export markets.
The non-vaccination policy was based on a restricted outbreak every 5 to 10 years.
The present epidemic is anything but restricted.
The non-vaccination policy is therefore based on false scenarios and must be reviewed.
I call on the Commission to consider the ethical dimension of its policy.
Healthy, vaccinated animals could be kept for the internal market.
Mr President, Mr Byrne has given us a very clear statement this afternoon in an area that was requiring more clarity.
In Cumbria, where the outbreak was spreading out of control, we told the farmers that they would have to slaughter even healthy animals in a preventative cull.
They reluctantly agreed to comply with that request and the slaughter of healthy animals has begun.
Now we appear to be changing direction and saying at a time when we have not enough veterinary resources to deal with the backlog of animals requiring slaughter, with the huge backlog of animals requiring disposal burial, we are saying now that we wish to diversify and use these vets for a mass vaccination policy.
This sort of dithering has been an element which has been obvious throughout this whole disease.
To say that the UK government has been decisive is a nonsense: it dithered over whether to bring in the army.
It dithered whether to use incineration instead of burial.
Now it is dithering over vaccination.
Let me say this afternoon that vaccination is not the right way forward.
After what Mr Byrne has told us, if we use the vaccination policy we effectively bring down the curtain on our agricultural economy.
We would close off the export trade for all these products from animals in the areas where vaccination had been used.
Vaccination is not a sensible way forward just now during the epidemic.
We know that in Saudi Arabia they have used the vaccination policy for the last two years.
They have nevertheless had six outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease.
We know that when you vaccinate cattle it can take up to 14 days before they develop immunity.
In the case of pigs it can take 7 days.
During that time they can spread the virus.
I would pose one question to Mr Byrne before I finish.
He was talking about whole areas of Holland, France and Ireland where restrictions will be lifted.
Will similar restrictions be lifted in areas of the United Kingdom not affected by the disease?
Mr President, Mr Byrne, I disagree with you on one key point, namely that we cannot yet discuss the measures to be adopted once the current crisis has been brought under control.
I take an entirely different view.
I am convinced that if you do not start talking about tomorrow and the future now, while all the Member States are trembling at the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, you will find that once everything has settled down, the Member States will all sit back and relax.
So now is the time for you to adopt a different course of action.
Now is the time, for example, to work actively with your colleague Mr Fischler to ensure that a follow-up system for sheep and pigs is introduced immediately, so that the premium payments are no longer coupled to specific transfer date provisions.
It would no longer be necessary to move the sheep and pigs all round the European Union to ensure they can be counted at the right place at the right time when the money is available.
But I also believe that you must finally take courage and throw a stone into the water.
Why do you not say: live transports are banned?
Every live transport must be granted an exemption.
Why can animals not be transported after slaughter?
Try it and see.
Why do you not announce here and now that we need a different policy on disease?
Sit down with the IOE in Paris and say: the international policy on animal diseases needs to be changed right away, together with all the other relevant partners in the IOE.
And finally: tell us, what have you got against giraffes?
Many people have asked me that question: what has the Commissioner got against giraffes?
Why is he stopping the safari parks from vaccinating to prevent disease?
Why is he making all the safari parks close down, or putting the fear of whatever disease into the zoos throughout the European Union, because we failed to pursue a decent disease prevention policy and all the animals suddenly have to be culled?
So tell us, Mr Byrne: please tell us, what have you got against giraffes?
Please be so kind, take the measures today.
Be more courageous today, do not wait until tomorrow.
Commissioner, thank you for your contribution.
I would urge you not to falter with regard to the non-vaccination policy pursued by the Commission since the beginning of the 1990s.
I should like to ask you, Commissioner, if it is not correct that, when we implemented the single market in 1992, there was an agreement that the national veterinary borders should apply in the event of a disease breaking out in any of the Member States.
If this is the case, I would urge the Commission, including you and the Commissioner for Trade, to make a far greater effort to ensure that some of the countries which really depend on exports to non-EU countries - and here I am thinking primarily of Denmark - will again be able to export to the United States, Japan, Russia and the many other countries which have stopped their imports from the EU, an action which is basically a technical trade barrier.
Mr President, hundreds of thousands of healthy animals are being killed in the name of export.
People in my country no longer accept this.
Other sectors of the economy too have ground to a halt.
The damage caused in those sectors is many times more serious.
Commissioner Byrne' s attitude is brutally inadequate.
Mr Byrne should have taken the initiative to vaccinate animals in zoos.
Instead, he did nothing.
Mr Byrne could have taken the initiative to vaccinate rare animals roaming freely.
Ministers KÃŒnast and Brinkhorst took the initiative instead.
Mr Byrne should have taken the initiative in respect of generous buffer vaccination.
Export interests are not sacrosanct.
Let the affected countries vaccinate their animals to their heart' s content and not sacrifice animals unnecessarily.
Finally, I should like to urge the Commission to reduce the time limit for the transport of live cattle from 30 hours to a maximum of 4 hours.
In that way, a future outbreak of foot-and-mouth would be restricted to one area, rather than affect half of Europe, as is currently the case.
Commissioner, Mr BÃ¶ge has helped me prepare this speech, for he has already indicated the best way to deal with the issue.
I would like to make three brief points.
Firstly, the animal health policy adopted by the European Union during the 1990s appears to have been a good one.
What we are witnessing during these initial months of 2001 is a quite extraordinary phenomenon, but one which requires careful analysis.
We thought that foot-and-mouth disease was a minor problem, but the response from all over the world is forcing us to think again: there is a complex situation in Mongolia, specific situations in Africa and Argentina.
This will probably mean the need for a rethink and the introduction of a World Trade Organisation regulation.
The second point relates to the agricultural sector.
The agricultural sector is, in any case, constantly the focus of traumatic events which are causing - I would say - a sharp, frightening drop in farmers' incomes.
Thirdly, we need flexible policies.
There should be separate measures for foot-and-mouth issues relating to zoos and rare animals.
Mr President, foot-and-mouth is leaving tremendous grief and helplessness in its wake.
In the battle against the virus, all means must be deployed.
The European non-vaccination policy is now turning out to be a self-imposed handicap.
I set great store by the fact that we should join forces in this time of crisis, and that we should adhere to a Europe-wide approach.
However, the downside of the non-vaccination policy is also making itself felt now.
I am quoting animal welfare in this connection.
The destruction or evacuation of healthy animals is meeting with enormous resistance.
I am also quoting animals in zoos.
It is quite inexplicable that animals in zoos and at pasture in nature reserves are not allowed to be vaccinated.
Furthermore, you are calling the effectiveness into question.
The massive slaughter could not prevent foot-and-mouth from spreading across England.
The draconian measures in the Netherlands could not prevent further outbreaks of the disease, or the spread of the virus into Germany.
Commissioner, the situation is very serious indeed.
We call for a joint approach. Hence, I would like to put two pressing questions to you.
First of all, at what stage will you recognise that the European strategy has failed?
I assume that you will not wait until all livestock has disappeared, but where will you draw the line?
Secondly, is it conceivable that vaccinations can take place in a short space of time and on a limited scale in the dairy farms, where the identification and registration system can guarantee that meat and dairy products remain in the region and certainly outside the export loop?
In the long term, we do not simply call for a return to a policy of preventive vaccination.
Experts, however, do call for strategic vaccination in the event of an outbreak, obviously accompanied by failsafe registration.
Finally, Commissioner, today, I received 350 signatures from children who live in Amsterdam.
They want the animals in their zoo, Artis, to be vaccinated.
I should like to offer you these signatures, and I hope for a positive response to their request.
I gave you the note that they enclosed a moment ago, and I hope that you will be able to spend a few minutes of your time on this.
Mr President, the Commissioner has told us that vaccination has not been asked for.
It is being asked for today in this House.
A decision on vaccination is not easy.
I understand that many farmers are reluctant to go down the route of vaccination but the effect of this outbreak is being felt not only by the farming community, but by hauliers, hoteliers and a whole host of tourist businesses who are suffering without compensation.
The Commissioner told us the disease has cost EUR 170 million in eradication measures.
It is costing far more in lost business.
If science allows us to distinguish between animals which have been vaccinated and those carrying the disease, then vaccination should be allowed whenever requested.
The lessons from the UK are of inadequate contingency planning, an inadequate number of vets due to cuts in government services and inadequate supplies of labour and materials.
I would ask the Commissioner three questions.
Are you satisfied with the UK's response to this disease?
Are you satisfied that other countries have adequate contingency plans?
Would you confirm that the first you heard of this disease in the UK was indeed on 20 February or were your services in fact tipped off about a possible outbreak some weeks earlier?
Mr President, today at 12 noon in London there was a strong protest outside the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food against the senseless culling of millions of healthy animals.
The message to the UK Government was clear: to help prevent the slaughter of millions of healthy animals and to save farmers and the tourist industry from economic ruin, the government must urgently start a vaccinate-now firebreak campaign.
In the longer term, Europe's farming must become less dependent on international trade and more self-reliant.
It is a nonsense that we simultaneously export and import precisely the same product to and from the same country and it is clear that it is not small farmers' livelihoods, animal welfare or the tourist industry that the UK Government has as its priority for protection, but simply our meat exports.
Commissioner Byrne, you also talked of not vaccinating in order to safeguard trade; yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up.
According to the National Farmers' Union, the UK earns just GBP 633 million per year from meat and dairy exports.
Compare this with the estimated GBP 9 billion cost of the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
We therefore urge the Commissioner to revise the EU strategy of defending, by all means, its FMD-free status, and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective.
Mr President, so that I do not repeat the words of the previous speakers, I shall state that I agree with almost everything that has been said, and with Mr BÃ¶ge in particular.
I would, however, like to ask Mr Byrne, firstly, to clarify the regional approach that he has taken, because I believe that we must protect this and immediately put it into place.
Secondly, with regard to the outcome of the inquiries, I would like to say to the Commissioner and the Council that foot-and-mouth disease is one of the contagious diseases that is rife in the world; the entire population, one which is increasingly mobile which is natural since travel is becoming cheaper and cheaper will, increasingly, spread diseases that can be caught by both animals and humans.
That is what this crisis of foot-and-mouth disease signifies.
Are you prepared, Commissioner to give some thought, in conjunction with the World Health Organisation, to all these illnesses that we are going to suffer in the future as a result of this increasingly accessible Europe, in the light of the decisions taken regarding LDCs for 2006 and 2009, which will allow the free movement of all products, apart from weapons, throughout Europe.
Are you prepared, Commissioner, to take steps, as the United States has done and I shall for once not make any openly anti-American remarks to establish much tighter controls in our airports, on all products that arrive from anywhere and everywhere in the world.
Have you considered, in conjunction with the Council and Commission, any further steps to benefit the people who travel and who pass through our airports too?
This really is a genuine appeal that I am making to the Commission, to Parliament and to the national governments.
I shall sum up, Commissioner, by also saying that the European spirit which brings us here, to Parliament, forces us to ask the Council and Parliament to take exceptional measures for farmers and all sectors of the economy and the affected regions in Europe, otherwise, I believe that European integration is meaningless.
Commissioner, the speech that you have just made has left me somewhat confused, and I shall tell you why: you began by saying that a review of livestock farming is needed.
You then present yourself to this Parliament as the master of an agriculture that is focused on intensive production and exports. In other words, you are saying 'I cannot vaccinate livestock because if I did, I would harm exports' .
This illogical approach is intolerable.
You have to make a choice, Commissioner: either you are genuinely interested in protecting producers, in which case you have to opt for vaccination in areas with the highest numbers of affected animals, or you want to protect the export industry, in which case you would be sacrificing producers to exports.
What you cannot do is address both issues in the same way.
I would ask you, whose side are you actually on? Are you on the side of the export industry or of saving livestock farmers?
My second question to you concerns another incongruity: the Netherlands has discovered a dozen cases, and the United Kingdom 900.
The United Kingdom has slaughtered hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of animals and the Netherlands has slaughtered a few thousand.
The latter is using vaccination but with regard to the UK, on which everyone is focussing, and which has major problems, you come here, Commissioner, and sit on the fence.
This is unacceptable.
You must tell us what you think about vaccination.
I should also like to ask you why animals are being slaughtered once they have been vaccinated.
You must explain to us what the technical or scientific basis is for having animals slaughtered when they have already been vaccinated.
I have one final question: your Veterinary Committee knows the type of vaccination needed and can guarantee its safety. Why then are you always confusing the situation and leading people to believe that from a technical and scientific point of view, we cannot control this disaster through vaccination?
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe we should revisit vaccination policy.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt is right.
We should do this today, and not tomorrow.
I have read reports from virologists and vets who claim that, in this day and age, adopting a non-vaccination policy is much like sitting on a time bomb.
Apparently, there are a number of diseases which we still do not have under control, such as swine fever, and now also foot-and-mouth disease, by all accounts.
This is why we need to reconsider all the factors involved, including the human dimension.
Surely you cannot tell farmers every couple of years: look, you have worked really hard, but there is now a threat of a disease and we will have to eradicate your businesses.
Then there is the aspect of animal welfare.
It appears that the scientific arguments are still not fully concluded.
All economic arguments have to be looked at, for internal consumption takes a real nosedive each time we hit a crisis.
Just add up all the costs of these crises combined.
We only need to look at the internal market: pigs are now being sold in the Netherlands at BEF 50/kg, and at BEF 80/kg in Belgium.
It is only a matter of time before the first reports on smuggling will start to roll in.
All these aspects should therefore be considered.
After all, people, especially in my country, are increasingly mystified by your policy.
You will therefore need to carefully explain what it is all about.
You claim that no single country is asking for vaccination, but no single minister dares ask at this moment when a true European discussion will be held on this subject.
The positions are shifting.
When will we be able to hold a debate on this subject at the highest level?
Mr President, we must see the current crisis resulting from foot-and-mouth disease as an opportunity to consider the European Union' s vetinary policy.
First of all, it is hard to understand why the Union is finding it so difficult to react to this disease and to adopt a strategy to combat it.
Starting with the Veterinary Committee, which only belatedly authorised vaccination, then the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which seemed more concerned with external trade issues than with controlling the situation, and finally, the Stockholm European Council, which danced around the crisis, like a 'cat on a hot tin roof' , insisting on referring all the costs to the financial framework defined in Berlin.
Secondly, the problems faced by some countries today in mobilising resources to deal with sick animals are clear for all to see.
The European Union itself has never advocated a genuine common veterinary policy and in my own county we have seen a degree of laxness creeping into health policy, with unbelievable delays in payments to health protection agencies cofinanced by the European Union.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise the urgency of adopting a decision on the strategy that we should follow.
We know that it is not easy and that both vaccination and non-vaccination have their pros and cons.
What is happening, though, is that the assessment carried out ten years ago which led to opting for non-vaccination must now be reconsidered in the light of the many aspects of European farming that have changed since then, starting with its integration into the global economy, which has increased the risks of contamination exponentially.
Selective preventive vaccination or vaccination within a cordon sanitaire, on a regional basis, should be seen as alternatives that the Member States can authorise, according to the number of cases they discover.
Otherwise, we shall run the risk of losing control of a potential future outbreak of an even greater crisis, or of irreversibly damaging irreplaceable genetic heritage, as has happened, in some countries, with certain native breeds.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, some of us appreciate your dilemma and your unwillingness to rush to judgement.
If there were simple solutions to this tragedy, we would have found them by now.
In the UK we gave our neighbours in France, Ireland and in the Netherlands an early warning and they acted promptly.
We applaud them for what they did.
But in a minefield the early warning is given by the first person to step on the mine and that was the UK.
We have suffered greatly from that.
Would the Commissioner confirm that this is essentially a crisis of movement?
Would he accept, as the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does not, that vaccinated animals can carry the virus?
Otherwise the belated decision which the Commission took on 14 March to exclude Argentine produce would make no sense.
Will he undertake with the SVC to examine the problem of long-range, unrecorded animal movements in which animals are largely treated as commodities, which has been the major factor in the spread of FMD?
Would a carcass trade not be better for Europe to be considering?
Finally, what is the SVC's opinion of the various methods of disposal used in the UK where a million animals have now been culled?
Can he reject the false stories which have been put around by some in the UK that these methods were originally vetoed by the Commission, if that was not the case?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will be quite frank: I am not happy about the fact that we are adopting yet another resolution.
I think that the situation for everyone concerned is far too serious for us simply to be carrying on with politics as usual.
Please do not misunderstand me: I certainly would not wish to prevent the dreadful situation of farmers and rural communities from being given the attention it deserves at European level, quite the contrary.
But I am afraid that if this discussion is not addressed seriously, it will simply create even more uncertainty among our citizens.
The tragedy faced by the farmers needs more than headlines.
The survival of a profession is at stake.
Although the farmers currently receive up to 30% less for their cattle, a kilo of beef costs just as much, if not more, than before.
And this is the case even in my own Member State, which fortunately still has no cases of foot-and-mouth disease or BSE.
The situation in the regions where there have been outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease is critical.
It is not only the farmers who are affected; it has an impact on everyone in these rural areas, including tourism and thousands of jobs.
I should like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy to the farmers and the rural communities who are suffering as a result of this disease.
I hope that everyone understands what damage this is doing to farmers, and that years of work will be required to rebuild these herds.
Let me say a few words about vaccination policy: I support the emergency vaccination measures in order to prevent the virus from spreading.
But we must not give people the impression that the animals are healthy as a result of vaccination, and that we do not need to cull them.
I believe that we must continue to cull if we wish to regain our disease-free status.
I also hope that the Commission, but above all the Member States, fulfil their responsibilities.
I notice time and again that throughout the European Union, there are still no disinfectant mats at the airports.
This hygiene problem is a matter of acceptance in the Member States.
Mr President, it is now clear that everyone's hope that the foot-and-mouth disease crisis will be temporary and short-lived has not been realised.
In the Republic of Ireland we have been fortunate so far in that the outbreak has been confined to one area close to the border with Northern Ireland.
And while the disease has appeared in only four Member States, we cannot yet be sure that it will not spread further.
In the light of this, we must make certain that the restrictions domestically imposed do not impact disproportionately to the detriment of other key industries and public life generally.
The option, therefore, of vaccination has to be kept open in the interests of the wider community.
I said this last month.
I hope that this month, given the weight of opinion expressed here today, this will now be listened to.
The current Draconian restrictions on people's movements cannot continue.
We cannot reasonably expect the farming community to have the balanced view of this issue that the wider community needs.
It is for politicians to make these balanced choices.
I am thinking, in particular, of the tourist industry in Ireland, which is worth EUR 4 billion.
The Irish Hotels Federation is already reporting actual losses of EUR 55 million in the last month, with obvious knock-on consequences for employment.
It must also be made clear that the illegal movement of sheep by unscrupulous operators will not be tolerated.
Such movements in border areas between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland must be stamped out and licenses withdrawn from those found to be involved in such practices.
To conclude, I want to support the call by my colleagues for a European taskforce, not only to monitor the existing situation, but whose remit would also be to monitor and approve a European-wide eradication programme.
Mr President, Commissioner, many questions have been asked today and time does not permit me to repeat them, particularly those questions asked by my colleague, Liam Hyland, and indeed colleague De Rossa in relation to the proportionality of the response.
Could this outbreak have been prevented?
Will consumers lose confidence in our food?
Are our rules and regulations concerning animal movement and animal traceability all that they should be?
Are farmers' incomes such that they can afford to call out a vet when in doubt and have the European Commission and the national responses been adequate to the challenge?
There will be more time for those later.
Then there is the complex question of vaccination, even if it is not on the Irish agenda.
In the last 18 months, 34 countries have reported outbreaks.
To maintain a disease-free status a country has to be free of FMD for at least 12 months, an effective system of surveillance must be in place and all regulatory measures for the prevention and control of FMD must have been implemented.
A policy of strategic ring-vaccination around outbreaks may be appropriate in certain circumstances even though we still cannot distinguish commercially between infected and vaccinated animals.
I appreciate that the Dutch, for example, have a particular problem about disposing of carcasses so vaccination is for them perhaps an option to ring-fence the disease.
I am referring specifically to firebreak vaccination.
With the tragedy of FMD following on from BSE and swine fever we must review in a rational way the common agricultural policy.
We know that FMD has been around for 400 years so modern farm practices cannot be blamed for this virulent disease, but the mobility of animals today gives rise to greater risk and faster contamination.
The general principle should be to ensure that animals are slaughtered as close as possible to the point of production.
There are huge economic implications for Ireland from this disease and while farmers are suffering badly, because of restriction of movements and slaughtering, so are other businesses and industries, particularly our tourism and transport sectors.
Already we have lost IRL 200 million in tourism receipts since the outbreak of FMD in the UK some weeks ago.
Our overseas markets are seriously threatened and we have only one case of it.
In conclusion, we are only spending 1% of the 1.2% of GDP currently available.
There are other measures that can help compensate sectors generally in terms of our budget.
Mr President, Commissioner, in 1991, I joined with other colleagues in this House to vote against the abolition of vaccination at that time.
I believe that against the background of enlargement, we will be forced to rethink the situation.
Last week, 4000 animals were culled as a preventive measure in my region, after piglets had arrived there from quarantine areas in Holland.
Since 2 p.m. today, foot-and-mouth disease may also have reached Germany and my home region of MÃŒnsterland near the Dutch border.
If the cases are confirmed, Commissioner, the disease will have broken out in a region which is widely regarded as the "meat belt" of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The EU's "no vaccination" policy has always been justified in terms of exports to third countries.
So my question is this, Mr Byrne: is it not clear that this policy really has failed?
What does Europe gain, in financial terms, from these exports, and what is the epidemic costing Europe?
The Commission should put these figures on the table for the Council.
I called for this two weeks ago in the Committee on Agriculture.
Put the figures on the table, and do it quickly.
Then the Council can decide, and the Council can take responsibility for its policies.
The European Parliament will undoubtedly set out its views on this issue in its resolution tomorrow.
I am in favour of emergency 'ring' and suppressive vaccinations, and I say: let us do it right away.
I believe that the current situation is putting untold emotional and psychological strain on farmers.
What about Europe's moral responsibility for its policies?
Please, Commissioner, answer the questions we have asked. Please do not just read your prepared text because otherwise this whole discussion will be a waste of time.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Mr BÃ¶ge has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, without wishing to impede the progress of the debate, but in view of the last comments, I would ask the Commission very sincerely to provide an overview at the next Committee meeting of the internal and external activities which it has undertaken in order to embed the recommendation of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare of 10 March 1999 both in the Commission's policies and at international level.
I would be grateful if we could receive a comprehensive report at the next Committee meeting.
Thank you very much, Mr BÃ¶ge.
The Commission takes good note of this and it will appear at the appropriate time before the Committee on Agriculture.
President.
Mr Posselt has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I would simply like to ask when Question Time proper, with the preparatory questions, is likely to begin.
After all, it was scheduled for 6 p.m.
Mr Posselt, I am really concerned today because we are going to have a delay of three quarters of an hour.
I understand what you have said and I will communicate the repeated problems which arise with Question Time to the Bureau of Parliament and the Conference of Presidents.
Report on the preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins
The next item is the Commission communication on the report on preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins.
Commissioner Solbes has the floor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro has been a reality since 1 January 1999 and the coins and notes will be introduced in 272 days.
We will thereby complete the historic process of passing from our countries each having their own currencies to sharing the same currency within the Economic and Monetary Union.
The first two years of the euro have led to the consolidation of good economic results and substantial advances.
I am not going to repeat the figures for growth or inflation or the extent to which monetary policy has contributed to growth or to the convergence of our economies, nor the role played by the euro as a protective factor in the face of external crises.
In any event, it is clear that the euro has had a definite impact on financial integration and has created the conditions for a broad and very fluid European market.
This new situation enables us to confront the challenges facing us, such as those in the field of budgetary policy. It enables us to prevent this being procyclical and to prepare ourselves for the risks posed by the ageing of the population, to speed up our structural reforms in order to improve our growth potential, to make progress in the field of financial legislation in order to further integrate the markets, and to complete the process through the introduction of notes and coins, which we hope will take place successfully on 1 January.
There is absolutely no doubt that the introduction of the euro is going to be an historic event.
Every company, consumer and authority must adapt to this new situation, and the communication being presented today consists of a report on the situation with regard to the preparations for the introduction of coins and notes, but also, as well as assessing the general situation, additional work is being carried out: on the one hand, to establish to what extent the content of the Commission recommendation of last 11 October has been complied with by the Member States and, secondly, to establish a series of good practices, the application of which may contribute to aiding the correct development of operations relating to the introduction of notes and coins.
It is possible that this new communication will mark the end of Commission communications to the Council.
And I say it is possible because we do not rule out the idea that, if new factors arise which suggest the need for a new communication, then this would be done next October.
In any event, I would like to respond to the two questions which are the subject of today' s document: what is the current situation and what new practices are proposed.
The framework of preparations presents a situation which I would call unequal.
It is not a black or white situation; it is a grey situation and, in some cases, it is too dark a grey, but only in some very specific cases, it is true.
With regard to companies, it is true that, generally, the preparation of large companies has made very satisfactory progress, but small and medium-sized businesses are still somewhat behind.
Approximately half of them have improved the situation, but still half of them have no action plan to transfer to the euro on 1 January.
What is more significant is that one in three of them is still not aware that 1 January 2002 is the time limit for carrying our all their operations in euros.
Therefore, increasing the awareness of small and medium-sized businesses is still one of the fundamental concerns of our communication.
With regard to consumers, the eurobarometer for January demonstrates the consumers' vision of the euro, and we must acknowledge that in some cases it is relatively confused.
For example, one in every four people (25 per cent) believes that euro notes and coins issued in one country will only be legal currency in that country, which indicates that a factor as fundamental as the existence of the single currency is still not fully understood.
One in every five, however, is not aware, for example, that the introduction of the euro will be accompanied by the withdrawal of the old currencies and, although progress has been made on the issue of the timetable, 40% of citizens do not yet know the exact date of the introduction of euro notes and coins.
The numerous information campaigns have had limited effects, but it is true that it is difficult to persuade consumers to take an interest in an event which they see as far off.
There is plenty of documentation, but that documentation is not always read.
We are convinced that this situation will improve at the beginning of the second six-month period, with large companies that issue invoices changing their bank accounts and other means of collecting payment early.
This will contribute to consumers being progressively more involved in the new situation we are creating.
Public administrations are generally prepared and offer the public the opportunity to use the euro in a very broad range of operations, although it is true that they could play a more significant role, acting as a catalyst for the whole of the economy, for example, by paying, public contracts or officials' salaries in euros, something which has taken place in some Member States, but not in all of them.
The banks are cooperating well; they are carrying out changes in advance in their relations with their clients; the adaptation of automatic cash dispensers in 2002 will probably be very rapid, and even immediate in the majority of Member States; in general, they will issue notes of low value and will thereby contribute to alleviating the problems of returning change which may arise in commercial operations.
The exchange of national notes for euros will be free and unlimited in the majority of participating States during the period of dual circulation.
The banks have in fact become one of the driving forces in the transfer to the euro and their policy of early exchange is a very important contribution to increasing awareness of the euro amongst economic operators.
We have also developed a series of good practices, which are nothing more than a series of simple, practical ideas which are being applied in some Member States and which are being made known to the others so that they can also apply them. In today' s communication, the Commission offers 20 new practices, 10 to be applied before the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January, and another 10 which could be implemented at a later date.
Those measures are not applicable in all the Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union, but they are a set of ideas which each Member State may have recourse to and use if the State considers it appropriate.
I will mention some, which are, as I said before, relatively simple ideas such as distributing to small businesses instruments for calculating the exchange of currency while the national currency and the euro are being used at the same time.
Or creating and distributing instruments for calculating the cash requirements of small businesses, a fundamental issue when it comes to calling for the front loading of notes and coins. Another measure, in agreement with consumers and businesspeople, is to start to pay a part of salaries, at the end of the year, with 'kits' of euro coins, which is a possibility.
After the introduction of the notes and coins on 1 January 2002, other issues of interest may be raised.
For example, we recommend that sales do not take place, as is usually the case in some Member States, on 2 January, as that would give rise to an unmanageable situation from the point of view of the operation of those businesses.
We also recommend, for example, that the 'neutralisation' of national notes be authorised for some economic operators, so that we can reduce the risks of transport.
We also propose, for example, as has happened in France, that specific precalibrated instruments for the old currency be created, so that the exchange of national coins may take place more easily.
Finally, there is a series of ideas which we believe to be useful, which have been applied already in some Member States and which are no doubt going to be have a positive effect in terms of ensuring that this introduction of notes and coins for 300 million Europeans takes place more easily.
The logistical operation is of great importance, and we should try to resolve the majority of the problems before that date arrives so that these possible second level and less important practical problems do not cloud the fundamental issue, that is the introduction of euro notes and coins.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Commissioner, it is always useful to hear your recommendations on the practical aspects of the euro. I do get the idea, however, that you are not overly concerned.
I, personally, am concerned and I think that there are still some fundamental sticking points: people do not really know what is going to happen in practice, businesses do not really know and Europe' s citizens are not familiar with the new currency.
Do you not think that specific measures need to be adopted?
The second question I would like to ask you is this: what is really happening with transfers between euro-zone countries?
When will stop paying transfer costs within the euro zone, between euro-zone countries?
Mr President, Commissioner, you know that as the rapporteur on this issue, this is of great interest to me.
As regards your current statement, which is hopefully more comprehensive and detailed on paper than what we have just heard, I have two main problems: firstly, how do you verify that the funds provided by the European Union for the information campaign are actually being used efficiently and constructively, and in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations and the basic political message, in the Member States?
I ask this question because I have the feeling that we have become more of a channel for EU funding and are relinquishing our leading role in the information campaign under the guise of subsidiarity.
And secondly: what do you intend to do to persuade the Ministers responsible, especially the ECOFIN Council, and include them in this much-needed action programme in the information campaign on a mandatory basis, not just in an advisory capacity?
Mr President, I would say to Mrs Torres Marques that my obligation is not to be anxious.
My obligation is to resolve the problems and view the difficulties rather coolly and with a certain distance.
I believe that we may have a distorted view of reality.
When you see the communication you will see the level of decision which each of the Member States has reached and the amount of information available at a national level.
I believe that the citizens who have wished to be informed have been so, the companies are reasonably well informed and the public administrations are also acting.
However, it is the case that the coins and notes campaign has still not begun, since most of it will begin in June, and be reinforced in September.
There will be national campaigns, as well as a European Central Bank campaign which will undoubtedly have a specific effect on coins and notes and their technical characteristics, including security characteristics, which will take place as we come closer to the final stage and will give everybody a clearer knowledge of the situation.
Another problem which you have raised is a rather complex issue, which you know well, and which appears on page 46 of our communication.
I am not yet able to offer you a definitive solution.
You will be able to see there the progress we are making on the different problems raised and that, since November 2000, the banking association has launched the STEP I project, which is the first project to offer us a system of compensation at a cross-border level, which should be a key element in helping us to reduce the cost of these operations which, for you and for us, are an issue of special concern.
It is going to be very difficult for the citizen to understand that, from 1 January, and working with euros in different countries, that a cheque in Portuguese euros paid in Portugal is not going to cost the same as a cheque in Portuguese euros paid in Belgium or vice versa.
Therefore, this is a point which has to be resolved, but resolving it necessitates the existence of a cross-border compensation system equivalent to the national compensation systems.
You will see in the difficulties posed by this issue in the communication, and we are prepared to do everything necessary to launch this project because we agree that it is a fundamental problem.
With regard to guidelines, I would say to Mr Karas that these have been established, with the Commission, through the different agreements which have been reached with the different Member States and, therefore, we are convinced that, if the agreements which have been reached for transfers of resources are applied correctly, there should be no problems in this regard.
And I would say the same to the respective ministers in relation to their national programmes.
The national programmes are all being discussed in the Commission.
There are references to each of the national programmes, including the communication issues, even the web pages relating to each Member State and the present communication informs us of exactly the action which each of the Member States has planned.
In any event, if Parliament or yourself have any doubt about any particular programme, we are prepared to give you the relevant information.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have two brief questions.
Firstly, 9 May is also supposed to convince young people in the European Union that their future lies in Euroland.
What are you doing, what is the Commission doing, and what are you arranging with the Member States so that a Euro project day takes place in every school before the end of this year?
Do you plan to launch a specific initiative here?
Secondly,what measures can be taken to help boost consumer confidence and ensure that in terms of consumer protection, there are no grounds to fear price distortions during conversion and a lack of transparency in price calculation?
Thirdly, do you intend to continue the Euro information campaign with the Member States at least during the first half of next year, and if so, in what form?
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not have as many misgivings as some of my fellow MEPs.
I believe that, on the whole, things are going well.
We still have a few months left.
Ordinary consumers and small businesses are not great planners, and the information will only strike home once they realise that things are getting serious and that it is high time they did something about it.
Of course, we could lend them a helping hand, and I have two suggestions in that respect.
As far as the SMEs are concerned, they should be given incentives in order to be ready on time.
So far, there are a great many small and medium-sized businesses, especially those working for the local market, who can only see the drawbacks.
They need to invest in order to be able to work with the euro, but they are not gaining any direct benefits.
My question is whether it would not be possible for the Commission to encourage the Member States by, for example, offering SMEs small fiscal incentives to be prepared in good time.
It is also important to make the consumer fully conversant with the fact that coins are not exchangeable in every Member State.
Foreign coins must be spent, and it is vital for people to know this before the summer.
So I would advise you to give them plenty of warning about this.
Secondly, could I suggest that you take the initiative of collecting all coins locally and maybe using them for a good cause?
That is better than simply binning them.
Mr President, I would like to say the following to Mrs Randzio-Plath:
Firstly, with regard to the activities for 9 May, as you know, in cooperation with the chairman of the eurogroup, it has been agreed to communicate the 9 May initiative relating to schools to the Ecofin Council, in MalmÃ¶, and the Commission will print 400 000 little passports which our delegations will make available to the schools so that the children can begin to familiarise themselves with this situation.
Secondly, in relation to the consumers' difficulties with prices, we make certain references in this communication to factors which may be useful in guaranteeing that the rounding up or down of product prices does not benefit the retailer.
We also insist that national administrations, in relation to the payment of taxes, for example - and the Belgian administration has done this - round prices down rather than up, so that the public administrations may be the first to demonstrate that the euro does not have to have inflationary effects, but precisely the opposite.
Thirdly, the fundamental problem with the information campaigns - as you know - is that they are national.
This means that some of the funds for 2002 can be used to finance some of the existing commitments.
Campaigns have not only been carried out in accordance with calendar years.
However, there is no doubt that if there are remains of these resources, we should seriously consider using them to send a political message about the significance of the euro, as a change in our customs, and about the fundamental nature of the process of European integration.
I would say firstly to Mrs Thyssen that I agree with her that the small- and medium-sized businesses and consumers will not adapt until the last moment.
Whether or not there are fiscal advantages is to be decided by the Member States.
The principle of subsidiarity applies here and it is not for us to intervene on this matter.
Something we have insisted on though, amongst the good practices, is that the debiting which the Central Banks make to the commercial banking sector, the financial advantage which results from the currency charge, be also partially transferred to the companies, so that this type of operation does not imply an additional cost for them.
With regard to currencies, what you say is clear.
We have not given any consideration to the recovery of currencies, but this is the element which initially is going to come into play most quickly.
I take note of your proposal that an initiative of this type be created at a local level, which, as you say, may help to bring about a good result.
Mr President, Commissioner, my question is this: the need for this information campaign is certainly not limited to the twelve future euro countries.
In Central and Eastern Europe, in particular, there are billions in circulation, especially in Deutschmarks, and in parts of the Balkans, the Deutschmark is the local currency, either officially or de facto.
The people there will then suddenly be confronted with the euro from one day to the next as well.
So my question is: How do you intend to provide information in these countries?
Are you working with their national banks?
Should they perhaps operate as issuing offices as well?
How do you propose to prevent racketeers from cheating people with their own particular forms of currency exchange?
I think there is a significant need for action in this area.
In the event that we have additional resources, we will organise a conference in Budapest in order to provide information on the introduction of the euro in the candidate countries.
However, in relation to the specific problem which you have raised, the European Central Bank has accepted the possibility of front loading even for branches of European banks in countries outside the eurozone, bearing in mind that a very substantial proportion of German currency notes are located outside German territory.
Work is being done on this issue and the European Central Bank has seen this as the best way to solve this problem.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
This item is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0163/2001). We will examine questions to the Commission.
Part one
Question No 29 by (H-0263/01):
Subject: Violence against women in Sierra Leone Given the widespread reports over the past month of the ongoing acts of sexual violence and rape being perpetrated against women and girls by the forces of the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone, could the Commission outline what measures it has adopted to monitor the situation in Sierra Leone and what action it has taken?
Could it also reassure me that everything is being done to help the Government of Sierra Leone address the human rights violations there?
The European Commission is aware of the reports relating to the Revolutionary United Front's violence against women and girls and shares the concerns of the honourable Member.
The United Nations, through its office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has this year established an information system in Sierra Leone, aimed at gathering information from women and girls in camps for internally displaced persons across the country, to determine the scope of sexual violence against women and girls.
The data gathered will be used to advocate better protection and programming on the ground.
Where appropriate the information may also be shared with the Truth and Reconciliation Committee being set up by the government and the proposed UN special court.
The Commission, through ECHO, has been assisting the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights since September 2000, with a grant of EUR 30 000.
This is intended to increase general awareness not only within government but throughout society as a whole, of the question of human rights in Sierra Leone and, in particular, the problem of violence against women and children.
Funding to the tune of EUR 50 000 is being provided for training courses for humanitarian workers on human rights and international humanitarian law, including acts of violence against women.
The human rights section of the UN peacekeeping force is implementing this programme.
Question No 30 by (H-0300/01):
Subject: Humanitarian aid for the Chechen people Leaving to one side the rights and wrongs of the Commission's humanitarian policy in Chechnya, can the Commission state whether, given that it has on several occasions drawn attention to the difficulties involved in operating inside Chechnya itself, it would be willing to support the implementation of humanitarian projects inside Georgia and Azerbaijan, aimed at the Chechen people and involving first and foremost the provision of medical assistance?
Since the outbreak of the current crisis in October 1999 the Commission, via ECHO, has allocated more than EUR 25 million in humanitarian aid to the victims of this conflict.
The emphasis of ECHO intervention in the northern Caucasus region, where the large majority of Chechen IDPs are located, is because this is where the biggest problem is.
Up to 360 000 internally displaced persons in Ossetia, Daghestan and Chechnya itself, compared with a figure reportedly around 5 000 to 7 000 refugees in the Pankisi Valley in Georgia.
Operating conditions in the northern Caucasus remain difficult, especially in terms of security.
However, the same holds true for Georgia, where aids to the Chechen refugees in the Pankisi Valley had to be suspended for some time last year in reaction to the abduction of expatriate aid workers.
To date, allocations made in the context of the Chechnya crisis and benefiting Chechen refugees in Georgia total some EUR 820 000.
The operations funded focus mostly on basic health care. They have, for instance, consisted of the distribution of essential medicines to health providers, training of doctors on rational drug use, rehabilitation of basic health care facilities and the distribution of hygiene parcels.
Given the scope of the case-load of internally displaced persons in the northern Caucasus and the limited resources available, ECHO's main focus for humanitarian intervention in favour of the victims of the conflict will remain there.
However, depending on how the situation develops, some limited funding might be made available to continue a medical programme in Georgia.
No specific humanitarian assistance is envisaged for Azerbaijan as at present no substantial numbers of refugees from Chechnya are reported in Azerbaijan.
Commissioner, thank you for your answer, although I think it is slightly elusive.
I am acquainted with the competent people, the Minister for Health in the Maskhadov government, Mr Oumar Khembiev, in particular, who believes that there are needs to be met in Georgia and Azerbaijan, which in no way detracts from what you have seen within Chechnya and the part of Russia where other Chechen people have sought refuge.
Having said that, I would like to know if you would be prepared to meet Mr Oumar Khembiev, the Health Minister, to discuss matters with him and to see if there are any firm possibilities of establishing two field hospitals in Georgia and Azerbaijan.
. We have been quite careful in calibrating and prioritising what we are doing with the aim of getting as close as possible to the biggest groups in need affected by the conflict in Chechnya.
We are also funding the logistic operation of food and medicine into Chechnya.
The priorities on which we are working are the right ones.
What you mention in your supplementary question sounds more like health support, not directed specifically to the victims of the conflict.
In any case, the priorities which I indicated in my first response are the best available answer we can give now.
Commissioner, I should like to ask whether you are now able to address the Chechen people directly via the Russian media, as I have read reports from ECHO which indicate that this access - especially via radio broadcasts - has not been granted by the Russian Government.
Are you able to do this, and is it helpful, for humanitarian aid purposes, to be able to contact the civilian population directly?
My second question follows on from this: do you not think it is necessary for the Commission to visit the refugee camps in Georgia and the other neighbour states officially in order to make contacts there?
I am not going to repeat the numbers of refugees in the different regions.
They are not our own figures.
They are from the various international forganisations working on this.
The reality is that in Chechnya itself we are working with 170 000 internally displaced people, the same number in Ossetia and the small number of 20 000 in Daghestan.
We are directing our assistance to areas with the largest concentration of people in need.
Finding the right channels to do that is not very easy.
It should be noted that the Commission, through ECHO, is by far the largest provider of humanitarian aid in this conflict.
Question No 31 by (H-0260/01):
Subject: Non-polluting vehicles The third oil crisis which recently hit the European Union raises a number of issues regarding the transport and energy policy pursued by the EU, the implications of that policy and the fact that it is having little effect in combating greenhouse-gas emissions.
What is the Commission doing to support and encourage the use of vehicles which run on non-oil-based fuels?
How many studies have been conducted in this area?
Does the Commission give due consideration to all projects involving the patenting of zero-emission techniques, and, if so, how have these been followed up?
. (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, a White Paper on common transport policy will very soon enable us to renew the debate on sustainable development.
As part of this debate, we will look into alternative fuels.
A communication is currently being drafted on biofuels to see how they can help to solve key political questions such as the dependence of transport on oil-based fuels, the security of power supply, greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.
Furthermore, the Commission will present a proposal for a directive before the summer of 2001 to introduce a rate of utilisation for biofuels in transport.
For approximately 20 years, the Commission has supported a great number of projects on alternative fuels and vehicles through its technological research and development programmes.
Almost all alternative fuels have been covered in these projects.
In spite of this huge support, these fuels and vehicles have not really been available on the market until now, the main barrier most often being the extra costs that are involved.
With regard to patents, many have been created as part of these projects, but they are the intellectual property of the industries and universities that took part in these projects which we cofinanced.
Commissioner, I mainly wanted to talk about the last point on patents.
Many citizens are concerned about reducing greenhouse gases and they even send us projects that are extremely interesting but which we are not in a position even to understand and analyse from a technical point of view.
I wanted to find out if the Commission had opened any sort of 'one stop shop' that these people could contact, because if they are not scientists or do not belong to a university, there is no one to act as a sounding board for their ideas.
With regard to the specific question on transport, I shall pass this on to Mrs de Palacio, to see if this sort of 'one stop shop' does indeed exist, but I can inform you that, as for all these research proposals, obviously we receive letters on a regular basis from inventors and people who believe they may have found a solution and these are of course sent to the administration department.
We should remember, however, that the principle of subsidiarity also applies and that in relation to the proposals that are dealt with in European projects, we must ensure that there is, of course, a body made up of several European partners.
We therefore believe that these projects must be looked into by the different innovation and research bodies that exist in the regions and also on a national level.
I shall pass on your proposal to Mrs de Palacio to see exactly to what extent a direct answer can be made to the proposals submitted.
Mr President, my question relates to the Green Paper "Towards fair and efficient pricing in transport".
As harmful emissions are a key measure of how transport and mobility should be regulated in future, are there any plans to consider, in the research field, carrying out cost-benefit analyses in order to determine the areas of transport in which low-emission or zero-emission options would be of greatest benefit?
Several studies have already been carried out on this issue and the Green Paper that Mrs de Palacio presented on behalf of the Commission sets a debate in motion on a whole raft of issues.
Some studies have already been funded on transport systems to find out what are the best systems in the current circumstances.
For example, we supported the solution to transport problems in towns, through the Joule-Thermie programme and the Energy programme and an experiment is being carried out at the moment using fuel cell-powered buses in various European cities.
This is a proposal that we have supported and which is currently being put into practice.
Over recent weeks, there has indeed been a great deal of public attention surrounding a trial taking place in South Africa against the pharmaceutical industry and the South African Government and also a complaint lodged against Brazil by the United States.
I shall not comment on these cases which are sub judice, but I believe that it is worthwhile to explain the Commission' s policy on this issue which includes the problem of action to take against communicable diseases affecting developing countries.
The issue was referred to us last summer and we have worked on this, whilst trying to be both ambitious and fair.
In September, we organised an international round table in Brussels, out of which came a number of recommendations, ranging from a diagnosis according to which the issue of access to key drugs involves both local systems for care provision, policies for prevention and, of course, questions of the pricing and thus the funding of medicines.
We came up with a global approach based on three pillars. The first is to step up our measures in this area, on the basis of development policy; the second is to lower the price of key drugs and the final pillar is to continue with high level research so that public research can be carried out alongside private research in this area.
We very recently began a specific action programme based on this approach which forms part of a whole raft of actions adopted by the WHO, the UN and UNICEF, the ONPI and the WTO.
I believe that we are now already seeing some of the first real effects with a number of pharmaceutical companies announcing that they are committed to lowering prices.
What part does intellectual property play in this matter?
In our view, it has a major part to play, as intellectual property is required in order to stimulate both innovation and research.
This is the role of TRIPS, which is the WTO agreement on intellectual property and today we clearly stated that we are defending this concept.
However, we also stated and we are stating this just as clearly, that there are cases where exemptions from patent law - which is called compulsory licensing - are permitted for public health or urgent health reasons.
We would like to reiterate that the WTO agreement on intellectual property stipulates this flexibility.
The same, of course, applies to parallel imports, since the agreement leaves this open to WTO members to decide what can or cannot be done.
As far as we are concerned, we are also willing, at European Union level, to move ahead with this issue if it allows us to make progress on the issue of tiered pricing.
The legal provisions, which Mrs Carlotti mentioned, do not therefore present an obstacle.
It is the ways in which they may be interpreted that could pose a problem.
We have clearly stated our own interpretation.
This, perhaps, goes further than some other WTO members would wish, but that is the situation, and we committed ourselves during the preparatory phase for the Doha meeting and in the ONPI and the WTO to push the consensus towards our own flexible interpretation of the WTO provisions.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very thorough answer and for his interpretation.
I think that we are on the same wavelength on this issue.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 33 and 34 will be taken together.
Question No 33 by (H-0279/01):
Subject: European Research Area and the aeronautics sector Aeronautics, the European Union's leading export industry (EUR 22 billion) is also a key sector in employment (400 000 direct and 1.5 million indirect jobs) and turnover (EUR 65 billion in 1999).
While the aeronautics sector provides a good example of integration at industrial level, aeronautical research is fragmented among the various Member States.
The industry does however depend on research to remain competitive.
Europe can no longer afford to waste resources by duplicating and failing to coordinate its activities.
The Commission, therefore, wished to take all appropriate action to make aeronautics an example for the implementation of the European research area.
The new Framework programme for research and innovation includes 'aeronautics and space' as one of its seven priority thematic areas.
Can the Commission give more specific details of the resources mobilised and the strategy adopted to make aeronautics exemplary in respect of research for the European Union?
The questions submitted by Mrs de Veyrac and Mr Titley deal with the Commission' s strategy on research and development in the aeronautical sector and the measures and resources that are planned in order to implement this strategy.
I would, therefore, like to explain the action that we have taken.
In our view, the aeronautical sector is one of the best examples of the implementation of the European Research Area at a sector of industry.
In the light of global competition and given the impact of air transport on the life of European citizens, the Commission believes that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of aeronautical research through greater coordination and integration of the activities undertaken at all levels, i.e. national, European and private, into a single vision.
During the last six months of 2000, I formed the Group of Personalities, representing all parts of the air transport system including industrialists and manufacturers, airport management, airlines, regulatory authorities, air traffic controllers and researchers, whose aim was to shape this vision.
The fruit of the group' s labour is the report entitled 'A Vision for 2020' , which defines the main technological objectives that the sector has set itself over a 20 year period and the resources that need to be put into practice in order to achieve these.
The report focuses in particular on the need to improve the integration of research that is today being undertaken at various levels.
The report recommends setting up an Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe or ACAR.
ACAR will, in the main, be made up of representatives from national programmes, the industrial sector, the scientific community and the Commission.
Its aim will be to draw up a strategic research agenda that all the players of the sector agree to, which will influence the research priorities of national and Community programmes.
The Commission will make the utmost effort so that this council is up and running by the middle of this year.
The ACAR members are due to be named by the end of May and the first meeting is scheduled for June.
A first draft strategic agenda is expected at the beginning of next year.
Consultation between the various players in this sector and the Member States with regard to ACAR' s competences and mandate has made a good start.
This has already stirred up interest within the Member States, which all wish to take part in this initiative.
A budget of EUR 1 billion for aeronautics and space will be provided for the new framework programme. There are four priorities - competitiveness, the environment, safety and the capacity of the air transport system.
These four priorities already correspond to the main objectives of the Vision for 2020. In order to meet these objectives, the Commission is proposing to use three major instruments.
The first is the networks of excellence, and the coordination that already exists between centres of research in the aeronautical sector should facilitate the implementation of these networks.
The second is integrated projects, which essentially involves undertaking and further developing the unifying measures of the previous model of technology platforms. The final instrument is the European Union' s involvement in programmes run jointly by several Member States and which are of benefit to the Community, for example under Article 169 of the Treaty, such as those we shall have the opportunity to discuss at the debate on the new framework programme.
The Commission' s action aims, over the long term, to stimulate the coordination of research undertaken at different levels by using the unifying effect of the instruments provided for in the framework programme and is perfectly in line with the agreements of the World Trade Organisation, the research actions sought being very competitive in nature.
The Commissioner did not actually respond to my question as to what exactly the response has been from Member State governments.
Also, in relation to the WTO, I notice the report lays great stress on the fact that the United States makes a major contribution to domestic aeronautical research.
That point is precisely at the centre of the dispute over the 1992 agreement on large aircraft construction.
Does not the Commissioner see this programme as being yet another opportunity for us to have a dispute with the United States of America?
Finally, given that much of defence expenditure is now in the aeronautical area, is there a likelihood of a spill-over of this research programme into the field of defence?
The proposal for this programme is based on Vision 2020, which has three main objectives - to reduce noise, to ensure greater safety and to reduce pollution.
This research is therefore of general interest, and as I already mentioned in my first speech, it is pre-competitive research, which should therefore not be compared to specific development programmes on types of aircraft.
That is why I do not believe that there will be any difficulties in this area, since we are working within the rules agreed with the World Trade Organisation, and that the objectives are important and, moreover, concern the quality of life of all European citizens, and to the safety of Europe' s skies.
It is therefore quite acceptable that these research projects form part of this objective.
Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.
Question No 35 by (H-0266/01):
Subject: Denmark's JHA opt-out Title IV of the EC Treaty does not apply to Denmark. Nonetheless, a number of the texts adopted under Title IV do apply to Denmark by virtue of international agreements.
The Danish Government has, for example, indicated its willingness to be associated with the EURODAC regulation, the bankruptcy regulation, the Brussels I and II regulations and the regulation on the notification of documentation in civil and commercial cases.
The Danish position is based on the assumption that it enjoys freedom of choice with decisions on whether to be involved or not being taken on a caseÂ­byÂ­case basis.
Can the Commission confirm that Denmark enjoys freedom of choice about whether to be a party to decisions taken under Title IV of the EC Treaty with the result, for example, that certain parts of decisions taken in the area of asylum and immigration can - also in the future - be acceded to by Denmark, while Denmark at the same time retains special national arrangements in other areas of asylum and immigration policy?
Mr President, as stated in the protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the areas covered by Title IV of the Treaty do not apply to Denmark.
Article 3 of this protocol, which incorporates the Schengen acquis into the European Union, lays down that, with regard to decisions on implementing the Schengen acquis, Denmark can decide to guarantee the transposal of these decisions into its national law, thereby binding itself under an obligation under international law to the other Member States.
With regard to issues of Community law, Denmark has reserved itself the opportunity to renounce the use of this exemption system, under the terms of its constitutional requirements and in the wake of an internal democratic debate.
Nevertheless, the Danish Government recently asked the Commission about the possibility of applying certain rules adopted in the field of cooperation in judicial and civil matters to Denmark by means of parallel agreements with a basis in international law.
A technical debate is now underway on this issue between Denmark and the Commission' s Directorate-General for Justice and Home Affairs.
Once we have moved beyond this stage - and above all, once we have identified any difficulties in these parallel agreements - I intend to present the whole process to the Commission, that is to the whole College of Commissioners, following the exploratory technical discussions that are currently taking place.
On the basis of this political debate, I also intend to lay down the future guidelines for the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties.
A very restrained thank you as I am none the wiser.
There is an ongoing debate in Denmark about Denmark' s position.
It will be recalled that, as the Commissioner also explained, we have this exemption in Article 5 and Article 7 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark.
Article 5 is a very simple rule specifying that, if the other Member States subject to Title IV of the Treaty should decide to develop the Schengen acquis, then the Danish government and the Danish parliament may, in accordance with the constitution, decide, within a period of six months, whether Denmark should or should not take part.
The question is what a development of the Schengen acquis means.
Currently, there is the issue of the EURODAC Regulation which I believe is very closely linked to Schengen cooperation and the Schengen system. Accordingly, it might be said that asylum and immigration issues are closely linked to the Schengen problems and the Schengen system.
The question is how far we are prepared to go in applying Article 5 in developing the Schengen acquis.
Mr Krarup, the Commission is of the opinion that the Schengen rules are not the basis for either the Eurodac regulation or the future Community regulation that will replace the Dublin Convention.
These are based not on the Schengen rules but directly on Article 63(4) of the EC Treaty.
We are therefore undertaking a technical study into the possibility of implementing the Eurodac regulation and the future Dublin regulation, on the basis of a parallel agreement with Denmark, which will be in accordance with international public law. This agreement will not be based on the Schengen Agreement, but based directly on Title IV and on the possibility of implementing a parallel agreement under international public law.
Question No 36 by (H-0276/01):
Subject: Passport requirement for Swedish nationals travelling within the Nordic region From 25 March 2001, Sweden and the other Nordic countries will take part in Schengen cooperation.
Current Swedish ID cards do not meet identification requirements under the Schengen provisions. A new national ID card in Sweden may replace the Swedish passport next year.
There is contradictory information about what will happen in the meantime.
According to the Council's answer to my question H-0145/01, application of the Schengen agreement is neither contrary nor an obstacle to the Nordic passport union.
However, Article 45 of the Schengen agreement states that anyone staying in a hotel in another Schengen country must be able to produce identification and prove citizenship.
The only document Swedish citizens have which indicates their citizenship is their passport.
In the Commission's view, are Swedish citizens required to carry their passports after 25 March 2001 when travelling in the Nordic countries until they obtain the new Swedish ID card?
Mr President, I must emphasise, first of all, that under Community law, any citizen of the Union may enter or leave the territory of a Member State on presenting a valid identity card or passport.
If the passport is the only valid document for leaving the territory, which is the case in various Member States that do not issue identity cards, it must be valid for a period of not less than five years.
Member States themselves are responsible for setting the conditions for issuing and validating the identity papers of their nationals.
Incorporating the Schengen acquis into the European Union has not had any affect on these provisions.
According to the Commission' s information, Sweden intends to introduce a national identity card with the status of travel document in accordance with Community directives.
Secondly, it should be pointed out that Article 45 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement stipulates that persons wishing to stay overnight in a hotel must prove their identity by presenting a valid identity document.
It should be noted that the Schengen acquis does not stipulate the type of identity document required.
Consequently and in summary, the concept of a valid identity document can be interpreted to mean that all identity documents that have been accepted to date by the Nordic States as proof of identity can, in future, be presented when booking into a hotel.
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer.
If I have understood all this correctly, a Swede does not need to carry any ID document showing that he is a Swedish citizen, in spite of Article 45' s stating that it must be checked whether the traveller is a citizen of a Schengen country.
Consequently, Swedish citizens are at present exempt from that rule when they travel in other Nordic countries.
Is that correct?
I am afraid that, probably due to the translation, the situation is not clear at all.
There is no change about the status of the Swedes' valid identity document as far as registering in hotels is concerned.
So if the document was valid to be registered in a hotel, in a Nordic state, it will go on being valid for the same purpose.
What I said was that as far as I know, up until now, the Swedish authorities have not notified any specific identity document to be recognised by all Member States as a travel document according to Directive 68/360.
I hope is now clear that there is no change about the possibility of using the current Swedish identity card to register in a hotel.
We no doubt all remember that, during the Schengen negotiations, it was emphasised how important it was for the Nordic countries that the Nordic Passport Union which is nearly 50 years old and which ensures that Nordic citizens can travel freely in the Nordic countries without their passports - or other identification documents, for that matter - should not be affected by the Schengen Agreement.
Now, if I understand the Commissioner' s answer correctly, it is nevertheless necessary to introduce passport requirements for journeys from one Nordic country to another, which means, in other words, that the Nordic Passport Union no longer exists.
The exemption from the requirement to carry passports, which we have enjoyed for nearly 50 years, no longer applies.
I am sorry I do not share your point of view.
Your freedom has been enlarged in that now you have a free area of movement throughout the Schengen area which is why, for instance, Norway and Iceland - which formed part of the Nordic free area of movement - have signed a parallel agreement with the Union to guarantee that they will also benefit from that area of free movement that is the Schengen area.
I know your political view on this issue and you know mine.
I hope that Commissioner Vitorino does not feel weighed down with too many questions about the Schengen Agreement and the Nordic exemption from having to carry a passport, but I should like to follow up what has been said by my fellow MEPs, Mr SjÃ¶stedt and Mr Krarup.
Swedish ID documents make no mention of citizenship, but it has been possible, in spite of that, to use them within Scandinavia.
Does the Schengen Agreement mean that Swedish ID documents will not be of use and relevance within the Schengen area in future?
If so, this would be a change for the worse for Swedish citizens.
Have I understood correctly?
I cannot interpret Mr Vitorino' s answer in any other way.
The only thing I would like to say is that some decisions come under the competence of the Commission, some other decisions come under the competence of the Swedish Government.
What I said and would like to reiterate is that, up to now, the Swedish authorities have not notified any specific identity document to be recognised by all Member States as a travel document according to Directive 68/360, which does not mean that the Swedish Government has the intention to introduce changes in their identity cards due to the reason that you have mentioned.
There is not a specific indication of nationality in that document.
My evaluation is that the Schengen acquis does not introduce any change in national travel documents because, as far as I know, that remains strictly the responsibility of Member States.
Therefore I hope within the next few months we will be able to clarify the intentions of the Swedish Government concerning identity cards and the best interpretation of the Schengen acquis.
I can assure you that the political objective of this exercise is to make free movement of people easier, not more difficult.
Question No 37 by (H-0311/01):
Subject: Authorisation to carry medicines when travelling between countries in the Schengen area The Danish Government recently submitted a draft law requiring authorisation to carry medicines for private use when travelling within the Schengen area.
There is great doubt in this regard as to what is required by EU legislation and what simply derives from requirements under Danish national law.
Will the Commission, therefore, say how it interprets the rules on carrying medicines for private use within the Schengen area?
Does EU legislation require such authorisation, and what are the rules in this respect in the other Member States of the Union?
Article 75 is one of the provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and this seeks to allow travellers to carry narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in connection with medical treatment.
These individuals must be in possession of a certificate issued by a competent national authority.
Pursuant to the above-mentioned article, the Schengen Executive Committee adopted, in its decision of 22 December 1994, the form and content of this certificate and the principles governing its issue.
The Commission takes the view that a draft law in Denmark covering the subject you have raised, now matches the above-mentioned provisions.
Thank you, Commissioner. Would you please answer the two other questions I asked on how the rules have been interpreted in other countries?
I would very much like to hear your answer, as the debate in Denmark and the proposals put forward there seem like an April fool' s joke.
However, 1 April was last Sunday, and now we have to look ahead, so I would therefore like to hear how other countries have tackled the issue of Article 75.
Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, I must inform you that the interpretation of Article 75 of the Schengen Agreement was drawn up by a decision of the Schengen Executive Committee adopted on 22 December 1994.
This decision, which was the subject of the document entitled SCH/Com-ex(94)28rev and which was published in the Official Journal of 22 September 2000, is applicable uniformly throughout the Schengen countries.
This means that, with the rules being identical in every country, the common form must be respected to certify the need for medical treatment allowing a citizen to carry the substances mentioned in your question.
This is the uniform implementation of a decision of the Schengen Executive Committee.
I am surprised to hear the Commissioner' s answer.
I should like to have it confirmed that this point, referring to Article 75, is about a development of the Schengen acquis.
We are dealing with the Protocol on Denmark, Article 5, paragraph 2, and I gather from the Commissioner' s answer that any rules regarding the carrying of certificates must be adopted unanimously and that if no agreement is reached, that is if Denmark takes up another position, then the parties must enter into negotiations.
In principle, this is about a development of the Schengen acquis, a fact which I should like to hear confirmed, and when it is claimed to be about extension of freedom, that is quite ironic for me personally, as I believe it would become quite a burden for those of us who travel around with many types of euphoriants in our bags due to our delicate health.
I have the greatest respect for your opinion, but my point of view is as follows: a Danish law, as stated in your question does not contravene the Schengen acquis.
Incidentally, I do not understand how Protocol 5 can be invoked - there is no contradiction between the decision of the Schengen Executive Committee and the free and sovereign decision of the Kingdom of Denmark.
This does not constitute an exception, but rather a guarantee for the uniform implementation of the rule.
Mr President, as Parliament, and Mr Posselt especially, knows, for the Member States party to Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the principles relating to controls and surveillance of external borders of the European Union are governed by Community law, in accordance with the Protocol implementing the Schengen acquis in the European Union, as drawn up by the Treaty of Amsterdam.
In my view and in the Commission' s view, there are now several reasons for considering the creation of a European corps of external border guards.
Several Member States also seem to want to explore this option further in order to strengthen resources for combating illegal immigration.
The countries who are candidates to join the European Union will be required, in the long term - I stress the long term - to play a full role in implementing the Schengen acquis and the acquis communautaire, in the area, amongst others, of controlling the European Union' s external borders and of the unchecked free movement of individuals within internal borders.
Even from the point of view of developing Community law, the only aim of external border controls is to check individuals purely in terms of migration.
The controls also seek to ensure monitoring of external borders in terms of combating crime, or applying customs regulations and to ensure that various technical regulations that apply to vehicles or to dangerous or illicit merchandise are being respected.
That is why - and I am able to confirm this - the Italian Government has requested the Commission' s support to undertake a feasibility study on the possibility of setting up a corps of European border guards. This is an initiative that was also supported by several other Member States and which the Commission favours.
As you know, any decision regarding this sort of programme supported by the Odysseus programme depends on the Management Committee.
What I can say to you is that the Commission supports the Italian initiative.
To turn to the subject of the European Police College, which was created as a result of the Council decision of 22 December 2000, to which the European Parliament also contributed in the form of Mr Posselt' s report - I would like to say that in terms of its organisation, the College' s rules of procedure will be submitted for the Council' s information.
The headquarters of the European Police College' s secretariat will be established on the basis of a forthcoming decision by the Council.
Its operating budget will also be set.
I can inform you that the College' s governing board approved its draft financial regulation on 23 March and this will now be submitted for approval to the Council.
With regard to the College' s working programme, we are working on the basis that the Police College must not be used to finance existing national actions and that it must concentrate on a few priority areas which are currently being defined.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your very precise and competent answer.
I have just one further question: when do you think the feasibility study on the creation of EU protective units will be submitted?
As you know, it was due to my report three years ago that this House has proposed the creation of these units.
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
I certainly recall the European Parliament' s proposal.
I hope that we will be able to approve the Italian proposal as soon as possible.
As you know, the proposals had to be tabled by 31 March.
The Management Committee will now meet and make a decision.
I hope that the proposal will be approved, so that it can be implemented during 2001.
I hope that by the end of the year, the Italian Government will present the feasibility study, which was, moreover, undertaken in close consultation with several other governments, which have already given their support and backing to the possibility of creating a common guard force for Europe' s borders.
Question No 39 by (H-0249/01):
Subject: Crisis in the Balkans As developments in the Balkans crisis have revealed, recognition of the borders of many countries in the region is a matter of direct or indirect contention.
A case in point is the border between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Serbia, on which the two countries themselves have agreed but which Albanian groups in FYROM itself and in Kosovo refuse to accept.
What is the Commission's view of these current developments and, in particular, what is its position on the acceptance of borders as a stabilising force in the Balkans crisis?
Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity of answering this question and I am grateful for what you said a moment or two ago.
My time of departure is largely determined by the fact that I took until 5.00 a.m. this morning to get back from Macedonia, which is the subject of this question.
As the honourable Member knows, the governments in Skopje and Belgrade recently reached agreement on border demarcation between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The European Union very much welcomes that agreement.
Since the appearance of the armed Albanian extremists, the European Union has made clear its very strong support for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and we have made clear as well our support for the inviolability of borders.
We have condemned the violence and we have argued passionately, as was the case for example at the European Council last weekend, that grievances must be addressed through democratic institutions.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is moving towards Europe.
As the honourable Member will know, we are looking forward to signing a stabilisation and association agreement with the Macedonian leadership at the beginning of next week.
The European Union has been intensively involved in trying to manage and prevent this crisis.
We have all worked very closely together - the Presidency, the High Representative, the Member States and the Commission - and we have also worked closely with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
My latest trip to Skopje was yesterday.
I went for the second time in about ten days with the High Representative.
It was his third trip in that period.
We have made clear once again that the Albanian population need to see the real opportunity for promoting their interests through political means.
We are very pleased at the attempt made by President Trajkovski to launch a process of dialogue in Skopje.
The first meeting of the political leaders that he brought together took place yesterday.
We are ready to help in that process of dialogue but I have to make it clear that we do not think it is our role to mediate.
It is our role to assist people in taking things forward but it is not our job to take the responsibility off their shoulders.
We appealed yesterday to the PDP Party to attend meetings of the dialogue in future.
We had individual meetings with all the party leaders.
All of them expressed their commitment to democracy.
All of them expressed their commitment to dialogue.
All of them expressed their commitment to joining the European family.
So we now look to them to make good the undertakings that they gave us yesterday.
We hope that they will talk to one another through the fora created by President Trajkovski.
We hope that all of them, including the opposition, will participate in the signing ceremony of the stabilisation and association agreement next week.
We have said that we stand ready in the Commission to support the process of building a successful, multi-ethnic Community through our CARDS Programme and so on. We have made it clear to the Albanian leaders in Kosovo that the donor community's patience is not unlimited and that they have to make clear their own absolute abhorrence of violence in the attempt to move away from extremism.
I think we have been doing all we can, but the political leaders in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia now have to show the leadership which is going to be required in order to get their country through this difficult period.
Commissioner, thank you very much for your detailed reply.
I must say that I agree with the way in which you have set things out, but there is one problem. You said, '... for promoting their interests through political means.'
As you know, there is a scenario, which is the subject of a great deal of discussion, whereby with institutional and constitutional change in the FYROM, i.e. by converting it into a kind of federation or confederation, political pressure could arise - especially at difficult times, such as now - for subsequent secession.
It is a model which, unfortunately, we have seen and several countries backed it in the former Yugoslavia.
I would like it to be made clear from your side - I think you expressed it well, but you could perhaps stress a little more - that no such way out will be given to extremists inside this country or, as you well know, outside it, to political forces in Kosovo.
I would like to go further than that, if I may.
First of all, it has to be the way forward for southeast Europe to turn its back once and for all on violence and the attempt to effect political change through bloodshed, mayhem, bombs and bullets.
That is the path to Europe.
That is what I will be discussing again tomorrow when I am in Croatia where they have, in my judgment, turned their faces to democracy and their backs to violence.
It is the point I will be making in Albania on Thursday when we have the high level steering group which will be discussing the stabilisation and association process for Albania.
I pay tribute now to the unequivocal statements made by the political leaders of the Albanian state in the last few days.
But I want to go further.
Those who believe that we can secure peace and prosperity in southeast Europe by fiddling with borders here and there are deluding themselves, and deluding themselves seriously.
There is not just one Presevo Valley in the southeast of Europe.
There are, in political terms, figuratively several.
So if you start fiddling with the borders here you end up fiddling with the borders everywhere.
Every time you do that you encourage those who think they can get their own political way by blowing up houses, buses with innocent women and children in them, or shooting police officers going about their lawful duties.
I endorse what the honourable Member says, but I would go a stage further.
There have been excellent signs in southeast Europe over the last 18 months of people coming back towards the democratic family.
I took particular satisfaction myself in looking at the B92 radio station website at the weekend, which had the headline "Slobo in the slammer". I thought we had come a very long way in the last few years.
I know that occasionally there are problems and not everything progresses smoothly, but I very much hope that we will not lose what has been achieved in the last 18 months.
To what extent would the Commissioner agree with me that the origins of the current crisis in Macedonia actually lie purely and simply with the activities of criminal gangs looking to protect their smuggling rackets and taking advantage of the weak security of the border with FYROM, and that what we need to do is to tighten up on those criminals who have used the issue of minority rights as fuel to keep the fires of discontent going in order to cover up their activities?
What is at stake here is that gangsters are seeking to undermine democracy and peace and stability to line their own pockets.
Primarily we have to take tough action to prevent that illegal activity so that the political situation can be stabilised.
I once heard somebody in another part of Europe, where I was chairing a commission on policing and security, make what seemed to me to be a curious distinction between what they described as 'good honest old-fashioned crime' and political extremism using bombs and bullets.
The fact of the matter is there is no good honest old-fashioned crime, but there are plenty of examples where organised criminality, organised criminal behaviour becomes interwoven with political extremism and its manifestation in organised violence.
We have seen that in so many parts of Europe and we are seeing it once again in parts of south-east Europe, including no doubt the Kosovo-Macedonian and Kosovo-Serbia borders.
While there are doubtless some who espouse political extremism for political reasons, there are others who see the advantage of cloaking criminal action - trafficking in drugs, trafficking in smuggled cigarettes, trafficking in human beings; they see political causes as a way of providing an umbrella for that criminality.
Whatever it is, it is wrong, it must stop, it is what the past was like in south-east Europe.
We must do all we can in the European Union to make sure that the future is very different indeed.
Is the Commissioner satisfied that KFOR is adequately controlling and successfully preventing movements of fighters and arms across the border between Kosovo and FYROM?
I had an opportunity to discuss that issue with the Swedish Foreign Minister, Anna Lindh, in the presidency of the Council, and the High Representative with KFOR, in Pristina about ten days ago, with the Special Representative, Mr Hakerup who is doing such an excellent job and also with KFOR and the KFOR commander.
They assured us that they were stepping up security on the border.
It is, like a lot of borders, difficult to give cast iron guarantees of security about the ability to pass from one side to the other.
It is very mountainous terrain as the honourable Member probably knows but nevertheless I am sure that KFOR need to continue to do more.
They are committing more troops.
They are making a greater effort.
It is essential that they do because there is no doubt at all that there have been people moving backwards and forwards across the border and the political consequences in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of movement of extremists from Kosovo into Macedonia make what has been a difficult crisis for them to face even more political and therefore even more awkward.
So yes, I hope KFOR will be able to do more.
We have certainly had a dialogue with them about that and I very much hope that the assurances they have been given will be manifested on the ground.
It is a difficult job but one which I hope they will be able to do even better.
As the author is not present, Question No 40 lapses.
Question No 41 by (H-0274/01):
Subject: Fundamentalist hostility to women in Saudi Arabia The laws currently in force in Saudi Arabia discriminate against women.
For instance, women are stoned for committing adultery and condemned to death for apostasy.
More than 28 women having been executed since 1990.
In its contempt for women, the State discriminates against them. They are subjected to gender apartheid, arbitrarily detained and imprisoned, and watched by the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, also known as the al-Mutawa' een.
In view of this situation, what measures does the Commission intend to propose with a view to improving the human rights situation for Saudi women?
The situation of women in Saudi Arabia is a matter of very considerable concern.
The European Union has raised this issue on a number of occasions in the context of the overall human rights situation in Saudi Arabia.
We have done this through dÃ©marches, we have done this in political dialogue and we have done this in statements on human rights policy.
For some years an exchange of views on human rights has taken place between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, including Saudi Arabia.
The situation of women has been raised by the European Union in the context of the European Union-Gulf Cooperation Council political dialogue.
The issue has also been raised by the Commission in the negotiations on a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in which an article on human rights and democratic principles will be included.
Moreover, the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia has been raised by the European Union in the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Last year this led to some modest but positive steps by Saudi Arabia, to which I can return if the honourable Member would like.
I hope that these relatively positive signals in the area of human rights which we have seen from Saudi Arabia in the last year will be followed by positive actions in Saudi legislation, but I have to say that having read, for example, the report by Amnesty International and other reports on the situation I can well understand why the honourable Member has tabled this question.
Commissioner, could you expand a little on your answer and tell me whether the Commission has made any specific proposal in this respect?
I would also like to know whether, within the existing political dialogue, the Commission is prepared to raise this issue of respect for the human rights of Saudi women.
In case I did not make myself clear, let me underline the fact that the Commission is exceptionally concerned by particular cases of the abuse of human rights, including the situation affecting women.
I referred to, for example, the special report by Amnesty International.
