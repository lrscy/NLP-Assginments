Tibet has been occupied for over 50 years.
Minorities such as the Uighurs and Mongolians are prevented from exercising their rights and are losing their cultural identity.
Fair hearings are denied.
The death penalty, which we have just debated, is handed out and is often carried out in public as a deterrent.
Sport cannot be divorced from politics.
Berlin in 1936 showed how the rally of the Jugend der Welt, with 100,000 spectators and a million people sitting in front of their radios and televisions, was subverted to the cause of propaganda.
The people's joy was genuine, the organisation was perfect, but this positive image was hijacked by the nazi regime in order to win recognition for the dictatorship.
The reaction to the boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow following the march of the Red Army on Afghanistan varied widely - and rightly so.
There was one common understanding, however.
Whenever international law is violated, it cannot just be business as usual.
In the case of China, our complaint in the PPE-DE Group is that for decades they have been destroying forests, polluting rivers and failing to control emissions to the point at which the whole ecosystem is on the brink of collapse.
Animal rights protestors are rightly horrified by the level of cruelty, which hardly anyone has been able to gauge fully.
Seven thousand bears are locked in harrowingly narrow cages in China and gall is constantly extracted from them, while they are still alive, in order to manufacture cosmetics and medicines.
For that there can be no excuse.
There are therefore a plethora of arguments as to why China should not host the Olympic Games.
Does anyone in this House really believe that anything will change in the next seven years?
The People's Republic of China is free to make a new bid and it will be a worthy host of the Olympic Games if it puts the right conditions in place, by ending human rights violations and paving the way for democracy and the rule of law.
Only once China has become a member of our community of values can the IOC say yes to such a bid next week or in the future in good conscience.
Mr President, it is about twelve years ago that on Tienanmen Square, the student protest and the call for democracy was quashed in a bloody fashion.
During that time, Commissioner Patten was very active in Hong Kong in another role, and well known for his commitment to human rights.
One could claim that ever since that period, in fact, the conservative trend in China has dominated, to the detriment of reformers, and that China is, in fact, still looking for a way out of the impasse in which it eventually ended up.
Historically speaking, one could say that those two trends are still present, of course, but over the past couple of years, a decision has been made to occupy the political centre very firmly via a central role of the Communist Party - a very classical, old-fashioned role, in fact - and to open up the economy in a powerful manner.
This creates enormous tension between the two trends, of course, which leads to enormous inequality in the country.
It is clear that China cannot continue in this vein.
In my opinion, and my group shares that view, we need a dual strategy: one of commitment, cooperation, talks and political involvement, for ultimately, they will need to take fresh steps at that Congress in 2002, which for them is a stepping stone towards a new generation.
They too will eventually need to adopt a different position in such a huge world nation which has the pretension of occupying a place on the world stage of the future and of playing a role there as well.
In the spirit of the Olympic Games, however, and given our position and values in Europe in terms of human rights, we cannot possibly support China' s application today.
That is why we, as a group, are also critical of China and support the criticism levelled at China.
I believe that commitment also means talking in clear and open terms.
That is why we are here: to talk openly.
That is why our group supports this resolution.
China is not the kingdom of darkness, but in terms of human rights, a great deal needs to be done before that country can qualify for the application to host the Olympic Games.
As Commissioner Patten is constantly being described as Chinese, I think it is high time to point out that he was governor of Hong Kong at the time.
Perhaps not everyone knows that, especially our guests.
I point this out so that they can understand the connections.
Mr President, on Friday next week there is a vote on who will be hosting the 2008 Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games are an opportunity for men and women from all around the world to come together to compete on equal terms, in a spirit of peace and cooperation between nations.
That is the theory, despite the fact that a large number of participating countries are brutal dictatorships which hold both democracy and human rights in contempt.
The Olympic Committee has a responsibility to promote the values which lie behind the Olympic Games.
We in the ELDR Group have demanded that the International Olympic Committee set up guidelines for the countries which are to organise the Olympic Games, guidelines which include respect for human rights and democratic principles.
One of the hottest tips for the Olympic Games is Beijing.
Beijing is the capital of one of the world' s most hardline dictatorships.
Persecution of those with opposing views, torture, censorship of the media and the Internet and more executions than all other countries put together are just a few examples of the way the Chinese regime tries to keep its population in check.
The occupation of Tibet and the oppression of its people continue, and religious minorities are not allowed to practise their religion.
For two years, there has been a systematic persecution of followers of the Falun Gong movement, with tens of thousands of followers being arrested and tortured, in some cases to death.
In recent days, 15 women in a Chinese labour camp were tortured to death, with the authorities saying that it was suicide.
Those who want Beijing to host the Olympic Games say that sport and politics should not be mixed.
However, that is exactly what the Chinese regime will do.
If Beijing were to host the Olympic Games, the propaganda value for the Chinese regime would be enormous, and it would reduce the pressure on the country to change its policy.
In a report on Beijing' s candidature for the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee writes the following: 'The overall presence of strong governmental control and support is healthy and should improve operational efficiency of the Games organisation.'
Calling the oppression 'healthy' is hair-raising.
Human rights activists of all kinds are united in their demand not to let China organise the Olympic Games.
A decision in favour of the Olympic Games in China is a breach of the whole Olympic ethos.
The ELDR Group would therefore like to appeal to all members of the International Olympic Committee to vote against Beijing on Friday.
Mr President, the Olympics are an event which celebrate man's beauty, which remind us of all that is most noble in the human character.
If we accept China's application to host the Olympic Games today, it would be like gilding the executions, the persecution of all political dissidents, the material and environmental destruction and the deportations which take place in China with the fine colours of the Olympic rings and all the flags. The result would certainly not be a reduction in these incidents; quite the contrary: it is more likely that the show of indifference on the part of the international community would encourage them.
This does not, of course, mean that we are happy with this situation.
We hope that the day will come when we will have the chance to be pleased, or rather to be enthusiastic about celebrating the Olympic Games in China, but that day has not yet come; it is still a long way in the future and we must be consistent in our actions.
Considering what my colleagues have said I feel that I can stop here, for this is another of those issues on which the whole of Parliament is in agreement.
I hope that our opinion will carry some weight.
Mr President, our resolution starts by quoting the Olympic Charter, which states that Olympianism has as a goal 'to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, with the object of creating a peaceful society' .
Lucio Manisco reminded us just now of the traffic in organs, and I remember we had to fight very hard in this Parliament to get that resolution through.
We were literally taken for madmen, for people who were inventing things.
Today, the direct evidence of doctors who participated in the operations is in all the papers, and nobody can deny the evidence any longer.
Nor can anybody deny the evidence of the executions, obviously, or the semantic changes: China now conjugates the verb 'to commit suicide' as a transitive verb.
Fifteen girls have committed suicide in the last few days in China, and hundreds of Falun Gong militants have committed suicide in the last few weeks and months. Nothing has changed in Tibet, and for the information of everyone hoping the year 2002 will see a new leadership in China, the favourite to succeed is none other than the former Chinese governor of Tibet, notorious for his policies of destruction and systematic incarceration.
I was very pleased to hear what Mr van den Berg and Thomas Mann had to say, and I think there are more than enough indications for it to be considered at least inappropriate, and I do say inappropriate, for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing.
Obviously, we all hope that it will rapidly become appropriate, and not just appropriate, but welcome, to hold the Olympic Games in Beijing, but there is still a long way to go, and I think, Commissioner Patten, that is also a result of this policy of critical dialogue which is increasingly becoming a policy of active complicity with the Beijing regime.
Mr President, if the huge sports festival of the Olympic Games is to be celebrated somewhere, then there has to be a cause for celebration.
That is not the case in China.
The human rights situation has not improved since the start of the political dialogue with the European Union.
Quite the contrary, in fact. The regime' s repression of political opponents carries on undiminished.
Dissidents often disappear behind bars for a ridiculously long period of time.
On a large scale, offenders are given the death penalty after a very brief trial.
The Chinese leaders are extremely frightened of the peaceful, religious movement, Falun Gong.
Followers of this movement are arrested, tortured, admitted to psychiatric hospitals or executed at random.
Recently, another 15 women were tortured to death in a labour camp.
Tibet is being systematically stripped of its own character.
The environmental and animal welfare situation is atrocious.
It is extremely naive to assume that large, international sports events and politics can be kept separate.
The history of the modern Olympic Games shows very clearly how the sports festival can be used to enhance the glory of a political regime.
The global media attention will only exacerbate this potential.
Especially states which could do with a complete make-over of their international reputation will seize the opportunity of setting a new Olympic record in exploiting this event politically.
The Chinese population will derive little pleasure from the Games.
The Games cost approximately USD 20 billion, and part of Beijing will need to be flattened and the inhabitants driven out of the city.
Economic ties between China and the world will also mean that liberal values and standards could enter the country.
That is why there is hope.
More welfare will ultimately lead to more political freedom.
The Chinese are a patient people.
In order to organise the Games, they have to practice patience and ensure that China has something to celebrate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to disagree with the majority in the House.
I could accept most of the points made by Thomas Mann and others.
I have voted and shall continue to vote in favour of all the resolutions tabled here on issues of human rights, religious persecution or on the Tibetan situation in China.
I feel, however, that this resolution is on the wrong track, because I am convinced that choosing Beijing as the venue for the Olympic Games will serve to support the reformist forces and that holding the Olympic Games could be a catalyst for major change.
I feel certain of this.
No one can accuse me of complicity and I shall continue to defend human rights in this House. I am certainly not a propagandist for the Chinese government.
It would be a mistake to isolate China and we must continue to level criticism at China in this House and in the appropriate international forums.
We cannot isolate a nation-state of 1.3 billion people.
I was against Chinese isolationism decades ago, when even the Chinese authorities wanted it and I am also against us attempting such a move.
Incidentally, the Cuban situation is a telling example of what can happen: the United States have maintained a stubborn embargo against Cuba for years.
They have achieved nothing and we see that the North American embargo is actually proving to be the main political prop shoring up Fidel Castro' s dictatorship in Cuba.
This is, therefore, the reason for my vote and the reason why my group does not support this resolution, because we feel that it is the wrong way to support progress on reform in China.
The decision on which country will stage the 2008 Olympics will be decided by the International Olympic Committee when it meets in Moscow on 13 July.
I have some knowledge of the way the International Olympic Committee does its work.
I appeared in front of it in 1990 in support of the magnificent bid by Manchester to host the Olympic games.
It was one of the examples in my life of tilting at windmills, but I know a little about how the IOC works.
The European Union, as a whole and the Commission do not take a position on whether the games should be held in China or elsewhere.
The decision is one for the International Olympic Committee, though I understand why honourable Members have such strong views on the subject.
I do not have to explain to Parliament that I share the concerns which have been expressed about the human rights situation in China - and I will return to that in a moment.
Just as I have always been doubtful about mixing the pursuit of trade objectives and the pursuit of human rights objectives, however, so I have doubts about mixing up sport and human rights.
My worry on both scores is that very often you do not achieve your objective, you simply muddle your objectives.
When I was the Governor of Hong Kong, much involved in the debate and the argument about human rights and democratisation, I still every year went to Washington to plead for China to have most-favoured-nation status and I certainly did not criticise the earlier bid by China to host the Olympic games.
I concede that at the margins, it can be helpful occasionally to take measures in regard to sport.
For example, one could not argue that taking those measures in relation to South Africa during the years of apartheid was anything other than helpful, largely because of the emphasis which the white community in South Africa placed on sporting links.
If you take the issue of the Olympics, while I accept that there are some horrendous examples of the Olympic spirit being abused - and one speaker mentioned the 1936 Olympics in which my late father-in-law ran - one should also take account of the Olympic Games in Seoul.
You would not find many democrats in Seoul who argued that holding the Olympic Games there had set back the pursuit of democracy and human rights, rather the reverse, so the argument is perhaps a little more complex than some honourable Members suggested.
While these are matters of rather subjective judgment, when I argue this case, I am not doing so out of - to borrow a phrase from the honourable Member - supine complicity.
I am doing so out of moderate, but not complete, conviction.
If Beijing is selected to host the games, it will require certainly both welcome and necessary steps on the part of the Chinese authorities if they are to have any chance at all of matching the outstanding performance as host, of Sydney last year.
For example, it would be inconceivable that a country hosting the Olympics would or could prevent both its citizens and its visitors from having access to the news on the Internet about the games themselves.
On a visit I paid to China a few weeks ago, an extremely interesting visit, it was curious that both the BBC and CNN Website were inaccessible.
I do not think that would be possible at the time of an Olympic Games.
I have spoken on many occasions to this Parliament about the European Union/China human rights dialogue.
I accept what the honourable Member said, that we have to be very careful that the dialogue actually produces some progress and it does not turn into, as he said, an act of complicity with the abuse of human rights.
Our dialogue with China is undoubtedly the most complex and multi-faceted dialogue on human rights which we have with any country, as befits discussions with a country in which so many abuses continue, alas, to occur.
The European Union is constantly seeking to work with China to make it more effective and to have more tangible impact on the human rights situation on the ground.
We are encouraging and supporting China in early ratification and implementation of the UN covenants and we continue to urge cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for human rights.
We welcome the Memorandum of Understanding, which China has signed with Mary Robinson, but we hope that they will now implement it.
Within this dialogue, we will continue to press for action in the areas of most concern to us, such as the repression of political dissidents, the suppression of religious freedom, the appalling and excessive use of the death penalty under the strike-hard campaign, the treatment of ethnic minorities, including those in Tibet, and the arbitrary detention conditions.
I also raised during my last visit to China, the reports of torture and ill-treatment of the followers of the Falun Gong movement and there are other issues which we must address.
There is increasing concern about the abuse of psychiatry in dealing with dissidents and members of religious groups in China.
I commend to the House's attention an article written recently in the Asian Wall Street Journal, which summarised the academic research of Robin Monroe, a very distinguished China-watcher, the author of probably the best book on Tiananmen, Black Hands of Beijing.
I recommend it to the House.
I share Parliament's concerns for the environment in Beijing and in China more widely and for the effects which preparation for the games could have on the city.
During my visit in May, I met some of the handful of genuine Chinese non-governmental organisations working on environmental issues.
I was left with the strong impression that China will find it impossible to meet the objectives it has set itself for environmental protection without the assistance of a civil society, which has mobilised itself voluntarily.
A relaxation of the rules governing the establishment and operation of genuine grassroots NGOs is essential, so as to harness the energy and commitment of a population of over a billion.
The same is true for any country or city which hosts the Olympic Games.
Sydney's success derived from the whole-hearted commitment of its citizens to hosting the games and making them a success in the eyes of the world.
Any country which hosts the Olympic Games will have a problem if it does not enlist the support of its citizens.
I do not believe that I am being naive.
I know the appalling problems that exist, but it seems to me at the very least inconceivable that any country like China, although there is no country really like China, but any country with the sort of authoritarian repressive government that China has, would find it impossible to host the Olympic Games without that having a considerable impact on the development of civil society within that country.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Mr President, I have great pleasure in commending the whole of this resolution to the House.
The recognition of the rights of children is of vital importance.
I am glad to be able to say that 25 years ago I published an article which, at least from a certain point of view, helped in pushing forward that case.
I do not want to talk about the whole motion for a resolution today, however.
I want to talk about one particular problem which is dealt with in the amendment by my group.
I am old enough to have children over the age of 25.
I see visitors in our gallery who are about the age of 25.
Like many people I can just imagine what it would be like to have a child ripped from your hands at the age of 20 days and never to see them again, be yourself in prison for five years under torture and cruel treatment, and then spend the rest of your life at liberty trying to find your lost child.
Sara MÃ©ndez from Uruguay was in this Parliament yesterday to press forward the case for recovering her child, or getting information about her son SÃ­mon, who was ripped from her arms aged 20 days after her illegal capture in Buenos Aires in 1976.
That is a dreadful thing to happen and we should add to this admirable motion for a resolution a clause calling upon those who are in authority in Uruguay to recognise the evil of disappearances, to recognise their bounden duty to bring children back to their parents and to end this scandal and disgrace.
I hope we will carry the motion for a resolution and make that point.
Mr President, ten years after the first World Summit for Children, the UN has decided to take stock.
In September 2001, on the eve of the summit, our group is naturally tabling a resolution in witness of our commitment, as we have always done.
I remember a time when it was difficult to mention the word children in this House.
The Dutroux affair had to happen before budget lines could be freed up and a certain number of resolutions passed for our children.
We have therefore had some successes.
The latest is the reference to children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and some of us in this House, notably under the leadership of Mary Banotti, have won a few battles.
It is therefore important to restate our commitment and determination on the eve of this summit, and we must also dedicate ourselves even more firmly to the cause of children, not just in Europe, but throughout the world, because there are now 600 million children worldwide in families living on less than a dollar a day, facing the real evils of malnutrition, lack of education and lack of health provision. We must mobilise against those evils.
To that end, our resolution proposes providing an institutional context to serve children. First, the various decisions we take should be subject to assessment of their impact on policy on children and family policy, secondly, the Commission should have a unit to deal with children' s issues and, thirdly, a special envoy should coordinate policies on children.
Finally, Mr President, we think it is important to be in a position to establish a European solidarity fund for the world' s children.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is pleased with this initiative and with the broad consensus that we were able to achieve on the compromise resolution, in which we saw our main concern included, as it was in our own draft resolution: a deep concern at the terrible situation seen in many armed conflicts and the cruel and barbaric use of great numbers of children who are recruited as soldiers at a very tender age.
Our censure of such behaviour is clearly voiced in the resolution.
I am also, however, going to table some amendments, for which I would request the House' s support, since it seems the resolution contains a loophole: there is no mention of the family and in any discussion of children, we must also consider the family.
When it comes to these resolutions, we always tend to be concerned about the most terrible situations of suffering and neglect, as I said earlier, involving children used in armed conflict, etc.
Generally, however, children live within a family environment and a policy for children must inevitably also be a policy for the family, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
As I am fond of saying, a world fit for children must also be a world fit for the family.
I should also like to say that I was moved by Mr MacCormick' s words and that we shall be supporting his amendment.
Yesterday, at the compromise meeting, doubts were expressed as to whether or not we should include a specific case, but his words convinced me. They convinced me perhaps because in Portugal too, the issue of children disappearing and of the terrible suffering endured by the families - and some cases in Portugal have been dragging on for years - is also an issue which is of constant concern to us, given the impotence of the State and of police forces.
These cases involve terrible, heartrending pain, which is also worthy of comment by this House.
Mr President, this week - as other honourable Members have mentioned - Sara Mendez was here in the European Parliament.
It is sometimes good in a wide-ranging resolution and in a broad framework to zoom in for a moment on something very concrete.
Someone who over 24 years after the event is still searching for her son Simon.
The military in her country took life in absolute freedom away from her, but they themselves still enjoy that freedom.
I believe that it is right - and I appreciate the fact that our President, Mrs Fontaine, also lent her support - that we should support her, because it makes something clear about who these people are.
Because if we eventually see the day when in the pandemonium of lawlessness the international rule of law prevails, it will be because of such brave individuals who have persevered for so long.
That is why I hope that we, standing above the parties and quite apart from arguments with each other, will shortly support the amendments made on that point.
A second point on the optional protocol.
I should like to ask the Commissioner something about this.
So 29 countries have signed up to it.
That includes all fifteen European Member States.
The protocol provides for children in armed conflicts to be as it were kept out of the sphere of child exploitation and child soldiery.
Only four countries have ratified it.
At least ten are required for it to come into force.
So there is a great need on our part to say: exert pressure in the Council too, on the various organisations in Europe and on the countries to get them to sign, so that we can achieve a success.
In conclusion I should like to say that I differ on one point from the honourable Members of the People' s Party.
Not on the content of their amendments on the family.
I very much appreciate them.
There is no disagreement between us on that.
However, in the context of the rights of the child we felt that the treatment of the subject deserves separate attention and as such does not belong here.
We shall not vote against.
We shall abstain, because we have no substantive objections to the texts you have submitted.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the expectations of the Belgian Presidency are rightly high, and with regard to the enforcement of respect for human rights the Belgian Presidency can certainly play a notable role.
The same applies to the determining of a common EU position on the occasion of the extraordinary session on children' s rights at the United Nations.
It would be generally appreciated if the Belgian Presidency were to succeed in getting the European Union to speak with one voice.
It can build on the efforts already made by the Swedish Presidency to decide on a common strategy.
As far as content is concerned there should be especial emphasis on the fact that as regards free access to education for all children and guaranteed health care provision, binding agreements should be made.
The European Parliament should pay extra attention to the situation of children in the candidate-Member States, specifically Bulgaria and Romania.
For that matter it could be decisive if the European Parliament were to take the initiative of inserting the dimension of the rights of the child into the rights of human beings in general.
In addition I should like to urge the EU in bilateral exchanges between European Member States and third countries to focus attention systematically on the situation of children in the third countries.
This approach will undoubtedly bear fruit if pursued consistently.
Mr President, Commissioner, according to the International Labour Organisation, whether we like it or not, we are indirectly responsible for the fate of 250 million children aged 5 to 14 years.
They make carpets in Nepal and luxury shoes in Thailand, they work in the coffee and cocoa plantations in Africa, and all for export, for us to enjoy.
In Europe it takes more underhand forms: apprenticeships give rise to abuses of working time. Child models are used.
We have child sports stars to entertain us as we watch television. On top of that are the things no one can tolerate: sexual abuse which destroys whole lives, pornography and prostitution.
I think our position should therefore be implacable.
Forcing children to work restricts their intellectual, physical and psychological development, so I do not think it is any good continuing to have countries signing conventions to get rid of labels, knowing they are doing it as if they were buying a pair of shoes.
The minimum to be demanded at the Conference in September is every child' s right to education, every child' s right to leisure, and every child' s right to be informed of his or her rights.
We must secure that, at least.
If we do not do so, it will effectively mean that children' s rights are like a pair of shoes. When they are dirty and full of holes, they end up in the bin.
Mr President, Commissioner, first I would like to say how truly thrilled I was to hear that the Belgian Presidency has made the issue of children's rights part of its presidency programme.
I would like to congratulate them warmly.
We have great expectations of this presidency and we will be keeping a very steady eye on what is happening and on progress.
I would also agree with Mrs Hermange who rightly pointed out that, up to very recently, children could not even be mentioned in this House.
We were constantly told they were not part of the competence of the Treaties and our concerns for their welfare were beyond the reach of this Parliament.
Happily now we can discuss them.
As long as I have been here in Parliament we have observed the awful dangers that many children in the world live in: a litany of miseries which are listed in this resolution here today.
Not too far from here children are still viewed as disposable objects for international adoption, for example.
We should hang our heads in shame that we have more legislation on the books of the European Union relating to animal welfare than we have relating to the welfare of children.
And lest anyone should attack me on that, I would like to say that I support animal welfare legislation as well.
But the situation is shameful.
There has been a political push forward.
You will see in this resolution that we call, for example, for a dedicated unit in the Commission looking at children's rights, looking at legislation so that we can assess its impact on the children and also on the lives of their families.
It is with great pleasure that I commend this resolution to the House.
I am happy to be one of the sponsors of Sara MÃ©ndez and her lost child.
Through my work in Parliament I too have experienced the fact that so many children are deprived of the company and love of both their parents, very often due to selfishness and lack of understanding about the particular needs of children.
Mr President, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has so far been signed by 191 countries.
The purpose of the special session of the United Nations in New York in September must be not just to get this convention ratified but to ensure that all the countries then apply it.
One fundamental element is the fight against child labour.
All too often children are seen as an investment to secure the survival of the family.
The parents who, like their children, never received an education, are by definition the people who are living in poverty and debt.
Children who are exposed from an early age to the harshest physical demands lose not just their innocence and identity, they often lose their whole childhood.
I have seen children who will not survive beyond the age of 14.
According to estimates by UNICEF, 200 000 children a year are sold in order to work on plantations in west and central Africa.
Two million children in the world, mainly girls, are being exploited by pimps.
There is cause for hope, however.
I have seen positive examples on the ground in India and Nepal.
The Rugmark Foundation is helping children whose parents work in carpet factories to obtain educational qualifications.
This NGO was founded jointly by German development aid organisations and carpet manufacturers.
These rugs rightly carry a quality label stating that they have not been manufactured by children.
In the meantime, 10% of Indian exporters have successfully applied for a Rugmark licence.
It is a first step in the right direction.
It will only be successful in the long run, however, if consumers change their attitude and demand these products.
Another example which gives cause for hope comes from Brazil.
A pupil's wage has been introduced for 11 million children from the poorest families.
This special programme has been set up for ten years and children are being paid a total of EUR 850 million a year to go to school.
Examples such as the few which I have been able to cite should set a precedent throughout the world, for the sake of the children.
Religious freedom in Vietnam
Mr President, there is no freedom of religion in Vietnam.
The resolution before us emphasises this serious state of affairs, supporting freedom of religion for religious societies of Buddhists not recognised by the Vietnamese government.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Belder, if you will excuse me, I think that Mr Patten wanted to speak about the previous order of business.
However, Mr Patten, strictly speaking you are down to speak at the end of the debate.
Do you really wish to speak now?
I would just like to say that it is a pleasure to listen to the debate and to take part in it, not least since it was so ably moved by my friend Mr MacCormick.
It is an important debate as part of the preparatory process for the UN Special Session on Children.
The Commission, in coordination with Member States, firmly supports a rights-based approach founded on the Convention of the Rights of the Child.
Since 1992, for almost one decade now, all cooperation agreements between the European Union and third countries have incorporated a clause defining human rights as an essential element of the agreement.
This includes the rights of the child and respect for the core labour standards as set out in the eight ILO fundamental conventions.
The Commission strongly supports efforts by the international community to eliminate child labour across the world.
In this regard, the Commission particularly supports the work of the ILO which adopted a convention in 1999 banning the worst forms of child labour, some of which were referred to during the debate.
On 15 September 2000, the Commission underlined its support for the ILO's efforts against child labour by adopting a recommendation to the Member States to ratify this new convention.
While there is no specific Community competence in children's matters, the European Commission recognises children as a particularly vulnerable group within the overarching policy focus on poverty and vulnerability, and the concerns about children as well as about human rights and gender issues are an integral part of our development policy objective of poverty eradication, especially in social sectors such as education and health.
Whereas there is no explicit focus on children in development cooperation, ECHO has made children a priority for our humanitarian assistance this year.
Promotion of the rights of the child is also a high priority for funding under the European initiative for democracy and human rights where the promotion of the rights of the child was chosen as a priority theme for funding under the budget this year.
As a complement to the European Union's intervention in international fora such as the UN, the Commission offers substantial support to projects designed to address the plight of children affected by conflict, and there were several references to that problem.
Since the beginning of 2000, more than EUR 40 million have been spent on projects providing assistance and protection to children affected by armed conflict.
The Commission is therefore active in supporting children's rights both at the political level and through practical initiatives.
I am grateful for your indulgence, President, but this seemed to me to be a sufficiently important subject on which to make those remarks.
You were quite right, Mr Patten.
We shall now continue with religious freedom in Vietnam, and the presidency of this sitting would like to apologise wholeheartedly for having to cut Mr Belder off.
We shall now listen to Mr Belder, the author of the question, for two and a half minutes with increased interest.
Mr President, it was worth waiting a moment for the contribution of Commissioner Patten.
There is no freedom of religion in Vietnam.
The resolution before us emphasises this serious state of affairs, supporting freedom of religion for religious societies of Buddhists, Roman Catholics and Protestants not recognised by the Vietnamese government.
Societies of these three denominations that are recognised by the state are reminiscent of the traditional Communist pattern: they are monitored by the Vietnamese authorities.
A second proof that Vietnamese citizens have no freedom of religion.
This unconstitutional situation issues directly from the nature of the country' s political constellation.
Obviously the Communist rulers of Vietnam are as terrified as ever of any free association and opinion.
That applies even more if this takes place on the basis of definite religious views.
Even today the Vietnamese government indoctrinates its citizens with pure antireligious ideas.
Within this general, restrictive social context the Protestants of the Central Highlands in the south of Vietnam occupy a special place.
They are exposed to double social discrimination, or worse still, persecution.
As members of various ethnic minorities they are literally the doormats of the 'kinh' , the so-called true Vietnamese, who consider themselves superior.
In addition for the past 15 years a Vietnamese government-encouraged mass exodus of 'kinh' into the fertile lands of the Central Highlands migration has simply amounted and amounts to common or garden theft of land.
Those 'Non-kinh' and 'backward' Christians must simply accept this violation of their rights.
Vietnam wants to be a player in the international field.
See its participation in the ASEM process.
It is therefore perfectly reasonable for the Council and the Commission should take Hanoi seriously to task about the desperate lack of freedom of religion in its own country.
I therefore emphatically call on them to do so.
It is not good enough to embed freedom of religion in the constitution and to practise the opposite.
Surely the era of Stalin and his like must at last be over.
Mr President, for many people, Vietnam would appear to be a long way away.
But here, for example, sits Mr Mayer, who represents Lower Bavaria, one of the most upwardly mobile regions at the heart of Europe.
One might even say that Lower Bavaria borders on Vietnam, because if you go from Lower Bavaria across the Czech border to Bohemia, you will see huge Vietnamese markets, with all that this implies in the border area.
This shows how many waves of refugees have left Vietnam for central Europe and Europe as a whole over the last thirty years and it shows how small the world has become and how closely everything hangs together.
During the last plenary session, Mr Modrow of the Social Democrat Party spoke about the huge crimes committed in Asia in the twentieth century by Germany, the USA and Japan.
He apparently completely forgot, however, that the worst crimes in Asia in the twentieth century were committed by Communists, namely the Khmer Rouge, namely Stalin and Lenin in the east of the Soviet Union, in China and, last but not least, in Vietnam, where people were persecuted for decades after the horrific Vietnam War and still are persecuted.
Vietnam is a Communist country in which religious freedom continues to be trampled underfoot.
We are in favour of contacts with Vietnam and we are in favour of economic contact with south-east Asia.
We take the view, however, that the only basis for economic collaboration is the rule of law and democracy.
Neither the rule of law nor democracy exist in Vietnam.
We must give massive support to the process of reform in Vietnam, which is still in its infancy, by saying quite categorically that freedom of religion and conscience, freedom for the Buddhists, Catholics and Protestants who are brutally persecuted and imprisoned there, is our yardstick for collaboration with this country.
Only when religious freedom is granted and only when these standards are applied can Vietnam become a partner for us.
First of all, I would like to say that this is not anti-communism.
It would be good if communism could co-exist with religious beliefs, and people should have the right to express their religious beliefs if they live in a communist country.
It is quite clear that in Vietnam that is not the situation.
In the resolution, reference is made to two very old Buddhist monks who spent two decades in detention under house arrest for their peaceful support for human rights, democracy and religious freedom.
This is completely unacceptable.
The problem in Vietnam is also that domestic human rights monitoring is not allowed, and that independent human rights monitors continue to be prevented from visiting the country.
We have to put pressure on Vietnam to release all prisoners who are being imprisoned or detained for peacefully expressing their religious and political beliefs.
We should also ask the Vietnamese to stop harassment of prisoners and surveillance of prisoners who have actually been released.
Furthermore, they need to look at their criminal code sections on crimes against national security to ensure that these laws cannot be applied against those merely exercising their right to freedom of expression, as well as at the administrative detention directive which allows for the detaining of individuals for up to two years.
This is completely unacceptable.
One of the things I am disappointed with is that there was no reference to the recent decision of the Vietnam National Assembly backing the concept of a dam in the northern province, which might become Southeast Asia's largest hydro-power project, possibly involving the relocation of more than 100 000 people.
I wish that they would take into consideration the international aspects of this in relation to the immense social and environmental problems that will be caused.
I think, Mrs McKenna, that our friend Mr Posselt is referring to communist regimes rather than to communists, which is somewhat different.
As some of you may know, I went on a short trip to Vietnam recently.
I accompanied the Most Venerable Quang Do, the number two in the Unified Buddhist Church, in order to enter Vietnam and take the patriarch back to Saigon, where he could, at last, receive the necessary medical care.
The patriarch was imprisoned for 20 years.
He was freed in 1997 and, despite being set free, he is still under 'administrative' detention and it is still impossible for him to travel freely and freely practice his religion.
Our mission was cut short because today, in the churches, in the Vietnamese pagodas, there are more police officers than monks.
During the day I spent in the pagoda, I myself saw two monks, I managed to see two monks and I saw at least ten police officers and then, when everything happened, I saw more police officers who were obviously plain clothes men appear from the road.
I say all this to describe the situation in Vietnam, a situation which is not confined to Saigon.
In dozens of other pagodas in the country, monks took to the road to accompany the Most Venerable Quang Do but were stopped, very often by louts who beat them up; in other cases, it was police officers who used force to take them back to their pagodas.
This is the reality of Vietnam today; it is the reality, once again, of a regime which describes itself as reforming but where there are no reforms to be seen, and I believe that, in this respect, this resolution is important.
It is also important because it calls on our delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, South-east Asia and the Republic of Korea to go to Vietnam and make a clear assessment of the situation in the area of religious freedom.
I call on all our fellow Members to urge the Chair of the Delegation, Mr Nassauer, to make this trip in the next few days, in the coming weeks and not in the coming months.
This is urgent - the lives, freedom, at least a minimum of freedom for these people are at stake.
I would also like to ask the Commission and the Council to make representations to the Vietnamese authorities and remind them that there are examples of former communist countries, such as Poland and Hungary, where the communist classes understood the need to change.
They still exist as political forces today.
In other countries, these communist classes did not understand and were swept aside.
This is an important message which we must send to the Vietnamese authorities without delay.
South Africa
Mr President, in the context of the long-suffering continent of Africa and, in particular, for the whole subcontinent of southern Africa, the Republic of South Africa stands out as a crucial factor for political stability and for development.
Today, with even greater importance given the extremely serious crisis in which neighbouring Zimbabwe has become entangled.
The Republic of South Africa proves that there is a way forward for Africa, that there is an alternative to poverty, to underdevelopment, to war, despotism, corruption and poor governance.
We are, nevertheless, familiar with the problems affecting the Republic of South Africa, such as the extremely high incidence of AIDS, the very high level of unemployment, the poverty and the serious social inequalities, economic stagnation and the terrifying level of violent crime.
I must reiterate the genuinely tragic effects of violent crime suffered by the South African people, particularly women, as well as the communities of immigrants from Europe.
The Republic of South Africa will not be able to overcome the enormous challenges it faces without the support and the solidarity of the international community.
We are pleased to note that the European Union is playing an important role in this area, to the extent that is provides, together with its Member States, 70% of international aid.
The European Union' s cooperation with the Republic of South Africa has a projected budget for the period until 2006 of around PTE 180 billion, that is around EUR 9.02 billion, to which we can add an equal amount of funding from the EIB, the main aims being to combat poverty, to encourage economic and social development, to create jobs, to stimulate the private sector and to consolidate democracy and the rule of law.
It is nevertheless crucial that under this cooperation, new actions are planned and that measures already in place that have a direct impact in terms of fighting crime are improved, such as measures for providing the police with organisational and institutional support and support for the modernisation and improvement of the judicial system.
We hope that this ambitious cooperation programme, which must be implemented down to the very last euro, will prove decisive in helping the Republic of South Africa to overcome the serious problems it faces.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of the 1980s, almost all, if not all of us, excitedly and emotionally watched South Africa' s transition unfold.
We all remember the exemplary way in which President Nelson Mandela led the process, and his choice was not accidental.
South Africa' s transition was acknowledged by the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to the two presidents: the last president of the apartheid era and President Nelson Mandela, that great African statesman.
Recently, however, we have seen an increasingly critical situation, particularly with regard to crime.
This is a very serious issue, which is of great concern to the Portuguese citizens resident in that country.
In the last four years, 400 Portuguese citizens have been murdered, and this year alone, 14 Portuguese and therefore European citizens have been killed, which is causing turmoil in the Portuguese community in South Africa and in Portugal.
The turmoil generated by these events often obstructs the matter from being debated calmly.
The intervention of the European Union can, therefore, be extremely useful in helping South Africa to address this problem, because the social and economic crisis underlying crime, as well as the increase in crime are issues that are crucial to consolidating South Africa' s progress on a path that has already impressed us. The alternative, which would be very sad, would ruin an experiment that we all hope will succeed.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is often said that history repeats itself and, with regard to South Africa, this seems to be happening.
We all know what this country has been through.
It has emerged from years of social segregation and apartheid which have left permanent marks.
Today, the crime and problems in this country are related, above all, to the years of social deprivation and segregation it suffered.
Yet today this country is preparing to host the World Conference Against Racism.
Today, Nelson Mandela is fighting anti-white racism.
Today, despite everything, this country has just won a decisive victory over the pharmaceutical industry which had decided not to provide it with any medicines: in any case, the South African people does not have access to tritherapy or AZT, medicines now capable of saving its population.
Now it is my turn to repeat myself and to say that I will keep repeating this here: abolish the third world debt, enable men and women to live in dignity at last and assign this money to education and health, which are at the very basis of this country' s resurgence - this is what is important.
We have to stop beating about the bush and, at last, raise the real issues after years of apartheid.
Today, we have to fight social segregation, and the only way to do that is through the cancellation of the debts of third world countries and those of, among others, South Africa.
Mr President, as previous speakers have already said, we are gradually losing all hope of South Africa's becoming a stable factor in Africa.
The tremendous impoverishment of large sections of the population, which goes hand in glove with the massive spread of AIDS and with drug-dealing and racketeering, are real causes for concern.
Do we not realise that poverty and the need for survival are a crisis waiting to happen in Africa?
This is where the crisis prevention is needed that we have spoken of so frequently over recent weeks, this is where we need self-help development programmes for the black population, health protection, support for preventive health care and, most importantly, educational support, before it is too late.
All this was discussed at length.
We also discussed something else, namely no arms exports to countries where poverty may disturb social peace.
Unfortunately, the Council has not honoured the promise made in the European Parliament.
Sweden, together with Germany, Great Britain and Italy, supplies arms to the value of 43 billion in local currency.
All the intentions expressed here, namely conflict prevention programmes without arms exports, have been forgotten by the Swedish government.
That is not all.
The whole thing was set up by bribing the South African government.
That shows that our code of conduct for arms exports is still full of holes and that we still cannot use it as an instrument for real conflict prevention.
We need to work on this.
We need clear criteria and transparent mechanisms so that this cannot happen again.
Mr President, the document we are about to adopt contains, in my opinion, points that might seem contradictory.
We reiterate our support for the government of South Africa but, at the same time, we ask it to make greater efforts in a number of areas, such as improving the living standards of the black population, reducing inequalities, creating employment, respecting minorities, fighting crime, and preventing and treating AIDS.
By putting pressure on the South African authorities in this way, we are on the one hand covering up the responsibility which many of our countries and the so-called 'western world' should be assuming for the colossal injustice that the South Africans had to start from in the democratic reconstruction of their society.
On the other hand, it seems that we are giving the message that those who are in power there are not doing everything they can to put an end to the problems we are pointing out, and that conclusion would be another injustice on our part.
These are the priorities of the Pretoria government, and trying to overcome these problems is what makes that country an acceptable model for the whole of southern Africa.
I believe it is vital to emphasise that we understand the effort that South Africa is making, often in a courageous and innovative manner, with significant victories such as the one it has just gained in the matter of AIDS, for instance, against the great pharmaceutical industry.
Furthermore, however, I should like to remind you that I was the rapporteur last year when we debated the trade, development and cooperation agreement with South Africa, and I do not remember from this debate that the European Union was over-generous with our contribution to increasing the South African government' s ability to overcome all these major challenges.
Now we are the ones who are demanding that they should be more effective.
Of course, we must remain vigilant, but without forgetting the serious difficulties that South Africa is facing, and of course we must turn our concerns into supportive cooperation to give the South Africans a better chance to achieve their objectives, which, moreover, coincide with our own demands.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is fashionable these days to be pessimistic about Africa, sometimes on the basis of rash generalisations.
In an ocean of instability, however, of never-ending wars and conflicts, such as in the long-suffering Angola, one regional power could guarantee a degree of order and peace in southern Africa - the Republic of South Africa.
A real political miracle has taken place there, which is firmly ingrained in our minds: the country moved from apartheid to democracy.
South Africa made a peaceful choice for democracy and thereby put an end to decades of racial oppression.
Nevertheless, South Africa still faces serious problems that have been described here today, from violent crime, into which the country is threatening to sink, and into which it could very well sink, to the terrible disease of AIDS.
The changes in South Africa have given rise to great hope, however.
The wisdom and the prestige of Nelson Mandela gave South Africa enormous authority in the world.
His political successors now have great responsibilities to history and to the heritage of values bequeathed to them by Nelson Mandela.
South Africa can only be a power that has a positive influence on the destinies of its region and of the world if it avoids sliding into racial or ethnic conflict.
The immigrant communities are living in fear and anxiety.
The Portuguese community, one of the largest and most affected by the violence, has already been brave enough to demonstrate on the streets and demand protective measures.
We must support South Africa, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and help it, without adopting a paternalistic attitude, to develop and to combat a lack of safety, conflict, violent death and murder.
A drift towards violence would be a tragedy not only for South Africa but also for Europe and for the whole world.
Amongst the many resolutions adopted by this Parliament, this is one of the most important and topical.
The Portuguese and other European citizens living in South Africa will then feel that Europe is not abandoning them to their fate and will keep the flame of hope alight. Most effective in achieving the remainder of what needs to be done, however, will be the diplomacy of the Commission and the Member States.
I would remind you of the words of the great French philosopher, Montaigne, who said: 'Every man contains within him the entire form of the human condition' .
To a certain extent, it is the human condition that is at stake in that great country.
Belarus
Mr President, these are tense times for President Lukashenko.
In just over two months' time presidential elections will be taking place in his country, White Russia.
Not without reason the power-hungry White Russian head of state is rather concerned about the outcome.
For example, will the opposition succeed in uniting behind one candidate?
Will it, moreover, be able to develop a strategy for cooperation with the growing number of critics in the Lukashenko camp?
In addition the neutral attitude of his Russian counterpart Putin must be uncomfortable.
What is more, recent opinion polls cannot be reassuring either.
Finally, the grave accusations of two senior magistrates of the White Russian Public Prosecutor' s Office, place the president himself, together with the country' s present Attorney General, in a very unflattering light: it is alleged that on their orders specially formed death squads liquidated no less than 30 citizens in the period 1998-2000.
These include prominent missing persons such as the former White Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Zacharenko, the opposition politician Gontshar and the White Russian television reporter Sawadski.
In order to secure his reelection above everything else the autocrat in Minsk eschews no means of neutralising his political rivals - 'depicted' in the state media as enemies of the people and criminals - in advance.
No wonder that over half the population state in opinion polls that they do not expect fair and free presidential elections on 9 September.
Once again, an understandable attitude. Because President Lukashenko is trying to frustrate all efforts in that direction - specifically a network of local, officially registered observers, actively supported by the OSCE mission in Minsk.
In this connection see particularly the presidential decree of 12 March, approved by parliament on 7 June.
In view of the influence on developments that Moscow can exert on developments in Minsk, participation of Russian monitors in an OSCE mission to observe the presidential elections of 9 September would be advisable.
I should like to know whether Commissioner Patten is able and willing to take initiatives in this direction.
I would like to address Commissioner Patten and, in particular, ask him and everyone else to note point 7 of the resolution on Belarus.
In this point, the European Parliament "calls on the Russian government and President Putin to support, within the political union between Russia and Belarus, a democratic multi-party system and pluralistic development in Belarus" .
There is a way to influence Belarus via Russia.
The political union which exists between these two states should be exploited to the full by the European Union.
We have great faith in Commissioner Patten and would like him, in all contexts, to bear this in mind within the framework of the Union.
Let me finally say that, in the parliamentary elections in Belarus in October 2000, a quarter of the candidates refused to stand.
This shows what kind of regime we are dealing with.
Mr President, first of all I should like to mention that two years ago the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy asked me to produce a report on the relations of the European Union with Belarus, and I confess that I should very much like to be able to finish it as soon as possible and in a positive fashion.
My visits to Belarus on several occasions have left me with a pessimistic, hopeless image.
It is an authoritarian, personality-centred regime, in which the opposition has no chance to express itself.
The opposition ranges from democratic communists to Christian democrats via social democrats, within a framework of a lack of freedom, as I have said repeatedly.
The constant violation of human rights is also very worrying.
I therefore think that the European Commission, the European Union, the Council, Parliament, all have to give a clear signal, together with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, for the Belarus government to adopt democratic rules and give some hope to its people.
Mr President, yet again I must concur with the previous speakers: our future neighbour Belarus is still a long way from being a democracy and democracy is now the only basis on which we can live together in Europe.
It is with concern that we must concede that even the four basic conditions which we set for preparations for the presidential elections have not been met.
The opposition is still being persecuted and criminalised.
It still has no free or fair access to the media, especially state television.
Disappearances are still not explained, especially the fate of Mr Kontscha and the Russian cameraman Mr Zawadski, for whom journalists are now holding a commemorative week.
However, today, I should like to highlight the case of Professor Bandaschewski, who has tried for years to enlighten the people in the areas contaminated by Chernobyl.
Because he told the truth and because he opposed people moving back into these areas, he has now ended up in prison serving an eight-year sentence.
Can you imagine?
It is intolerable.
Belarus still represents a challenge for European diplomacy.
We must be critical where criticism is needed but we must also provide support where we can.
Belarus is of strategic importance to the EU, which is why we must do everything we can to ensure that democracy is restored there.
Mr President, when we talk of Belarus, we are talking about more than just the situation in an albeit important country.
We are talking about the future of the whole of Eastern Europe.
The Pope was recently in Ukraine and voices were raised both for and against him.
Not between denominations, however, as everyone would have us believe, because pro-Europeans of all denominations welcomed his visit. It was the anti-Europeans who criticised him.
The Russian patriarch Alexei travelled to Belarus, not to criticise the repression of human rights and religious freedom there, but to campaign - with the support of the state - for the restoration of the single state of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
This shows that we are talking about an important political force here, which is why it is important to support the freedom of the people of Belarus and ensure that democracy and the rule of law are established there.
Now that Milosevic has been toppled, the last real Communist dictatorship in Europe is the regime in Belarus.
It is most important to ensure, and here my support goes above all to Mrs Schroedter, who has done a great deal of work here, that prisoners of conscience are released, that political prisoners are released, that the opposition is at last given a fair chance and that free elections can at last be held in Belarus, so that this country can return to where it has belonged since the beginning of its history, namely in the community of Europeans.
Situation of refugees from Burundi in Tanzania
Mr President, Hutus of Bantu origin form the majority tribe in Burundi with a population of 6 million.
The Tutsis of Nilotic origin are the minority tribe, but they dominate the government and the army.
Such tribal polarisation as we often see in Africa has been a major factor in the internal conflict, not only in Burundi but in neighbouring states.
In 1993 Burundi's Hutu President was assassinated and within a month over 100,000 civilians were killed.
A further 150,000 civilians have been killed since then.
More than half a million are refugees in Tanzania's refugee camps to this day.
The Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced similar conflict and almost 2 million civilians have been killed there or are missing over the last two to three years.
In the Horn, East and Central Africa covering 12 countries, there are 20 million displaced persons, displaced from their homes and their villages.
These people were poor before. They are even poorer today.
They have no education, no access to health care, no employment and no shelter.
They depend totally on the World Food Programme for their food and they fear those who run the refugee camps where they live.
It is not surprising, therefore, that these refugee camps are breeding grounds for disease, discontent and disorder.
Young men and women are lured by the warlords to join their unruly gangs.
These innocent and desperate people, who were ordinary civilians before, probably farmers, are easily persuaded to train and be armed to support the greed and power struggle of the warlords.
The Lusaka and Arusha peace accords have failed to end the violence and internal conflict.
Repatriation of refugees is not satisfactory as the people are simply afraid to return to villages devastated, overrun and terrorised by the terrorists or the warlords.
How can we allow these displaced millions, these desperate refugees, to live in their camps as beggars for life.
How can we extinguish the fires of conflict and civil war in these developing countries?
Containers full of medicines, tents, food, blankets and other such things bring temporary relief, but this is not enough.
We must be more active and rethink our strategy.
We must first of all give the poor a stake in their rural economies so that they may own their own land and have an opportunity to build their lives.
Secondly, we must give them the appropriate technology - third world technology - which they can then use to start local enterprises to break this cycle of dependency on us.
We must rethink our strategy and reassess the quality of people that we have in place as our ambassadors and representatives, their experience, and see how we can perhaps use local experts with international reputation and competence to advise us, to act on our behalf, to use the limited resources that we have to its best effectiveness.
We must embark on this with great urgency.
I have great confidence in Commissioner Patten to lead this, and Commissioner Nielson, and I hope that they will get together and make sure that the EU's next decade is much better than the last 40 years, a period in which, I consider, much time and resources were wasted.
Firstly, on Vietnam, may I say that I share the concerns of honourable Members about the human rights situation and, in particular, about recent developments in that country.
These appear to suggest that the progress which has been achieved by the Vietnamese government, both politically and economically, since the 1992 Constitution was adopted may be slowing down or even going into reverse, particularly where political freedoms are concerned.
The European Union's policy toward Vietnam, as it is towards all countries, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation and to raise concerns both publicly and in private where abuses or a deterioration in the situation is observed.
In Vietnam, permitting freedom of opinion and freedom of religion are of paramount importance to the European Union.
The Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of belief and religion, and in recent years the state has developed more cooperative arrangements with the Catholic Church.
However, the Constitution also specifies that it is forbidden to violate freedom of belief or religion or to take advantage of it to act against the laws or the policies of the state.
This provision obviously reflects the desire of the Vietnamese authorities to try to control the pace of change and to maintain their grip on society during the transition process.
It is also plainly a restriction on freedom of opinion, and the press law is similarly restricted.
The cases mentioned in today's debate seem to me to be more concerned with freedom of opinion than with freedom of religion, a freedom which of course the European Union holds to be equally important.
Father Ly has called publicly for the United States not to ratify its bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, linking this action to human rights issues.
Similar calls have reportedly been made by members of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.
These calls are clearly contrary to the government's policy and difficult for them to tolerate in a society unaccustomed to public dissent.
What is needed in Vietnam is continued progress in the country's reform programme so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and to appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government.
We will continue to support progress and to take every opportunity to draw attention to the fundamental importance of freedom of opinion.
The first article of the EC-Vietnam Cooperation Agreement which we signed with the government of Vietnam in 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis for our cooperation.
We will shortly be holding in Hanoi a meeting of the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission at which all aspects of our relations will be reviewed including our shared commitment to respect for human rights.
In the meantime, the Commission delegation participates with the Member States represented in Hanoi in all EU dÃ©marches to the government of Vietnam on human rights issues, as well as in the regular discussions on human rights which the EU missions pursue with the Vietnamese authorities.
I can assure Parliament that in this process, we will continue to raise particular issues of concern and individual cases, and will continue to encourage action to address human rights abuses in Vietnam.
I will make those points when I am in Vietnam myself later this month.
I would have referred specifically to a point raised by Mr Dupuis, but since he is not here, I will pass on.
The second subject that I would like to deal with is South Africa.
The Commission shares the European Parliament's view that South Africa/EU cooperation should seek to redress the existing inequalities inherited from the apartheid era and to work to improve the living conditions of the population with programmes targeting employment, health, education and housing.
That is what our European programme for reconstruction and development is about.
We strongly share the European Parliament's concern that there is an urgent need to combat the HIV/AIDS problem in South Africa and I am sure - as I said this morning during the debate on the forthcoming G8 Summit - that will be one of the subjects which is discussed then in Genoa.
The Commission also agrees that there is a need for a climate of greater security in South Africa as a prerequisite for a peaceful society and for economic development.
We fear that the crime situation is not only a threat to the inhabitants of the country and to its social fabric, but also threatens South Africa's reputation abroad, discourages foreign investment and has a detrimental effect on the economy as a whole.
As the House knows, the priority areas under our current multiannual indicative programme for the years 2000-2002 are poverty alleviation through the provision of basic social services, private sector support and the consolidation of the rule of law and promotion of human rights.
The Commission has funded two programmes to support the South African police force.
The most recent one is currently being implemented.
While it is true that last year saw no new projects or programmes in the health sector, the public health sector support programme 2000, which was agreed in 1999, became operational during the course of the last year.
Programmes under consideration for funding in 2001 include a major health programme on primary health care, and that will also cover HIV/AIDS in selected provinces.
Preparations for the programming of the next multiannual indicative programme are about to start and they will take place in the course of the next year.
In this programming phase the Commission will give very proper consideration to the concerns and interests expressed by the European Parliament.
I now turn to Belarus.
I want to say how important it is for Parliament to discuss this subject and I very much take the point raised by a number of honourable Members about the importance of raising our concerns on Belarus with the Russian Federation.
That is something we have done, are doing and will continue to do.
I welcome this timely debate.
I congratulate honourable Members on highlighting the extremely worrying situation in Belarus.
The Commission shares the deep concerns contained in the resolutions that are before us today.
I join Parliament in calling on President Lukashenka to reverse the present alarming trend towards increased authoritarianism by decisive action to improve human rights, press freedom and democracy.
In the short term this means, in particular, ensuring free and fair elections and addressing the situation of missing opposition figures and political prisoners.
Improved cooperation with the OSCE will be a vital ingredient in this.
The presidential elections on 9 September will be the next test of the democratic credentials of the country and we are in close touch with the OSCE-ODIHR discussions over the desirability of an international election monitoring mission.
There are some - I emphasise 'some' - encouraging signs of greater unity among opposition parties.
However, all the indications are that the authorities will again fail the democratic test, just as the parliamentary elections last October fell disappointingly short of the conditions established by the OSCE.
The European Union has a clear position: as long as the present intolerable situation remains we cannot consider closer economic or political relations with Belarus.
Unless and until there are significant improvements, our financial assistance will remain limited to direct help to those involved in promoting civil society and democracy, and humanitarian assistance where it is needed.
The European Union has condemned the recent government decree on external funding for non-governmental organisations, and we are urgently seeking clarification on how it might affect our own assistance programmes.
Speaking personally, I would prefer to see our present limited assistance suspended, rather than have it subject to prior approval by the authorities.
Our restrictive policy on political dialogue has not prevented the European Union from repeatedly airing our deep concerns about prominent public figures who mysteriously disappear or who are imprisoned for political reasons.
Recently the European Union has raised the cases of the former interior minister Yury Zakharenko, the former head of the election committee, Viktor Gonchav, the businessman Anatoly Krasovsky and the photographer who was referred to in the debate, Dmitry Zavadsky.
It is disturbing that despite this pressure there has been no progress in these cases.
The debate today has highlighted a further case: the imprisonment of Professor Bandashevsky, following his work on the alarming social and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
European Union heads of mission in Belarus have recently undertaken a study into the impact of Chernobyl on public health.
The Commission is keen to discuss with Member States how the European Union should respond to these disturbing findings and on how we should react to Professor Bandashevsky's imprisonment, taking account of the strong views that are felt by honourable Members.
I have no hesitation at all in defending a fair, but tough, line on Belarus, but it is a pity that it is necessary.
Belarus is a country at the heart of Europe that has the potential to become an important political and economic partner for the Union, particularly following enlargement.
This is the positive message that we must continue to send to the people of Belarus.
In this way we can lend our support to those forces in society that are pressing for the reforms that are so necessary, the reforms that will one day assuredly arrive.
Finally, I refer to the important speech made by Mr Khanbhai, who raised a number of very important issues, triggered by the position of Burundian refugees in Tanzania.
The Commission is concerned about the lack of progress towards peace in Burundi.
How could we not be?
We are concerned about the continuation of violence against the civil population resulting from persistent clashes between the Burundian army and the rebels.
In the current circumstances a voluntary return of Burundian refugees in Tanzanian camps is not, frankly, likely and a forced repatriation is hardly advisable.
The continued and growing presence of a huge Burundian refugee population in Tanzania is causing tension between the two governments.
By the end of May there were approximately 523 000 refugees in camps in Western Tanzania, of whom over 383 000 were Burundians.
In particular, the Tanzanian government is accused of not preventing Burundian rebels from using refugee camps as bases for their attacks.
In reaction to recent allegations by the Burundi government to this effect, Tanzania's President Mkapa suggested an immediate forced repatriation of all refugees, without taking into account the prevailing security situation in Burundi.
The government of Tanzania has since reassured the UNHCR that its policy towards the Burundian refugees is not in question, and it undertook to respect its earlier commitment to facilitate a gradual voluntary repatriation once the security conditions in Burundi permit.
For our part, the European Commission will contribute EUR 25 million towards the implementation of the UNHCR plan for voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees to be launched once the situation is favourable.
For now, the Commission is taking the necessary measures to assist the government of Tanzania to cope with the refugee population.
Through the humanitarian aid office, ECHO, the Commission is funding more than a third of the total humanitarian aid available to refugees in Tanzania.
Last year ECHO's budget for aid to Tanzanian refugees was nearly EUR 27 million.
This was increased to over EUR 32 million this year.
Mr Khanbhai also raised a number of important issues about the management of our assistance and development programmes and about our representation in Africa and in other parts of the world.
I look forward to future opportunities to discuss those matters with him and the whole House, not least in the context of the communication which we have just produced on our external services.
Thank you very much Commissioner.

Illegal exploitation of natural resources in Democratic Republic of Congo
The next item is the joint debate on five motions for resolutions:
B5-0485/2001 by Mrs Maes, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo;
B5-0492/2001 by Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the looting of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo;
B5-0502/2001 by Mr Van den Berg, Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco and Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo;
B5-0510/2001 by Mr Van den Bos and Mrs DybkjÃŠr, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo;
B5-0517/2001 by Mr Miranda, Mr Vinci and Mr Sylla, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to call special attention to a problem that forms part of a tidal wave of disaster engulfing a whole region, a million people.
The Democratic Republic of Congo is at this moment being ravaged by war.
A war that turns mainly on the considerable natural wealth of the country.
For years the land has been used and abused, a population has been sidelined for the sake of the lucrative exploitation of what nature has to offer.
War is an ideal situation for very lucrative deals, because there is seldom any control or accountability.
The example which most fires the imagination today is the extraction of and trade in coltan, a material without which none of us could communicate with such mobility and ease.
We pay ridiculously little for this material, while today the local population, for the first time in history, is facing serious famine.
The war that is currently raging permits not only so-called 'legal' exploitation of this type, but also much less covert forms of plunder.
In addition it is clear that the lucrative trade in uranium and nuclear waste almost exclusively benefits Western interests.
We could also ask questions about the role of Western embassies and their associated agencies.
I should particularly like to draw attention to one aspect of this long-drawn-out state of abuse.
For many years the European countries and the United States have extracted uranium, which was responsible for such horrors as Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
To make matters worse Western nuclear waste is dumped in the same region.
Radioactive waste from the 1960s and 1970s is still an unmistakable direct threat to the population.
Consequently it is encouraging that Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke ambitious words yesterday about tackling the situation in the region.
It must not stop at empty words.
The end of the cold war and the arms race means that the demand for the termination of the trade in uranium and nuclear waste is not an exaggerated one, but extremely reasonable, a demand that as it were flows naturally from the values to which Europe is pledged.
Mr President, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of access, control and trade in key mineral resources.
The wealth of the country is appealing to its greedy neighbours.
All six nations involved in this conflict share responsibility for their illegal actions, as must those in other countries who have helped this profiteering.
Is long-term regional instability a price worth paying for short-term theft?
Alongside plundering, looting and racketeering by foreign armies, criminal cartels see the DRC as a weak link.
The United National panel of experts warns: "These criminal cartels have ramifications and connections worldwide and they represent the next serious security problem in the region".
I would like to ask the Commissioner what the difference is between Milosevic ethnically cleansing his neighbours and African leaders looting and killing 2.5 million of their Congolese neighbours?
When can we see some of these leaders sitting in the dock in The Hague?
I see no difference between one sort of killing and another, expect that one is white and the other black.
When the final United Nations findings are published, the EU and the UN should respond by considering freezing financial assets of rebel movements and of the leaders of criminal cartels and foreign powers that do not withdraw.
We, in the centre right of Parliament, want firm action to prevent the DRC's destruction.
The irony is that the wealth stolen from the Congolese could provide the foundations for real long-term regional growth and stability.
This needs African leaders to lay down their guns, however.
With our historic connections with Africa - particularly during the Belgian Presidency - there is a real opportunity for something to be done very soon.
Mr President, the report of the panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural sources of energy is particularly brave.
Normally those reports are quite vague about names and surnames, but here the names of the various people responsible are listed.
In that respect too it is an extraordinarily useful report.
It makes it clear that not only government leaders in the region and of course a number of the 'war lords' in the areas involved but also a number of industries in Europe with export and import operations that are illegal, or at least involve the use of illegal material, share a great part of the responsibility.
The report is lucid and clear in its recommendations.
It is in fact the second such report after the Fowler diamond report.
It also gives us the opportunity to operate quite effectively as an international community.
Mr Verhofstadt said here earlier in the week that if we had this in Europe, it would be called a world war.
The number of people affected by this disaster is extremely high.
I believe that it is right - in terms of equal treatment and application of the right criteria - to use the same standards in the Congo as we use elsewhere.
We are capable of doing so, because we know a number of the companies.
We can get them round the table.
We know a number of the governments with whom we have links.
We can also exert heavy pressure on this point.
It is a complicated game.
That is clear.
Uganda, Rwanda, Congo, the new debate, the Lusaka agreements, the facilitation of a dialogue.
If we do not remove the source, however, the financing of the arms trade and armed conflict, will continue.
We can make everything dry up there.
I would consider it of extreme importance if the European Commission, in fact Mr Patten with his colleague Mr Solana, would think about ways of mounting specific operations in the context of the UN Security Council to exert sufficient pressure to bring it to a halt.
On that point one more comment for the Belgian Presidency.
When he was here this weekend, Mr Verhofstadt, together with Minister Reynders and others, very quickly released credits that had been blocked.
Now of course I understand that there is a need to get the parties around a table and get them moving.
At the same time, though, you must of course be careful.
Making loans available and not at the same time making firm demands and meanwhile allowing the illegal exploitation of natural resources, is not the most credible way of going about it.
I am in favour - and that is a lesson from the past and on that point we need not be outdone by the Americans - of being hard and clear.
In fact exactly what we have said in previous debates: deeply committed, but also hard and clear and making our demands, on our own industry, our own Member States and the six countries involved.
I hope - and expect - that you will support the Belgian Presidency in such a way that it will lead to some effectiveness on this point.
Mr President it is sad that Europe seems to be giving real political priority to Congo only now that Belgium is president.
The Balkans and the Middle East demand all our attention.
Does this not basically indicate that strategic and geographical considerations are ultimately more important to Europe than purely humanitarian ones?
For from the point of view of human misery there is every reason for the Union to concern itself intensively with Congo.
There are already one and a half million dead to mourn in the country.
Hundreds of thousands have become refugees and some 28 million people are being oppressed, plundered and violated under the military occupation.
A weak central authority is not capable of governing the huge country with its many natural resources.
Congo is extremely vulnerable to merciless neighbouring countries, which by military force are systematically robbing the country of its principal sources of income.
The population sees none of the proceeds.
It is difficult to state that the European Union has allowed Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi to go their shameless way and allows them to continue their occupation with development aid.
Angola, Zimbabwe and Zambia also participate without scruples in the violence in this country.
It is high time that clear conditions were imposed on these foreign profiteers.
Continuation of development aid will be possible only if all foreign troops leave the country.
Western companies involved in the illegal exploitation of Congolese riches should also be exposed. They are also contributing to the continuation of the war.
We may expect Kabila to finally initiate an inter-Congolese dialogue, and carry through the process of democratisation.
It is the task of the Belgian Presidency and the Commission to win over the European Union once and for all for the lamentable fate of the people of Congo.
The Commission is well aware of the information referred to in the proposals for a resolution submitted to Parliament and in the press concerning illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This information has been broadly confirmed by the Commission's interlocutors on the spot, including non-governmental organisations and in an interim report by the United Nations, to which a number of honourable Members referred.
The honourable Member referred to that report during a speech which made a powerful case for an international criminal court able to extend its remit around the world, not unlike the Tribunal at The Hague focused on the Balkans.
That report covers the illegal exploitation of the DRCs natural resources and other wealth.
It was presented to the Security Council by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on 14 April 2001 and it was the subject of a heated debate.
The Secretary-General decided to extend the mandate of the experts who compiled the report by three months, so that they could add to the research and the information already provided.
The report will be an important point of departure for the international community, which will have to take a position on it.
The profits to be made from coltan mining and other mining by the warring parties in Congo are bound to have an impact on the devastation in Kivu.
The region's decline began under President Mobutu and has a number of causes, one of the most significant being ethnic tensions.
The situation became much worse following the genocide in Rwanda and Rwanda's intervention in both the country's wars which were originally fought to secure external borders.
The international community is aware of the link between economic interests and the continuation of the war in Kivu.
The only lasting solution is nonetheless to advance the peace process and to build legitimate institutions able to regulate the exploitation of resources.
This is the objective supported by the Commission through its activity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
That is the context in which we envisaged the gradual resumption of aid in tandem with the implementation of the Lusaka agreement and the progress of the Congolese dialogue.
Honourable Members, and particularly Mr van den Berg, focused their arguments on the relationship between the illicit trade in some commodities and the conflict.
We know the problems that have been caused with diamonds elsewhere and the arms trade.
It is extremely important, where we can, to take initiatives and pursue them on both.
That is why we have been so active in working at the United Nations on small arms and we must make use of the Community's competences, when we can, and with the Member States deal effectively with the illicit diamond and with other illicit trades which have caused so much suffering and impoverishment in Africa in particular, but in other countries as well.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Earthquake in Peru
Mr President, the city of Arequipa will never be the same again.
The loss of human life that has happened there, the economic damage and also the irreparable destruction of the historical and monumental heritage of this most beautiful city have astounded us all.
Southern Peru is experiencing a tragic situation caused by the earthquake of 23 June, the devastating effects of which have left over a hundred dead, over a thousand injured, and have destroyed over ten thousand homes, leaving over 40 000 people homeless in the provinces of Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna.
The earthquake has also caused severe destruction in northern Chile and in Bolivia.
The economic damage has set these regions back by more than 20 years.
The scale of the disaster has affected infrastructure and economic development.
Some towns, villages, districts, settlements and roads have been destroyed by the earthquake.
Faced by such a disaster, the forces of international solidarity and especially European solidarity were swift to act.
The European Union humanitarian office mobilised in record time, and I should like to congratulate those responsible in the European Commission on their rapid intervention with a package of measures which, right from the first few hours, included food aid, temporary accommodation, supplies of products for purifying water and deliveries of medicines.
In this context I must also feel proud of the solidarity expressed by the Spanish government and people, who have contributed very generously.
At times like these we have to look to the future, and the reconstruction and rehabilitation plans must be coordinated quickly and effectively.
To these ends, a strategic communication should be drawn up covering all aspects of aid coordination and the reconstruction and rehabilitation plans that I have mentioned for the affected areas.
This sad human tragedy may be an occasion for Latin Americans to be more united and determined when facing their numerous difficulties, and also for them to deepen their ties and their process of regional integration with, perhaps, larger doses of solidarity.
Mr President, both the Commissioner, Mr Patten, and the Members of this House are well aware of the situation in Peru, and the last speaker, Mr Ojeda, has summed up the situation very well.
The starting point for Parliament' s resolution is, in effect, the Commission' s rapid action, and I should like to join in congratulating the Commission and particularly the Commissioner, Mr Patten, on this rapid action.
Nevertheless, the purpose of our resolution is to remind us that this initial aid is likely to be insufficient, given the extent of the disaster.
We have in fact just been visited by the new President-elect of Peru, Mr Alejandro Toledo, who has met members of Parliament and also the Commission and has told them of his needs.
We do not think this is the moment to adopt a resolution on Peru' s economic policy and, in this respect, we do not consider it prudent to support the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, since we believe it is a subject that requires rather more time for consideration.
Above all, we do not believe it is the right moment to tell the government of Peru how it should prepare its budget for 2002.
We do hope, however, that, regardless of the overall context of the resolution, the Commission will over the coming weeks and months consider the special situation of this country, which has been through quite a critical time from a constitutional and economic standpoint, and which now, after an impeccable electoral process, seems to have started on the road to recovery in democracy and with the confidence of the whole population.
We hope that, based on these views - I repeat, regardless of what happens here - the Commission will go ahead.
There is a subject to which the Commissioner, Mr Patten, is quite sensitive: the effectiveness of Community aid.
It seems that, in the past, the financial resources earmarked for the Latin American area have not been used fully effectively.
Since the start of his mandate, Mr Patten has been concerned with the effectiveness of the operations, and we should like to know whether at this moment (although it may still be premature) the aid that the Community sends is achieving its results, and also what measures he foresees for the development of future aid.
While aid is being granted, it is important that it should be monitored and that the Commission should inform us whether in effect this aid that we are approving, which is paid for with our taxpayers' money, is achieving positive results.
Apart from that, I repeat, I want to join in congratulating the Commission and the Commissioner, Mr Patten.
I hope that in this new stage Peru may find an important ally in the Commission and the European Union, and that the Commission may soon present to us proposals for aid for the recovery of Peru and aid for cooperation with the Andean Community, which, as we know, finds itself in difficulties, not only in Peru but also in other countries.
Mr President, I would like to make some additional remarks regarding the humanitarian resolution that we have signed.
It is indeed important to attempt, as a matter of urgency, to do something to address the damage caused by the terrible earthquake on 23 June this year.
The consequences of this earthquake have been described by the previous speakers.
I will not go over them again as we already know what they are.
I just want to point out that the quake reached 8.3 on the Richter scale.
That says it all.
Unfortunately, there is no Richter scale to gauge the extent of the institutional, economic, social and cultural devastation brought about by almost ten years of dictatorship under Alberto Fujimori and his henchman, Vladimiro Montesinos.
In a room in this Parliament not far from this one, only the day before yesterday, Alfredo Toledo, the future president of Peru, painted an uncompromising picture of the situation in his country.
He described institutions in ruin, an economy in dire straits.
He told us that he is going to start the task of rebuilding as soon as he has been sworn in, which should happen on 28 July, Peru' s national holiday.
In particular, he told us that he was against impunity for those responsible for this situation.
We therefore believe that Japan should be asked to extradite the former dictator Alberto Fujimori, and that he and his accomplice, Montesinos, should be tried in Peru itself.
We call for the 'Truth' commission, which was promised by the candidates, to be set up, for the committee to establish responsibilities and to carry out the purge that must follow of the armed forces, which colluded with the dictatorship. We also call for the return of the money stolen by the dictatorship from the Peruvian people, which totals 43 billion dollars, and which is probably tucked away in a European bank somewhere.
Lastly, our institutions should find out whether the money stolen from the Peruvian people is indeed in our banks.
As the House knows, a strong earthquake struck southern Peru on 23 June 2001.
Up-dated figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs indicate that almost 190 000 people were affected and some 35 000 homes damaged or destroyed.
Through its humanitarian aid office ECHO, the Commission reacted, and I am grateful for the generous remarks made by the honourable Member, Mr Medina.
The Commission reacted very promptly. A decision to allocate humanitarian aid amounting to EUR 1.15m was taken two days after the earthquake to help meet the first urgent needs of the victims.
This is the first time, in fact, that the Commission has made use of its new system for responding immediately to the sudden onset of humanitarian crises which came into operation less than two weeks ago.
Furthermore, five emergency humanitarian operations are already under way.
The Spanish Red Cross is distributing food aid and emergency relief items for 1 000 families to the tune of EUR 250 000.
Oxfam is spending EUR 200 000 on emergency water storage and distribution facilities and sanitation.
Save the Children Fund - EUR 300 000 on blankets and tents.
Medicos Del Mundo - EUR 100 000 on blankets, medicines, water tanks and plastic sheets for shelter.
The International Federation of the Red Cross - EUR 300 000 on shelter, food and support to the rescue efforts for health, water, sanitation and other relief supplies.
That is how our emergency relief is being spent and I think it is being spent in sensible ways.
According to information received from the field, the international response has been generous and the immediate needs seem to be covered.
Nevertheless, the Commission services continue to monitor the situation in case additional aid is required.
A debate on a resolution on the Peruvian earthquake is not perhaps the most appropriate framework to discuss the political situation in Peru, but I would nevertheless like to stress that we are extremely satisfied with the capacity shown by Peru and its transitional government to carry out transparent and clean elections after the political disasters described very effectively by the honourable Member in his maiden speech.
We shall look forward to hearing from him many times in the future.
It was a pretty vigorous maiden as maidens go!
The European Union Observation Mission for the elections was extremely positive.
Like honourable Members, I discussed the catastrophe and the European response on Tuesday with President Toledo during his visit to Parliament.
We want to congratulate the interim government and the people of Peru for the maturity shown in this situation and for the support and cooperation provided to our team in the field.
I was able to say to President Toledo when he was here with us that the approximately EUR 60m in programmes for the alleviation of poverty blocked by the conduct of the elections in 2000 will now be released.
We want to proceed with those projects as rapidly as possible.
I follow very much the point raised by Mr Medina, you want to get on with those projects as soon as possible and I know that poverty alleviation is one of the new President's priorities.
We also want to sit down with the new government to discuss programming our future assistance.
The President himself underlined his commitment to reforming the judiciary and making sure that there is in place a rule of law in the institutions to make that rule of law effective.
I feel that that is a very important way in which we can see the encouragement of more private investment in Peru and more confidence on the part of the international community.
We all express our condolences to those who have been affected by this terrible earthquake but at least it has given us the opportunity of expressing in this House once again our solidarity with democracy in Peru and our encouragement of the new Peruvian government.
Thank you very much indeed Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Results of the multiannual guidance programmes for fishing fleets
The next item is the report (A5-0188/2001) by Mr Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Annual Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the results of the multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets at the end of 1999 (COM(2000) 738 - C5-0107/2001 - 2001/2056(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries for the considerable interest and support elicited by my report on the multiannual guidance programmes for fishing fleets.
It shows that this is a very important report.
The multiannual guidance programmes proposed by the Commission make a lot of sense.
The overriding problem is that they are not being implemented in the Member States. Therefore, we never find out whether or not they would be a success.
It is quite simply unacceptable that they are not being implemented in their entirety.
According to the Commission, there are 7 or 8 Member States which do not comply with MAGPs.
If one adds to these the countries which do not have a fishing fleet at all, not many countries are left which comply with the common decisions.
We simply have too large a fleet fishing for too few fish in the EU.
There has only just recently been a ban on cod fishing in the North Sea, and this clearly shows that there are some very weak links in the chain when it comes to the ability of the common fisheries policy to secure sustainable fisheries.
European fishermen are entitled to a more stable fisheries and quota policy as a basis on which to organise their industry.
One of the most important tools for securing sustainable fisheries is simply to ensure that the size of the fishing fleet corresponds to the quantity of the fish that can be caught.
Technological progress entails a still greater need to reduce fishing fleets.
We are now, of course, in the unfortunate and regrettable position arising from the failure to renegotiate a fisheries agreement with Morocco.
The EU' s over-capacity when it comes to the fishing fleet is therefore a great weakness.
I look forward to the Commission' s using the new tools in the form of Articles 6 and 10 of the Council Regulation which of course enable the Commission to withhold aid for, respectively, fleet renewal and the modernisation of vessels.
It is naturally sad that the Member States do not have a greater incentive to implement those decisions which they themselves have been involved in taking on a joint basis and that some countries feel superior about the fact that they are to implement the guidance programmes, given that they are not exceeding the quotas.
I find that deeply regrettable.
One is almost tempted to propose introducing a system of rewards for those countries which comply with the common decisions and reduce their fishing fleets.
I am obliged to criticise the form taken by the Commission' s annual report, which is impossible to read unless one is an expert in the area.
The various figures are set out without any comments as to their reliability.
For that matter, they are included in the report in such a way that it is largely up to the reader to interpret the figures and make what he considers to be the correct interpretations.
In other words, the annual report is not easy to read and it provides absolutely no overview of the situation.
For example, there is no clearly set-out table to permit comparison of the individual Member States.
It is, unfortunately, a very poor point of departure for the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002.
The Commission therefore has a very great deal of work ahead of it, Commissioner, if a new and better guidance programme for the reduction of the fishing fleet is to be carried out and if this is to be implemented in all the Member States.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Busk, because he has done an excellent job.
Our group is going to support this report from the first line to the last.
I also thank him for the collaboration which we have had with him at all times in the work we have carried out.
The report echoes yet again the request by this Parliament that the European Commission should make an example of and apply truly dissuasive penalties to those Member States that repeatedly fail to comply with the fleet objectives they have been assigned, so as to avoid once and for all that the general objectives for the Community fleet should be forever jeopardised, despite the very high social and economic sacrifices made in some regions of the Member States that have traditionally complied.
This lack of compliance with the MAGPs has led the European Commission to present its proposal to extend MAGP IV until the end of 2002, unfortunately setting out a number of conditions which are absolutely unacceptable.
In a further attempt to adapt the fleet to the resources, the Commission has again forgotten that there are countries that have broadly complied with their objectives, and is presenting a global proposal which will punish everybody with the threat of new cuts in fleet size and the intention of withholding aid for the modernisation of the fleet.
As I have said so many times (the last time was right here, during the last part-session), the structural aid for modernisation is the only guarantee to maintain a competitive fleet and to ensure the best conditions for the quality of Community fisheries products and the quality of life and safety of our crews.
Far from understanding it in this way, the Commission shows it has completely lost touch with reality by persisting in suppressing such aid, and in real terms the new MAGP proposal literally says that it will suppress the article that allows fleets to seek modernisation, for safety reasons.
With the review of the common fisheries policy, the Commission talks a lot about listening to those involved and consulting the industry and the administrations.
Time and time again, they have all made it perfectly clear - and they are unanimous in this - that they consider the modernisation budget to be indispensable.
Because of all this, I ask the Commissioner to explain to me the reasoning behind this proposal
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the common fisheries policy has the difficult and, at times, thankless task of reconciling the interests of an activity as old as mankind with preserving fishery resources and marine ecosystems.
The continual erosion of fish populations will, in the long term, threaten the survival of European fishermen and the preservation of the species.
And without fish, it goes without saying, there can be no fishing.
It is therefore crucial, as Commissioner Fischler suggested, that we make a clear decision to accept short-term losses in order to achieve economic and environmental benefits in the long term.
The overcapacity of the Community fishing fleet, which marine scientists estimate to be 40%, a figure adopted in the March 2001 Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy, is one of the main causes of the excessive pressure that fishing exerts on fish stocks.
It must not be forgotten, however, that other activities apart from fishing, namely tourism and various forms of pollution, also contribute to the destruction of the marine environment.
For this reason, the multiannual programmes for reducing the fishing fleets are an important component of the measure that has been implemented in order to protect species that are being fished at dangerous levels.
The basic aim of these programmes, which are truly complex and hard to implement, is to achieve a balance between resources and catches, not to punish fishermen.
A permanent reduction of the fishing fleets is, of course, viewed with apprehension by fishermen and others in the industry.
The reduction must therefore be implemented rigorously and transparently and with fairness to all those concerned.
The results for 1999 are mediocre and disappointing and it is, therefore, worth emphasising the recommendations contained in Mr Busk' s report, calling on the Commission and the Member States to adopt clear and precise criteria for measuring the capacity of ships and fishing fleet categories so as to guarantee control of developments in the fishing fleets and the multiannual plan objectives.
Member States must have the courage to respect the limits that have been set.
Fishing must, increasingly, become an activity which is not predatory but rather one which is friendly to the sea and to marine life.
Mr President, once again we are seeing the same situation.
Several Member States are behind in their obligations to reduce their fleets and once again nothing is being done to improve matters.
The next report, by Mr Nicholson on cod in the Irish Sea, clearly shows the failure of the present approach to fleet management.
The Commission is proposing to extend the MAGP by one more year in order to debate fleet policy in the context of the Green Paper.
We support that. We think it is a good idea.
However, there needs to be a major rethink about fleet policy.
We would agree with the Commission that fleets are too large and must be reduced.
We also feel that the Council should wake up and join the real world, because it seems to think that this is unnecessary.
As a step in the right direction the Greens support the idea of penalties for those countries which are not observing their legally binding commitments to reduce fleets.
We must get serious about this problem and also look at the countries that are claiming to have met their obligations under the MAGP, to ensure that they are not transferring their vessels to other flags.
We must ensure that they are doing what the MAGP intends they do in the long run.
Mr President, the structure of the fishing fleet is determined by the socio-economic circumstances of a region, by the Total Allowed Catch (TAC) and the quota in combination with technical measures.
The multiannual guidance programme (MGP) has generally acted too much as an end in itself and too little as a means to an end in all this.
The end is to maintain fish stocks in a sustainable way.
If a Member State' s fleet keeps to its quota, it has met the principal objective.
Threatening to reduce the quota if the MGP targets are not met ignores that objective.
One then finds the odd situation that fleets that meet the MGP target but structurally overfish go unpunished, while fishing fleets that do not overfish are penalised because their engine capacity is too great.
On the latter point it was a considerable step forward that in 1999 account was taken for the first time of countries that regulate their fleet capacity through a days-at-sea scheme, in other words capacity limited by activity.
Unfortunately an end has not yet been put to the confusing number of units to denote fleet capacity such as gross registered ton, gross ton and kilowatt propulsion capacity.
It is an illustration of the lack of vision of fleet structure and the inflexibility of the Commission' s fisheries policy that as yet no proper unit has been found for fleet activity.
With the increasing catching efficiency, the need for an indisputable indicator of the catch per unit of effort is great.
On the other hand, great engine capacity need not indicate a greater fishing effort if we consider that the freezing capacity also requires extra engine quality as on some ships.
Sustainable fishing can only be achieved if there is room for an efficient fleet within the permitted catches.
Grants for newly-built ships disrupt the operation of market forces and encourage an expansion of capacity.
I therefore call on the Commission to end these grants, and I know that I have the support of Dutch fishermen in this.
The Commission needs support among the fishermen, if it is to have a chance of succeeding.
The MGP must not be seen as a separate instrument with independent objectives from the other policy measures such as the TACs and the quota.
By giving fishermen in their product organisations scope to shape policy for themselves within a single framework, such support can be created.
These producers' organisations can then be tackled on the division of the quota, transparency of catches and the registration of ships.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am going to speak on behalf of my fellow Member, Dominique Souchet, and set out the position she upheld - which I also share - in the Committee on Fisheries.
This Annual Report - whatever the rapporteur' s qualities and however much work he puts in - appears repetitive, conventional and quite pointless each time.
The pointlessness of this exercise underlines, if there were any doubt, the vacuity of a process, namely the MGPs or multiannual guidance programmes, the principal effect of which is to encourage fraudulent behaviour, favouring certain fleets to the detriment of others.
The purchase of virtual wrecks from outside, in order to break them and thereby have unjustified reserves of kilowatts available, distorted the mechanism from the start.
This corruption has even become a veritable national sport in certain States.
Indefinitely lamenting the poor quality of the statistical data on MGPs therefore does not make much sense.
To embark, as the Commission proposes, on a course of punishment and penalties for Member States - which would, in fact, hit the workers - would be dangerous.
What we need is simply to take note of the failure of the MGPs instead of trying to artificially prolong the life of this ineffective and counter-productive measure.
Despite their elevated cost, these MGPs have not achieved their objective.
Adding to the total allowed catches - the TACs - they were badly designed from the outset and have made the second-hand market rocket to the detriment, in particular, of young small-scale fishermen who are just starting out in this profession.
Everyone recognises this failure in private.
It would be sensible to have the courage to recognise it publicly and draw conclusions from it.
The main conclusion should be the need to include in the new common fisheries policy, along with the abolition of the MGPs, reorientation of the sustainable management of resources according to a reformed system of TACs and improved, fine-tuned multiannual quotas based on refined assessments of resources made possible by a substantial increase in scientific research and close collaboration with workers in the process.
In wishing to prolong the MGP policy the Commission is in danger of committing itself to a dangerous path, and we are warning it against this.
This is not the way to reconcile fishermen with the common fisheries policy.
First of all, may I take the opportunity of congratulating the rapporteur.
He, like myself, has been given the great problem of trying to deal with a highly technical report and trying to find a way through.
My report comes later. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate him on an excellent report.
I think those of us who participate in the fisheries committee in this parliament do not always get the credit for what they achieve or indeed what the Commission achieves.
I have to ask the Commission and indeed, we all have to ask ourselves, why is the multiannual guidance programme not being implemented?
It is all very well to complain about it, but we have to ask the question 'why'?
The main reason why it is not being implemented is because Member States and national governments are not prepared on many occasions to find the matching funding required to bring about what is necessary to restructure an industry which we all know and agree must be restructured.
Until we find a way of encouraging all the Member States to do this, there is no point in one Member State doing it, there is no point in two or even three, four or five Member States: it has to be right across the board of all Member States or else you will end up with massive recriminations between Member States as to who is doing what.
The fact that we have not been able to give it that priority in the Member States is certainly something that we all view with great concern.
I would be inclined to say to the Commissioner that, no matter what you call it or how you achieve it, what you should do is to take the problem, give it a good shaking, get on with it and to try and force Member States to bring about the result everyone agrees is required and sort out how it will really affect the industry.
We have the Member States going one way, we have the Commission going another way, we have scientists telling us another thing and in the middle we have fishermen and the fishing industry wondering what way they can go.
Mr President, it is essential that fishing effort - and I mean effort as opposed to capacity - is matched to fishery resources.
Member States must also be obliged to fulfil their fleet reduction targets so I welcome the general thrust of Mr Busk's report.
Unfortunately, an amendment in committee added a reference to the Cunha report and brought with it the concept of quota penalties, a proposal which is against the acquis communautaire.
As the Commission itself stated in this House on a previous occasion, and I quote: "The automatic reduction in quotas for non-complying countries seriously undermines the basic principle of the common fisheries policy which is that of relative stability".
Quota penalties are impractical as well as unjust, punishing fishermen for their Member State's wrongdoing.
Quotas should be based on science and conservation objectives, not misused as automatic penalties.
I ask therefore for a separate and split vote on paragraph 4 of this text and I urge Members to reject the references to the Cunha report and make sure that effective sanctions are targeted against those who are obliged to fulfil MAGP targets, that is, Member State governments, and not fishermen.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. May I start by thanking Mr Busk for his excellent report.
As we all know, the multi-annual guidance programmes are important instruments for fleet policy.
I agree with you wholeheartedly there. According to the information in the annual report, not only were the MAGP IV targets not ambitious enough, even these modest targets were not all met.
Now I should like to comment on the two main demands contained in the report: measurements of vessels and sanctions for Member States which fail to meet their MAGP targets.
First, Mr Busk, you call for precise and clear criteria for measuring capacity.
In theory, we introduced a uniform definition of tonnage which applies throughout the Community in 1994 in Regulation No 3259.
According to this regulation, the Member States had to file tonnage estimates by 1995 and have until 2003 to measure all vessels in accordance with uniform regulations and notify the actual values.
So far, we have only received estimates and now they must gradually be replaced by actual values.
This means that we shall have to work with a mixture of accurate measurements and estimates until the end of 2003.
In theory, there are also harmonised definitions for engine power. There is a problem here with controls, however, because the actual engine power is often higher than the value declared or is subsequently increased.
We must put a stop to this practice and the Commission will be organising a workshop of experts from the Member States in the autumn of this year in order to find solutions to these problems.
In all honesty, however, there is good cause to question, over and above this, if these two criteria, that is, engine power and tonnage, really are the only possible and the most suitable criteria for assessing the fishing effort of a vessel accurately.
In all events, I intend to raise this question again when we consider the reform of the common fisheries policy and investigate it more closely.
Secondly, Mr Busk, you call for effective sanctions against Member States which fail to honour their obligations under MAGP IV.
You refer in this context to earlier resolutions by Parliament on the Cunha report on the same subject.
I agree with you wholeheartedly here.
We need more effective sanctions which will have the right impact.
The most effective method in the past, with the exception of legal recourse, has been to freeze state aid for fleets.
This is, of course, completely pointless in Member States which do not grant state aid, such as the Netherlands or the United Kingdom.
The only legal recourse available if the MAGP IV targets are exceeded is to go to the European Court and institute infringement proceedings.
We have prepared infringement proceedings against several Member States and we now intend to set them in motion because there is no other way of making sure they toe the line.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Cod stock in the Irish Sea
The next item is the report (A5-0213/2001) by James Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2549/2000 establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) (COM(2001) 165 - C5-0140/2001 - 2001/0083(CNS)).
Mr President, I am grateful for the support I had in producing this report.
As I indicated in the earlier debate, it is a technical report.
Sometimes it requires a bit of knowledge to get to the bottom of the problem.
Thanks also to the Commission.
To some extent we are dealing with the issue of Box 7(A) in the Irish Sea, which has been closed off at times recently, in cooperation with the fishermen.
I certainly welcome that.
Discussions were based on the debate about what happened in the North Sea.
That area was also closed when the Norwegians were working on the project, and scientists came forward with new conclusions that did not affect the industry.
This report also helps French fishermen.
It operates in conjunction with the cod recovery plan in the Irish Sea.
Everyone accepts now that there is a problem of cod stocks.
No one has been able to agree on how you work towards their recovery, however.
I certainly hope this study and the proposals that come forward will, in conjunction with the fishermen, help the fishing industry, the fleet and those who actually work at sea.
To a large extent this report is technical, as I have said.
It involves the difference between a 4mm thick double twine that is equivalent to a 6mm thick single twine on the cod-ends on the actual net that catches the fish.
I hope the scientists are right and that this improves.
We all have to accept that this is about the protection of juvenile cod in the Irish Sea.
I hope it is successful.
If stocks are to recover then the juveniles have to be allowed to mature and develop if the industry is to recover.
One area I am encouraged about is the fact that there is better cooperation and dialogue between the Commission and those involved in the industry.
That must be welcomed by everyone.
We all have a part to play in this: fishermen, the Member States, scientists, and the Commission.
Each has to know where the other is coming from if we are going to succeed.
Everyone has to cooperate if we are to succeed.
I would like the Commissioner here tonight to confirm that this cooperation is working to the maximum and as well as he would wish.
Perhaps he could suggest ways of improving that, especially in the months ahead when, near Christmas, we decide what the TACs and quotas are for those areas and are bound to face grave difficulties.
The Commissioner may be aware that for the last two years the Irish Sea has been closed at spawning time to aid stock recovery.
Fishermen in that area have cooperated fully, as they have this year about the North Sea.
Do these new methods have an effect?
Can you tell us that the desired effect has been achieved, as far as the scientists are concerned?
There is growing realism that there is a problem. But are we on the way to solving that problem?
Have we got the right methods and mechanisms in place to resolve it?
All these new measures create extra costs, at a time when we have reduced fishing and have a fleet that is, to some extent, in financial difficulty.
We seriously require support through the industry: decommissioning, a reduction in size of the fishing fleet and fishing time so that we can at least leave those left in the industry some hope of survival.
I hope, Commissioner, you will encourage the cooperation that is required.
It has come about to achieve this technical agreement.
I hope that you will encourage cooperation between your staff, scientists and those involved in the industry.
That is the way forward.
Can I first of all congratulate my friend and colleague, Jim Nicholson, on his report.
Technical measures to aid the recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea are of very great importance and they are of considerable consequence to fishermen in Scotland who are now desperately searching for ways to rejuvenate cod stocks in the North Sea.
We are therefore studying the success of the measures taken in the Irish Sea with huge interest.
Fish stocks, as you know, have collapsed in the North Sea, recently forcing the Commission to introduce emergency measures for the first time, when they closed 40 000 sq miles to cod fishing for 12 weeks, and to introduce emergency measures to protect northern hake stocks.
Our once proud Scottish fleet, which landed 400 000 tonnes of cod per year in Scottish ports in 1970, is now limited by strict TACs and quotas to a mere 20 000 tonnes per year.
The situation is no longer sustainable.
The Commission Green Paper on reform of the CFP contains proposals, which have received widespread support from the industry, for maintaining the 6- and 12-mile limits to protect in-shore fisheries, preserving the successful conservation zones such as the Shetland Box and maintaining the concept of relative stability to limit access to the North Sea.
The Commission has also recommended devolving some aspects of fisheries management to zonal committees, involving key stakeholders such as fishermen and scientists in an advisory role.
All of this is highly commendable and will assist in the process of stock recovery and juvenile recruitment.
It is also necessary, however, as the rapporteur has pointed out, to introduce a wide range of technical measures such as mesh sizes.
For this reason alone, I am alarmed that we continue to allow industrial fishing for sand eels and Norway pout in the North Sea.
Industrial fishing is completely incompatible with the development of a sustainable fishery.
How can we force our fishermen to utilise 110 mm mesh sizes in the EU sector from 1 January 2002 for cod, haddock and whiting when we continue to allow these Klondykers to scoop up everything in their path using small-mesh nets.
This destructive practice has got to stop, and I hope that the Commission will take the necessary steps to control industrial fishing as part of the overall CFP reform.
Mr President, this is a very necessary technical proposal and I fully endorse Mr Nicholson's report and the proposal to which it refers.
But speaking of recovery plans in general, of course it is not only the Irish Sea that has seen catastrophic declines.
The North Sea too has been confronted with drastic depletion of stock leading to partial sea closures and another cod recovery plan and the hake recovery plan.
There is a manifest need in fisheries management to take account of the local eco-system and the regional differentials which exist.
The broad brush approach, I would contend, has not worked with stocks on the decline and recovery very slow, if evident at all.
That is why regional management is the way forward.
In addition to the short-term technical proposals referred in this type of report, the approach of the Commission's Green Paper, which is both more regional and conservation-orientated, must be embraced.
In this regard, I also welcome proposals to make additional funds available for tie-up schemes as a necessary part of the management tool box for conservation purposes, going in tandem with the recovery plans.
Compensated tie-up schemes are also essential for the preservation of the CFPs social role.
In Scotland, the need for recovery is acknowledged by all the stake-holders, but fishermen also must have the financial and the social protection that they need to encourage them while taking responsible actions.
Therefore, I ask the Commission to ensure that a system is set in place which allows for compensated tie-ups, but without being subject to the whims of Member State governments, to ensure that a more level playing field exists between fishing industries in the different Member States, which from time-to-time will be affected by recovery plans.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can keep it brief.
First I should like to thank Mr Nicholson for his report and, secondly, I should like to state that the Commission fully supports this report.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that 6 mm thick single-twine netting is equivalent in terms of selectivity to 4 mm thick double-twine netting.
There was therefore no reason to prohibit 4 mm thick double-twine netting for fisheries in the Irish Sea.
We have therefore amended the regulation accordingly.
I should like to thank you for your positive attitude to this Commission proposal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended until voting time at 6.30 p.m.)

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Resolution B5-0327/2001
We shall be voting for the resolution on the European Union's strategy for the Bonn Conference on Climate Change.
It responds to an urgent need, by confirming the intention to forge ahead in the face of President Bush' s unilateral opposition to the Kyoto Protocol.
It also contains positive articles, such as the article which reaffirms the need to promote 'clean development' by encouraging technologies which exclude nuclear energy, the large-scale use of fossil fuels and the use of carbon sinks.
Or the article which favours internal-action policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, rather than the use of 'flexible mechanisms' (which the resolution restricts to no more than 50%).
Or the article which calls for, beyond current stipulations, for the WTO to comply with environmental priorities established externally by an international conference, in order to prevent countries which do not ratify the Kyoto Protocol from obtaining unfair competition advantages.
This resolution shows how far the situation has deteriorated today.
The Union has been reduced to defending the Kyoto Protocol which was, in any case, far from perfect.
Kyoto unduly favours the mechanisms of an unequal market.
The Protocol sanctions the successive climb-downs which environmental policy has seen since the Rio Conference under pressure from established interests and supporters of economic liberalism.
We cannot be content with this state of affairs.
As yet, there is no proof that the climate change concerning us is not caused by a natural climatic cycle that has been in progress since the beginning of our planet.
Admittedly, we cannot deny that air pollution is increasing, that human activity lies at its root and that it is our duty to give consideration to the development of an effective policy to preserve the environment of Europe and the world.
In this context, I support the idea of providing aid to developing countries which will enable them to ensure respect for the environment.
I favour a system of encouraging States to become more responsible over a system of fines for not respecting their commitments, so I do not support the idea of a 'censor' who would fine the States according to criteria which I find unacceptable and which would exclude nuclear and other forms of energy.
On the other hand, in order to be consistent, we must begin immediately to develop non-polluting forms of energy such as bio-fuels through the use of tax incentives.
To sum up, we must be firm about the goals we need to attain but flexible in the means we use to reach them.
Report A5-0214/2001
The two recent mining accidents, which were mentioned in the explanatory statement, were representative of ecological disasters, the effects of which have been felt well beyond the regions where the accidents actually occurred.
Since the Baia Mare disaster, the main shareholder, who is Australian, has withdrawn his capital and has washed his hands of the destruction of the fauna and flora of Tsiza and of a large area of the Danube.
If we want to prevent this type of disaster happening in the future, at the very least, we must introduce restrictive legislation to make not only mining companies but also all the owners and all their shareholders responsible for the damage caused. If they do not comply, all their assets and their capital will be confiscated, including those invested in other sectors.
We will not achieve anything by merely expressing desires or even issuing recommendations unless we call into question the sacred right of ownership, when exercising this right is having disastrous consequences for a whole population and will continue to do so in the future.
We voted in favour of some of the proposals in this text, but we abstained on the text as a whole because it is too vague.
.
(FR) The report by Mr SjÃ¶stedt follows a Commission communication and deals with an extremely important question which is all too often overlooked, the impact of mining on the environment.
The report draws lessons from two recent major accidents which occurred at DoÃ±ana in Spain in a mine producing metal concentrates and at Baia Mare in Romania.
Given the blatant current lack of rules and monitoring requirements, there is an essential need for a systematic review of the Community environmental policy in order to take account, finally, of mining activities (and particularly their waste management).
There is therefore a need to clearly define the mining companies' responsibilities in this area, for they currently take advantage of the lack of strict regulations.
We shall be voting in favour of Mr SjÃ¶stedt's report.
Report A5-0188/2001
The rapporteur focuses a great deal on the need to reduce the capacity of the Member States' fleets and to establish a system of penalties that will compel the Member States to 'comply with the provisions requiring them to reduce their fishing fleets under the MAGPs' .
He also points out that not all Member States have met the criteria laid down in the MAGP.
He furthermore calls for more precise criteria for measuring fleet capacity.
Unfortunately, the rapporteur does not name the Member States that have failed to meet the MAGP objectives.
Portugal was one of those that fulfilled the MAGP criteria from the very outset, since it did not take the opportunity, like some others did, to modernise and even to increase its fleet.
Bearing in mind the Green Paper on "the future of the common fisheries policy" , what we need is for the States that have already made large reductions not to be forced to make further reductions in the future.
Another factor that must be considered is the balance between a Member State' s fish consumption and the capacity of its fleet.
Furthermore, reducing the fishing effort does not necessarily mean a reduction in the number of vessels.
This reduction could be implemented by improving catching techniques or by not fishing for a certain amount of time, with the appropriate compensation for boats that are forced to remain idle.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
