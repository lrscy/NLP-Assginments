Let me also pay tribute to my two fellow-Members who are now this Houseâs rapporteurs â Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo, and Mrs Anne Jensen in particular, who took over the work of rapporteur only a month ago.
Making such a good job of it without preparation is remarkable in itself, and so every respect to her.
The Budget before us is not some sort of abstract entity with nothing but figures floating around in it; on the contrary, it reflects the sort of policies we want to make and on which we have decided; it reflects how we want the European Union to further develop, and what we want it to be like.
At the same time, we must always bear in mind that it is the taxpayerâs money that we are spending, and we are obliged to be very careful in what we do with it.
It can, I think, be said that this House has, over recent years, been a very careful steward of the European taxpayersâ resources.
If the impression is communicated every year during the Budget debate that Parliament wants more to be spent while the Council, representing the governments, always wants to cut outgoings, that amounts only to fake frugality on the part of the Council.
This, I believe, is where we have to ensure that the funds we need to make the policies that we want to happen are actually available.
Let me clarify that by using two or three examples.
Over past years, we have again and again seen the categories narrowed down.
It has just been said that Category 4 has become more and more restrictive.
Commissioner Schreyer rightly pointed out that Category 4 used to include not only foreign policy, but also Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans as well.
All these things were to be paid for using the same funds.
The Council wanted more to be spent on its common foreign and security policy, but the things we wanted, it cut â such things, for example, as funds that would have been made available for democratisation or for conflict prevention.
That is just not on!
You cannot fund what you are promising for the future with money for promises made in the past; it merely baffles the public, who no longer have any clear idea of what the European Union actually stands for.
This we will not go along with, and we will keep on telling uncomfortable truths.
In the other field, that of internal policy, which has also just been mentioned, we have created several extra agencies.
These agencies exist to perform administrative tasks, but they are introduced into a portfolio with which we want to make internal policies, environmental policy, policies on research, development, and education.
All these things are crammed in on top.
Additional tasks are transferred and the whole thing is rubber-stamped by the Council, which then comes to us and tells us that we must be more careful with money!
We will tighten our belts, even in this Budget procedure.
We will look to see exactly what we need.
In this Budget procedure, then, we will take up our positions, exert our influence successfully, and make it clear to the public that what we have announced in the past we will stick to and make happen.
There will be no blank cheques handed out, neither in the 2005 Budget procedure, nor when it comes to the future funding of the European Union.
You can expect this House to stand firm; we will tell people what is needed and also where we can make savings.
Â Â  ,. Mr President, I first of all wish to congratulate our rapporteurs for the budget, MrsÂ Jensen and MrÂ Garriga Polledo, for their excellent work in shaping this yearâs draft budget.
It has been a weighty and onerous task, but both rapporteurs have carried it out extremely well.
I also wish to thank the new Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, MrÂ Lewandowski, for his skilful leadership of the committee.
I would like to say a special thank you, however, to Commissioner Schreyer for the outstanding degree of cooperation she has shown, not just this year, but across the whole five-year period of the last Parliamentary term.
Under your leadership, the EU budgets have been produced and the legal basis for them revised. The structure of the budget has been amended, the Financial Regulation and the rules for its implementation have been revised, and the accounts system is being reformed as we speak.
I would like to thank her warmly for her excellent level of cooperation and wish her every success for the future.
The EU budget for 2005 aims to foster economic growth.
The special areas of focus in the committeeâs proposal are the enhancement of economic cohesion and the creation of employment, and we believe they are the correct ones.
One aim is to safeguard EU agriculture prior to the massive reform which will take place.
Accordingly, the committee has restored approximately one billion euros of the cuts that the Council had made.
It is particularly important to reduce transportation of livestock step by step, and to this end the committee has set aside 10% of the appropriations for further research.
The committee has proposed an additional EUR 40Â million for the prevention of animal diseases.
This has been one of my groupâs main areas of focus.
The Structural Funds are an important instrument for job creation, and so it was right of the committee to endorse the sum of EUR 3.8 billion in payment appropriations.
In this way, we can speed up the implementation of programmes, and at the same time reduce outstanding commitments, which have grown to a sum equivalent to approximately two years of appropriations.
This is a threat to structural policy in the years to come.
The promotion of entrepreneurial activity has been a particular area of focus.
It has been crucial to validate the relevant budget headings and to strengthen support for small and medium-sized businesses as well as research and training programmes.
My group backs these proposals.
Likewise, the areas of focus are in harmony with the new financial perspectives, as these also aim to enhance EU competitiveness by endorsing these items of expenditure.
The proposal before us, possibly in amended form, will be Parliamentâs first chance to present its view of next yearâs budget.
Hopefully, the budget will be approved, by December, in a positive spirit.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I too welcome this opportunity to reiterate the warm gratitude of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to Commissioner Schreyer for the work she has done.
I would like to add, with reference to Green policy on women, that I am very proud and glad that you have represented us in this allegedly tough area of politics in recent years, and with such courage and decisiveness, such openness to dialogue and such competence.
That was a tremendous success for us Greens, and also for the European Union as a whole.
In that I take pride, and I wish you all the best for the future.
You have also been courageous enough to raise the question of for how long budget policy can be structured in the way it is.
In the very same way as the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, you have today made it clear that budget policy is pre-eminently a political task, that not only do we have to handle columns of figures, but we also have to express the priorities of what we are endeavouring to do politically and hence also our political self-conception in Europe.
Let me start by emphasising that we generally endorse the broad outlines of what our rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, has said, and by following a number of the previous speakers in illustrating this by reference to a number of policy areas.
Things are improving in the field of structural policy, which is being better implemented, and which is about solidarity and real cohesion in Europe, and about reducing the differences in standards of living.
Now that it is working better, it is self-evident that we must allocate more money to it.
Mr Walter has just pointed out that, as an increase in their number was what we wanted, the Council must be willing to make new funds available to the new agencies, for we cannot allow the policy of decentralised agencies to result in a price war in European politics.
The third point I would like to highlight â and on this I very much agree with many of the positions expressed by the specialist committees â is that we have to attach greater importance to information policy.
Only if we communicate what we are trying to do to people where they actually are, and only if we are really pro-active in promoting the Constitution over the coming months, will we be able to win the people of Europe over to the European project, which makes political sense.
A majority in our group supports precisely this approach, which involves making work on Europe more transparent and going into battle for Europeâs cause.
You then spoke about foreign policy; here, too, we take the view that we must press on with the reconstruction of Iraq with real determination.
That will not, however, be possible with the present structure of the Budget, so we will have to make use of the flexibility instrument.
I would also like to stress something that Mr Garriga Polledo said, that this House and the Committee on Budgets possess the political will to counteract terrorism, the fundamentalism that strengthens it, and totalitarian thinking.
Whilst endorsing this approach in principle, we do believe that we absolutely need to fight for specific measures that really make sense.
Finally, let me observe that everyone in this House is constantly talking about the Lisbon strategy.
We, too, think this right and proper, but it is evident that some Members are talking about different aspects of it.
We are convinced in our heart of hearts that growth policy may not be separated from sustainable growth.
Green thinking and measures to protect the environment can add up, too.
That, and not reverting to the mindset of the 1960s by again treating the economy and the environment as separate, is the truly modern policy for the economy and for innovation.
With that in mind, I hope that we will be able to arrive at compromises with the members of the other groups in the forthcoming discussions.
Â Â  , .
Mr President, Commissioner, I too had something positive to say about Commissioner Schreyerâs five-year term of office, but I cannot find anything to add to what has already been said here today, and I will therefore simply say thank you, on behalf of my group, to Commissioner Schreyer.
Regarding next yearâs budget, it has to be said that our groupâs opinion of it varies considerably.
Many of the representatives of countries classified as net contributors support the Councilâs stringent 1% line.
The majority of our group, however, think the budget is too stringent, as the priorities highlighted by Parliament are not being implemented, especially in the area of external relations.
Of the priorities set out by the rapporteur for the Commissionâs budget, we support the idea of highlighting the importance of the Lisbon Strategy, but we regret that the large parliamentary groups were unwilling to increase funding in areas relating to employment and social welfare.
Business is setting the terms for the way we proceed to too great an extent.
There are two aspects to consider with regard to increasing appropriations for information.
More money is being proposed for campaigns in favour of the new Constitution of the European Union.
It is our experience that both the Commission and Parliament are channelling these funds for purposes of propaganda, and are trying to influence the final result of the referenda in the Member States.
Money set aside for information on the EU is all too often used for persuasive advertising, without presenting all the sides of an issue.
This is not justified, especially as far as the issue of the Constitution is concerned, as that currently falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States, and not at all within that of the Community institutions.
The national parties in our group do not constitute a common European political party.
Not all parties on the left wish to restrict their freedom of action with some sort of rigid party line or enforced solidarity at Union level.
Some members of our group therefore take a dim view of parliamentary funds being spent on supporting European political parties.
There would seem to be more sympathy for increasing funding for the salaries of assistants.
We await with interest the negotiations between Parliament and the Council for the second reading of the budget.
The margins that are now being created are not sufficient to cover the priorities of both the Council and Parliament, and both have to make compromises on their objectives.
Our group will adopt a final position on the draft budget when we see the outcome of the talks that are now commencing.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two particularly important reasons why we believe the EU budget for 2005 to be unsatisfactory and why we will vote against it.
The first is of a formal and political nature.
The draft budget for 2005 was drawn up at a time when it was assumed that Poland and nine other countries would become EU Member States, yet the draft was not discussed or drawn up with these countries.
In Polish politics there is a principle according to which ânothing about us without usâ should ever be done.
A failure to hold consultations demonstrates a lack of equality and a lack of respect for oneâs partner.
The second reason relates to substance.
There are two issues upon which the EU should focus.
These are firstly, the enlargement to include ten new countries, and, secondly, the slow-down in economic growth within the EU, particularly in comparison with South-Eastern Asia and the United States.
The new Member States are characterised by low levels of wealth, backward economic structures, a lack of capital and extremely high levels of unemployment.
The acceptance of these countries into the European Union should act as a catalyst for a change in EU economic policy to ensure that the backwardness I referred to is eliminated as quickly as possible.
The draft 2005 budget is not a good response to this challenge, as it only represents 1.03% of countriesâ GDP, and the amount by which budget expenditure will grow will not be much greater than the contributions paid in by the new Member States.
As in previous years, a budget surplus can be anticipated, because it is likely that not all the money in the Structural Funds will be spent.
This will mean that the new Member States, instead of receiving more from the budget than they pay in, will become net payers.
I called for the 2004 budget surplus of EURÂ 5470Â million to be earmarked for a fund to modernise the new Member States, but this did not happen.
The Structural Funds will be increased, but only by a small amount.
This is too slow a tempo, in view of the fact that consumption levels in the new Member States are often ten times lower than those in the old Member States.
A little over EURÂ 1.4Â billion is to be earmarked for direct aid to farmers in the new Member States.
In a situation such as that in Poland, where the EU imposed significant restrictions on the majority of producers, aid cannot compensate for these losses.
If it wishes to overcome its problems, the EU must understand that investment in the new Member States would be the most effective form of investment.
If there is not such investment, the whole of the EU will face increasing economic and social problems, which is not what we want.
I thank you.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I should like to add my voice to those thanking MrsÂ Schreyer for her many years of work on the EU budget.
I should also like to say on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that in principle we accept the strategy whereby Parliament reinstates the budget figures suggested by the Commission and reduced by the Council.
The majority of the members of the UEN Group would of course gladly see a more striking increase in these figures, in particular those under Heading 2, but as a Polish pop song says, âwhen you donât have what you love, you should love what you haveâ.
We welcome the increase in funding for implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and for information policy.
At the same time, however, we would like to stress that funding for information campaigns relating to the referendums on the Constitutional Treaty must not be spent merely on propaganda for the Treaty.
An equal amount must be spent on critical media coverage.
We must respect public opinion in our countries, and public opinion is very divided on this issue.
We welcome the reinstatement of funding for programmes under the budget line covering TACIS and MEDA, which are of particular interest to our group.
We are, however, concerned at the ambiguous position adopted by the Committee on Budgets with regard to our amendment.
This amendment relates to a ban on the provision of Community aid to projects in third countries that could result in the carrying out of forced abortions, sterilisation or female circumcision.
It is an amendment aimed at protecting human rights.
In order to ensure that the right to choose is a genuine right, and not a mere mockery of the phrase, we call for this House to vote in favour of our amendment, AmendmentÂ NoÂ 5.
This does not, of course, change the fact that in principle the UENÂ Group supports the draft 2005 budget in the version put forward by the Committee on Budgets, and will vote in favour of this draft at its first reading.
At the same time, however, we hope that in future years the EU budget will be increased in order to allow the EU to achieve the ambitious tasks it has set itself.
We have in mind in particular the rapid development, or development demands, of the new Member States, given that the development of these countries, and the acceleration of their development, will be to the benefit of the EU as a whole.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about dividing up the cake but less has been said about how the size of the cake was arrived at.
It is worth remembering that approximately 90% of the budgetary resources comes from the base of gross national income and from resources derived from income from Value Added Tax, and that these resources are closely related to the pace of economic growth.
Yesterday the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, stated that 2003 was accompanied by sluggish growth of just 0.5% of GDP.
He also stated that, at present, the world economy is recording its strongest growth in the last 30 years, and that the European Union should be exploiting this positive global environment.
The draft budget plan totally fails to respond to these realities, however.
In 2004, aÂ provisional growth of 7.9% in the amounts of commitments paid is expected in relation to 2003.
This is based on the latest figures, taking into account trends in July or August.
In comparison with this, and in spite of the advised favourable growth environment, the draft European Union budget allows for an increase of just 5.4% compared to 2003, which means that the year on year growth in funds paid out should be 30% lower than in 2004.
Moreover, unlike the budget for 2004, the EU budget for 2005 now has to reflect aÂ full yearâs membership of the ten new Member States.
From this point of view, the starting-point parameters as set by the Council and in principle accepted by the Commission are, from the developmental point of view, both cosy and restrictive, and will present considerable problems in the implementation of the basic structural, regional and solidarity policies of the EU.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me join in the gratitude expressed for the five years we have been able to spend working with the Commissioner.
Back at the beginning, when we had negotiations and Agenda 2000, those years were not easy.
Nor were they easy when it came to bringing together the various aspirations and drawing up a single European Budget.
Let me very warmly thank you for your cooperation, which has been marked by a high degree of trust, and I of course wish you speedy resumption of your work at the Free University of Berlin in the winter semester, in other words that, if a new Commission takes office tomorrow, the burden of European labours will be lifted from your shoulders and you will again be able to completely devote yourself to your research.
Let me also thank both the rapporteurs, who have managed, under conditions that have not exactly been easy, to put together a very decent package.
That is what we have to discuss among ourselves today â where it is that Europe can become visible, where we can create added European value that gives people visible evidence of where our priorities lie, and where Europe makes a contribution to progress.
Turning to the Lisbon strategy, let me say quite plainly that I find myself wondering whether this strategy for establishing a competitive economy throughout Europe is just a matter of redistribution by way of the European Budget, or whether certain Member States have particular tasks to perform; I am thinking in particular, Commissioner, of the country from which both you and I come and in which your party shares in the responsibilities of government.
Might we not do much more for Europeâs competitiveness if structures were to be broken up, thereby helping to create real growth?
It should not, therefore, be said only that Lisbon means using the European Budget as a roundabout way of distributing more money among the people.
We have to begin by making the necessary reforms possible at ground level.
There have already been many proposals relating to this from both Lisbon and the German Government, and I would like to see them put into practice.
To move on to the Budget, though, the past five years have seen the administrative apparatus of the European Union expand as never before, something that has to do not only with enlargement, but also with the Councilâs inventiveness in extending administration in the shape of the agencies.
Like Mr Walter, I wonder whether we are paying for all this out of the policy sections of the budget, where it does not belong in the first place, or whether the Council is at last willing to include it under the heading of administrative expenditure?
When it comes to foreign policy, I am fed up with the foreign ministers wandering the earth doling out money, and us then being supposed, again and again, to give the new priorities budgetary form, a task which is far from simple.
That, too, has been mentioned, and, as the old priorities have become irrelevant, we have opted for a tough approach to the Budget, and I hope we will get out of the Council some sensible results that will help, not only to make this Europe of ours visible, but also to make savings where it really is possible to do so.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with the criticisms already made and, above all, the criticisms of the Council's budgetary irresponsibility.
At the time when this House was approving the current financial perspectives, we were perfectly aware that certain headings were insufficient to cover the needs we already knew about in 1999.
Heading 4, âExternal Actionsâ is an excellent example.
It was created without sufficient resources, without the resources necessary to implement the aid to Kosovo, and every year the Union has committed itself to special interventions in certain parts of the world, as Mr Ferber has also pointed out: Kosovo, the former Yugoslavian republics, Afghanistan, and, recently, Iraq.
Nothing was provided for in the figures in May 1999, and unexpected revisions have been required every year.
This Parliament has had to accept some of the cuts to its traditional policies proposed by the Council.
After five budgetary years, these cuts amount to a very significant sum for a development aid policy which is diminishing in relative terms, while we are constantly saying that we want a Europe which is open to the world.
Despite the fact that our Parliament was able to increase the Berlin figures for administrative spending in Category 5, we have been faced with budgetary restrictions which I believe have led to increased inefficiency in the Commission's work.
Nevertheless, the Council does not hesitate to call for austerity in administrative spending, while awarding itself substantial annual increases.
This year, the problems which were already becoming obvious in Heading 3, âInternal Actionsâ, have finally come to a head.
I am not going to repeat what has been said here about the Agencies; we completely and utterly agree with this, but we want the resources necessary to fund them.
Furthermore, over this period we have used the so-called flexibility instrument, even going as far as to revise the ceiling of Heading 2.
None of this is good enough, ladies and gentlemen of the Council.
Of course there should be budgetary discipline and rigour, but what you have been doing over the last five years is not an example of rigour but rather of shoddiness.
Reducing spending by hundreds of millions of euros is not, in this case, a saving, but rather a short-sighted exercise in accountancy.
You create new priorities but, in order to put them into practice, you sacrifice some of the existing priorities, based on the principle of not exceeding a certain spending limit.
This is not politics, but accountancy.
And I believe that politicians can provide more solutions to the problems faced by our society than accountants and I say this with every respect for accountants.
In relation to the new financial perspectives, I hope that the Council will change its attitude, that it will take a wider view and realise that the Unionâs budgetary policy faces much more important challenges than keeping spending below a particular percentage of gross domestic product, which would appear to be the only objective the Council is actually sure of.
Commissioner Schreyer, I would naturally like to join in all the thanks for your good work and wish you good luck.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking Mrs Schreyer for the work she has done, and I should like to thank her particularly for the open-minded attitude she has always adopted to this House.
I have always enjoyed good relations with her, especially when I was rapporteur for this yearâs budget.
I should also like to thank Mr Garriga.
I am very pleased that he has adopted for this year a number of initiatives that I took last year.
In this connection, I should immediately add another comment about the Commission, because in the letter of amendment for next yearâs agricultural budget, two initiatives have been included with regard to the quality of agricultural products and the future funding of infectious animal diseases.
I think that we need to investigate at any rate how this will take shape.
Looking back on the past few years, my slogan has always been that we need to be careful with European money.
When I consider the level of the European budget of the past few years, that is quite clearly what we have done.
We should not break the financial perspectives if that proves unwarranted, but I should add immediately that the Council did make it particularly difficult for us.
What is the use of creating new agencies every year if the necessary funding is not available?
Moreover, the self-same Council has difficulty reaching a decision as to the location of those agencies.
Sometimes they appear in the most bizarre places in Europe and are accommodated elsewhere temporarily.
All of that costs money.
Removal costs are to be covered and everything is to be funded from the programmes that appeal to Parliament.
I do not believe that to be the right attitude, and so I welcome the fact that we are thrashing this issue out properly.
It is unacceptable for one branch of the budgetary authority to take unilateral decisions that have financial implications, without indicating how these should be funded in future.
With regard to Heading 3, there is one component of which I am still strongly in favour, and that is investment support, provided by the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg, to fund small and medium-sized enterprises.
I think that we should give as many opportunities as possible to SMEs, to private enterprise, particularly in the new Member States, because some of them still lack a sound and healthy banking sector.
That is why it is a good thing that this year again, an amendment has been adopted in the budget at first reading in order to give back-up in areas such as these.
As for Heading 4, this yearâs Budget is again a very tight one.
Just as we did last year, I think it is inevitable that we will again have recourse to the flexibility reserve.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer has done a good job, and she well deserves the respect of this House.
I think we would be able to do another five yearsâ worth of work together, were it not for the reshuffling of the Commissionâs membership, something that I very much regret.
You have left us a little legacy in the form of your speech on the scope and structure of the future Budget.
In essence I agree with you, and I am very grateful for the way in which you contradicted your own countryâs governmentâs ideas about a shrinking budget.
If new policies are moved to the European level, money for them cannot be refused.
You said â and here I must be cautious â that the agricultural budget is substantial.
It is, but we must resist the tendency to use this Budget as a quarry for the new tasks that are to come.
What we want is a change of direction, and you talked about the Lisbon targets and economic development.
I see rural areas as part of this too.
You talk about research, education and innovation; they are needed in rural areas too.
Let me remind you that, when the EU was enlarged, a proposal of this Houseâs Committee on Agriculture was adopted to grant the funds collected for the pro-hectare bonuses as structural aid for rural areas.
Nothing has been done about that, and I think we will have a repeat of this argument when, in future, Turkeyâs accession is on the agenda.
It is important that we invest in our own rural areas, where money gains added value, and the added value should remain in those countries.
It might be said that this often makes more sense than investing in certain major industrial projects.
I believe that we must â and will â take account of this in the structure of budgets in medium-term financial planning.
I hope that the House agrees with me in this.
It is unfortunate that our work together is coming to an end.
As a result of the redeployment of the mandatory funds, we have rather more responsibility for the agricultural budget.
I hope that we can bring about change in line with what Parliament wants.
Many thanks for your efforts, Commissioner Schreyer.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that one of the most important tasks and goals for the enlarged European Union of 25 Member States is unquestionably social cohesion on as wide a scale as possible, in order to guarantee living and working conditions.
As it stands, however, the draft budget for 2005 is not conducive to ensuring a balance between economic and social development.
Its aim is rather to achieve a greater degree of balance and solidarity between the Member States and to guarantee equal opportunities on the labour market and in the social sphere.
Not only does the draft budget fail to reach the possible ceiling of 1.27% of the EUâs gross national product, it will not even reach 1%, as in recent years.
In my opinion, however, it is not the budget which poses the most serious problem, but rather the planned cuts to the structural funds set aside for retraining programmes, the cuts to the fight against social exclusion, the cuts to education and to support for NGOs working in the social sector.
In contrast, expenditure on the common foreign and security policy will rise.
In my opinion, the European Union must not give priority to the goal of a neoliberal market economy and to strengthening its military potential, but must instead concentrate on goals relating to improving the quality of life.
Many of the social problems experienced by citizens of the new Member States are in part due to the fulfilment of economic demands the European Union made of these Member States.
It would, therefore, only be fair to reward their efforts and their trust in the European Union.
I do not believe that the budget accomplishes this task, and I will therefore have to vote against it.
I thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I represent a party that entered Parliament this year.
We do not believe that we can approve the 2005 budget.
We believe that the expenditure is too high, with the commitments amounting to 1.14% of gross domestic income.
This budget should form the basis for future financial planning, and we believe that it could have been more restrictive.
There are many areas in which savings could have been made.
That being said, we of course have nothing against re-prioritising within the framework set up by the Commission and the Council.
There are many instances of re-prioritising for which there are good reasons.
We naturally think, however, that it is important for strict limits to be placed upon agricultural subsidies.
As MrsÂ Schreyer said, these constitute 55% of the budget, and that is quite unreasonable.
I know that it is not in accordance with the Treaty, but our development proposal involves, of course, reducing agricultural subsidies considerably and instead using the money for new initiatives.
We argue in favour of a percentage of gross domestic income as our objective.
This is not a block on reform, but a demand for re-prioritisation.
Nor do we think that the Lisbon strategy should be the basis for trying to procure significantly increased expenditure by the EU.
We believe, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, that growth is a supremely national issue that is not promoted by increased EU expenditure and taxes.
That is not the route to increased growth.
We therefore reject the very cornerstone of the thinking behind the budget.
I shall not go into all the details of the re-prioritising.
All that must be discussed.
We need a much clearer link between those who propose expenditure and those who have responsibility for arranging the funding and collecting taxpayersâ money.
To me, it seems as if Parliament is pushing for expenditure without accepting the political responsibility for demanding further tax revenue.
In the long term, it is not a good division of labour to have one body that proposes expenditure and another whose task it is to obtain the money.
That is from where the tensions arise.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to add my thanks for the Commissioner's excellent work over the past five years and to wish him well in his future career.
The European Union clearly has to prioritise its budgetary commitments.
It recently brought out proposals to increase cooperation within the Union on international terrorism and organised crime.
That means an increase in the justice and home affairs budget.
The European Union is in a strong position to promote cooperation on asylum and immigration and to promote judicial and police cooperation.
That also appears to be the view of the EU justice ministers, who are meeting today to put in place enhanced EU programmes to better coordinate EU asylum policies.
The budget in these fields is going to increase next year and in the 2007â2013 financial perspective.
I should also like to emphasise my support for the agriculture budget, particularly in view of the fact that we have sold the mid-term review to our farmers and they expect that commitment to be honoured.
EU governments are also committed to playing a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq; the EU made a five-year commitment at the donors' conference in 2003 and will be at the forefront in providing financial assistance to the new Iraqi administration.
The budget for next year is going to have to take account of these commitments.
Although there have been differences within the European Union as to how best to deal with Iraq, we are all agreed now that the European Union must remain at the forefront of this reconstruction effort.
The Iraqi people have suffered too much.
We must work together to ensure that their quality of life is dramatically improved, sooner rather than later.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to express my emphatic agreement with the broad thrust of what was said by the previous speaker but one, MrÂ Wohlin.
I believe that in continuing to waste billions, the EU, which was meant to act as a shield for Europe, is â to put it mildly â committing an extremely serious error.
Yet the budget is also full of clever little hidden nooks and crannies, a fact known by few better than by most of those now listening to this debate.
I should like to single out just two of these.
Firstly, the measures planned in relation to the implementation of the Statute for Political Parties, a great many aspects of which must be described as problematic in terms of democratic politics.
This is equivalent to acting by stealth, and, to quote Professor von Arnim, a researcher into political parties, to an undercover source of funding that may be turned on at any time at the taxpayerâs cost.
If we continue in this manner there will be adverse consequences for the European project.
The same is true of the increase in secretarial allowances for Members of this House, a proposal which is currently only being cleverly held in reserve, but which has nonetheless again been established as a goal.
It is of course necessary for us to be able to carry out our work here well, but not in such a way that beneficiaries can make easy money and party officials can receive a great deal of money on repeated occasions without contributing anything to the Parliament, a phenomenon which has been proven to occur.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ Schreyer, the task faced firstly by the Committee on Budgets, and today by this House as a whole, in setting out a position on the draft budget for 2005 is an extremely difficult one.
On the one hand, our room for manoeuvre is extremely limited.
This is normal towards the end of a Financial Perspective, when new tasks appear for which no provision was made earlier, and funds are eaten up by these tasks.
I am not referring to enlargement or cohesion, but primarily to aid for Iraq, new tasks in the field of security and defence policy and the ever-increasing number of agencies.
On the other hand, the newly-formed Parliament urgently needs to reassert its priorities and make good on its electoral promises.
It must also stand by the position assumed by this House in the past, namely to exert democratic control over the flow of funds within the European Union.
On this occasion, Parliamentâs traditional strategy, whereby the Commission proposals are reinstated in place of the Councilâs traditional and extremely mechanical cuts, has proved inadequate in the face of such a challenge.
The votes held in the Committee on Budgets have revealed an offensive strategy endorsed by MrÂ Garriga, according to which Parliament expresses itself clearly and creates room for manoeuvre before the second round, or the second reading, in order to defend its traditional priorities.
These priorities include those mentioned many times in todayâs debate, such as the Lisbon Strategy, information policy, development aid for rural areas, which does not necessarily mean the creation of jobs in agriculture, and the fight against terrorism.
This time the priorities did not leave much room for new initiatives by the new Member States, something that needs to change in future years.
It should be stressed that this strategy gained the strong support of various forces within the Committee on Budgets.
The real test of whether inter-party solidarity of this kind can be sustained during the remaining rounds of the 2005 budget battle will, however, come during the vote on Thursday.
As an MEP from Gdansk, the birthplace of the Solidarity Movement, I await this vote with hope, and the reason for this is obvious. The strong position the House has adopted this time will have a far-reaching impact on future annual budgets, but above all on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
With regard to very many words of thanks addressed to MrsÂ Schreyer again today, there will presently be a further occasion to thank her during our last joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets, which will begin shortly.
Many thanks.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too thank you kindly.
There are many clouds chasing across the skies of Europe now, just as, with enlargement complete and the Constitutional Treaty about to be signed, we should be acting with renewed vigour.
There is a persistent miserliness in certain Member States with regard to the European project, which also shows itself in the matter of resources, an essential condition if our objectives are to be supported with adequate means.
The Barroso Commission looks as though it will be a poor ally in this battle and, in this area as well, Parliament must become the main champion of the institutionsâ credibility and win back the confidence of the people.
Essentially, we have supported the strategy of our rapporteurs, Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen, in order to restore some coherence to our statements and to honour the principal commitments we made to our electors.
The most important of these is the commitment to relaunch the growth and competitiveness strategy.
We have done a good job in the Committee on Budgets, one that ought to be supported further.
I know that a difficult stage in the negotiations is about to begin, and there will be an outcry because we have cut the funding to the agencies, for instance.
Who was it, though, that really cut the funding to the agencies?
We in Parliament, or the Council, which forces us into making these choices through its penny-pinching miserliness?
The same is true for the cohesion policy and external policies: according to the Council, the cost of the reconstruction of Iraq should be borne by the Unionâs normal programmes.
We have to stand united, ladies and gentlemen.
I agree with Mr Lewandowskiâs appeal: on Thursday Parliament can vote by a large majority at first reading to ensure a successful outcome for the credibility of our institution.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the European Bureau for LesserâUsed Languages is running short of funds.
We have also been informed that no funding can be allocated for the parliamentary use of stateless languages.
Why has the Ebner report, which was intended to improve real language plurality in Europe and the development of lesserâused and minority languages in the EU, not yet been implemented?
This morning we listened to the Queen of the Netherlands talking about the use of one's mother tongue as a right in a multilingual Europe.
What will happen to some mother tongues which have been forgotten by the EU?
I am referring to Catalan, my mother tongue and that of nine million Europeans.
Is there any other parliament in the world where the president and first vice-president are not able to speak in their own mother tongue?
Should the Union be more efficient as regards its budget?
With apologies to interpreters and translators, if Europe is not in favour of real language plurality, we should save money by using only one official language: English.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, it has already been said that the European Union has set itself the goal of becoming the worldâs most economically competitive region by 2010.
This, however, presupposes the elimination of the far-reaching differences between the Member States and within regions in the Member States.
If the Gothenburg Strategy is to be taken seriously, this involves not merely economic issues, but also the attainment of a balanced relationship between economic development, social development and environmental development, whilst adhering to the principle of equality.
After all, the European Union is not merely a project to create an internal market, but also a project based on solidarity!
I therefore find it entirely incomprehensible that despite the increased number of tasks incumbent upon the enlarged European Union, a fact referred to in many wise speeches by all kinds of government representatives, funding is now to be limited to 1% of gross domestic product, with the budget at an even lower level.
This means that there is no chance at all of us ever putting this idea into practice.
I should therefore also like to say to the Council that this kind of behaviour is opportunistic.
You make grand proclamations, but when it comes to actually implementing these policies, you backtrack.
This is in no way acceptable!
Furthermore, if we now agree to these proposals, we will already have prejudiced the outcome of the 2007-2013 Budget debate.
Once we have chosen to go down this road, it is unlikely that we will ever have an opportunity to say that enough is enough, and that we no longer wish to go along with such a policy.
We must therefore respond to this Council proposal with a categorical ânoâ, in order to provide ourselves with the opportunity to achieve a sensible relationship between the Member States with regard to development in various policy areas.
Thought must be given to what we want to achieve and which policies we wish to implement before money is made available, rather than the other way round.
Â Â  Mr President, after reading the reports on the proposed budget for 2005, I cannot help but wish that they could also be read by those useful idiots back home, upon whom the British Government so often relies, who keep telling us that the EU is not about creating a giant single State.
I should like them to count how many times the word 'integration' appears in the text.
Let me concentrate on one issue.
I am heartily sickened to read the passages about how many millions are to be aside for bodies that are â to quote the jargon â 'active at European level' or 'information relays'.
They are to receive huge handouts, which they call 'Community subsidies for organisations working to advance the idea of Europe'.
I will cut through all the jargon and tell you precisely what they are talking about: brainwashing!
The European Union is a self-perpetuating political bureaucracy.
In its quite unprecedented fashion it can arbitrarily allocate vast amounts of taxpayers' money towards the establishment of chairs in universities and to bankrolling educational institutions with deeply worrying titles, such as 'the College of Europe' or 'the European University Institute', and dozens of others.
In total, there is a financial envelope of EUR 77 million over 3 years in this brainwashing budget. This budget is a gross misuse of public money.
A large slice of the money it encompasses will be used to brainwash the public into thinking that the European Union is wonderful and that 'integration' really is a nice word.
There is nothing nice about misleading people.
In my country this is known as leading them down the garden path.
We should reject this budget.
Â Â  In relation to the Budget, Mr President, we are concerned about the positions of the new prospective Commissioner for the Budget, MrsÂ Grybauskaite, who is apparently announcing the death of the common agricultural policy; that is a warning for the French farmers.
Our Parliament's Committee on Budgets is, however, partly responsible, since it practises a form of clientelism which leads to a dramatic increase in the Community budget of 11.72% in payment appropriations compared to 2004.
This is particularly shocking at a time when France, in order to comply with the 3% deficit imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, is having to tighten its belt and raise taxes.
The irresponsibility of our Parliament will lead to an increase in France's contribution to the Community budget of more than a billion euros.
EUR 17 billion in total, equivalent to 110 billion francs.
The French taxpayer, who is already subject to some of the highest taxes in Europe, will not appreciate this, just as they do not appreciate that France finances Turkeyâs pre-accession to the European Union to the tune of EUR 47 million.
Europe risks becoming a financial bottomless pit, and we do not want to fall into it.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to respond to Mr Gollnischâs claim that France is the largest contributor to the European Union; it is in fact my own country.
As far as the agricultural component is concerned, I have to say that 40% is allocated to France, and in my country, 60% of the farmers and market gardeners have to make do without any European contribution.
I too fight for French agriculture, but he should get his facts right.
I am strongly opposed to the Councilâs course of action with regard to agricultural spending.
The sweeping reform of 2004 â now listen to this, Mr Gollnisch â is putting incomes, especially those of European farmers, under enormous pressure.
In some cases, incomes are being halved.
That is also why I object strongly to excessive cutbacks in the agricultural budget, particularly in export contributions.
I am pleased that the Commission intends to put this right to some extent, and I am also pleased with the rapporteurâs commitment, for he has, in the area of agriculture in any event, shown his good nature and his willingness to revert back to the Commissionâs first initiative and to rectify this digression on the part of the Council of Ministers.
If I may now turn to fisheries, I should like to urge Parliament to act on the Committee on Fisheriesâ proposals and establish regional fishery councils.
At present, there is a yawning chasm between what is happening in Brussels and what fishermen are experiencing.
These regional fishery councils could bridge the gap between what is happening in Brussels and how this should be applied in practice.
It follows that Parliament has every reason to cooperate and to try to actually build that bridge.
I am also pleased that the rapporteur is in any event prepared, despite his critical stance towards agencies, to equip and furnish the European Maritime Agency.
That is of the essence if we want to offer more maritime safety to our coastal communities.
My last point concerns animal diseases.
I know that there are fresh proposals to carry out more detailed research.
As far as I am concerned, the research stage is over and I am pleased with the initiatives by the Dutch Presidency, both at Parliamentary level in November and also via the Council in December, to organise two large conferences in order to achieve better European policy with regard to protection against animal diseases, such as, at the moment, avian flu in Thailand and in Asia.
Such an approach packs far more punch than filling the coffers of yet another research fund, because, although we have by now acquired a great deal of knowledge, we still have not summoned the political decisiveness in order to effectively deal with the risks of infectious animal diseases.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs, and especially MrsÂ Jensen, who took on responsibility for her report halfway through the year.
Speaking for the Socialist Group, we support MrsÂ Jensen's approach and believe that the amendments represent a satisfactory compromise between the Commission's proposals and the Council's cuts in the draft budget.
In particular, I endorse fully the reinstatement of the PDB for the Ombudsman's budget, and also for funding for an objective information campaign on the constitutional treaty.
It is important that our citizens are able to make informed decisions based on facts.
As regards the secretarial allowance, if we are to improve it, it is essential we have in place an assistant's statute.
That is why the funding for this stays in reserve.
I have been following the budget for over five years and the issue I have always focused on is transparency.
The budgetary cycle each year is a repetition of the same exercise whereby the Commission proposes X, the Council then cuts it to Y and Parliament comes up with Z. This process is flawed and does not always lead to the most efficient and effective use of resources.
I believe the problems arise because we have no opportunity to appreciate the behind the Council's decisions to increase the budget lines or decrease them.
These decisions are taken behind closed doors.
If the Council is serious in wanting Parliament to support its approach, then it needs to make these decisions in the public arena.
Over the years, I have tried to improve our budgeting process, especially in relation to the way other institutions come up with and propose their budgets, by encouraging them to take on Activity Based Budgeting, ABB.
I have to say that I am deeply disappointed that none of the other institutions have made reasonable efforts to adopt this method.
I believe that since the Commission has implemented ABB, its budgeting has improved with greater transparency.
Having said that, there is considerable room for improvement even with the Commission.
What is urgently needed there is greater openness and a thorough evaluation of programmes, of successes and failures, to ensure that when programmes are re-targeted or re-evaluated, this is done on the basis of independent evaluation.
There are areas where the Commission is still failing to match policy priorities with an adequate level of resources.
For example, my particular hobbyhorse is poverty eradication.
It is not just the Commission and the Council that need to demonstrate greater transparency: it would benefit Parliament too.
In the last few years, we have seen the emergence of horizontal amendments.
Of course they simplify voting procedures, but they also create two problems.
Firstly, they blur the decisions taken by COBU and, secondly, the result is that fewer and fewer people are involved in decision-making, both within Parliament and within the political groups.
We have a unique opportunity to address these issues, namely in our deliberations on the next financial perspectives.
We have the chance not just to look at the figures and headings, but also to make our internal processes clearer and simpler.
The budget process is not just for the anoraks like myself and others who are sitting around here, everyone in this House is accountable to European citizens for the decisions this House makes on the budget.
Finally, I call on the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions to take this opportunity to take radical action so that future budgets are simple and transparent.
I would also like to add my thanks to Commissioner Schreyer.
I would like to thank her for all her work in this area and wish her all the best for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, like other speakers in this debate, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
It is never an easy matter to represent this House on budgetary matters, whether in relation to the Commission's or Parliament's budget.
My congratulations go out to them.
Of course, we are not at the end of the budget procedure but already in this big, first public debate we have come a considerable way.
I should like quickly to cover a matter that we hold dear in my political group â the question of value for money.
I should like to underline what Commission Schreyer referred to this afternoon, which is not often mentioned: we have a budget, a very strictly managed budget.
In 1992, if I remember correctly, it covered 1.1% GDP and is now under 1% GDP, with savings in the running of the agriculture budget, for example.
However, we have to keep particular lines in focus.
MrÂ Titford mentioned the question of funding cultural organisations.
We have asked for one of those lines to be in reserve precisely so that we can make sure that the funding goes to organisations that actually exist.
But I would remind Mr Titford that even taking the amount of money that he referred to, it is less than 0.01% of the overall budget.
Therefore, to refuse to accept the budget on that basis is not really valid.
I would have been more convinced if he had taken up the issue of funding for Iraq where, as a political group last year, we asked for EUR 500m to be put in, but everyone threw up their arms and said that we would not be able to find that sum of money.
But we have found it because other lines have been able to be pilfered for it.
It is always nice to be right in retrospect, but I would agree with Mrs DÃŒhrkop that when funding a budget, we should clearly set the priorities that we wish to set as between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, so that we do not find other objectives submerged within a broader political will.
This will be highly necessary when we come to set the next financial perspective: we must not be found wanting in this particular area of external policy.
Secondly, linked to the matter of the financial perspective is one of the questions that we put down on the approval of posts.
We would like to see whether there are going to be amendments available for the financial regulation to enable us to make sure that monies allocated are properly spent.
Therefore, we would like those amendments available to us before we come to final decisions on the financial perspective next year.
Lastly, we have often pioneered the idea of interinstitutional cooperation.
I know that you have done your best, Commissioner, while in office.
But I believe that those of us in this House should remember that when we ask the Commission to apply codes of conduct to high-level officials, to the way in which Commissioners run their offices and so on, we should not ask the Commission to apply standards that we ourselves refuse to apply.
Therefore, if we ask for a code of conduct we will have to apply it ourselves in the future to retain credibility.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, much has already been said on the strategy adopted this year by this House with regard to the 2005 Budget.
It has also been said that the decentralised agencies play an important role for us in negotiations with the Council.
Once again, I should like to make it very clear to everyone that we are not opposed to the agencies; indeed quite the opposite is true, as we believe that most of them make an outstanding contribution to our common European concern.
Yet we must be aware of the fact that in recent years the rate at which agencies are established has accelerated considerably.
Whereas in 1990 there were only three agencies, in 1995 six and in 2000 seven, and there will be 23 as soon as 2005.
We have always supported the Commissionâs intention to concentrate on its core competencies and transfer certain areas to the agencies, but we want this to occur in a focused manner and under extremely strict political and budgetary control.
The Council is always in favour of creating new agencies, and since the Member States have been represented on agenciesâ management boards this has been particularly true, above all in the case of agencies which implement European legislation.
In the preliminary draft budget for 2005 EURÂ 281Â 303Â million is earmarked for agencies, EURÂ 53.7Â million more than in the 2004 financial year.
We must, however, bear in mind that all but four agencies are funded under Heading 3, internal policies, where very little money remains.
We are therefore left with only two options; either we provide the funding earmarked for the agencies without complaint, and cut funding in other priority budget lines in order to find the money to do so; or we negotiate with the Council in order to increase funding under Heading 3 by the missing EURÂ 54Â million.
The latter is exactly what we want to happen.
I should now like to address Mrs Schreyer once again, and to thank her, as have all the previous speakers.
All the men who have spoken before this House know how to pay compliments much better than I am able to, yet, as you are aware, my thanks are sincere, as Mrs Schreyer has persuaded her fellow Commissioners to put forward proposals which are genuinely forward-looking.
In fact, they are so forward-looking that I do not believe that it will be possible to implement them during my time as a Member of this House.
You are aware of the proposals to which I am referring, which include the general correction mechanism and the own resources report, with the âwindow to the futureâ of an income system intended to undergo successive amendments.
This was an extremely courageous feat, and one which none of your predecessors achieved, in any case not the two men who were your immediate predecessors.
I would like to offer you my heartfelt thanks for this.
Mrs Schreyer, women can do it!
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has essentially absorbed all the basic competences of the common foreign policy and of European defence and security policy.
It has basically created a mini-budget under the absolute control of the Council, fully integrated into the operational spending of the Council which, on the basis of the gentlemen's agreement, we in Parliament are hardly even allowed to touch.
They are taking crucial responsibilities and powers of financial control away from us and holding up the gentlemen's agreement in order to stave off our reaction.
For example, the account of the new counter-terrorism coordinator is not audited by the European Parliament, but comes directly under the Council's expenditure.
The same applies to the account of the representative for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the FADO programme.
Even in its explanatory statement on the budget, the Council itself boasts that its General Secretariat has acquired a new, more dynamic, more flexible profile, a development of which, I repeat, the Council boasts, even adding that it will be demanding new terms for the benefit of the Council.
So the Council is building up this separate mini-budget, thereby creating its own separate bureaucracy on foreign affairs.
Our question therefore should be: do we want a European Parliament which exercises policy on behalf of Europe or a European Parliament which rubber stamps the funding of policies exercised by intergovernmental institutions?
Do we want a European Parliament involved in codecision, as provided for in the new Constitution, or a European Parliament which everyone takes for granted and takes no notice of?
If this is what we want, we know what we have to do.
Absolutely nothing.
If we want to be taken notice of and to represent the Union, then we must send the message out in every direction that we are here and that our role is not cosmetic.
Â Â  â Mr President, I, too, should like to express my appreciation for the work done by our rapporteurs, Mr Garriga and Mrs Jensen.
I should also particularly like to join in the congratulations expressed to Commissioner Schreyer on the excellent work she has done, which, most importantly, has not, contrary to what we have heard in this House, led to an astronomical increase in the budget â far from it â and which has succeeded in meeting many of our objectives and maintaining considerable budgetary discipline.
Whether we say goodbye this week, or put off this goodbye for a little longer, I should like to express my sincere gratitude to you, Mrs Schreyer, and to wish you much happiness for the future.
I should also like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the in-coming Commissioner â although we do not yet know when she will take up her post â has given us guarantees that she will carry on the work that is already under way and has given some signals as regards her commitment that I feel are most welcome and that make me think that we will continue along the same path that we have thus far been following.
In relation to the Financial Perspectives, we must ensure that the hand-over takes place smoothly, and we must resist the temptation to debate everything all over again and start from scratch.
This would have a damaging effect on the defence of our interests and on European integration.
Consequently, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot stress enough how important this point is.
Let us continue the work that we have developed thus far with a new Commission, but without ever forgetting all that we have constructed together.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Mr President, if you ask our constituents what they want from Europe, they will probably tell us to do less.
But they will also tell us that what we do, we must do better.
Commissioner, if you ask them what sort of things they want us to do, they say 'the things that protect us, the things that help us'.
Nowhere is that more true than in the areas of public health: in terms of the safety of medicines; in terms of food safety; and in terms of protection from diseases and health emergencies.
That is why I want to follow what Mrs Haug said about these agencies.
Some agencies are crucial to our citizens, and we are not providing them with sufficient funding to do the job we expect from them.
The first of these I would pick out is the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, where new drugs â orphan drugs, pharmacovigilance, herbal medicines and so on â are piled on top of its initial responsibilities, but the funding is static.
I ask the House to support the amendment on orphan drugs that Mrs Haug has tabled on behalf of the Environment Committee, and to look very carefully at funding for the future in that area.
The second example is the European Food Safety Authority, which is expected to move to Parma.
It is also being expected to take on new responsibilities, not least in terms of health claims with regard to nutrient profiling and so on. We are not funding that adequately either.
That can fall flat on its face, and if does so, then public confidence is lost.
That is true of both the bodies I have mentioned.
The third example is that of our new 'baby', the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which is being set up in Stockholm.
In Stockholm, it has already been found that costs are higher than anticipated.
The value of the Krona has shot up against the euro, and the costs of employment and premises are both having an impact.
As a result it will not be possible to implement the expected recruitment policies.
I ask that this should be looked into as well, because if we do not protect people from health emergencies and from the dramatic increase in health threats, the public will not thank us.
If we wish to pay for this â and we should â then we need to look at the budget for subsidies for tobaccoâgrowing. That would pay for all those agencies.
Moreover, if we removed these subsidies, we would also remove a health threat.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to start by warmly thanking our rapporteurs, Mr Garriga and Mrs Jensen, for their excellent work.
The 2005 budget is of particular importance.
It is the first Union budget following enlargement, while in 2005 we shall be half way through the Lisbon strategy timetable.
Unfortunately, the first reading by the Council was governed by a cutback rationale.
The Council displayed inconsistency between the objectives it has set and the resources which it ultimately decided to use in order to achieve them.
The question arises of the political reliability of the Council, when it decides to cut EUR 3 billion from payment appropriations for the structural funds at a time when the European Commission and the Commissioner responsible have repeatedly stressed to us that implementation of these programmes is expected to intensify in 2005.
The question arises of the political reliability of the Council, when it makes significant cuts to crucial Lisbon strategy policies.
The question of political reliability arises when we are currently debating the new financial framework of the Union for 2007-2013 and the impression is created that the symbolic 1% ceiling is concealed behind the Council's cutbacks.
Ladies and gentlemen, at the first reading on Thursday, the European Parliament must support the restoration of the appropriations for structural policies, in accordance with the strategy which we also followed in the Committee on Budgets, with a sense of responsibility towards the citizens of Europe and towards the objectives which we have set.
We consider it necessary to reinforce policies which aim at sustainable development and employment.
We aim to strengthen social Europe and to give serious support to small and medium-sized enterprises.
We really need to use the first reading as part of our effort, by December, to make the 2005 budget a reliable development resource which will safeguard the smooth integration of the new Member States, the reduction in differences within the Union and the efficient implementation of European policies.
In closing, I too should like to warmly thank the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, for her work and to wish her all the best in her future political career.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MrsÂ Xenogiannakopoulou.
As that was the final speaker, the debate is now closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The sitting is now adjourned, and will resume at 6Â p.m. with Question Time.
I thank you.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time, during which we will examine questions to the Commission (B6-0017/2004).
A missing childrenâs web site linked to a global network has just been launched in Ireland.
Similar web sites have also been set up in the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Canada and Australia and, at EU level, apart from Ireland, in Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.
Can the Commission indicate if EU support is available for such web sites and, if so, why are so few EU Member States participating in this global network?
What steps can it take to ensure that every Member State has its own web site and becomes actively involved in the activities of the network which enables the public to come forward with information on unsolved cases of missing children?
Â Â  . Let me say at the outset that the Commission very much appreciates the work of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.
I greatly welcome the fact that six Member States of the European Union are connected with this global network on missing children, which has been set up on an American initiative.
Existing funding programmes, especially AGIS and Daphne, and previously STOP â which has now expired â continuously addressed the issues of child-trafficking, sexual exploitation of children, child pornography, violence against children in general and, in this context, the issue of missing children also.
In particular, both STOP and Daphne have been used to support financially the Childoscope project of the Belgian organisation Child Focus, and also the Institute for International Research on Criminal Policy of the University of Ghent, in line with the Council resolution of 2001 on the contribution of civil society to finding missing and sexually exploited children.
Programmes, such as AGIS and Daphne, however, focus on cooperation among EU Member States.
The global network on missing children, on the other hand, is a worldwide initiative and is not limited to the Member States of the Union.
In principle, the creation of websites in the EU Member States that could be used to search out and find missing children could be an appropriate subject for funding using one of the relevant funding programmes.
The Commission can only encourage relevant governmental administrations and civil society organisations in the Member States to set up websites in the framework of the global network on missing children and submit appropriate project proposals for the relevant programmes.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
We all know that speed is of the essence in finding missing children, not only through the Internet which, when properly used, can be a powerful tool in finding people as quickly as possible, but also through the mobile phone networks.
I have two questions to put to the Commission.
Firstly, do we know how many missing children there are in the enlarged European Union?
Secondly, I would like to ask the Commission whether it would undertake through its 2005 work programme an initiative to establish a missing children website in all European Union Member States?
Â Â  . In reply to the first question, I am afraid the only thing we can do is to make intelligent if rather gloomy guesses about the number.
It is very difficult to be precise and the accession of ten new Member States to the European Union does not make it any easier to give a general figure.
Whatever the figure is, it is far too high.
That is therefore a strong argument for us to develop the website proposal which the honourable Member has mentioned.
I will make certain that my successors â I hope, my successors! â in the European Commission are made aware of his proposal and take it seriously.
This is a very worrying problem and we should, as the honourable Member has said, use every possible resource, including modern technology, to try to cope with it.
Â Â  . Following the abject failure of the Burmese military regime to fulfil the Tullamore conditions to which the question refers, the European Union on 11 October agreed to adopt further targeted measures against the Burmese military regime.
The additional measures agreed by the Council are designed to apply both direct political pressure and indirect economic pressure on the Burmese military regime.
To apply direct political pressure and to sharpen the international isolation of the military regime, the Council has agreed to expand the EU-wide travel ban on senior Burmese military officers and their families.
Under the new rules all Burmese military officers of the rank of brigadier-general and above will be barred from entering the European Union.
To apply indirect economic pressure, the Council has agreed to adopt new measures prohibiting new investment in listed Burmese state-owned enterprises.
Under these new measures, it would also be forbidden to provide loans or credits to Burmese state-owned enterprises.
The Commission realises that the new measures, though they further isolate the military regime, cannot force it to carry out the actions demanded by the European Union at Tullamore.
However, we believe that this increased pressure will significantly increase the costs to the regime of not complying with European Union demands.
Perhaps I could add one point about assistance.
At the moment, as the honourable Member will know, assistance from the Community budget is restricted to basic humanitarian aid and health care, and it is delivered through UN agencies and non-governmental agencies active inside Burma and close to the country's borders in Thailand and Bangladesh.
The Commission is currently discussing with the Member States, but also with UN agencies and other donor organisations, the means which will allow us to optimise and expand our assistance from the budget to the Burmese people.
Â Â  I should like to ask the Commissioner if he could expand on the remark he made on the Council taking decisions regarding investment in stateâowned companies.
This relates to specifically named companies.
I understand that Total has recently done a deal with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Exploration Company.
Is that deal affected by the Council's decision?
If not, why not, if we are serious about exerting serious economic pressure?
Lastly I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he would agree that this matter should now be raised within the UN Security Council.
Â Â  . The financial sanctions politically agreed by the Council will be implemented by a Council resolution, which is directly applicable in the Member States and is binding for economic operators.
Off the cuff, I cannot give the honourable Member details of all the companies that are, or will be, covered by the proposals, but I can certainly ensure that we correspond with him on the particular company that he has in mind.
I do not want to hide a couple of points from Parliament.
Firstly, in applying sanctions against named companies, you have to be careful that you are not obliging companies to break existing contractual arrangements or deny payments for goods they have received.
It is always a trickier business to apply financial or economic sanctions than it sounds when one addresses the issue rhetorically.
However, the point the honourable Member makes about the crucial importance of the energy sector in Burma is one we have to take account of.
The other thing that I would like to say very frankly to the honourable Member is that there are limits to the extent to which we can apply pressure and achieve the desired outcome.
Like, I am sure, every Member in this Parliament, I would like to see Aung San Suu Kyi released from house arrest.
I would like to see her and the NLD able to play a full part in the political life of Burma and Burma itself released from the trap of impoverishment and totalitarianism in which it at present finds itself.
It is also the case that Aung San Suu Kyi's husband taught at a university with which I am now intimately associated, so it is a case that I have followed with huge interest and concern.
My own judgement is that, a little like the case of Zimbabwe, it is more difficult to achieve the desired outcome if neighbouring countries and regional organisations do not cooperate in achieving a desired human rights objective.
I hope that, in this case, ASEAN will act rather more vigorously in the future than it has in the recent past.
The situation in Burma is horrendous, and we must do everything we can to achieve some improvement.
Â Â  I do not have another question, I simply wanted to remind the Commissioner that there was a second part to my original question, i.e. whether the matter would be brought up in the Security Council.
Â Â  . It remains the case that the Commission is not represented in the Security Council and I imagine that will continue even during the lifetime of the next Commission, distinguished though it doubtless will be.
My own personal view is that it would help to raise this question regularly in the Security Council.
Whether that position would be shared by say, China, or some other Member States of the United Nations, I am not sure.
But if I may make a point about two countries which have a strong relationship with Burma, China and India, I think they should both recognise that Burma is a destabilising force in their region and the sooner they work with others to help achieve a more democratic regime there, the better off the whole region will be.
Â Â  Can I tempt my right honourable friend to agree that this House was right, and the foreign ministers were wrong, over the decision to permit Burma to attend the ASEM Summit?
I should also like to ask him whether he would agree that banning the senior generals and others from entering the EU is only as successful as the policies of individual Member States.
We have not seen a very effective policy on Zimbabwe, for instance.
Lastly, I ask the Commissioner to concur that although Aung San Suu Kyi â whose house arrest is unreasonable â is a crucial player in the Burma affair, we must accept that many others are also languishing in prison, including many members of the Burmese parliament.
Â Â  . Of course, the last point which the honourable Member made is entirely correct.
The focus is understandably on Aung San Suu Kyi, both because of her record and because of her international status.
She has been garlanded â alas, â for the extraordinary heroism she has shown over the years.
There are, as she would say, very many who have been persecuted along with her, whom we also need to take account of, and that includes most of the leadership of the NLD.
Secondly, the honourable Member is entirely correct that the effectiveness of any sanctions â and certainly of travel bans â is entirely dependent on the extent to which Member States implement those sanctions.
He might not be surprised to hear me say that, during the last five years, I have sometimes seen a little distance opening up between what people advocate at European level and what happens in the Member States.
That is unfortunate.
On his first question, we know Parliament took a more vigorous view of ASEM and Burmese participation in the Council.
I am not, at this late hour, going to pick an argument with the Council, even when it is not present.
I think it was understandably concerned that we should not allow the ASEM process, which has been reasonably valuable over the years, to be taken hostage by our concerns over Burma.
It is possible to take a different view on that.
At least we were able to ensure that Burma's human rights record was discussed in plenary session in ASEM and to toughen up the sanctions regime against Burma in the Council.
It was a difficult matter of judgment and I can understand why Parliament has its own view, but I hope Parliament will understand that the Council did not take the view it did because of pusillanimity.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for the commitment you have made during your term of office to trying to ensure a better situation for the suffering people of Burma.
I just wanted to follow up on the last common position, where there is a distinct lack of clarity regarding the lists of companies.
What exactly is meant by the measures that have been put in place?
Having said that â and it is clear from your response earlier on, Commissioner, that we are not going to get much more clarity on this â could we have an assurance from you that the Commission will look very closely and on a regular basis at the list of companies affected, and will update the list regularly, having monitored very carefully what will be necessary if this is going to be effective in any way?
Â Â  . My experience over the years, not only in the case of Burma but also in other cases, has been that when the Commission is asked to police a sanctions regime it does so as diligently as possible.
The diligence with which we pursue these policies is not always as popular with some Member States as it might be.
Sanctions can be sometimes a rather Pavlovian foreign policy reaction: what is important is to examine the credibility of sanctions and to ensure that, where you put them in place, you apply them as rigorously as possible.
I was unable to give the honourable Member who asked the first question all the information he would have liked, but I have tried â as I am sure that my successors will try â to be as open on this as possible.
It is perfectly legitimate for Parliament to want to be absolutely clear about these matters: about what is being done in the name of human rights policy in Burma and about how we are trying to make a success of an objective which we presumably all share both in principle and in practice. That is, to secure the release of an extraordinarily brave woman and those who, with her, have fought not just for democracy, better human rights and civil liberties in Burma but also for a better deal for an extremely talented people who have been impoverished by totalitarianism.
Â Â  . First it should be stated that operations having military or defence implications cannot be financed from the Community budget â I have spent too long looking at the provisions of Article 28(3) â and are therefore financed on an intergovernmental basis.
As regards the financing of non-military crisis management operations, the rules referred to in the question are laid down not only in the Financial Regulation, but also in its implementing rules.
The implementing rules already offer simplified procurement procedures for crisis situations in external relations, such as the use of negotiated procedures.
It should be recalled that such simplified procedures constitute derogations from the normal procedures.
Moreover, Parliament monitors their use by the Commission and a special report on their use is presented every year to the budgetary authority.
Arrangements for crisis management operations under the CFSP are currently being reviewed in the light of the functional needs of these operations, which it should be possible to accommodate within the existing framework of rules.
For the longer term, the Financial Regulation provides for a review every three years, or whenever necessary.
The Commission undertook to report on its experiences after the first two years of application of these new rules, that is, by the spring of 2005.
This review will cover both the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules in order to see if, in the light of experience, any modifications to the rules are necessary, including the procurement rules for external actions in general and for crisis management operations in particular.
I hope that is relatively clear.
Â Â  Commissioner, although I do of course agree with you that military operations are excluded from funding under the EU budget, my question relates to the police operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
According to reports I have received, there have been long delays in the arrival of equipment in the country, with six to eight months passing between the requirements being determined and the equipment actually arriving.
The European Union has decided that it wishes to provide itself with instruments to ensure that crises, especially those in neighbouring countries, are overcome rapidly.
Yet we are surely failing to achieve our aims if equipment arrives only when the crisis is already over.
I should therefore like to urge the Commission â perhaps jointly with this House â to re-examine this procedure.
Â Â  . I have some sympathy with what the honourable Member says in relation to both Bosnia and Macedonia.
At present, each time there is a crisis-management operation, all the necessary supplies and equipment have to be procured from scratch.
However, the contracting, which obviously takes some time, cannot begin until the head of mission has been appointed and has engaged his own staff.
Therefore we have to find some way to allow the procurement to begin before the crisis-management operation is formally adopted so that the supplies are available as soon as the operation starts, or very shortly thereafter.
We could obviously provide technical assistance with this preparatory work, but I am sure this is one of the factors that will be taken into account in the review of the implementing rules which I mentioned earlier.
In my experience it is not always possible for us to operate as rapidly as we would like, and that is because of the rules which have been put in place, usually with good reasons â greater transparency, proper budgetary procedure, etc. Unfortunately, when people draw up those rules they do not always think about the real world in which we have to operate.
Â Â  The next item is the second part of Question Time, during which the Commissioners present at this sitting will answer questions.
I should like to welcome Commissioner Verheugen and to begin with Question No 37 by Mr Ferber, on EU membership for Turkey and its consequences for the population.
Â Â  . Madam President, the answer to Mr Ferberâs question is in the negative; there is no such automatic entitlement.
Â Â  In that case I shall ask the following question; in your proposal on the opening of negotiations with Turkey, provision was made for a comprehensive suspension of one of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market.
Do you believe that this will stand up to scrutiny by the European Court of Justice?
Â Â  . I am unable to reply to that question, as I do not know the answer.
Â Â  . Mr Claeys, only a few days ago the Commission reported in detail on the situation in Turkey with regard to torture and ill-treatment, and I should therefore like to refer you to the Commissionâs regular report published on 6Â OctoberÂ 2004, which includes the outcome of the visit to which you referred.
During this visit, Commission representatives met representatives from five human rights organisations and from two organisations in the field of forensic medicine, as well as government representatives and representatives from the police, gendarmerie and judicial institutions.
The Commission came to the conclusion that further efforts had been made to step up measures against torture and ill-treatment, with the provisions of the new Penal Code playing an important role in this connection.
Custody procedures have been brought into line with European standards, although prison officers do not always inform detainees of their rights.
The authorities have announced a zero-tolerance policy against torture, and punishments have already been handed out to a large number of torturers.
The Commission emphasises that there continues to be a large number of cases of ill-treatment and presumably also of torture in Turkey, and that it is now a case of eradicating these practices entirely.
Further efforts must be made in this regard by the Turkish Government.
With regard to Turkeyâs progress towards accession, the Commission stresses in its recommendation that reform processes and the fight against torture and ill-treatment, which are to be extended, must also be consolidated, and that the Commission will continue to monitor this process closely.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, my question was, in fact, whether the Commission intends in future to send investigation teams to Turkey as soon as there are complaints about incidents of torture in that country.
I think that the Commissioner will have to agree with me that Turkey is a very special candidate Member State.
Today, there was an article in the German newspaper stating that in Germany alone, more than 11Â 000 refugees have arrived since the beginning of 2003 asking for asylum on political grounds.
How is this possible?
Either Turkey is democratic â and political refugees do not exist â or there is a real problem.
Â Â  . Mr Claeys, the two questions you have asked are very different ones.
The answer to the first is a clear âyesâ.
The Commission will continue to take all necessary measures, firstly to help Turkey in its fight against torture and ill-treatment, and secondly in order to monitor current developments.
Special missions will of course also be sent to Turkey in the event that this is necessary.
I should also like to make one further point; the sources to which you refer in your question, Mr Claeys, and which speak of systematic torture in Turkey, come from a political camp which you would not normally use as a reference source, and one which is diametrically opposed to your political position.
You would not normally associate yourself with views that come from this part of the political spectrum.
I am merely pointing this out for your information.
With regard to the second question, as a candidate country Turkey naturally undertakes to comply fully with the political criteria, as do all candidate countries.
Ensuring that this does in fact happen in future is regarded by the Commission as its most important task in relation to Turkey.
Â Â  . Mr Czarnecki, one can, at present, do no more than speculate on this issue.
The Financial Perspective put forward by the Prodi Commission, which covers the period until 2013, does not earmark any funds for a potential accession by Turkey.
This means that it is impossible to comment on the way in which the potential costs of such an accession might be distributed.
There is no way in which detailed comments can be made on this issue at present, as Turkey cannot be expected to join the EU for another 12 to 15 years.
During this period both the European Union and Turkey will experience economic developments which are as yet unknown to us, the budget of the European Union may undergo far-reaching changes of which we are unaware, and expenditure on related policies may also change.
As a basic principle, it will be possible for any matters which require regulation to be regulated under the Accession Treaty, including matters relating to costs.
Turkeyâs accession will not cost more than the Member States and the Community budget are prepared to spend at that point in time.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MadamÂ President.
MrÂ Verheugen, I should like to take this opportunity to thank you for your personal contribution to the recent EU enlargement, involving my country, Poland, amongst others.
I should also like to thank you for providing us with an extremely important piece of information, namely that Turkey may join the EU in 2019, but no earlier.
I have an additional question to put to you, MrÂ Verheugen.
Do you believe that EU funding will tend to be used mostly to eliminate differences between Turkish regions and European regions or mostly to support Turkish agriculture?
Â Â  . Mr Czarnecki, firstly I should like to extend my sincere thanks for the compliment.
As in the case of Poland, the elimination of regional disparities will of course also be an important factor if Turkey ever joins the EU.
At present, however, it is still entirely impossible to comment on the financial implications this will have.
I should merely like to point out that there is an upper ceiling for resource transfers into the new Member States, as well as into the old ones, which is set at 4% of gross national product.
This means that the transfer of unlimited quantities of money is impossible.
In fact this 4% ceiling has never been reached for the large Member States such as Spain, Italy or Poland, and it never will be.
It is therefore reasonably safe to assume that, when the time comes, it will not be a question of comparing Turkey with Estonia or Lithuania, but rather with Spain or Poland, and this means figures of a very different order.
Â Â  . This is a very complex issue, Mr Posselt.
The Commission attaches great importance to the ongoing reforms of public administration and the judiciary in both countries.
Not only must these reforms ensure that both countries are able to meet the conditions for membership, but they must also, above all, guarantee that after accession both countries are able to honour their commitments effectively as Member States.
Signs of concrete progress have recently emerged in Romania, for example the formal adoption of a strategy to accelerate reform of public administration, the 2003 strategy on reform of the judiciary and the adoption of three fundamental laws for judicial reform in June 2004.
Romania still needs to ensure, however, that these measures are implemented successfully.
A strategy was adopted in Bulgaria over a year ago on reform of the public administration, not least as a result of a great deal of pressure on my part, and in general the country is making good progress with its implementation.
I must make it clear, however, that major efforts are still required in order to make improvements to the organisation of work, to the administrative capacity necessary for implementation of the and in particular to the management structures of the Bulgarian administration.
With regard to the judiciary, Bulgaria is continuing to make progress in implementing the 2001 strategy on judicial reform, even though there have been delays in certain areas.
The Commission is closely monitoring developments in this field, and has supported these reforms by means of pre-accession assistance and close cooperation with other donors, including the Member States.
Reforms of public administration and the judiciary are among the absolute priorities to be supported in the framework of PHARE multi-annual programming for 2004-2006.
In addition, informal committees on reforms of the public administration and judiciary will be set up in order to conduct a structured dialogue with both countries on these issues and to monitor and support the extension of operative capacities in both fields.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Following the summer holidays I received a huge number of enquiries from people living in my electoral district relating to this issue, in particular with regard to the extremely slow progress of border controls at the borders between Bulgaria and Romania and between Bulgaria and Turkey, with such controls often being halted entirely for hours at a time and the delays lasting for up to twelve hours.
The issue of corruption was also raised in a great many of these complaints.
As these complaints have raised the specific issues of border controls and corruption, I should like to ask you for your views on both of these.
Â Â  . Mr Posselt, I am of course also aware of these complaints, and indeed some of the complaints we receive are probably the same.
The Commission looks into all of them.
As far as border controls are concerned, we are working with both countries to improve the system, albeit not always successfully, as is apparent, and in fact the programmes are not yet complete.
Overall, however, we believe that there has been an improvement.
With regard to corruption, you know that I have made very frequent reference to the issue in this House, and that all our progress reports call on Romania and Bulgaria to take firmer, more transparent and more decisive action in the fight against it.
Although there are signs of progress in both countries, overall I should like to make it clear that I am not yet satisfied with the progress made in the fight against corruption in either of them.
During the talks I held with both regions this stood at the top of the list of issues where the Commission expects to see significant improvements.
In any case, I should like to make it clear that, before any possible accession by Romania and Bulgaria, they need to have effective legislation and effective institutions in place to fight corruption.
Â Â  . The contribution made by the Commission under the Structural Funds to the development of the northern regions of Greece consists not only in the implementation of operative programmes in individual sectors, but also in the running of the INTERREG programmes within the framework of Community initiatives.
These programmes provide for the funding of measures to promote cross-border, transnational and transregional cooperation in the regions of EU Member States.
The European Union provides cofinancing for structural policy measures in the Greek regionsÂ under the third Community Support Framework for Greece, which covers the period from 2000 to 2006, and programmes have been agreed for the regions of Western, Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, the aim of which is to promote development and structural adjustment.
A planned total of EURÂ 2.7Â billion in public funding is to be allocated to measures in the three regions in question, with EURÂ 2Â billion, or 75%, being provided under the Structural Funds.
Although extremely good progress has been made with measures to improve local infrastructure, delays have unfortunately been experienced with measures to improve the performance of the local economy and the labour market and with those to promote use of human potential, due to the difficulty of implementing these measures.
In many cases, the actual implementation of these extremely complex and ambitious programmes remains too demanding a task for the authorities responsible.
In addition to these sources of funding, the above-mentioned regions also receive significant amounts of funding via the operative programmes implemented throughout the country under the Community Support Framework for Greece, and over 65% of Structural Funds earmarked for Greece flow through these horizontal programmes.
The northern regions are also involved in a number of cross-border programmes, which include firstly the EURÂ 46.6Â million INTERREG programme for Greece and Turkey, which was approved in late 2003, although no measures have yet been implemented under it.
The second of these programmes is the cross-border INTERREG/PHARE programme for Greece and Bulgaria, for which EURÂ 254Â million have been earmarked.
A large number of projects have begun under this programme, including measures in the field of transport infrastructure.
Thirdly, the northern regions are involved in INTERREG/CARDS for Greece and Albania, as well as INTERREG/CARDS for Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
EUR 126Â million are earmarked for the programme with Albania, as well as EUR 103Â million for that with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and several programmes are underway, including those relating to economic development and employment.
The INTERREG/CARDS programmes are likely to be converted shortly into Neighbourhood Programmes in order to promote and strengthen cooperation between Greece and Albania and between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Pre-accession assistance for Turkey will begin with the 2004 programme, and includes a component for cross-border cooperation between Turkey and Greece, with annual funding of around EURÂ 2Â million at present.
The projectâs aim is to improve cross-border cooperation between Greece and Turkey at a local level and to support the development of the economic potential of border regions.
It is expected that funding for these measures will be increased in future years.
One of the focuses of the PHARE programme for cross-border cooperation between Bulgaria and Greece, which currently receives EURÂ 20Â million in funding annually, has been infrastructure, and in particular the rehabilitation of regional roads with access to the two existing border crossings.
There are also plans for the cofinancing of three new border crossings with approach roads, of which one is nearing completion.
To date over two thirds of programme funds have been allocated to this priority.
Environmental issues are second on the list of priorities, and after Bulgaria and Romania join the EU cross-border cooperation between Greece and Bulgaria will be promoted under INTERREG on both sides of the border.
Â Â  â Madam President, following the transition to the Europe of the 25, the definition of border regions has surely also changed.
My question is clear: will we have a differentiated extension and extension in time of the scope of this truly useful Community action?
Moreover, the Commission itself has confirmed that the Greek regions in question face very serious problems according to criteria of income, the strength of the labour market and human resources.
Madam President, in conclusion I should like congratulate Commissioner Verheugen most warmly on the significant contribution he has made to the enlargement of the European Union.
Â Â  . Thank you, MrÂ Papastamkos, for your kind words of appreciation.
I should like to try once again to explain this in my own words.
There are three different programmes covering the north of Greece, including firstly those relating to cross-border cooperation with Bulgaria, a future Member State.
As soon as Bulgaria joins the EU, this programme will be discontinued and replaced by a normal INTERREG programme at the border between Bulgaria and Greece, as is usually the case between Member States.
This does not, however, mean that less money will be provided; it will merely be a different programme.
Greece also has a joint programme with the neighbouring countries of Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which are not yet candidate countries.
Provision has therefore been made here for another programme, and the Commission is planning to combine these instruments into a single Neighbourhood Programme in order to simplify matters.
This programme will run for the whole of the next Financial Perspective.
It is not my impression that a lower level of funding is to be expected at this border, indeed rather the opposite, in view of the high priority accorded to the Western Balkans in our strategic considerations.
Thirdly, programmes exist in relation to the border with the candidate country Turkey, and more funding will be made available for this border region as part of the intensive cooperation with Turkey, which is only in its initial stages.
Overall, it can be said that purely technical alterations will be made to certain aspects of the situation in the Greek border regions, but that there is no reason to expect that funding will be reduced; in fact, it is more likely that the opposite will be true.
Â Â  Question No 44 will be answered in writing.
In the spring of 2004, Advocate-General Phillipe Leger of the Court of Justice declared the Swedish State monopoly on pharmacies to be contrary to EU competition principles.
Final judgment in the Hanner case is expected during the year but, usually, the Court of Justice adheres to the opinion of the Advocate-General.
In the light of this opinion concerning pharmacies, what is the Commission's view of the future for the Swedish State monopoly on the sale of alcoholic beverages, Systembolaget?
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the Court of Justice may adhere to the opinion of the Advocate-General, it should be emphasised that such an opinion is not legally binding either on the Commission or on any other party.
That is also true for the opinion that Advocate-General LÃ©ger issued on 25 May 2004 in case C-438/02 Ãklagaren versus Krister Hanner, regarding the compatibility of Apoteket, the monopoly that exists in Sweden for the distribution of medicinal products, with certain Treaty provisions on the free movement of goods and the right of establishment (Articles 28, 31 and 43).
With regard to Systembolaget, the distribution system for alcoholic beverages in Sweden, the Court of Justice has already made a pronouncement on that monopolyâs compatibility with Article 31 of the Treaty, in its ruling of 23 October 1997 on the FranzÃ©n case.
The article states that the structure and activity of State monopolies must be organised so as to ensure that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of Member States, so that trade in goods from another Member State shall not suffer any disadvantage in law or in fact compared with a domestic product.
Having thoroughly examined the Systembolaget system with regard to points of sale, choice of products and promotional activities, the Court decided that the monopoly sales structure of Systembolaget was compatible with Article 31 of the Treaty.
In the current state of affairs, the FranzÃ©n ruling provides the Commission with a guideline from a legal point of view in the context of assessing the compatibility of Systembolaget with EU rules.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the Commission for that answer, which I think was an extremely good one.
The reason for the question is that not only the issue of pharmacies but also that of the Swedish state monopoly on the sale of alcoholic beverages, Systembolaget, is mentioned in the Advocate-Generalâs opinion.
I interpret the answer as saying that the Commission does not today believe that there are any problems with Systembolaget and considers that its activity is compatible with the EUâs regulations, a position I think is a wise one.
Â Â  . I have nothing to add at this stage.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to underline the fact that the state aid that has been recalled, because it is considered illegal and incompatible, is to be returned to the Member State in question and not to the Commission.
This is a misapprehension that crops up occasionally: whereas a fine imposed by the Commission for a cartel or abuse of a dominant position is credited to the Community budget, an order for reimbursement of illegal and incompatible state aid requires a transfer of money from the firm that wrongfully received it to the Member State in question and not to the Community budget.
According to the case law of the Court of Justice and Article 10 of the Treaty, when a Member State encounters difficulty in enforcing a Commission decision requiring the reimbursement of an illegal and incompatible state aid, the Member State and the Commission must cooperate in order to find a solution to the difficulty.
It is not a case of negotiation, and the Commissionâs decisions remain valid in all respects.
This kind of cooperation is currently taking place between Spain and the Commission.
The Commission does not intend to review the decisions in question since that would create a distortion of competition in the EU shipbuilding market.
In recent years the Commission has received a large number of complaints from EU competitors regarding the aid granted to Spanish shipyards.
Moreover, it would seem impossible, anyway, from a legal viewpoint, to authorise the aid in question, in view of the condition not to grant any further aid in future to Spanish shipyards, which was laid down by the Council back in 1997 and repeated in Article 5 of the regulation on aid to shipbuilding that was applicable at the time when the aid was granted.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, the truth is that the request for withdrawal or return of aid is an immense blow to the Spanish shipbuilding sector, a strategic sector.
You are well aware, as I am, that the vast majority of the worldâs heavy ships are directly or indirectly subsidised.
This aid is permitted within the European Union and different formulae have been sought through regional governments, by unifying the private and military shipbuilding sectors.
I would therefore urge the Commissioner and the political leadership of the European Union to reconsider this idea of preventing subsidisation of the shipbuilding sector, which is a strategic sector for Europe, particularly in view of the unfair competition on the part of Korea and the protectionism of the United States of America.
Â Â  . Thank you for this complementary question, which raises a point of general interest.
The Commission is perfectly aware of the importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe and also of the importance the shipbuilding industry attaches to a level playing field within Europe, which would be at odds with an unregulated system of State aid to shipbuilding.
There have been two recent visible signs of the importance the Commission attaches to this sector.
First, you mentioned unfair Korean competition: you will certainly be aware of the Commission's bold initiative â which unfortunately took a long time to be reflected in a Council decision â firstly to bring Korea to the WTO and secondly, at the same time, to put in place a temporary defensive mechanism against unfair Korean competition.
The second visible sign of interest is the Leadership 2015 programme, which was coordinated by the Commission with the participation of representatives of the European Parliament and the shipbuilding industry, to identify a number of proactive policies.
This gives you an indication of how the Commission, with the other European institutions, has tried to accommodate the needs of the sector, while at the same time trying to comply with the law when it comes to specific subsidies.
As you know, in the case of IZAR there is a whole history of non-compliance with the rules.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to ask the Commissioner, in view of the international situation he has referred to and Europeâs situation in relation to the World Trade Organisation and unfair competition on the part of Korea, whether the Commission would be in favour of revising its current policy on State aid to the European shipbuilding industry.
Â Â  . It is rather unusual to talk about the policy intentions of the Commission when â this Parliament permitting â the term of office of the present European Commission is only seven more days.
They will be very intensive days, at least for competition policy.
As far as the question on shipbuilding is concerned, and without, of course, committing our successors to a policy along the lines I have just described â namely, rigorous control of compliance with the existing, fairly generous rules for this sector, as well as active measures to promote, in cooperation with the industry, the sector's development â I would expect this kind of policy to be pursued.
Â Â  . â Madam President, with reference to Mrs Sbarbatiâs oral question, to tell the truth I should like to underline the speed with which the Commission has followed up this case, as it only learnt about it through the complaints received from 6 March 2003 onwards.
The decision to begin the formal investigation procedure was actually adopted on 17 September 2003, once information had been forwarded by the Italian authorities on 4 July 2003.
Besides, the applicable regulation does not set any time limit for the examination of a case by the Commission.
Lastly, I must point out that the Commission adopted the decision to close the formal investigation procedure on 20 October 2004, or five weeks after receiving the final details from Italy.
With regard to the second part of the question, the articles that appeared in the press before the Commission adopted its decision were based on information that did not come from the Commission itself, which only informs the media of its decisions after they have been adopted, usually by means of a press conference and/or press release.
Finally, the Commissionâs decision specifies that Italy must order all the beneficiaries to refund the incompatible aid, with interest, and it must inform the Commission of the measures implemented and planned in order to comply with the decision within two months.
The Commission is monitoring the recovery procedure and may take the case to the Court of Justice if it is not properly carried out.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wish to state that I am quite satisfied with the Commissionerâs answer, and I take the opportunity to thank him not only for all he has done in carrying out his mandate for Europe but also for the prestige he has brought to our country.
Â Â  . â May I just thank MrsÂ Sbarbati very much for her kind words?
Thank you.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of state aid is raised every time there is a natural disaster.
As a result of the EUâs enlargement, Objective 1 or 2 areas in border regions are now bordered by other areas which have been deprived of this status.
Do you believe it possible that temporary exceptions relating to state aid could be put in place for these border regions in future?
Â Â  . Unfortunately Europe, like every other area of the world, is no stranger to natural disasters.
There have been a number in recent years.
I am sure that some of us will remember the huge floods in Germany and Austria only a few years ago.
With the support of Parliament, the Commission has tried to put in place appropriate mechanisms, within the limits of the financial resources available.
These included the monitoring of state aid â subsidies or contributions from national budgets â and also direct contributions from the Community budget.
As regards the 'Tremonti Bis' law referred to in MrsÂ Sbarbati's oral question, the Commission was not questioning whether companies suffering the consequences of natural disasters should be helped.
The issue was whether the way the law was formulated enabled that objective to be met.
Â Â  . â Madam President, this short series of questions shows the variety of topics on which the Commission has been active in the field of competition.
I should like to say in reply to Mr Staes that he must surely be aware of the fact that early in 2003 the Commission began an investigation into the inkjet and laser printer market.
Since then, the Commission has gathered a large amount of evidence and held many talks with printer manufacturers and reconditioned cartridge suppliers.
Our inquiries have focused on the problem of determining whether the printer manufacturers are infringing Community competition rules because of the shapes and prices of their cartridges.
The investigation is extremely complex in both economic and legal terms.
The Commission is currently completing its analysis of the evidence gathered, and at this stage it is still too early to say whether or not there has been any infringement of competition law or whether the proceedings can be closed.
The Commission will, of course, make any further news on this matter public as soon as possible.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his response.
I should nevertheless like to point out â and I have investigated this for myself â that 75 cl of ink-jet printer ink is more expensive than a bottle of champagne.
That is surely absurd.
I very much have the impression that this is a case of tied selling, whereby printers are sold at bargain prices and ink is very much overpriced.
For the time being, I content myself with the Commissionerâs response, but I should like to note that this inquiry should be completed urgently, because this is not benefiting the consumer.
Â Â  . Thank you for that observation.
I can assure you that the Commission will make public all the relevant elements.
We are not yet in a position to find out whether there has been an infringement.
You will certainly be aware that the Commission does not have the role of a price regulator.
We live and work in a social market economy and it is of paramount importance that the Commission ensures that the conditions for competition are in place, pursuant to European law.
These may or may not lead to consumers perceiving prices to be high.
It would not be right in an efficient market economy for the Commission to set prices.
This is not an option.
But I am sure that just as this Commission did, the incoming Commission will closely monitor all the phenomena which might violate competition rules, causing adverse effects for European consumers.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
I will now bring the questions to you to a close, so that Questions No 49 and 50 will be answered in writing.
We will now move on to the next group of issues.
Â Â  . I would first like to thank MrsÂ McGuinness for this question.
The main objective of the food labelling legislation in the EU is to provide consumers with factual information regarding the characteristics of foodstuffs, such as composition, quantity and shelf-life.
Under EU food law, origin labelling is not mandatory, unless the origin is clearly connected with one or more characteristics of a foodstuff, or it is necessary that the purchaser should not be misled as to its true origin, for instance where its name includes a geographical reference.
Origin labelling in itself would not provide the consumer with clear information as regards animal welfare or methods of production.
We continue to work through international organisations to improve world standards in areas such as animal welfare.
This would offer the best way forward in meeting the honourable Member's concerns about the application of these rules in third countries.
As regards standards of food safety, all food and feed placed on the market in the EU must be safe, irrespective of where it comes from.
Third countries may only export food products to the EU if stringent conditions are met and a verification mission has been carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office.
In addition, obligatory checks are carried out on all imports of animal products at the point of entry, in the EU border inspection posts.
The recently adopted Food and Feed Regulation aims to harmonise controls on all other imported food products.
These measures ensure that the food standards applied in the export sector of third countries trading with the EU meet EU food safety requirements.
Â Â  At the outset, I wish to compliment the Commissioner on his good work in a very difficult area.
There have never been as many issues about food safety, and he has been there to protect consumers.
You are correct in saying that food labelling is not enough to protect consumers.
I have recently learnt that, in Ireland, beef from South America has been found to be labelled as Irish.
That has to be a cause for concern in terms of misleading consumers.
Would the Commissioner just comment on that as an area where the new Commission should certainly take an interest, since, if consumers are to have accurate information, we need to tighten up on labelling.
I am not calling for a police force for food, but it certainly looks as if we need something more than we currently have.
Â Â  . I would firstly like to thank Mrs McGuinness for her kind words about the work I have been doing over the past five years.
I much appreciate that.
On the issue of her supplementary question: there is specific legislation relating to beef labelling, namely Regulation No 1760/2000, which specifies the particular requirements in relation to beef, including its origin, and was enacted in response to the issues surrounding the BSE controversy some years ago.
Any labelling in any Member State which mis-states the origin of the beef in question is a failure to comply with that piece of legislation.
The Commission is always concerned at any failure to comply with EU law.
If this has happened on any occasion in Ireland or indeed anywhere else in the manner that you have described, this is a clear failure of compliance with EU legislation.
In those circumstances it is a matter for the competent authorities of the Member States, and in this instance the competent authorities in Ireland, to ensure that any failure to comply with EU legislation is properly investigated and dealt with in the appropriate manner.
It certainly would not be the wish of the Commission to see any failure to comply with legislation of this kind and this is a matter which should be dealt with properly and by the competent authorities of the Member State in question.
Â Â  My question is about the Commission's position on the fact that the law of the Russian Federation on additional guarantees and compensations for military servicemen etc., in its versions of 21 January 1993, 21Â JulyÂ 1993 etc. âŠ
Â Â  I regret that I have to interrupt you, MrÂ Landsbergis.
What I have heard so far does not appear to relate to the question, and you can only put supplementary and specific questions on this point.
The extent of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the best advice to offer to expectant women remains controversial.
A recent study by Dr Raja Mukherjee, London, claims that drinking any amount of alcohol can be damaging and that one in every 100 babies born is damaged by their mother drinking while pregnant but that many cases go unrecognised.
Studies in the US, South Africa and Scandinavia suggest that one in 300 infants is affected by FAS.
Affected children can suffer problems with memory, attention span, hyperactivity, physical abnormalities and a diminished IQ.
There is a need for further research into FAS.
However, heavy alcohol consumption is known to be damaging to the unborn child and some EU governments recommend a limit of one to two units of alcohol per week for pregnant mothers-to-be.
In the light of this does the Commission have any plans to introduce EU legislation requiring alcoholic beverages to carry warning labels about the potential for damage to unborn children?
Â Â  . First of all, I thank Mrs Stihler for this important question.
I fully share her concerns on this issue.
Foetal Alcohol Syndrome â FAS â is a mental and physical disorder that can include mental retardation, brain dysfunction, physical abnormalities, learning disabilities and psychological disorders.
FAS occurs as the result of prenatal alcohol exposure.
Recent studies increasingly suggest that there may be no clearly safe drinking limit above zero alcohol for pregnant women.
Key elements to prevent FAS are awarenessâraising and consumer information.
The Commission is at present developing a working paper on a coordinated approach in Europe to tackle alcoholârelated harm.
FAS is one of the possible topics to be addressed in the paper.
The Commission is carefully studying the types of information that should be provided in addressing this problem.
Possible guidelines on these could be included in the Commission's working paper on alcohol, which is planned for next year.
The Commission also intends to prepare a report on the application of Council recommendations on alcohol and young people from 2001, which, among other things, will address the need for further action.
In addition, the possibility of having a conference on alcohol next year, together with the WHO European office, is being explored.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that we should not forget the central role of our Member States in tackling alcoholârelated harm.
An integrated approach needs concerted action by all stakeholders, including families, schools, employers, industry, advertisers and national regulators.
Â Â  Thank you for that answer, Commissioner Byrne.
I also thank you for all the work that you have done over the past five years on the public health agenda. It is much appreciated.
As you said, new research suggests that in some cases, one in a hundred babies could be affected.
Other research suggests that the figure is one in three hundred.
In fact, according to Friday's , which dealt with what is happening in France, about 7Â 000 babies born there are thought to be mentally or physically damaged by passive consumption of alcohol in the womb.
Mr Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French Minister for Health, said that FAS was 'aside from genetic factors, the prime cause of mental retardation in children'.
This is clearly a European issue and one that we have to take seriously.
I hope that the Commission's alcohol strategy will look at what is happening in the United States of America, where alcohol products are properly labelled with a health warning.
Commissioner, how can we make the possibility a reality?
Â Â  . Thank you for that supplementary question and for your kind words, MrsÂ Stihler.
I appreciate that.
As you may know, DG SANCO is at present preparing a Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm, as called for in the Council conclusions in 2001.
Several areas for action have been identified as key areas.
One of them is consumer information, to improve awareness of the risks connected with the consumption of alcoholic beverages.
At the moment the draft proposals concern the legal and practical feasibility of having health warnings on the containers of alcoholic beverages, as well as at points of sale.
These would include information on, for instance, pregnancy.
If the public health authorities do not move in and occupy the field, it might well be occupied by industry.
That is not entirely satisfactory, because the information being made available by the industry might not be consistent with best public health practice.
I look forward to further discussion of this important issue in the future.
Â Â  . Two inspections carried out by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office in Greece, in July 2003, March and April 2004, revealed breaches of Community requirements with regard to procedures for licensing abattoirs and respect of hygiene requirements.
These findings confirm the results of earlier FVO missions.
Based on Commission recommendations, commitments were received from the Greek authorities on action to rectify these deficiencies.
As regards the new Rentis market, there has been slipping in the timetable notified by the Greek authorities for its construction.
According to our latest information, the construction works are scheduled for completion in mid-2006.
Despite the fact that the Commission has had a number of high-level contacts with the Greek authorities in recent years about the food control system, progress has not been satisfactory.
This relates to the specific issue of insufficient staffing levels in the Greek veterinary service to ensure effective implementation of EU veterinary legislation.
That is why, in May 2004, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Greek authorities urging them to remedy this situation.
In the absence of appropriate assurances from the Greek authorities, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Greece on 18 October, asking the Greek Government to address effectively the problem of understaffing in its veterinary services within a period of two months. Failure to do so could lead the Commission to bring the case before the Court of Justice.
The Commission is also considering similar action in relation to the control systems in Greece for the approval of red meat establishments.
The Commission has been keeping the situation in Greece under close review and intends to continue to ensure that the necessary corrective actions are taken.
Â Â  . Mental Health is indeed a priority of the Communityâs public health policy and under the Public Health Programme (2003-2008).
Under its first strand, dealing with health information, the Working Party on Mental Health has been created, bringing together project leaders and stakeholders.
In the 2005 work plan, the focus of activities will be on promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in children, adolescents and young people, based on improved data collection and analysis.
There can be no doubt that human rights and humane treatment are fundamental to mental health practice.
The Commission welcomes the recent adoption of the Council of Europeâs recommendation concerning the protection of the human rights and dignity of persons with mental disorders.
It also supports the UN standard rules for the equalisation of opportunities for people with disabilities as well as the efforts to establish a UN legally binding instrument to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.
The Commission is fully engaged in the negotiations on this instrument.
The Commission is aware of the use of caged beds within psychiatric and social care facilities in Hungary and Slovenia as well as in Slovakia and the Czech Republic and welcomes the report on this issue that was published in 2003 by the Mental Disability Advocacy Center.
As a result of this report, the Commission made enquiries about the exact position on the use of caged beds in these countries and drew the attention of the national authorities to the necessity to remedy this problem.
According to information then received by the Commission, it appeared that the situation was improving. It was reported that Hungary has imposed a caged bed ban that will come fully into force at the beginning of 2005.
In the Czech Republic, caged beds are reported as being gradually replaced.
The Commission has launched a study on conditions in institutions in all the 25 Member States in order to establish the situation that currently exists, with a focus on disabled persons.
The findings of this study, undertaken by Inclusion Europe, were presented in Brussels on 22 and 23 October.
The study confirmed that caged beds, or netted beds â as they are also called â are indeed being used in several Member States, including old and new Member States.
Furthermore, the study showed that the question of caged beds cannot be dissociated from the more general context of living conditions in large residential institutions.
These conditions are sometimes unacceptable and do not respect the most elementary requirements of human respect and dignity.
The study found that community-based residential services provide opportunities, but not guarantees, for better outcomes.
From 2005, the Commission will produce a biennial public report on the overall situation of people with disabilities in the European Union.
The report is intended to provide a useful tool for all disability decision- makers by providing accurate, dynamic and up-to-date information on the situation of people with disabilities throughout the European Union.
The Commission salutes any appropriate efforts to make mental health systems as humane as possible.
We also congratulate Dr Pfeiffer on his nomination as European Hero by Time Magazine.
Â Â  There are not many of us here, but I hope that the answer given by Mr Byrne, our Commissioner, will be widely read.
I would like to place on the record our thanks as a Parliament for his work for public health over the last five years, particularly in the area of mental health and the way he has ensured that this issue has risen up the agenda.
I invite him, as a last clarion call, to repeat that inhumane treatment in mental health is not to be tolerated in this Union.
That includes such things as caged beds, which should not be a part of any country's policy.
As he says, rights and dignity are what we seek.
Rights and dignity are what he has talked about.
Rights and dignity must be the future of European mental health policy.
Â Â  . I should like to respond to my friend John Bowis' kind words to me by saying how much I have appreciated working with this Parliament over the last five years on issues relating to public health, and not least with one of the leaders in Parliament on this subject: Mr Bowis himself.
It has been a pleasure for me to work so closely with such experts in the field for the benefit of our citizens here in the European Union.
I accept his invitation to repeat what I have just said in relation to this issue, that the protection of those with disabilities, particularly those with mental health disorders in the European Union, is of paramount importance.
Their human rights and dignity ought to be respected by all Member States.
This is something that I believe is appropriate, I believe the Commission believes it is appropriate, and I am happy to hear that this House takes the same view.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Exceptionally, and with your permission, I would like, from the Chair, to express my agreement with what you have said and thank you for your work.
Â Â  Madam President, unfortunately I was chairing my group meeting when my question came up.
I should like to apologise to the Commissioner and to the House for not being here to take the question myself.
This is the last opportunity that I will have to thank Commissioner Byrne for all his help and great leadership over many crises over the last five years.
I wish him well.
It will not be retirement for him, but a new phase in his life.
Â Â  . I should like to respond very briefly to my old friend, Mr Crowley, and thank him very much for his kind words.
We have worked together and I now look forward to a deep friendship in the future.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Crowley.
What you have said will be recorded in the Minutes.
I would now like to conclude Question Time.
Questions No 56 to 93 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Brussels European Council on 4 and 5 November.
Minister NicolaÃ¯ has the floor first on behalf of the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 5 November the first European Council under this Netherlands presidency will be held.
The last European Council under a Netherlands presidency took place in Amsterdam in June 1997 and resulted, as you know, in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
There are no such grand ambitions this time around.
However, it will not surprise you that the major topics of the forthcoming European Council coincide with some of the main items discussed seven years ago.
In 1997, as a consequence of the procedures for approval of the Maastricht Treaty â which had caused problems in some Member States â the issue of how the Union could be brought closer to the citizens was added as an agenda item.
That issue has lost none of its immediacy.
At the forthcoming summit we shall also be discussing citizens' involvement in the European Union.
The other important topics for the European Council are: first, a new multiannual programme for justice and home affairs; second, preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the Luxembourg presidency next year; and, third, external relations.
I shall start with cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs.
This is a highly important topic for this European Council.
On the basis of the Tampere European Council programme, much work has been done over the last five years to create a European area of freedom, security and justice.
The European Union has strengthened cooperation between the Member States' justice and police departments and developed policy in the area of asylum, migration and external borders, but the work is not complete.
The problems facing the Union are very much cross-border in nature: terrorism, organised crime, and flows of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants.
In addition, the attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York and 11 March 2004 in Madrid have shown more than ever the extraordinary scale of the challenge of improving citizens' security.
At the same time, the Union must ensure that citizens can continue to enjoy their fundamental freedoms and travel freely within the Union.
The Council has therefore drawn up the programme for the next five years on the basis of the evaluation submitted by the Commission in June.
This new multiannual programme â also called The Hague Programme â builds on the Tampere Programme.
Over the last two days the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers have been discussing this project further in Luxembourg.
The Council has reached broad agreement on the substance of the programme.
The issue of qualified majority voting and codecision on asylum and immigration matters may, however, be the subject of further discussion in the General Affairs Council.
Another point of discussion was the common asylum system.
It seems that a reasonable compromise has been reached on this issue.
The intention is that the European Council should establish the multiannual programme.
The Hague Programme is based on the Constitutional Treaty but does not anticipate it.
The presidency's aim is that the multiannual programme should make maximum use of the possibilities offered by the current Treaty.
Other aspects of the new multiannual programme include combating illegal immigration, a strengthened partnership with third countries and a common visa policy, formulating basic principles for the integration of migrants, effective border surveillance, rapid information exchange between justice, police and security departments, combating terrorism and working towards a genuine European legal area.
These are all essential components of a more secure Europe where the rule of law prevails and each person knows his freedom is a reality.
The intention is that the European Council will ask the Commission to submit an action plan in 2005 with the measures to be adopted and related deadlines for the implementation of this multiannual programme.
The second topic is the preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy.
As you are aware, during the Luxembourg presidency essential issues concerning the Lisbon strategy will be up for discussion.
The Spring Council in March 2005 will have to address the mid-term evaluation of the Lisbon strategy.
The Netherlands presidency wishes to make its contribution to the success of this important Spring Council.
On 4 November the European Council will take note of the report by Wim Kok's working party.
The European Council can subsequently ask the Commission and the Council to use the Kok report as a starting point for their preparation of the Spring Council.
At a dinner for Heads of State and Government, an informal discussion will be held on public support for reform of the Member States' economies under the title 'Managing Change'.
The discussion will be introduced by the German Chancellor, the Prime Minister of Finland and the Prime Minister of Slovakia.
They will share their experiences in this area with the other members of the European Council.
The new President of the Commission will then explain briefly his vision for the future of the Lisbon strategy.
The role of the social partners in implementing the Lisbon strategy will also be on the agenda at this European Council.
Prior to the European Council meeting, the tripartite social summit of employers and employees will take place at European level.
As I said in my introduction, we will also focus on citizens' involvement in the European Union.
Following the disappointing turnout at the last European parliamentary elections, the June European Council decided it was time to return to this matter.
To prepare the discussion in the European Council, the presidency organised an informal meeting of the European Affairs Ministers on 5 October, exclusively devoted to increasing citizens' involvement in Europe.
The meeting focused on the forthcoming ratification procedures in Member States, which entail referenda in at least ten countries.
The outcome of that meeting will serve as the basis for discussion within the European Council.
The third topic of importance to the European Council is external relations.
Four subjects will be discussed.
First, the situation in Iraq: the European Council will examine a package of support measures for Iraq's interim government.
This package will be presented formally during the working lunch with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi.
The package will, I hope, contain a political statement of intent for establishing relations with the EU and also a series of specific measures supporting the Iraqi Interim Government.
Here I am thinking of EU support for the elections early next year, activities relating to civilian crisis management â such as police training â and building up the skills of the judiciary.
Not only will this demonstrate the unity of the European Union, so badly needed following the events of the last year and a half, but it will also allow us in the Union to contribute actively to a real improvement in the situation in Iraq.
The European Council will also address the situation in the Middle East.
We will look at how the EU can further contribute to the peace process in the short and medium term against the background of the political decision in Israel on plans to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.
I cannot say at this stage what might emerge from this discussion.
As far as I am concerned, the five key points formulated at the March European Council are still valid.
The European Council will also briefly discuss Iran.
The international community, which includes the EU, must unanimously continue to put pressure on Iran to totally suspend all enrichment activities and improve its human rights situation.
In this connection, the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on 25 November will be an important benchmark.
Lastly, we will reflect on the situation in Sudan, especially in Darfur.
We must bring pressure to bear on all the parties to achieve progress in the various peace processes.
Our starting point remains that if progress is insufficient, suitable measures â including sanctions â are definitely an option.
The Council will also discuss positive action, including the support the EU can offer to the recently approved extension of the African Union's mission in Darfur.
That is an overview of the forthcoming European Council, for which preparations are currently in full swing.
The presidency will brief you on the outcome of the summit at the November partâsession.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I had actually wanted to start my speech with the words âNext week we will have a new Commissionâ, but today I will leave that to you to decide, ...
... and will say that, whatever happens today, offices are about to be handed over.
The present Commissionâs term of office is coming to an end, and that of a new Commission will begin.
That does not mean, however, that a whole new policy is in the offing; on the contrary, whatever you decide, there will be continuity in the broad outlines of European policy.
It is important to point out that there is no dispute about the great issues facing Europe today, and that European policy will still be reliable, stable and constant even after the offices have changed over.
It was with this in mind that Mr Barroso, whom you have already elected as President of the Commission, reaffirmed yesterday morning that the next Commission, every bit as much as the present one, was committed to creating a competitive Europe and to making the European economy more competitive.
At the heart of these efforts was and is the Lisbon strategy, and it must remain so, with all its essential components intact.
Change is, however, essential in one respect, and that is that we cannot be content with devising plans or ambitious perspectives, but we must also do some serious work on making these plans and ambitions reality, by which I mean really breathing life into this Lisbon strategy.
Another essential aspect on which the President-designate laid stress is the creation of a secure Europe, one that concentrates on the needs of its citizens.
The Europe we want is one that builds up its external relations with all its important partners, with prospective Member States in particular and with its neighbours in general.
The topics with which the European Council intends to deal next week are very closely connected to these issues.
I want to highlight the most important items, with particular reference to the Lisbon strategy and to the new programme for strengthening justice, freedom and security.
The Commission very much welcomes the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, which is now entering its decisive phase; the high-level group chaired by the former Dutch prime minister, Mr Wim Kok, is to present its report next week.
The Commission is working on the assumption that it, on the basis of this report, will be mandated to draft concrete proposals for this mid-term review in preparation for the Councilâs Spring Summit.
This is a time window; it is the moment at which we will be allowed to get the Lisbon strategy onto the right track.
That should not be taken to mean that nothing has happened in the last five years, but there is no point in skirting around the fact that not enough has happened, and the Commission is seriously concerned to note that one Member State after another has, above all, failed to summon up sufficient energy to translate its promises into actions.
This now has to change.
The Commission is still willing to closely consider all the options as to how the process can actually be got moving and can also be better supervised.
The Commission believes that the EU must now really focus on the growth aspect.
There is no doubt that Europe needs dynamic and sustainable growth in order to create more jobs and thus securely underpin our social model.
For that to happen, we need more entrepreneurial initiative, greater willingness to be innovative, and more investment in research and education.
Europe needs us to implement the reforms that make for more economic dynamism.
In order to become a real knowledge-based economic area capable of keeping up with ever-tougher international competition, Europe must play the trump cards it holds in the areas of education, expertise and technical development.
Let me very plainly reiterate, though, that creating a more dynamic and more competitive Europe must go hand in hand with the maintenance of the European social model; only in a more dynamic and more competitive Europe will we be able to uphold that model.
We should not forget that some of our Member States are still far from possessing really adequate social protection.
Competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity must be advanced in parallel, they must, so to speak, move forward in step with each other.
The Lisbon mid-term review gives us the chance to achieve these goals.
I want to point out, in connection with this, that the Commission is not relaxing in its efforts to improve lawmaking, in other words, making it simpler and more comprehensible, and, in particular, to attach more importance to the broadest possible impact assessment, making visible what happens to the sectors of society affected by the laws we make, especially the economy and businesses.
The Presidency has prioritised measures aimed at simplification and those intended to improve impact assessment and to measure administrative costs, and these measures the Commission unreservedly endorses.
