There is an issue of proportionality.
Yes, Cuba violates human rights but not to the extent of Colombia with its death squads or Haiti with the anarchy of criminal gangs and violent politics which have seen more than 1000 deaths.
Hopefully next weekâs elections there might start to bring that to an end.
Where is Parliamentâs constant concern on these and other human rights in the region outside of Cuba?
Where are our concerns about âoccupiedâ Cuba in Guantanamo Bay, where reports indicate that the situation is far worse than Cubaâs worst jails?
Â Â  Of course I believe that Cuba should be a parliamentary democracy.
I also believe, however, that foreign policy is a national matter and that multilateral channels, such as the UN, are the only acceptable alternative for influencing countries not in the immediate vicinity of the EU.
For the above-mentioned reasons, I have voted against the resolution.
Â Â  . Two hundred words will never be enough to undo yet another manoeuvre that forms part of the EUâs policy of isolation and discrimination against Cuba, which panders to the demands of the USA.
This is the same EU that, lest we forget, called for a change to the political system in Cuba in its 1996 common position, thereby interfering in an issue that is exclusively the responsibility of the Cuban people.
The majority in this very Parliament, in a cynical move, criticised the US embargo on Cuba, yet also called for continued sanctions imposed on Cuba by the EU.
Furthermore, it does not manage one single word of solidarity with the five Cuban patriots held in the USA for defending their country against terrorism.
Though it pains the majority in the House, Cuba means hope for, and confidence in, a decent life for millions of men and women.
This is a country that, in spite of the embargo, achieved the highest economic growth in the past 45 years in 2005, a country that is set to take on the presidency of the non-aligned movement and to host its 2006 summit, and a country that sends thousands of doctors, teachers and sports coaches to other countries, rather than armies to occupy, exploit and oppress.
Â Â  . Cuba is proof that in the western world not all of the walls of shame have come down.
Between the absurd idealism of some and the shameless pragmatism of others, there have been those who seem determined to forget that in Cuba there is no democracy, no human rights, no freedom, nothing that we would consider to be the essential building blocks of our societies.
No unfathomable romanticism, nor pragmatism, can justify any change to the essential position: consistent condemnation of Cuba and calls for democratisation, without which it will not be possible to maintain close ties with this tyrannical government.
Â Â  . I have voted for the joint motion for a resolution on Cuba, but it is missing several important facts in the political context.
The main problem in the Cuban situation is caused by the US-led blockade and the aggressive US threats against Cuba.
Putting an end to the blockade and stopping the aggressive threats by the US would be the most important step in creating an atmosphere in which there would be better possibilities to create true democracy in Cuba.
But the aggressive US policy is not the only reason for the severe restrictions on freedom of expression and democracy in Cuba.
The Cuban Government has also its own individual responsibility to bear.
One example, among others, is the decision not to let the Sakharov Prize winners, the leave the country to receive the prize in Strasbourg.
I have voted for the resolution, but I protest against the Cuban Governmentâs travel ban on the .
Â Â  . I have voted in favour of the proposed resolution on Cuba, even though it is missing several important facts in the political context.
The main problem in the Cuban situation is caused by the US-lead blockade and the aggressive US threats against Cuba.
Putting an end to the blockade and stopping the aggressive threats by the US would be the most important step in creating an atmosphere in which there would be better possibilities to create a true democracy in Cuba.
But the aggressive US policy is not the only reason for the severe restrictions on freedom of expression and democracy in Cuba.
The Cuban government also has its own individual responsibility to bear.
One example, among others, is the decision not to let the Sakharov prize-winners, the , leave the country to receive the prize in Strasbourg.
I am voting in favour of the resolution, despite its imperfections, since I want to protest against the Cuban governmentâs travel ban on the .
Â Â  . I reject this resolution on Cuba, which is one-sided and does no justice whatsoever to the complexities of real life in that country.
If we condemn Cuba,
â we are treating as of no account that countryâs efforts at developing in another way, which it is doing in the teeth of resistance from many quarters;
â we are ignoring Cubaâs exemplary achievement in making provision for its peopleâs welfare, which it continues to do despite the American embargo and serious economic problems;
â we are denying that the continued existence of the Cuban system offers a glimmer of hope to those in the so-called Third World who are on the losing side in a globalised world in which markets and profits matter more than anything else.
This resolution takes a reductivist view of the concept of human rights, and the way it makes use of them betrays an intolerable dual morality.
This resolution is not aimed at defending human rights, but rather at condemning the Cuban system and contributing to its downfall.
I will have no part in it.
Â Â  . The implementation of the Community budget, that is, ensuring that political decisions are actually implemented, is an extremely important issue.
Unfortunately the budgetary process is increasingly less transparent and more scattered, making it difficult to ascertain the final destination of funds.
The budget savings imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact and by the major contributing countries has meant that, following adoption of the annual Community budget, many priority areas are underfunded, which has led to a policy of redistribution and cuts across the budgetary headings and countless amending budgets.
In other words, non-execution is encouraged in certain areas to finance others, regardless of the adopted budget.
There are also policies and instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact, that are factors in non-implementation.
In this regard, the Commission and the Council cannot wash their hands of their responsibilities, in view of the constant reduction in payments in respect of authorisations.
National implementation must go hand in hand with the definition of national priorities on the ground, especially when it comes to the Structural Funds.
Irrespective of the instruments that have just been proposed, we do not think that the negotiations on the new financial perspective should be contingent on the proposals being adopted.
Â Â  . The motion for a resolution on which we have just voted highlights the need for new management measures to be taken for the Mediterranean.
Care must always be taken to uphold the principle that the sustainability of fishery resources must be guaranteed in order to ensure that fisheries activities are viable, that fleets can continue to operate, that jobs can be maintained and that fishing communities can be developed.
We therefore feel that the Council must adopt the management regulation on which Parliament has now given its opinion.
Given that the current situation may result in discrimination among fishermen operating in other waters, however, we believe that there must be effective decentralisation and that the main stakeholders, namely the fishermen and their representative bodies, must be involved in management decisions, given that practical measures must reflect the specific realities of each fishing area or region.
We also feel that the management regulation should be accompanied by the necessary measures to compensate for the social and economic impact caused by the regulation itself, with Community funding.
All measures must be based on scientific fisheries research.
Â Â  . There are many instances where an EU of 25Â states does not make sense, and one-size-fits-all does not work any more â if it ever did.
There is no reason why I as a Scottish Member of this house should have a say over the Mediterranean, and I have accordingly abstained on this vote.
The EU needs to find new ways of working to ensure legitimacy of our decisions.
Continuing the notion that everyone is equally interested in everything is untenable and discredits the EU itself.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 2 February 2006.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 9 February 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
The secretariat has just received three requests for amendments to the agenda presented by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
Strictly speaking, according to the Rules of Procedure, these requests have not been presented on time and they should therefore not be taken into consideration.
Nevertheless, the President believes that, since the time difference was very small and also in view of the political importance of the matter, they should be taken into account.
I would insist that this is being done in spite of the fact that they have not been presented on time and only if no political group objects.
I believe that there have been consultations in this regard.
We shall listen firstly to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck who will present the request that in the debate on the right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs, there should not be just one speaker per political group, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents, but that there should be a list of speakers according to the normal procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity I am being given to say a few words in connection with the order of business on Wednesday morning, in respect of which I should like to make a suggestion on behalf of my group.
First of all, I suggest the speaking time on Wednesday morning be divided up evenly over the various groups and individuals, thus ensuring that more time can be devoted to the crucial debate under item 1.
Secondly, we suggest that, should it prove necessary to move one of the items of debate to a later session, that this be the item concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina, not because we see it as unimportant, but because it is less urgent, and it will be equally useful to discuss it during a future session.
Thirdly and lastly, we would like to round off the first item on the order of business with a resolution.
I would like to thank the President once again for his understanding.
I would ask the Members and other groups to support this proposal.
Â Â  We shall examine the proposals one by one, because there is not just one, but several.
The first is that the list of speakers should not be restricted to the Presidents or spokespeople of the political groups; the second, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has explained, asks that the item conclude with a resolution; and the third, which only makes sense in the event that either of the first two proposals are approved, asks for another item, the statements on Bosnia-Herzegovina, to be postponed.
We shall take them one by one: firstly we shall debate and vote on whether or not there should be a list of speakers.
Â Â  If we want to be logical, then we have to voice our opinions about the three requests at the same time.
It would not make sense to accept one of the requests and to reject the others.
I therefore call on you to open the debate by dealing with the three requests at the same time, because they are linked.
Personally speaking, I will come out against the three requests because there is a logic in all of this that needs to be respected.
Â Â  Mr Cohn-Bendit, excuse me but I believe that they are two completely different things: whether or not there is a resolution is one thing.
The number of people speaking in the debate is quite another.
Â Â  Mr President, the point made by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is one that we, in the Conference of Presidents, have discussed in a wider context, and what I said there I shall also say here on behalf of my group.
We do believe that the adoption of a resolution at the present time is not advisable, whereas, by contrast, it is advisable to limit the speaking time in such a very important debate to one speaker from each group.
We therefore take the view that what was decided by the Conference of Presidents, what is set out here in the order of business, should stay the way it is.
Â Â  Mr President, we always listen to you, not only out of respect for your office but also out of regard for you personally.
We must, of course, vote on these points one by one, but they are interconnected, and so I have to say something about how and why that is so.
Let me say at the outset, though, that this is something that we could have sorted out on Thursday in the Conference of Presidents.
I was the only one to demand, on behalf of my group, not only a resolution but also a debate.
As the Liberals were very definitely opposed to the idea, I am astonished that they have now put forward this motion, but that is their right.
We have just now â while in a meeting of our group â been informed that the Liberals were making this request.
To one part of it, we say âyesâ; to another, we say ânoâ.
We say ânoâ to a general debate right now, since that would require us to remove an item from the order of business, and that we do not want to do.
We therefore recommend that this House should, in March or at some appropriate time, have a wide-ranging debate on this issue, but, as far as a resolution is concerned, our group did â as in the past â take the view that we need one.
That being so, Mr President, you are quite right to have us vote on the individual points separately.
Â Â  Mr President, now that the two big groups have realised that everything is connected, we too can depict everything in its proper context.
For a start, Mr Poettering is right to say that the Liberals, in the Conference of Presidents, said that they were not in favour of a broader debate and not in favour of a resolution either.
It was we who, in the Conference of Presidents, expressed the desire for a resolution.
We do not think that the number of speakers matters, but we certainly do think it right that more speakers should be given the floor if the groups feel the need for it.
We are always, as a matter of principle, in favour of resolutions, and we see it as important that this House should adopt one.
We are, however, dead against the idea that the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be taken out of the debate, for the issue of the constitution is a live one in Bosnia at the moment, and it is of the utmost importance that this House should deliver a position in the aftermath of so many American initiatives.
It would therefore be absurd to defer discussion of it, and we are against that.
If we do not manage to adopt a resolution now, then we can go down the third way and have a debate now and leave dealing with the resolution to the next part-session.
Â Â  We shall now vote on the proposal of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that there should be more than one speaker per group.
We shall now vote on whether to accept or reject the proposal of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that the debate should conclude with a resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, that is something of which we have to take note.
The question arises of whether we can come back to MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs proposal that, in view of the current situation and Mr Solanaâs visit to these countries, we could adopt the resolution at the next part-session.
I see that as a reasonable compromise on which we might agree.
Â Â  The time for negotiations has passed, Mr Swoboda.
We have voted.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, please excuse me.
It is true that the time for compromises has already passed, but the request by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe arrived after the deadline.
Therefore, we are debating a compromise now only because we were unable to do so previously.
Â Â  Mrs Frassoni, I asked earlier whether anybody had any objection to the proposals being debated despite the fact that they had arrived late, and nobody expressed any opposition.
The vote cannot be invalidated.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would never take the liberty of invalidating a vote.
I merely asked that MrÂ Swobodaâs request to postpone this resolution until the next part-session be put to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, a member of the Liberal Group has put several motions to the House.
The Rules of Procedure provide for a decision for or against them.
We in this plenary, rather than discussing whether to vote for or against a motion intended to correct a decision by the Conference of Presidents, are staging a rerun of it.
The only speakers in this debate are group chairmen arguing against their decision being corrected, and the reference to Mr Solana is obviously meant to indicate that the House is willing to refrain from exerting its influence, but the fact is that, if we wait until he has got back, this House will scarcely be able to have any influence on his policy.
I propose that we stick to the Rules of Procedure and call speakers to speak for or against, rather than having the House repeat what has been said in the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  We have already voted, Mr Voggenhuber.
We now have to see whether there is another proposal that can be put to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I regret having to say this as much as I regret our being in the situation we are in, but we have just voted on whether there is to be a resolution.
We said yes to one, and if there is to be one, it has to be voted on this week and not in March or at some even later date.
Â Â  I can tell Mr Poettering that I am opposed, and I also want to explain why.
This week, this whole House is going to have its hands full of this Services Directive, and I see no chance of a proper resolution and compromise in these three days.
That, after all, is why we proposed it last week!
That is why I think Mr Swobodaâs suggestion is a sensible one.
This House does indeed need a resolution on this issue, but it also needs to be given the chance to put a proper resolution together, and that is why we should start the debate now and then follow it up by voting on this resolution at the next part-session.
That would be the sensible thing to do.
All you will be able to adopt in these three days is banalities, and I believe that this issue deserves better than that.
Â Â  Mr President, I am in absolute agreement with what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, but I would also like to say that I am rather irritated about much of what has been going on here.
I had, quite properly, spoken to a motion on the order of business, on which one can speak in favour or against; I spoke in favour of the motion and you reprimanded me for it, saying that we had asked for a debate, and I still cannot follow your reasoning.
We are now having a debate, and Mr Voggenhuber is complaining that that is not right either, on the grounds that only group chairmen are speaking.
Somehow or other, then, we have to get some structure behind what we are doing, and so I will now put it to you that if the motion from the Liberal Group was called for debate despite being received outside the specified timeframe, then there is no less justification for my colleague Mr Swobodaâs motion that, it having been decided that a resolution is to be drafted, we ask that the vote on it be deferred until the next mini-plenary in Brussels, which is the first possible opportunity to do so.
I would ask that we now have a vote, as the rules of procedure require, following one speaker in favour and one against.
Â Â  Very good, now we have the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, on which the Presidency will allow a vote, that the vote on this resolution take place at the next part-session in Brussels.
Â Â  Mr President, I would just like to point out that there is â thank heavens â to be no mini-plenary in Brussels; instead the next proper plenary session is here in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Very good, thank you for your observation.
Â Â  Mr President, this conflict is being discussed not only throughout Europe, not just in all the newspapers, not just by the man and woman in the street day in and day out; it is a conflict with profound implications and is being talked about around the world.
It surely cannot be the case that one institution alone does not discuss it, does not adopt a resolution on it, that the European Parliament, which the people elected to represent them, should choose to keep silent about one of the greatest conflicts Europe has seen.
It just cannot be true!
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that the vote on the resolution should take place during the next part-session.
We still have to vote on the third proposal from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that an item on the agenda be postponed, namely the Outlook for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Â Â  I believe that there has been enormous confusion in the debate and in the vote that has taken place.
Since the House has accepted that there should be just one speaker per group, there is no reason to alter the agenda and the debate will remain as scheduled and approved by the Conference of Presidents.
The only thing that is changing, Mr President, is that there will be a resolution, nothing more.
Â Â  We will all have to be disciplined in our use of speaking time so that we can deal with all of the subjects and none is left out.
If you promise to do that, we will not have to alter the agenda.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to draw your attention to a recent conference held in London on drugs in Afghanistan.
We face a grave threat from a flood of heroin made from the Afghan poppy, destroying the lives of Europeans, especially young Europeans.
As Chairman of the Afghan Circle in the European Parliament, I know the problem faced by the leaders of Afghanistan, whom I have met many times, with over 60% of their economy being dependent on the poppy.
The countries of the region came together for the first time at the London conference to offer support to Afghanistan.
Regional cooperation is the way forward.
The distinguished Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, MrÂ Tokaev, for example, said that Kazakhstan is funding a programme which provides Afghan farmers with alternative seeds, equipment and advice on growing alternative crops.
Others are doing the same and, as you know, Britain is playing a leading role in the war against drugs.
Our Parliament should have a debate on the global menace of drugs.
We talk about terrorism and avian flu, but drugs are destroying many peopleâs lives.
Â Â  The Directive regulating the legal status of third country nationals residing legally in the European Union came into force on 23 January.
They will now be able to work, study or reside in another European Union Member State, as well.
We, the Socialists of the new Member States, have always supported the integration of those arriving from third countries.
However, we cannot accept a situation where they are in a more favourable position on the labour market than the labour force of the new Member States.
Post-enlargement labour market movement statistics do not justify the fear of social dumping.
The Commission report, accepted on 8 February, states that the positive effect of labour force movement is a decisive factor.
However, the Austrian Presidency still supported the extension of restrictions.
The task of the European Parliament is to represent all European citizens.
Therefore I call upon all my colleagues in this House to engage in a process of joint thinking, so that we can eliminate this contradiction as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, the European citizens lack a common language.
The Unionâs institutions therefore have services to make communication possible.
In Spain, the existence of Castilian as a common language and its recognition as the Stateâs official language does not prevent the recognition of the citizensâ right to use other Spanish languages which have official status: Galician, Catalan and Basque.
All of them are European languages as well, they belong to the European area â or hyper-area â of communication, and have a European vocation.
The Spanish Government has proposed a formula for the administrative agreement to promote, without any cost to the Community institutions nor to the other Member States, the reasonable use of these languages at Union level.
This proposal conforms to the linguistic legislation in force and has been accepted by the Council and the Committee of the Regions.
Mr President, I do not know of any reason why there has not been any progress on their acceptance, since the conditions for the cooperation requested have been met, Parliamentâs role as the house of the citizens will be enhanced, institutional coherence will be provided and democratic value will be created.
Our institution cannot be left behind everybody else in this field.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am from Leipzig.
Three weeks ago now, two engineers were abducted in Iraq, and there is so far no sign of them being still alive other than a video message in which their captors threaten to kill them both.
This is upsetting not only their relatives and immediate family, but also a very, very large number of people in Leipzig, who are very worried and are expressing their sadness in prayers for peace and vigils.
An abduction of this sort is not a merely national matter; since both men are both German and European citizens, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission what they have done in the meantime to save these hostagesâ lives, and I beg them to send a message of solidarity and practical help.
I ask you, Mr President, to do likewise on behalf of this House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like simply to draw our fellow Membersâ attention to the dreadful and tragic situation of the wine growers from southern Europe and, more specifically, from the Languedoc-Roussillon region, thousands â tens of thousands â of whom will take to the streets in the large cities of southern France this Wednesday in order to voice their distress.
A wine growerâs annual turnover is EURÂ 20Â 000.
His fixed costs come to EURÂ 15Â 000, which leaves him with EURÂ 5Â 000 on which to live throughout the entire year.
We know what is behind this tragic situation: unreasonable free trade agreements, like the ones concluded as recently as November 2005 with the United States, South Africa and so on, that is to say with countries in which the climate and the environmental, social and fiscal conditions are different to our own.
This is therefore unfair competition.
Thank you, MrÂ President, for having taken note of the tragic situation of the wine growers, including those from Spain, Italy, Greece and France.
Â Â  Mr President, on 9Â February the Italian Parliament passed an act that flagrantly interferes with the sovereignty of Slovenia and Croatia.
The act unilaterally concedes Italian citizenship to the descendants of the citizens of the two countries who have resided in the territories that Italy ceded to the former Yugoslavia under the provisions of the Peace Treaty of 1947 and the 1975 Treaty of Osimo.
This introduces a kind of reoccupation of the territories over which Italy, as a defeated power of the Berlin-Rome Axis, definitively lost its sovereignty.
Considering the entirety of the European peace arrangement after the Second World War, the said act represents a threat to peace and security in Europe.
Therefore, I wish to call upon the President of the Italian Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, to make use of his veto and not to endorse the act.
Â Â  â I should like to welcome the 30th anniversary, on 27Â February, of the proclamation of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and in so doing to pay tribute to the Sahrawi peopleâs just struggle for freedom and for the right to self-determination and independence.
I should like to point out that, in its resolution of 27Â October of last year, Parliament declared its support for a fair and lasting solution in Western Sahara, based on the rule of law and on international law, and in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
In spite of the major efforts, unilateral concessions and good will gestures on the part of the Polisario Front, the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, the process continues to be stymied by the intransigent attitude, to put it mildly, of the Moroccan Government, which refuses to recognise the Sahrawi peopleâs fundamental rights.
It is therefore of pressing importance to implement immediate effective measures with the clearly stated aim of decolonising Western Sahara.
Â Â  MrÂ President, has launched a hostile TOB for , threatening nearly 50Â 000 jobs in Europe. , which was born out of the ECSC, enabled the iron and steel industry to be adapted to the new world order at the cost of unprecedented financial and human efforts, which are liable to be written off as a loss.
Although I am concerned about the social consequences in terms of protecting workers and keeping jobs, I also wonder about European industryâs ability to tackle the mergers and transformations resulting from globalisation.
Over and above the national positions, however, it is undoubtedly from Europe that the steel workers are awaiting some action. This action will hinge on the implementation of an ambitious European industrial policy endowed with sufficient financial resources and based on a budget priority that is clearly focused on research and development and on innovation.
This case shows that, in the EUâs key economic areas, we must provide long-term answers and, more specifically, act as the driving force behind international regulation.
European integration began with steel, and this is truly symbolic: it must be possible for European integration to continue without abandoning and its employees.
Â Â  â Mr President, two months ago we voted here on MrÂ Alavanos's thoughts on telephone tapping.
I have something disturbing to report: for one year, the Prime Minister of Greece, the Minister of National Defence, the Minister of Public Order, the Chief Commissioner of Police, the Head of the Secret Services and the Head of the Anti-Terrorist Squad have been bugged.
For one year they have been bugged, for one year they have been unable to discover by whom and no one knows exactly how many plans or what highly secret talks with the Members of the European Union were leaked.
I therefore wish, through Parliament, to find out the extent to which the European Union has been informed about this telephone tapping, in this instance of Vodafone mobile telephones.
Secondly, as it is so easy to tap telephones, and I refer here to the telephone of the Prime Minister of Greece, I refer here to the telephone of the Hellenic Minister of Public Health, I refer here to the telephone of the Hellenic Minister of Foreign Affairs, how sure can we be that the telephones are not being tapped here, in the European Parliament?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to draw attention to the fate of Anton Kuzniecov, a Russian citizen who came to Poland from Russia over 10Â years ago and applied for political asylum.
MrÂ Kuzniecov left Russia when he was called up for military service.
He did so because of the persecution he had to endure on account of being a homosexual and a human rights activist.
The Polish authorities are refusing to grant him political asylum and intend to deport him to Russia.
Reports by organisations committed to the defence of human rights, such as the Council of Europe, confirm that homosexuals are subjected to repression in Russia.
If he is returned to Russia, MrÂ Kuzniecov will have to do his military service along with criminals in a penal battalion. believes that if this were to happen, MrÂ Kuzniecovâs life could be at risk, as he is a homosexual.
At present, MrÂ Kuzniecov is subject to humiliation and persecution in Poland, and is being treated insensitively by officials.
What is worse, he is liable to be immediately deported at any time.
MrÂ Kuzniecow wishes to start a new life in freedom where his rights will be respected.
In his eyes, the European Union still stands for human rights and a dignified existence.
The European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to his situation.
Â Â  Mr President, in a few days we will decide on the fate of the Services Directive.
That will be a crucial test of whether the EU is taking the Lisbon agenda at its face value, because the services sector is a main reservoir for rapid economic growth.
However, today the giant of the enlarged EU is like Gulliver in Lilliput, his immense potential tied up by innumerable cords of protectionist regulations.
Our challenge is to dismantle the complex network of anti-competitive practices, which is undermining confidence in genuine European integration.
Our responsibility this week is to open up the services sector to free and fair competition.
The new Member States are not a threat to the EU internal market, but an asset.
Therefore, compromises on the Services Directive should not serve to block the dynamics of this important change.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the way in which Islamic countries reacted to the cartoons of Mohammed in the Danish press proves that, as far as culture and civilisation are concerned, there is a very deep divide between Islamic countries and countries based on Christian principles.
Followers of Islam do not understand the difference between what is said in jest and what is real.
In contrast, our culture is based on metaphors and symbols.
For example, Descartes doubted for a long time that the world even existed.
The misunderstanding I mentioned earlier confirms the belief that Islamic countries such as Turkey have no place in Europe.
It also suggests that the Islamic world needs our help.
We are prepared to provide it, but at a distance.
Â Â  â Mr President, two weeks ago in Greece the action of an extended gang of telephone call thieves was uncovered.
The Greek Government was told of the problem in March 2005, but concealed it for eleven months.
The political issue which has arisen is huge and also concerns the European Parliament:
First, the Greek Government does not appear to have notified the Commission or the Council about the holes in the security system in Greece, especially at a time when Europe was debating the famous directive on the retention of our sensitive telecommunications data via service providers' databases which, as it turns out, are riddled with holes.
Secondly, the Greek Government also failed to notify the other Member States, so that they could take immediate steps for the safeguarding and protecting of the data of their citizens by Vodafone and Ericsson.
Thirdly, the incident was also discovered by the independent national authority responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of communications.
Fourthly, it also failed to notify the thieves' victims for a full 11 months, thereby exposing them to the risk of continuing violation of their confidentiality.
Â Â  â Mr President, the citizens and residents of the European Union have a right of petition safeguarded them under the Treaties.
However, the operating rules of the Committee on Petitions are not clear and the impression is being created that selfish and/or political objectives are often pursued through the committee.
Similarly, European citizens are subject to discriminatory treatment and I shall explain how: with the excuse that there are legal proceedings pending, their cases have not led to the drafting of a report.
By contrast, the Cashman report is to be presented tomorrow on a case on which a decision is pending before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and proceedings are under way before the national courts.
The fact that proceedings are pending is not respected here.
Even at the eleventh hour I ask you, Mr President, to prevent the Cashman report from being adopted, not for its content, but so as not to create a precedent of intervention in the work of justice and discriminatory treatment of European citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to draw Membersâ attention to the fact that, in recent days, there have been various cases of missionaries being murdered in Burundi and the Philippines.
Yesterday, in Angola, an 80-year-old missionary was murdered.
Obviously, the most moving case was that of Don Andrea, an Italian missionary murdered in Trabzon, Turkey.
I should like to pay tribute to this man and to his sacrifice, partly because he was caught up in a climate of tension between the Islamic world and Europe.
On his behalf, I should like to call on Members to support anyone seeking to break this circle of hate, partly because I am sure that there is a large majority of men and women of good will, be they Muslims or Christians, or indeed atheists and non-believers.
I should therefore like to remind Parliament, too, of Don Andreaâs message.
Â Â  MrÂ President, freedom of expression in the European Union, expressed through directives and regulations, has imposed limits on the shape of bananas, the volume of milk production, and the temperature of washing-up water.
It has also resulted in a free market that is only free for monopolies, media terrorism and the violence we all witnessed perpetrated by followers of Mohammed who felt insulted by certain cartoons.
The right to freedom of thought and expression as enshrined in the Declaration of Human Rights cannot be interpreted as to offend the religious sensitivities of believers, and this should apply to all religions.
We Poles are well versed in Gospel truths.
We know that âevery good tree bringeth forth good fruitâ or, in other words, âthat by their fruits ye shall know themâ.
We should therefore draw the appropriate conclusions from recent events, and implement the provisions laid down to protect human rights and democracy in such a way that freedom of expression does not come to mean lack of respect and lack of responsibility.
If it fails to respect ethical and moral principles, freedom will evolve into destructive lawlessness or even into a dictatorship of relativism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is truly at a crossroads.
The improvement to our decision-making process has come to a halt.
The most recent countries to have joined the EU are discovering a Union that is less united than it was in their predecessorsâ day, as demonstrated by the stingy draft budget.
The nations of Europe are worried â and rightly so â in the face of the wayward path taken by the Commission and most of the Member Statesâ governments, which want to introduce rules of unbridled competition among themselves.
I am thinking in particular of the taxation dossier.
If we value a Europe founded on solidarity and reject one that is founded on self-interest, then, ladies and gentlemen, let us seize the opportunity to stand side by side tomorrow with the demonstrators in response to the call of the ETUC and, if possible, let us go equipped with our scarves.
I call on you to do this in order to show the citizens from throughout Europe that a large number of their representatives are behind them and understand their more than legitimate concerns.
Â Â  Mr President, the furore over the Danish cartoons rages in Europe and worldwide.
I regret that MEPs are only going to have a restricted debate on it, but I am confident that, whatever our opinions on the publication of the cartoons, it will condemn unreservedly the violence and destruction committed because of the offence taken.
But efforts to lower the temperature have been impeded by the real crimes against Muslims, not only illegal abduction and detention â as in Guantanamo Bay, which we will be debating later this week â but the assaults by occupying forces.
Most recently, a video apparently showing British troops beating up Iraqi youths was revealed yesterday.
Human rights and the rule of law must be universally respected by those of all faiths and none.
I disagree with my colleague over on the right.
I do not believe that I live in a Christian state or Christian territory and I look forward very much to Turkey joining the European Union.
Â Â  ( The citizens of the new Member States greatly appreciated the courage of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden in opening their labour markets immediately following EU enlargement in May 2004.
The report submitted by Commissioner Å pidla confirms that these three countries have not been harmed by opening their labour markets and, on the contrary, that people coming from the new Member States have been taking on jobs unattractive to local workers.
By doing so, they have contributed to the economic growth of these countries.
On the basis of the positive report from the European Commission, I trust that the remaining twelve Member States will follow the example set by these three countries and will lift the temporary restrictions on the free movement of workers in the labour market that apply to the new members.
I am convinced that Austria and Germany will also understand that removing the existing obstacles to the free movement of labour from the eastern countries is better than having to face the delocalisation of German and Austrian companies to the East.
I am pleased that the Commission has received significant support from European social partners.
Both the umbrella employersâ organisation, UNICE, and, surprisingly, the European Trade Union Confederation have spoken in favour of terminating the transitional period.
Only German and Austrian trade unionists were opposed to the idea.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no goal to which Europeâs political forces commit themselves with greater determination than that of making our continent more competitive and thereby reducing mass unemployment.
It follows that doing something for those people who have no work is a credible and respectable thing for us to do.
This week will see us voting on the Services Directive, which may well, when transposed, bring 600Â 000 new jobs, 100Â 000 of them in Germany, my own country, providing that it is adopted in the form that has emerged from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
There is now no more than an infinitesimal prospect of this actually happening, since the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has caved in and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has got its way right down the line.
That has had no impact on the trade unions, who are continuing to spread untruths and panic.
We expect, tomorrow, the arrival of 30Â 000 well-organised, well-fed and well-clothed people, who will be demonstrating against the creation of 600Â 000 jobs.
Those who have work are fighting to keep it for themselves; that is immoral and unacceptable.
It is for us to do something for those people who do not have work, for they have no leaders to bring them to Strasbourg by the busload.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, many employees and citizens of the European Union do not understand the European Commissionâs passivity in the face of the hostile TOB affecting the group and have been deeply shocked by the remarks made by Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who does not see any need for a defence strategy for European groups.
She is just happy that there are international groups in Europe.
Adopting this attitude means forgetting about our past, namely that Europe was founded on the European Coal and Steel Community. It means disregarding any notion of an industrial policy and it means believing the remarks and the commitments of âs boss, which he will clearly go back on in the long term.
Proof of this is the closure, in Ireland, of one of this groupâs factories despite the commitments that had been made to the local authorities.
Finally, I should like to say that, in this industrial policy affair, it is clear that the group is basically aiming to take the groupâs own funds, which are unquestionably the fruit of employeesâ labour; it is also seeking to pave the way for long-term relocations and is thus threateningÂ âŠ
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to refer to the recent crisis which has broken out over the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, to which other members have also referred.
We are currently experiencing and trying to clarify the limits of freedom of speech and cultural freedom of the free and theocratic world, often with the theory of the clash of cultures as a basis.
I believe that there are not two conflicting worlds â and I am certain that most of my honourable friends believe likewise; I believe there is one open world in which we are forced to coexist.
This crisis has broken out at a time of mutual distrust between the West and Islam and, I fear â mainly as far as the war in Iraq is concerned â that the West is to blame.
Unfortunately, public opinion in the West links the Muslim faith with terrorism.
By contrast, public opinion in Islam considers that terrorism is an invention of the powerful on earth in order to intervene in the internal affairs of any country they wish.
Ladies and gentlemen, the world we live in does not belong to us.
It is on loan to us from future generations.
It is our responsibility to respect it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have some cheerful news.
In three days the state of Lithuania will celebrate its Independence Day.
This is on 16 February.
However, I fear that our state's national holiday will once more remain unmentioned, as it is not traditional to do so.
Therefore, I propose that at least during plenary sessions and plenary sittings the national holidays of those states, which celebrate them on those particular days, should be mentioned.
It would be possible to do this with various references in the session timetable; it may even be possible to indicate on this board that one state or another is celebrating its national holiday.
Of course, the chair of the sitting could also let Members know that one state or another is celebrating its national holiday.
This would certainly help us get to know one another and would bring the citizens of Europe closer to Europe's institutions.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, the British Government is proceeding with a programme of reorganisation of the English and Welsh police forces on a regional basis.
The stated reason is that the existing structures cannot deal adequately with terrorism, extremism and serious and organised crime.
However, the real reason is not to make them more effective, but to further the EUâs policy of regionalisation of Member States.
Where the British people have been given a choice, they have rejected regionalisation overwhelmingly.
The police forces are to be given no such choice: the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, gave the 43Â Chief Constables an ultimatum to produce plans for a mass merger, like it or not.
The Treaty of Rome speaks of the regions, and their significance is becoming more and more apparent.
Few people in Britain realise how their country is being fundamentally changed in order for it to become merely a region of a United States of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on 20Â October 2005, the Unesco General Conference adopted the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions by 148 votes in favour to two against with four abstentions.
This convention recognises the specific nature of cultural activities, goods and services that can under no circumstances be regarded as mere commodities.
Article 20 stipulates that the countries must pay heed to the convention when they subscribe to other international obligations, such as the agreements concluded in the context of the World Trade Organisation.
This convention must be ratified by 30 countries before it can enter into force.
To date, Canada is the only country to have ratified it.
The European Union, represented by its Commission, has played a major role in the adoption of the convention.
Ought not our President, together with the chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, write a letter to the Council and to all the Heads of State or Government urging them to ratify the convention?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw the honourable Membersâ attention to the great efforts being made to bring the institutions closer to the citizens.
The Commission has just adopted the White Paper; we have a plan D â dialogue â and in this attempt to find new and better ways to communicate with each other, we cannot forget the natural means, which is the language of the European citizens.
In Spain, in addition to Castilian as the common language, the citizensâ right to use other official languages is recognised: Catalan, Basque, Galician; all of which are European languages.
In December 2004, the Spanish Government presented a proposal to the Council to authorise the use of those languages under certain conditions, without adding any cost for the Union's institutions.
The Commission, the Council and the Committee on the Regions have already put this proposal into practice.
In Parliament we are still waiting.
It is a question of making it possible to use these languages in correspondence between the citizens and Parliament, in the publication of legislative provisions and in the speeches of Members of the European Parliament.
Mr President, this request does not imply any cost to the institution.
On the contrary, it would increase the wealth of this Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, last year, the Alsace region was understandably incensed at the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in Herrlisheim.
Without a scrap of supporting evidence, the blame was attributed to a activist, a young, honest employee of the Forestry Commission and the sole support of his mother.
On the basis of a simple handwriting analysis that revealed that his noughts were slightly smaller than the other numbers, he was immediately remanded in custody.
It appears that the two perpetrators of this crime have now been arrested.
They have no connection whatsoever with MrÂ Lezeau, the innocent victim, yet neither he nor the have received any apologies.
The clearly had nothing whatsoever to do with this act, which it finds just as disgusting as the rest of the population does.
Prosecutor Schultz is responsible for a real legal scandal in Colmar.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I returned last night from Palestine, where I met with President Abbas.
In this connection, I should like to pass on two messages to you: the first is that he will address the Palestinian Legislative Council at the end of next week and that he will adopt some extremely firm positions.
He is truly determined not to accept a government that would not itself accept the peace agreements or recognise the State of Israel.
We are therefore probably heading for a succession of political crises in Palestine, which could even lead in perhaps a few monthsâ time to elections â that is how President Abbas sees things, anyway.
The second message that he delivered to me and that he gave me the job of passing on to you â to you as well as to the European Parliament â is that he would be very pleased to accept your invitation and to take part in the March part-session.
When that time comes, he will provide a detailed explanation of the situation in Palestine and of his policy framework.
Â Â  Mrs De Keyser, thank you for that information and your telephone call this weekend to tell me about it.
We shall be very happy to receive the President of the Palestinian Authority if he can come here.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 7 February marked the seventh anniversary of the day on which five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor were arrested by the Libyan authorities on charges of contaminating children in the paediatric hospital in Benghazi with the AIDS virus.
The death sentence subsequently handed down to them by the Libyan court galvanised the Bulgarian authorities and European diplomacy into action.
Although the death sentence imposed on them was recently quashed by the Libyan Supreme Court, in view of a repeat trial, we can send them a message of support and, at the same time, call for the Libyan authorities to guarantee that the new trial will be held fairly and objectively.
We also need to stand by the children of Libya who were contaminated with the virus and, at the same time, to work to create the conditions needed in order for a fair solution to be found to this sad story.
Â Â  Mr President, about two weeks ago an 11-year-old girl collapsed in her classroom in a school in the UK.
She was later found to have taken heroin by inhalation.
It was reported that she had been taking drugs for a number of months.
That is not a unique case: thousands of children in Europe are thought to be taking drugs and there is growing evidence that paediatric substance abuse is increasing rapidly.
Children are very vulnerable and drug addiction in schools can, if allowed to proceed unchecked, soon reach epidemic proportions.
Many of us believe that the situation is already becoming extremely worrying.
Therefore, Mr President, knowing your â and most colleaguesâ â sensitivities on the subject, I respectfully call upon you to request from the Commission and the Council a statement on the current situation regarding drug addiction among children and the possible need for an urgent review of the strategy as to how best to deal with this alarming problem.
Â Â  Mr President, there are currently 84Â Lisbon directives that the European Parliament has adopted; 63 of them should have been fully implemented by all Member States; so far, only 12 have been fully implemented.
According to the latest figures published by the Commission, the directive on the common rules for the internal market in natural gas should have been implemented by 1Â July 2004.
The following countries have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing that directive: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain, Ireland, Latvia and Luxembourg.
Lisbon is placed in jeopardy by such lax behaviour on the part of the Member States.
Mr President, would you write to the Commission and ask them what they are doing to speed up legislation on the Gas Directive in particular?
Â Â  â Mr President, the tragic shipwreck of the obsolete, over-maintained, 35-year-old passenger car ferry , which dragged thousands of passengers and seafarers to a watery grave in the Red Sea, is yet another link in the long chain of maritime crimes committed for the sake of profit.
We express our heartfelt condolences to the families of the passengers and seafarers who lost their lives for nothing.
We would take this opportunity to point out that, with the reasoned opinion/ultimatum sent by the European Commission in December 2005 to the Greek Government on the application of Regulation No 3577/92, adopting the demands of the shipowners on the pretext of alleged unfair competition, basic seaworthiness and safety criteria of passenger car ferries are being abolished, such as the horsepower and registered tonnage of ships and the 30-year age limit for the withdrawal of ships, which has been adopted in our country.
We are calling on the European Commission to stop this procedure.
There is an immediate need, through the International Maritime OrganisationÂ ...
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to raise an issue of pressing importance to the farming community in my constituency.
In the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland there is a high preponderance of conacre lettings, whereby an active farmer rents land for ten months each year from an inactive landowner.
Under Regulation (EC) NoÂ 782/2003 â as it is being implemented â the landowner and the active farmer cannot share the single farm payment relating to that land.
That has resulted in duplicate claims for the same land by both tenant and farmer.
Now both face the penalty of total non-payment.
Confusion and error, rather than fraud, is the predominant cause.
The threatened withholding of the entire single farm payment is wholly disproportionate and potentially ruinous for many.
I therefore call upon the Commission to sanction an approach capable of delivering a solution and securing the purpose of single farm payments, namely a fair standard of living for farmers.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the agreement between Germany and Russia to lay a gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has raised many questions.
It is reproached not only because of Germany's economic egoism, which tramples on the EU principle of declared solidarity and increases the threat of Russia exerting economic and political influence on EU countries.
A huge threat is also posed by a legacy from the Second World War chemical weapons that were buried at the bottom of the Baltic Sea 50 years ago.
The seaâs ecosystem is threatened by 292Â 000 tonnes of chemical weapons.
The Baltic Sea is not a lake in the German or Russian interior.
Its shores are home to the citizens of another six EU states, for whom the sea is the source for making a living and for recreation.
When the sea is used intensively for fishing and other economic activities, the laying of a gas pipeline and these chemical weapons become a concern for the international community.
In order to avoid an ecological catastrophe in the Baltic Sea, I urge you to encourage the Commission to carry out an exhaustive investigation into the possible effects of the gas pipeline, which is viewed as a private commercial project, on the ecology of the Baltic Sea.
Â Â  The international community faces a serious challenge this year with the forthcoming negotiations concerning the status of Kosovo.
The stake is huge, and the future of the region will determine the situation and European perspective of the entire West Balkan region.
It is obvious that Kosovo is lost for Serbia, not only because the Albanians, constituting the 90% majority of the population, do not want to live there, but also because this is also supported by several superpowers, including the United States of America and Great Britain.
The European Union has not formulated its own position yet, although this should be considered a matter of urgency.
My question is, if the international community grants Kosovo the right to break away, to become independent, why should it be given the entire region, even areas inhabited by Serbs?
Why is the possibility of territorial division excluded right from the start?
Why are the Albanians rewarded and the Serbs punished?
If the status of Kosovo is not resolved successfully, this will result in the long-term destabilisationÂ âŠ
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the European Commission has tabled a report regarding the operation of restrictions on access by citizens of the new Member States to the labour market in the countries of the Fifteen.
This report proves conclusively that concerns about opening up the labour market were unfounded.
The scale of the influx of workers to the old countries is fairly small, and the countries that opened up their labour markets have benefited in many ways as a result.
Unfortunately, despite these clear conclusions most of the remaining Member States still wish to retain the current restrictions for several years.
Why, in the light of the findings of its own report and in its role as the guardian of the Treaties, is the Commission not taking a much stronger line in pressing for discriminating restrictions on access to the labour market in the remaining Member States to be lifted?
I would also like to enquire why the retention of these restrictions is condoned.
Not only do they run counter to the provisions of the Treaties and the spirit of European integration, but they are also slowing down the Unionâs economic growth, making it less competitive and creating the conditions for aberrations such as undeclared labour and fictitious self-employment.
I trust the Commission will make a determined effort to ensure these harmful restrictions are lifted.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, many European newspapers recently printed cartoons of the prophet Mohammed, thus mocking Islam.
Its outraged followers retaliated by burning flags and attacking the embassies of European countries.
In addition, an Italian priest was murdered in Trabzon in Turkey.
This escalation of hatred and violence was triggered and fuelled by the liberal left-wing media who have long been attacking religions of all kinds.
In the name of a false notion of freedom, we are witnessing the desecration of faith and God, beliefs sacred to millions of individuals.
The media are trumpeting religious intolerance, moral nihilism and anti-culture before our very eyes.
One personâs freedom ends where anotherâs begins.
Freedom of expression in the media must not amount to infringement of the rights and freedoms of other people.
Freedom does not insult, it does not despise anyone, it does not mock, it does not demean and it does not make fun of what is holy.
Freedom equals respect for the dignity, convictions and lives of other people.
We ought to bear this in mind as we stand up to the increasing deterioration of Europeâs culture.
Allow me to appeal for a return to the core values of Western civilisation, in which there is no room for the religious hatred that is currently rampant in the European media.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to register my contempt for a decision taken by a high-level group â which I presume is the Commission â to overrule the Committee on Budgetary Control and reappoint Mr Franz-Hermann BrÃŒner as Director-General of OLAF.
Mr BrÃŒner is an immensely controversial figure and his judgement has been brought into question on many occasions.
In his first term he supported witch hunts against journalists such as Hans-Martin Tillack who exposed frauds.
He has also been criticised by politicians and his supervisory board, and I do not believe he has the confidence of this Parliament, the press or the public.
This also demonstrates the utter pointlessness of this Parliament and its committee system.
The candidates for the post gave presentations before the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We questioned them and ultimately voted for a better candidate from Sweden.
Now we find that the whole time-consuming process was a meaningless charade.
Â Â  That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Thijs Berman, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive laying down minimum rules for the protection of chickens kept for meat production (COM(2005)0221 C6-0190/2005 2005/0099(CNS)) (A6-0017/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start first of all by thanking the members of the committees which addressed this matter and, of course, I should like to make a point of thanking the rapporteur, Mr Berman, on the very valuable work which he has done and for all the efforts which he made to bring this initiative to a positive conclusion.
I know that the proposals, when they reach the decision stage, may not fully satisfy all sides.
Some would like to us to move more in one direction, feeling perhaps that we have not gone far enough, while others may believe that we should be more conservative and that we have already gone too far.
However, I believe that this proposal, as it stands with many of the amendments tabled, is a balanced, logical proposal, which strikes a balance between the need for better handling of animals, for the welfare of the animals, especially in the chicken sector, on the one hand, while at the same time taking account of the financial cost and burden which it may cause to industry and undertakings in this sector.
However, we should not underestimate, first of all, the close link between the proper handling of animals and the health of the animals, and this is particularly important now that we are debating the measures which will be taken in order to combat avian influenza, which has now arrived â albeit only in wild birds â in the European Union.
On the contrary, if we follow a policy of proper handling of animals, all the protective measures, all the precautions we take are much more effective.
Much better supervision is being carried out, there is much better identification of the health problems which can arise and, of course, this means, from a practical point of view, fewer diseases for the animals, fewer fatalities, fewer unsuitable chickens in such cases and, hence, fewer losses and lower costs.
Consequently, it may, if you look at it superficially, appear to be a cost for entrepreneurs, for producers, for farmers; however, in actual fact, it is a benefit which will result in savings and will bring producers financial benefits.
In addition, I would just like to state briefly that the World Bank recently issued a report setting out the financial benefits of the application of a welfare policy to animals and illustrating that there is also a financial benefit from these policies.
The second point I wish to comment on is, of course, the question of aid for producers.
It is particularly important that they should not bear the entire cost; however, European consumers are prepared to pay more if they know that certain products have been produced on the basis of policies for the welfare and proper handling of animals.
Labelling â voluntary at first â we shall be presenting a report on compulsory labelling â will give producers the opportunity to make full use of the fact that they follow a policy which is well received by European citizens and, on the basis of our studies and research, they will be able to charge something extra, because European consumers are prepared to spend more.
Of course, there is also a general, multi-proposal strategy, the strategic plan for animal welfare, which was adopted recently by the Commission and will come before Parliament for debate.
This proposal may have preceded the proposal on the action plan, but it is in keeping with the principles and philosophy and proposals of this action plan.
Finally, I should like to mention the well-known question of the World Trade Organisation.
I know that European producers may often feel that they are at a disadvantage to third countries.
Constant efforts are being made to introduce terms and conditions for the welfare and proper handling of animals on the international market.
It is not easy, but we are promoting it.
The recent adoption by the World Organisation for Animal Health of principles relating to the proper treatment of animals is a first step in this direction and we shall intensify efforts in the same direction.
Nonetheless, bearing in mind the very high level of sensitivity of European consumers, we believe that labelling could give European producers an advantage.
It will not be a disadvantage for them to follow animal welfare policies.
On the contrary, something like this will give them access to the very large market of European consumers.
Â Â  . Madam President, I hope that this week will see this House taking an important step towards sustainable European agriculture.
The European Union needs to respect, and lay down in law, the five freedoms of the animal, namely freedom from thirst, hunger and malnutrition, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain, injury and disease, freedom to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress.
This directive accommodates these freedoms, and that is not a moment too soon.
It is first and foremost the European consumers and citizens who demand respect for animals and who â in an increasing number of countries â are prepared to pay a reasonable price for it.
It is good that the Commission, three weeks ago, launched the action plan for animal welfare.
Agreements and rules of this kind should be European; if not, Member States will start competing against each other at the expense of animal welfare.
The European consumerâs main concern about animal welfare at the moment is the welfare of broiler chickens.
This was fuelled by reports of overcrowding in chicken houses and of breeding methods that were aimed at achieving ever faster growth, rather than strong bone structure and stronger heart and lungs.
Too many animals sustain injuries on legs and chest due to poor litter.
With my report and related amendments, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has sent a clear message to the Commission and the Council in support of animal welfare and of quality requirements, but also in favour of some flexibility in respect of the poultry farmer.
I have also, in my report, attempted to lay down two principles that were not yet included in the directive.
First of all, genetic selection, the breeding of animals to obtain certain features, should never result in a decrease in, or threat of, the potential level of animal welfare of an animal species.
This principle must be a cornerstone in any animal welfare directive.
Secondly, animal welfare should not be treated as secondary to socio-economic considerations.
With this principle in mind, it makes sense to subject the quality of the chicken houses to certain criteria.
These are criteria that good poultry farmers have met for a long time, since they reduce mortality rates and thus increase the yield.
As Commissioner Kyprianou has already pointed out, animal welfare is in poultry farmersâ economic interests.
The directive also provides for professional and daily health and welfare checks, which, particularly in this day and age, are an important preventive measure against animal diseases.
Even so, poultry need more room than they are often given.
The amendment that Mrs Jeggle and I have tabled specifies that maximum quantity of poultry per square metre in the few days immediately preceding their being transported to the slaughter house must come down to 38 kg per square metre and to 34 kg by 2013.
Many EU Member States are already under or around this limit.
I do not support amendments that favour even lower densities.
Even though experts believe that animal welfare is at greater risk above a density of 30 kg per square metre, that is definitely not an absolute limit above which disaster is sure to strike.
Above 30 kg per square metre, everything depends on good management, and that is precisely what this House can rely on.
That is why the rules should be flexible in their application to farmers.
Quality requirements and sanctions go hand in hand, but these should be proportionate and encourage better management.
It makes no sense whatsoever to increase the severity of penalties or increase their duration for longer than is strictly necessary.
Those who are opposed to this directive claim that global competition makes animal welfare standards of this kind impossible, and allege that Europe is subjected to stricter requirements than countries outside.
As a matter of fact, that is not the case.
Brazil, which is our biggest competitor in the poultry industry, already does all that this directive requires.
Even if Europe were to stop bad animal welfare at its borders, Brazilian meat would still come in effortlessly.
Consequently, the European sector will need to look at reducing costs and thus increasing the scale, or else at producing fresh, high-quality meat near the European consumer.
What this directive encourages is already, we can see, becoming a trend, but that does not mean that the Commission should not place animal welfare on the agenda within the World Trade Organisation, and do so more firmly than it is doing now.
I have questioned the Commission about this.
What scope does the GATT Agreement offer for animal welfare?
In Article 20 of this Agreement, import restrictions to protect human, animal or plant life or health are said to be justified on moral grounds.
We need to press on down this road.
Europe needs concrete proof in order to get its citizens to regain trust in the EU.
Sustainable development is one of the areas where the EU can score points.
Animal welfare is part of this and that is why this directive should be put into practice soon.
Â Â  Madam President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety obviously welcomes the Commissionâs proposal on common rules governing chickens kept for meat production, particularly because the proposal involves clear improvements to animal protection but also because we aim to promote an efficient internal market.
The big problem with the Commissionâs proposal is that it does not do enough in terms of animal protection.
According to the conclusions drawn by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare and on which our decision is based, stocking density must, for example, be lower than 25 kg if major injuries and unnecessary suffering are to be avoided.
In line with this, many Members have tabled amendments precisely on the subjects of stocking density and the scoring system for foot pad lesions.
These changes are necessary if we are to guarantee animal protection.
We in the European Parliament must take expert opinion seriously and show the Council that we want to see the Commissionâs proposal tightened up when it comes to animal protection.
That, and not perhaps the details of our amendments, is what is most important right now.
I therefore hope that, tomorrow, a majority of this Parliament will vote in favour of these amendments which, as I say, obtained considerable support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
A broad majority, on both right and left, voted in favour of them.
Â Â  . Madam President, I must congratulate Mr Berman and thank him for his work, because his political position has been very constructive and realistic and has enabled us to reach an agreement amongst the different positions expressed by Members.
This draft report, adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on this new directive on the protection of chickens kept for meat production, is balanced, because it takes account of the production practices of the majority of Member States.
The key point of this report is densities, as you know.
From the information that I have been gathering, the densities laid down in the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are more than acceptable in most of the European regions, but they could cause certain problems in certain very specific areas of the Union.
As rapporteur, I have tried to reflect the opinion of the majority and, incidentally, with regard to amendments, I would like to warn you that I do not intend to support the majority of them.
I do believe, however, that Amendment 42 responds to a highly justified political concern, extending minimum standards applied in the European Union to imports from third countries.
With regard to Amendment 44, which removes the implementation of labelling for meat subject to the new welfare directive, I must tell you that this runs counter to the need to give added value to these products in order to provide greater visibility for the efforts made by European producers.
The European Union has been producing abundant legislation over recent years with a view to improving animal welfare and responding to one of the concerns expressed by European public opinion.
In this way, we have managed to considerably improve, sometimes at the expense of jeopardising the viability of the sector, the protection of laying hens, calves and breeding sows.
We must recognise that this effort should lead to an improvement in the quality of products for the European consumer, and this quality must be accompanied by an effective policy in the field of labelling.
Nevertheless, supporting the amendments that have been presented, the majority of which toughen the legislation pointlessly, will cause adaptation problems in certain regions.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, this matter is in keeping with the idea that the European Union should distinguish itself from its competitors in the area of animal welfare.
In this matter, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, MrÂ Berman, who has tried to strike a balance between positions that were much too far apart.
It must be pointed out that one criterion was emphasised above all others, that of stocking density.
We should condemn the Commission proposal for recommending the automatic registration of certain data, something that seems difficult for small producers to contemplate and to write off as part of their costs.
Let us return, however, to stocking density, which is the main criterion at stake.
An initial economic approach in Wallonia shows that, on the basis of average revenue of 72 cents per kilo, the estimated loss of annual revenue for a 1Â 000 square metre building would be 55% for a stocking density of 30 kg per square metre and 24% for a stocking density of 38 kg per square metre.
The sector cannot absorb this estimated loss of revenue.
The planned elimination of countless producers in Europe and a stagnant or rising consumer demand will inevitably benefit imports from countries that are a long way away from applying our standards, or even from considering them.
Animal welfare will be the loser throughout.
While I am therefore responsive to the rapporteurâs arguments aimed at moving European agriculture in the direction of sustainable agriculture, I should like, by way of conclusion, to underline two crucial elements.
Firstly, moving in the direction of higher quality means that European producers will have an extra cost to bear.
We should emphasise this difference and draw attention to it through the use of labels so as to put in practice, and explain the reason behind, a price differential that the Eurobarometer respondent â who is also a consumer â must be prepared to pay.
Mass distribution has a key role to play in this regard.
Secondly â and to conclude â it is crucial that we do everything in our power to ensure that the European Commission, with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health, succeeds in making the WTO more compliant with the animal welfare measures.
Â Â  . â Madam President, let me start by congratulating MrÂ Berman.
It may well be his first report, but I think he did a very thorough job of it.
As for the report itself, while I have to say that I do not know of anyone in this House who is opposed to animal welfare â everyone is, of course, in favour of it â I do nevertheless have my doubts about this proposal, because I think there is room for improvement.
First of all, it imposes the same standards across the whole of the European Union, and I can imagine that in a cold climate such as Finland or in a totally different climate such as Italy, very different standards should apply with regard to stock densities.
Things may well already be different in practice.
The Commission fails to take this into account in any way, and as the previous speaker said, we have not yet seen an economic analysis.
It is easy to say that animal welfare must not take second place to socio-economic priorities, but some people still need to make a living out of this; what exactly are the consequences for them?
Does the Commission have any idea?
What matters most, of course, as has also been mentioned by many before me, including the Commissioner, although he did not manage to win me over completely, is a code of conduct.
It is not very sensible, though, if we want to stress what are referred to as non-trade aspects, to table yet another fresh proposal in the middle of discussions in the World Trade Organisation, without knowing for certain that the importers comply.
Why does the Commission not raise the subject of a code of conduct with the supermarkets and other large importers, and do so as soon as possible?
Where is the logic, if European producers are told that they need to meet such and such standards, while various supermarkets are allowed to import from the rest of the world with no restrictions, without the Commission demanding that checks of any kind be put in place?
We only check for salmonella, or whatever, but we never check for animal welfare.
That is what the Commission should do and that is what is missing completely from this proposal.
Â Â  . â Madam President, the rapporteur wrote, in his explanatory statement, that âall good farmers respect their animalsâ.
It goes without saying that there must be some who have not yet got that far, or else we would not need to prescribe it by law.
I think the problem also lies in the fact that many of those engaged in fattening up chickens are no longer farmers, but rather industrialists, for whom respect for life is irrelevant to the business of getting a return on capital.
I can tell Mr Berman that the only conclusion we can come to from seeing the way breeding was approached is that the primary concern was not the animalsâ well-being, but rather the use to which they could be put in obtaining the maximum possible profit.
The very sight of these pens is enough to show the urgent necessity of our enacting legislation on them.
On that we agree.
I do think, though, that we have to take care that this directive and this regulation do not end up leading us to aid and abet this sort of industrial production.
One problem is, in fact, that these stalls are often outwardly healthy, but that is only because they are protected by prophylactic inoculations and medication, which, while preventing an outbreak, allow the germination of the variants that are currently troubling us or that make bird flu particularly to be feared.
This makes the preventive measures currently being adopted for free-range animals especially problematic, for it is the good conditions under which these animals are kept that enables them to develop the strongest resistance to diseases.
We need to take good care that we do not end up catching the wrong people, and we must also ensure that the specialised markets for which these animals are supplied, which people accept along with the higher prices charged on them, are not run into the ground in such a way that farmers lose out.
Â Â  . Madam President, although all things considered, Mr Bermanâs report strikes a good balance between the importance of animal welfare and the interests of the agricultural sector, I would like to argue that the interests of chickens should count for more where stocking densities are concerned.
I would therefore ask all my fellow Members, when you go down to vote tomorrow and are crowded, uncomfortable and pressed up against each other in the lift, you should imagine that an additional ten people are squeezed in and have this feeling for one minute, to spare a thought for an industrial broiler chicken that has to put up with this for all of its miserable life.
I would encourage you take that image with you when you press your voting buttons tomorrow.
Tomorrow, we have the opportunity to take an important step towards a more animal-friendly Europe.
Let us seize that opportunity, not only for the sake of animal welfare, but also for the sake of our own humanity.
Â Â  . Madam President, this is a scintillating report that runs to 48Â pages.
It is a of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo and statements of the blindingly obvious.
The authors have provided us with such masterpieces as âregular inspections of establishments by competent animal welfare inspection authorities would place a considerable burden on farms and greatly increase the size of the authorities.
It would also substantially increase costs.
These can be curbed by having irregular inspections carried out on a random basisâ.
I will let Members consider the wisdom of that particular pearl in their own time.
This Parliament regularly churns out details like that, prepared by people who probably have not the faintest idea what it is like out in the real world, where real people have to try to put all these new rules into practice and still manage to turn a profit.
Not only do the authors of this report wish to see this new regime inflicted on chicken meat producers in the 25Â Member States, but they also make it clear that they expect non-EU countries to follow suit.
Some chance, I would suggest!
I come from a country that already has very high standards of animal welfare and hygiene, which are vigorously policed.
We do not need a supranational bureaucratic dictatorship to tell us how to look after our chickens.
The authors of this report have laid an egg and I suggest they scramble it.
Â Â  . )Â Madam President, the regulation we are debating today lays down high standards for the rearing of broiler chickens and their welfare.
These standards are needed.
Within the European Union we should be striving to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible.
This applies especially to animals raised for meat production, such as broiler chickens.
We should spare animals unnecessary suffering to ensure humane treatment and out of regard for the standards of our civilisation.
We should do so in the interests of our own health too.
There is a large body of research showing that meat from animals raised in poor conditions and subjected to constant stress is simply less healthy.
However, a problem of a rather different nature has arisen.
The regulation imposes high standards on European Union broiler producers, but it does not apply to importers.
Maintaining high standards is expensive, which means that our producersâ meat cannot compete with meat from producers outside the Union.
They are exporting to the European market meat from poultry raised in countries where such high standards are not guaranteed.
Many European broiler producers are threatened with bankruptcy, because they have become less competitive due to the fact that they have to meet high European Union standards.
The same standards should be imposed on imports as on meat produced within the Union, not only for the sake of the broiler chickens but also for the benefit of their producers and especially for the good of the consumers.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment tabled by the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group calling on the European Commission to ensure that these high standards are also met in the case of imported meat.
I believe this should be a general principle that should apply not only to poultry but to all agricultural products.
Union producers and importers must be required to meet the same standards.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, we are all clearly in favour of protecting chickens kept for meat production from the barbarity in the concentration camp-style farms.
Many a time in this very Chamber have I denounced the disgraceful industrial farms, in which up to 80Â million male chicks have been burnt alive to heat up the farms.
I have denounced the way in which the chickens are slaughtered using electric stunning techniques. In fact, the chickens are not completely stunned, with the result that they are plunged into hot water while they are still alive: they are boiled so that they can be plucked.
We therefore all agree that rules are needed.
However, when European farmers read the directive, what do they see?
They see that the broiler chicken is subjected to two daily medical visits, which are carried out by a veterinary surgeon who must be at least three metres away from the chicken; the area in which the chickens are kept must be illuminated by a non-flickering light with an intensity of 50 lux, 20 lux or 100 lux â no one quite knows â measured at bird eye level; the inside temperature of the farm must not exceed the outside temperature measured in the shade by more than 3ËC; the chickenâs litter must be 5 cm deep; certificates are required for the purposes of keeping chickens and of castrating chicks that are less than ten daysâ old; the chickensâ foot pads must be examined, and the stocking density of the chickens must be limited to 28, 30, 35 or 42 kilograms per square metre, although it is not specified whether this means one kilo liveweight or metabolic weight.
Meanwhile, thousands of chickens are being slaughtered in Nigeria, and avian influenza is going to strike down 1.1Â billion African chickens.
All of this because we did not find the EURÂ 800Â million that would have made it possible to administer to each African chicken the two necessary vaccines, at a cost of 40 cents per dose.
I could also try to add a touch of black humour here.
Faced with this deluge of precautions that are reserved for white chickens while black children are dying of leprosy, AIDS and tuberculosis, the little African child is going to end up saying: âwhen I grow up, I am not going to be a fireman, I am going to be a broiler chicken in Europe!
In the meantime, our Breton farms, for example, are relocating to Brazil â the leader in poultry farming â where not only are the chickens unprotected, but the children are too.
The latter are treated like slaves so that the Brazilian farms can be kept in operation, and that is without mentioning the banana plantations, in which little eight-year-olds fall asleep exhausted on cardboard boxes and come into contact with plant-care products that make them dizzy, all for just USD 2 a day.
Well, everyone has his or her own idea of what is most important.
Some people choose white chickens whereas I, for my part, choose African children and Asian children.
That is where foolishness leads you when you try to act virtuously and, with this directive, we are acting stupidly.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start with very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Berman, for the work he has done.
Some 5 billion broiler chickens are slaughtered in the European Union every year, and the great challenge presented by this report is that of finding a balance between the protection of animals, which is necessary, and the protection of jobs in the commercial production of broiler chickens.
There is no doubt â not least in the minds of those who breed and keep chickens for fattening â about the rightness of our making a joint proposal for the improvement and harmonisation of the conditions under which they are kept in the EU.
I, too, endorse the report, but the producers operate, even today, with the tightest of profit margins.
If standards are raised within the Community, they will in particular face the problem of imports from third states, where standards in production are far inferior to our own.
I therefore call for the introduction of binding rules on labelling, founded upon compliance with standards of protection, which will be effective, binding and harmonised right across Europe.
Secondly, I call for certain standards in the keeping and production of broiler chickens and other agricultural products to be demanded in future WTO negotiations.
The EUâs high standard in food production should become an advantage for producers in the EU.
While we want our animals to be protected, we cannot, at the same time, allow our producers to be put in a disadvantaged position.
The current threat of bird flu is another reminder to us of how important it is that broiler chickens should be produced safely, in adequate quantities and on a sound economic basis.
Â Â  Madam President, the welfare of animals in farms has traditionally been an ethical issue.
Due to numerous food crises, it has now also become a public health issue.
Specific legislation in this area has therefore become urgent.
I believe that that is something on which we have all agreed during this debate.
In producing this legislation, however, we must keep our feet on the ground.
We must produce a viable and credible proposal, not restrict ourselves to making pointless gestures, which give the impression of being inconsistent with the Councilâs current figures.
I therefore believe that the report by the rapporteur, MrÂ Berman, whom I congratulate, combines a genuine concern for the welfare of animals, taking account of scientific data at all times, with the necessary flexibility in its application to make it possible for producers to accept the measures proposed and adapt to them.
On the one hand, measures are proposed to prevent the practices that lead to pointless and gratuitous suffering for the animal, and, on the most hotly debated and controversial point â stocking density â credible and applicable figures are laid down that represent significant progress in this field and which are acceptable to the Council.
I believe that we must show responsibility â and we have done this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Furthermore, this proposal maintains the necessary flexibility with regard to producers, which makes this minimal regulation genuinely applicable in the countries of the Union, and does not lead â as is usually the case â to the unnecessary closure of farms.
I believe that it provides the necessary firmness in laying down the regulations with a gradual application of sanctions and an estimation of the costs for producers with a view to ensuring that the burdens stemming from the directive do not fall to them â as is almost always the case.
In conclusion, I would ask you to support the Berman report, in the form presented by the rapporteur and as supported by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I believe that it is a measured and balanced proposal that takes account of the interests of all of the parties, which is not always an easy task.
There is no question that its approval will have positive effects in terms of the quality of the final product, that is to say, for the well-being of European consumers.
Â Â  Madam President, no other animals suffer as much as broiler chickens.
It is they that have far and away the worst experience at present.
They are bred in such a way that they grow extremely large and, as a result, as many as a fifth of them have injuries to their joints.
Separated from their mothers at birth, accommodated in cramped conditions and placed under stress, they suffer throughout their short lives.
MrÂ Berman has tried to find a good balance of measures, but the Committee on Agriculture unfortunately has a bias towards short-term interests.
This must be corrected by means of the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Better conditions are required both by our consumers and in the interests of animal health.
I would thank MrÂ JÃžrgensen and others for their constructive cooperation.
According to Eurobarometer, the individual animal protection issue that most Europeans want to grapple with is precisely that of improving the conditions of broiler chickens.
Today, Parliament must listen to their voices.
Vote, therefore, in favour of the proposals by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and in favour of the proposals put forward by MrÂ JÃžrgensen and the rest of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Without these improvements, the industry will lose all credibility and is in danger of being destroyed â by low consumer confidence rather than by competing imports.
Â Â  Madam President, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the thoroughness with which he has done his job.
Let there be no doubt about this: the CDA is all for animal welfare and regards it as important.
We also welcome the new action programme presented by our Commissioner.
That does not, however, take away from the fact that, while it is clear that the European public does not think highly of animal welfare in Europe â God only knows why, though, for Europe does apply the worldâs strictest standards â their behaviour as consumers is often very different, and that is where the problem lies.
This means that whilst we can introduce stricter standards in Europe, at the same time we could open the floodgates to imports if they are unrestricted.
One could say that we do not make that mistake in the World Trade Organisation and that although Europe tries its hardest, more should be done.
We can come to an agreement with regard to imports and import quotas.
We can also do a deal with regard to labelling.
We can also agree that we in Europe will in any event commit to those who have launched special projects, including the people behind the farmerâs chicken in the Netherlands and the âlabel rougeâ in France.
It should be possible to support them by giving them extra incentives, so that consumers will buy their products.
The CDA prefers this way of working, because otherwise we will produce yet more European legislation, which consumers may applaud well as citizens, but in respect of which they will display different purchase behaviour the minute they walk into a supermarket.
It is essential that what the public want is also translated into consumer behaviour.
That is the very reason we are very critical of this report.
We will be voting in favour of Amendment 42, by means of which something will at least be done about imports, and we will also support everything in this report that is related to improved recognisability through meat labelling.
As long as there are no guarantees, though, that imports can be subjected to the same criteria, as long as we are once again putting the European farmer on the back foot and are again making things more difficult for animal welfare in Europe, it will be extremely difficult for us to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  Poultry breeding and rearing is the progressive, profitable sector of European livestock farming.
A few months ago no one would have questioned this statement.
Today however, poultry farmers are facing a new threat after the bird flu: the current regulation.
The current draft regulation, which has given more consideration to animal welfare than to industry sector and economic arguments, threatens the competitiveness of this sector.
Animal welfare aspects should indeed be taken into consideration.
But we should not overshoot the target by imposing unrealistically strict regulations which force our farmers into a severe competitive disadvantage, endangering their livelihood.
These people do not intend to be cruel to their animals â they just want to earn a living by doing what they are good at.
Therefore, excessively strict regulations are unacceptable.
Additionally, the planned excessive restrictions may lead to serious tension on internal markets, as well, because non-EU countries such as Brazil, which do not have to comply with these strict regulations, are able to sell their poultry products on European Union markets at significantly lower prices.
The majority of average consumers, at least in the new Member States, choose the cheaper product, because their income does not allow them to pay a higher price for basic food, just because they are environmentally aware or care about animal welfare.
In view of the professional, economic and animal welfare considerations, the acceptable stocking density would be 34 kilograms of live weight per square metre, with a maximum upper limit of 42 kilograms of live weight per square metre.
Any figures included in the report that are lower than these are not acceptable.
Let us trust in the expertise of poultry farmers, as none of them would be able to achieve good results with sick animals, which means that their primary interest is to conduct a rationalised economic activity, taking into account animal welfare considerations.
Let us not make their task so difficult that they may be forced to give up poultry breeding altogether!
Â Â  Mr President, is it worth drafting legislation with the aim of relieving the pain of poor creatures that are going to live just six weeks?
My answer is yes, and not just out of kindness to animals: this is linked to human health concerns.
The economic aspects of the industrial production of broiler chickens have rightly been taken into consideration.
However, the case also concerns the limits of the safe decoding and manipulation of animalsâ genetic material.
We should have thought long ago about the dimensions of the industrial production of broiler chickens, not only for reasons of animal welfare, but also on account of the unplanned and unintended effects on the genetic material â in terms of resistance and reproduction, for example â of the animals providing our food, and the subsequent effects on us.
The danger of an outbreak of avian influenza is linked to the problem of control measures, and these measures do not consist only of vaccines.
One of its sources is overly intensive chicken farming, which is also not ideal.
I welcome this first piece of EU legislation of this kind.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a very worthy report that has been a long time coming through the system.
It has achieved as good a balance as one could expect, because I recognise that this is not an easy area in which to balance all the different interests.
Two weeks ago, a poultry-processing plant in Northern Ireland closed with the loss of over 400Â jobs, not to mention the other jobs on the farms and in the feed compound mills.
The reason given was that they could no longer compete with cheap imports from Asia and South America.
I happen to believe that there is no such thing as cheap food.
If food is cheap, it is not meeting the standards.
Therefore I have to ask myself: is the chicken meat produced to our existing standards, never mind the proposed increased standards?
I support the part of the report that states, in AmendmentÂ 17, that we must insist on the same standards in third countries as in the European Union.
At the moment we only pay lip service to this.
We are tying the hands of our producers, our farmers, with bureaucracy and red tape, while allowing others to flood our markets with food that does not meet our standards.
This goes beyond the poultry industry: it is in the pig industry and in the red meat industry as well.
They all have the same problem.
I welcome higher standards, but I want the same everywhere.
We must give consumers the choice.
We must have proper food labelling; it must be clear, so that wherever consumers shop they can make a clear choice about what they wish to buy.
They must know where the food came from.
In many instances the supermarkets in the European Union are worsening standards by forcing down food prices.
As I said earlier, there is no such thing as cheap food; cheap food is sub-standard food.
Â Â  Mr President, I too welcome this report and would like to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for actions which demonstrate that the EU is still prepared to take a leading role in actively improving and promoting animal welfare issues.
The proposal starts from the basis that the existing standards for keeping chicken for meat production are indeed very low in parts of the European Union at the present time, and that is demonstrated by painful leg disorders, enlargement of the heart, sudden death syndrome, ammonia burns on feet and so on. I welcome the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmentâs proposals, but I still believe there is room for further improvement and that is why I have also signed the amendments tabled by Mr JÃžrgensen.
In particular we need further action on stocking density, on uninterrupted rest periods â a minimum of six hours in the darkness â and on issues such as the inhumane issue of beak trimming.
That said, even if we only go as far as the proposal put forward by Mr Berman, there would be a big step forward for animal welfare, but it will also be a big step forward for consumers.
Consumers worry about the conditions under which their chicken meat is produced and they worry about the health of the chicken they are eating.
Properly reared chicken will be a better piece of meat when it goes on the plate.
Finally, I would like to address the issue of cost.
I have looked at the various estimates of what this would cost the industry.
Even if you take the highest estimate, if you aggregate that estimate down to the cost per bird, you are talking about one British penny per bird.
It is not going to be animal welfare measures that make our industry uncompetitive.
I accept that the industry is facing real challenges from places like Thailand and Brazil, but there are other factors â cost of labour and other costs â that we cannot compete on.
It is not animal welfare standards that will make the difference in terms of whether our industry survives or not, so do not use competition as a reason for rejecting these animal welfare standards.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Berman on his report.
I wish to clearly state from the outset that I am in favour of a decent life for animals, for all animals in general and for chickens in particular.
To look at the bigger picture, I say that this demonstrates our humanity towards all our fellow inhabitants of this planet.
However, we must accept that, as has already been said, all this increases the cost of production in the European Union.
On the other hand, of course, we allow chickens to come in from third countries; we allow everything to come in except weapons.
In this way, we are causing European poultry farmers to close their poultry farms.
This is unfortunate on two counts: both for the poultry farmers, a class for which we should show solidarity, and for the chickens, because we shall arrive at the point, in a few years' time, where chicken products will be imported from third countries which are produced without any protection as regards a decent life for the animals.
Unless we want to be hypocrites, we must find a way of controlling the living conditions of chickens in third countries; otherwise we should not permit imports.
Labelling, which Mr Kyprianou, referred to, is a very good idea, we think it is an excellent idea and we want to proceed towards this sector, but we also need to think about subsidising poultry farmers for the costs relating solely to the measures we impose on them.
Otherwise, we shall also wipe out poultry farmers and the poultry we bring in from abroad will have been raised under much worse conditions.
Besides, it is not a crime for us to protect poultry farmers, a class which is asking for our solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, the farming of chickens for meat production is one of the most intensive of farming systems, involving major problems for the welfare and health of the animals.
Today sees us discussing for the first time minimum rules for the protection of broiler chickens; previously, there were only the general provisions of the directive on the protection of farmed animals.
This move on the part of the Commission is therefore to be welcomed, as is also Mr Bermanâs report, and those who have been following the debate, with points of criticism and interventions flying off in all directions, have completed a difficult exercise.
One can take a positive view of Article 1 of the Commission proposal, according to which the Member States are at liberty to enact more stringent provisions, but those that the directive proposes are inadequate in certain respects, the issue most frequently discussed today has been that of how much stocking density can be allowed in terms of kilos of live weight per square metre.
The Commission claims to be taking as its basis the report that the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare produced in 2000, but that is not in fact the case, for this report explicitly states that the occupying density must not exceed 25Â kg per square metre if more serious problems for the animalsâ well-being are to be avoided.
Article 3 of the Commission proposal prescribes 30 kg per square metre live weight.
I endorse Amendment 53 from Mr JÃžrgensen, Mr Bowis and Mr Sacconi, which prescribes that chickens should be kept at a density of 25Â kg per square metre, and that this density may be increased to a maximum of 30Â kg per square metre if the owner complies with certain conditions.
Â Â  Mr President, I also very much welcome Mr Bermanâs report and thank him for the work he has put into it.
I believe that high standards for animal welfare are good not only for chickens but also for farmers and consumers.
What we have to do is get the balance right and I believe he has moved in that direction.
It is not just about the number of chickens per square metre; it is also about the atmospheric conditions in the houses and whether there is straw or anything in them, so that the chickens have slightly better conditions during their very short lives.
When consumers go to the supermarket to buy chicken, it has to be clearly labelled.
One of the problems is that you can often go into a supermarket now anywhere in the European Union and buy a chicken without being absolutely sure where it has come from and to what standards it has been produced.
The Commissioner said that consumers like to buy high-welfare-standard chickens.
Yes, they do, but these need to be clearly labelled.
Also, the Commissioner must be aware that a lot of the imported chicken meat that comes into Europe arrives in a partially cooked state.
That way it gets around some of the EU tariffs.
It then goes straight into processed food, so that when we go to buy our chicken sandwich at a motorway service station, it will probably be made from imported chicken meat and we have no idea what sort of standards it has met.
AmendmentÂ 17 to ArticleÂ 5 asks the Commission to bring in a clear labelling system for meat that is imported into the European Union after the legislation has been in place for six months.
I urge the Commission to do that.
When Europe introduces higher standards â as I believe it must â we have to be sure that everything else entering Europe meets the same high standards.
Â Â  MrÂ President, animal welfare is undoubtedly a noble cause; we subscribe to it and we also pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur, MrÂ Berman.
I will simply add that the farmersâ welfare is also a noble cause and, in our view, a high-priority cause.
This sector is already seriously threatened by non-European competition.
I heard one of my fellow Members say a short while ago that there had been no farm closures, but that is incorrect because this is already a widespread phenomenon across the European territory.
I will simply mention my own region â Brittany â which represents 35% of the French production of broiler chickens and which, above all, accounts for 18Â 000 jobs, 11Â 000 of which are in the agricultural and food industries.
This is a region in which farms are currently being closed.
Clearly, if the current â and already very serious â distortions of competition increase, then we will witness a massive influx of products from third countries, coupled with a fall in our exports.
Of course, it is all very well being told âproduce high-quality goodsâ, but we know that adapting and restructuring are very risky, and in any case require a great deal of time.
A great deal of work has been done on this matter, but there are nevertheless some real shortcomings in the justifications of this text.
I will mention the thresholds, which seem to give rise to a virtue contest, with the thresholds being set at the lowest levels possible; next, the assessment indicators of the âbreeding contestsâ; and lastly, and above all, the impact study of the repercussions in terms of the elimination of farms and jobs in the sector.
To conclude, I should like to pose a question to Commissioner Kiprianou.
Commissioner, in the current context of the threat of avian influenza, which is approaching Europe, or even already in Europe, how should one go about tackling the paradox between, on the one hand, high European standards in respect of animal welfare and, on the other, the necessary national measures for keeping poultry indoors?
We should be grateful to receive your reply.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Members for a very interesting debate.
Perhaps I should have quoted Mahatma Ghandi earlier: âThe greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treatedâ.
In the European Union, thank God, we have a very high level of civilisation.
The largest number of letters and complaints I have received from European citizens concerns animal welfare, in particular broilers.
So this proposal reflects the views of European citizens.
It is based on science, but also on consultations with all the stakeholders over a period of three years to take account of all their views and concerns.
It is a compromise.
Some would like us to go further and have said it is a low-standard proposal.
Others say we have gone too far.
It is a step towards protecting the welfare of animals, but it also takes into account the interests of the producers.
Competitiveness is certainly important, but we know that the cost imposed on production by animal welfare standards is very low, something between 2.5 and 8Â cents per bird.
The other costs affect competitiveness. But I do not believe that European producers can compete on the basis of cost.
They should compete on the basis of quality.
I have some photographs here of the dermatitis caused by this intensive farming and I do not think that any European consumer would be willing to eat these birds; it is just that they do not know about it.
So awareness and education are the best policy, together with labelling, which is very important. We have letters; we have Eurobarometer.
European citizens are ready to pay more, provided they know, and we are working on that.
On the issue of avian flu, best practices in animal welfare help us implement preventive measures more effectively, to protect the industry and the birds from avian flu.
If it is easier to detect sick animals, it is easier to control the situation, and therefore these proposals on animal welfare and protection against avian flu are compatible.
Regarding the amendments, because of the lack of time we will circulate a full list of those that have been accepted and those that have not.
I would ask that this list be included in the verbatim report of proceedings of this sitting(1).
Many of the amendments were accepted because they are compatible with the philosophy of the proposal.
Others cannot be accepted, mostly for technical reasons or because the provisions are already included in existing legislation.
Proposals such as those that take account of climatic conditions, types of production, training of staff and the way the checks should be performed can all be accepted.
One of the most sensitive issues was density.
We feel that the proposal is a reasonable compromise.
It meets the standards, it improves the situation and it establishes conditions and controls.
We would therefore prefer that Parliament accept the Commissionâs proposal on that point and we cannot accept that amendment.
Concerning mandatory labelling, we feel â and I agree with Mr Parish that it is very important â that six months is a rather short period.
It would be very difficult to produce a substantial report with specific proposals, so we need more time for that.
Finally, on the issue of cost, not everything can be measured in monetary terms, but I know it is a very important aspect.
Animal welfare is a very small part of the production cost.
I mentioned earlier that in one of the cases the World Bank studied, with the adoption of a very small number of improvements in the treatment of birds, a farm managed to save USDÂ 320Â 000 per year.
I think that proves that adopting animal welfare policies is only really a cost in the short term; eventually it makes a profit and there is a financial benefit for the producers.
I would like to thank Members again for their support for this proposal, which is a big step towards improving animal welfare in the European Union.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon
Â Â  It is unacceptable that the chickens we eat are effectively subject to torture for the whole of their brief lives.
I support the proposal to introduce lower stocking densities for broiler chickens and I will vote for the amendments I have co-signed for still lower levels.
It is also right to deal with this matter at European level.
Too often, animal welfare provisions of this sort are thwarted at national level by the argument that âif we alone do it, we will put our producers at a competitive disadvantage, and production will simply shift to less scrupulous Member Statesâ.
By introducing the same rule across the whole of our single European market, we lessen that problem at a stroke, ensure a level playing field for our producers and protect chickens across 25Â countries.
The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2, 7, 16, 20, 22, 24, 30, 32, 37, 39, 40, 41, 45, 55, 60 and 67.
Amendments 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 34, 35, 38, 56 and 57 can be accepted in part.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 21, 23, 29, 31, 33, 36, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 or 68.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Gunnar HÃ¶kmark, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on State aid reform 2005-2009 (2005/2165(INI)) (A6-0009/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, the roadmap for State aid reform from the Commission is a good and an important document.
I hope that this report will contribute to the improvement of the State aid policy.
Therefore, I should like to thank colleagues and shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this improvement by the amendments and discussions we have had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I hope there will be, as there was in the committee, broad support for this new policy, which I hope will make an impact on the future guidelines on State aid policy that the Commission will be responsible for.
MrÂ President, Europe needs a competitive economy.
As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, new jobs, new products and new markets.
It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate.
Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.
If we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs.
Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old.
This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses.
A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind.
However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome.
In European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned.
In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of.
The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be.
As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs.
We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors.
Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window.
We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.
An overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commissionâs document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition.
A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid.
What is required is that State aid be predictable.
It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations.
The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable.
The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another.
That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation.
The same applies to companies in the public interest.
We must not have State aid that funds that type of activity excessively, but must give new companies opportunities to develop.
The same may be said of regional or environmental aid.
It must be directed across the board and so made open and accessible to all.
If we ensure that this happens and follow up the demands for increased scrutiny and transparency, better rendering of accounts and more stringent auditing, we shall lay the basis for a State aid policy that entails less State aid, and such State aid as there is will no longer distort competition.
There will, however, be increased resources for innovation, a cleaner environment and thriving regions.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr HÃ¶kmarkâs remarks make sense, and I could not agree more with them.
It is a pleasure to take part in the discussion about the report on the State Aid Action Plan prepared by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I can assure you that, after your remarks, it is an even greater pleasure.
As has been said, it is of fundamental importance to handle State aid in the correct way.
If it is not handled in the correct way, it is an instrument which, instead of providing a solution, can have the opposite effect.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his clear and balanced report.
I greatly appreciate the interest and involvement of the European Parliament in the process of reforming the rules of State aid.
This is â as has been mentioned before â a crucial project.
It is a high priority for me during this term in office.
You may remember that the consultation on State aid reform was launched here in Strasbourg last June.
Today, again, Strasbourg is the place where we are continuing the debate and, hopefully, will come to a conclusion as to which direction we can go with the review.
I am happy to say that the consultation on State aid reform will be completed with your report.
The Commission has received many comments on the State Aid Action Plan, from many different stakeholders across Europe.
For me, your comments are an essential complement to what I have heard from elsewhere in Europe.
I am very pleased that Parliament, like the great majority of stakeholders, is supportive, in general, of the Commissionâs plans.
I will not repeat the content of the reform programme, which was touched upon by the rapporteur.
In the spirit of the Lisbon Strategy, we want State aid reform to help Member States get the best value for money by focusing state resources on measures that will contribute to sustainable economic growth and to more and better jobs for the future.
State aid is taxpayersâ money, so we need to take into account that we can explain it to those who want it and those who obtain it.
We also want to improve the procedures and administration of State aid policy, as was rightly touched upon by the rapporteur.
One important message in the report is the need for legal certainty.
I fully share the concern that, if we are not successful in making that legal certainty visible, then we will have failed.
The Commission will explain further how it intends to use economics for State aid policy.
Market failure is not a magic word; it is, rather, a methodology to analyse the problems within markets.
I agree with the reportâs focus on the need for transparency of aid.
On services of general economic interest, the Commission has no competence to interpret the jurisprudence.
Nevertheless â I got your message, Mr President! â the Commission will try to give guidance when adopting decisions on individual cases in this field.
I look forward to your questions and comments, and I will do my utmost to respond to them.
Â Â  . As aÂ member of the Committee on Regional Development and rapporteur for the recently adopted report on State aid for regional development, allow me to make aÂ few points concerning the possible implications of the reform of State aid for economic, social and territorial cohesion.
In its document, the Commission correctly indicates that State aid is an important factor in ensuring homogenous regional development, thereby strengthening one of the fundamental economic pillars of the European Union.
I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of regional bonuses.
It seems to me that in striving to attain the Lisbon Agenda parameters it would be logical to invest more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas, thus preventing the all-round growth of the European Union.
In addition, IÂ would like to emphasise the need to simplify procedures and to make the whole system of State aid provision transparent.
Maximum transparency should be applied rigorously to the process of allocating and approving State aid.
All persons and entities applying for aid in support of their activities must feel sure, in the event that they are turned down, that it was for objective reasons.
Similarly, they must be informed about who has been granted aid, and why.
This will generate a spirit of trust, and will enable citizens to have faith that the EU system is functioning in a uniform way.
National governments are important elements that can either support or disrupt this system.
If they are given more responsibility for taking decisions on State aid provision, their decisions and activities must be subject to the transparency of the entire system.
IÂ hope, Mr President, that we will all be able to conclude, following the reform of State aid provision, that the system really has been improved, and that it will contribute in a clearly objective manner to the uniform development of the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, since I agree entirely with the report produced by my group colleague, Mr HÃ¶kmark, I shall be very specific and deal exclusively with the issues that I would like to emphasise.
With regard to the general philosophy, I agree that, since State aid is a form of competition policy aimed at creating an even playing field amongst the different companies, we should insist not just on aid that takes the form of subsidies and which therefore belongs in the public spending chapter, but also on those fiscal incentives that do not respond to the nature of the tax, but which respond to the desire to stimulate certain activities in geographical areas, that is to say the same intention as direct aid.
With regard to research, development and innovation, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur in particular on the extension of the scope of beneficiaries, to expressly include universities amongst the possible beneficiaries of this kind of aid.
I would also like to congratulate him â and I am now addressing the Commissioner â on his comments in the field of risk capital.
If one thing explains the differences in growth between the United States and Europe, it is dynamism, the power of its small and medium-sized companies, not so much in terms of net birth rate, which is more or less the same, but in terms of US small businessesâ greater capacity for growth in the first two years, which requires a degree of funding.
And in the field of risk capital we are a long way behind.
If my figures are accurate, while risk capital represents 0.45% of United States GDP, European risk capital is less than 0.14%.
On the issue of regional aid â my final point â I would also stress what Mr Koterec has said, but I would like to add an aspect that has not been mentioned: it would not make sense also to take State aid away from regions that stop receiving Structural Funds as a result of natural growth, and not just for statistical reasons, as the rapporteur has said.
If the Commissioner will allow me, therefore, I would like to correct paragraph 36 on this issue, to include regions losing funds for statistical reasons and those that lose them through natural growth.
I congratulate the rapporteur once again.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to thank our rapporteur, MrÂ Gunnar HÃ¶kmark, and all of our fellow Members.
We are in fact dealing here with a non-legislative report, and I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a good job in terms of voicing the European Parliamentâs strong position.
On the whole, we have managed to end up with a fairly clear outlook on things.
I am one of those who believe, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we do in fact need to review the State aid system.
This system is more than ever at the heart of the Commissionâs powers, since Europe remains essentially a Europe of the internal market and competition until further notice.
I am not sure whether the âNoâ vote in the French referendum offers other prospects for the long-term future.
We are therefore truly at the heart of Community powers here, and it is true that, with the enlargement of Europe, the European Union and the Commission are at risk of thrombosis if the State aid system and arrangements are left in their current state.
Parliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society.
We are not just a market society; there must, as the texts stipulate, also be room for public action, not only on all those occasions when the market is failing, but also on all those occasions when we need to reduce social or territorial inequalities, manage external effects, promote innovation and, should the need arise, give a boost to industry.
When, at times, we shift to a free market way of thinking, we sometimes find ourselves wondering: âWould we be in a position today to build the or would we be in a position to build the rocket, given the dominant ideology?â
I believe that we must retain this opportunity to intervene very forcefully in the industrial landscape and in public research.
I should like to say to the Commissioner that the main contribution of Parliament is to ensure that State aid is not assessed as something merely to be borne but, rather, is assessed in a balanced way, that is to say that not only are the negative aspects, such as distortions of competition, considered, but so too are the positive effects.
We, in the European Parliament, wanted the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to be clearly applied and, more specifically, wanted State aid that has no obvious impact on the internal market to be considered as compensation.
We also wanted market failures to be better understood.
Finally, I should like to mention the issues that still need to be discussed and that are referred to in the 21 amendments tabled.
With regard to public services, we need clarification on those aspects to do with compensation, with the legitimate funding of public services and with subsidiary funding and, above all, we need clarification on what constitutes the fourth criterion set out in the judgment, a criterion that, by the Commissionâs own admission, is actually extremely vague and very difficult to handle.
With regard to innovation, MrsÂ in 't Veld will soon present us with her report.
We believe that it is a very good text and we hope to enhance it.
The question that must be asked concerns the scope of the report: should it be strictly confined to innovation, or should it branch out a little further into the area of research and development?
With regard to the regions, some excellent amendments are focused on preventing relocations from being funded by State aid.
This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies.
Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that we are obviously totally in favour of State aid being considered in the framework of the Lisbon Process and the Gothenburg Process, that is to say not only in terms of the knowledge-based economy, but also in terms of helping the environment.
Â Â  .
Mr President, first of all, I should like to add my voice in support of Mr HÃ¶kmarkâs excellent report, which we as a group will be backing, and we also support the choice which the Commission has made in favour of less and better-targeted state support, in which respect I should like to stress once again, lest we forget, that the amounts involved are actually lower.
State support should be a last resort and is not a panacea.
Although it may be presented in that way from time to time, it also has adverse side effects.
At the same time, we can be open-handed in granting state support only after all pre-conditions and our other items of policy have been complied with, or else we would end up fighting a running battle.
We must, for example, ensure that the internal market is completed and functions well and in that respect, I hope that this House will be taking a sensible decision on Thursday with regard to the services directive.
We must counter protectionism, promote fair competition, abolish red tape and excessive legislation, guarantee better access to risk capital and also establish an internal market for financial services, but at the same time, we must put in place such things as truly free movement for workers from all EU Member States and an immigration policy that is geared towards keeping the brightest and best, our top people, in Europe rather than chasing them away to the United States.
Only when those things are in place can we see whether we might be able to intervene with State aid where the market is inefficient, for we are not so much dealing with market failure as we are with market inefficiencies.
I should also like to repeat that State aid should, in principle, not be sanctioned.
It disrupts the market and distorts competition.
Mr Savary said a moment ago that the EU has a tendency to be too liberal, but I should like to draw Mr Savaryâs attention to the fact that we spend billions on State aid each year.
Even by the most conservative estimates, the amounts involved are more or less half of the EUâs budget, so that is not terribly liberal in my view.
Things could be a bit more liberal as far as I am concerned.
I also agree with what Mr Savary said a moment ago: we must set aside State aid for the priorities of the twenty-first century: the Lisbon objectives, innovation, knowledge, sustainability âŠ
Consequently, I think that we should give far less State aid to obsolete and obsolescent industries, and as far as State aid for environmental objectives is concerned, I think we should first set to abolishing the billions of State aid we grant the many polluting industries and sectors that make use of sources of non-renewable energy, and I will therefore advise my group to support Mr Lipietzâs amendments to that effect.

Global context is also important in the debate.
We cannot deny, of course, that in other parts of the world, liberal amounts of State aid are still being given out.
That much we should recognise, but our objective to reduce State aid remains intact.
Finally, I should like to say a few words on public services.
I should like to repeat â and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect â that the phrases âservices of general interestâ and âservices of general economic interestâ have still not been defined, and it is, in that light, very odd to legislate for them.
That is just by the by.
As Mr Savary mentioned a moment ago, legal certainty and clarity are urgently needed for those public services.
I should like to finish by asking the Commission to submit, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of the impact which the rules that the Commission adopted last year had on State aid as compensation for public services.
I would like to know the amount of State aid involved, the number of companies involved and what impact this had on the market.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can follow on directly from what Mrs inât Veld had to say just now.
It is true to say that Europe is competitive only if it is also innovative in the ways in which it protects the environment.
I think it would be a good thing if there were a bonus not only for innovation, but also, and primarily, for environmental information, and I think it regrettable that this is absent from the Commissionerâs draft.
Secondly, one important feature of the report is the fact that the de minimis rules really must be applied to businesses with at least EURÂ 200 000 per annum.
I have to say, Commissioner, that they are very generalised, and that is not enough.
We know that these businesses are needed in rural areas if they are to enjoy the most basic economic development, just as we know that the regions affected by population change need businesses to settle in them, and if they are to do that they will need State aid.
There is no other way in which we can counteract such effects, and so I think it is important that there should be a marked increase in this area.
Finally, let me turn to the rules for businesses providing services of general interest.
It is not acceptable that such rules should qualify the Altmark ruling, for the risk then arises of the Commission using competition rules as a means of defining what general interest actually means â the very same thing that you are trying to do by means of the services directive, that controversial document in which you sacrifice general interest on the altar of the free market.

What we need, then â and urgently, too â is a framework directive, even if you do not see yourself as having that responsibility, and we need one in this instance because we want the social Europe to stand on secure foundations, one of the most fundamental of which is services of general interest, and the public will turn their backs on Europe if these become the victim of rules on competition.
Â Â  . â Mr President, State aid, in other words the workers' money, is in the firing line, the objective being to reduce it and have management of it controlled by the European Union, so that it can serve the Lisbon Strategy.
This means less State aid for grass-roots needs and servicing of the competitiveness of European capital.
In other words, the people's money will be not for grass-roots prosperity, but for the profitability of capital.
The references to State aid for purposes of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States, but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice.
It is vital, they say, to reduce State aid, in order for it to have positive results.
Do remote rural and island areas, such as those in my country, in which capital does not invest because there is no or little profit, really have to be abandoned completely, including by State aid, and be laid to waste?
They are already being abandoned, to a degree, and it looks like this will intensify in future.
Public services are being privatised, basic grass-roots needs are being commercialised.
The reduction in State aid and its orientation towards servicing the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy will exacerbate still further the situation of the grass-roots classes.
Despite the reference to the financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises for investments, unfortunately the evidence shows that, so far, economic aid for small businesses has been non-existent or has been dispensed with a dropper.
By contrast, for big business there has been open-handedness and it is big business that benefits and, with today's proposals, will be strengthened even more.
Â Â  . Mr President, it would be very nice if we were able to throw endless amounts of money at our relatively poor East European neighbours, but history has shown that by doing that you do not make the poor rich, you simply make the rich poor.
At an exhibition in Brussels put on by the Dutch Presidency, it was predicted that another ten poor European countries will be joining the EU by 2022: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine.
West Germanyâs experience in pouring almost a thousand billion euro into East Germany shows what it costs to try to create a level playing field for a poor neighbour.
The cost of giving State aid to all of these new Member States will be astronomical.
Currently the EU is spending over half its budget on State aid.
Britain is far from rich as it is.
We are being told that our government cannot afford to pay us a decent pension unless we work until we are 70.
Our health service is seriously under funded and our navy, which is a fraction of the size it once was, can hardly afford to pay for the fuel it needs to go to sea.
Let us stop this crazy idea now before the so-called rich Member States end up totally impoverished.
Instead, why do we not help to improve the economies of our European neighbours and of Third World countries by opening up free trade opportunities to them?
If this enriches us all, as I think it will, individual Member States might then be in a position to help their neighbours financially; but charity should begin at home.
Â Â  Mr President, it seems to me that on occasions the Commissionâs policy on State aid has proved to be a blunt, inflexible and at times inappropriately directed instrument, which has often discouraged rather than facilitated economic development.
I therefore question whether a further assault on State aid is justified in pursuit of the failing Lisbon Agenda.
However, the specific issue I wish to focus on is regional aid.
I welcome the fact that the present regional aid guidelines, as they affect my constituency of Northern Ireland, are a marked improvement from earlier drafts, and that the Commission has listened to representations from myself and others.
The new draft guidelines provide for continued distinctive treatment of Northern Ireland as an economic development region and therefore allow ongoing aid to attract inward foreign investment on a reducing scale through to 2011.
Having to compete with a 12.5% corporation tax south of the border in Ireland, the capacity for Northern Ireland to give aid to attract foreign investment is absolutely indispensable.
It is exactly such local realities that the Commission needs to reflect more and more on the implementation of what is too often rigid dogma on State aid and indeed on other policies affecting the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr HÃ¶kmarkâs report and the debate in Committee got to the heart of the matter; the report, in particular, is an excellent one.
The Commissionerâs contribution also gave great cause for hope.
The reform of policy on State aid is enormously important to people at the local level, where the towns, boroughs and regions are the main sources of public investments.
As has already been said, their municipal enterprises play an important part in guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest, and so it is important that the Commission should â as it has already agreed to do â announce how it proposes to implement the criteria set out in the ECJâs ruling in the Altmark case.
If legal disputes are to be avoided, those who will have to apply these criteria must have a clear idea of what the Commissionâs policy is.
The more concrete the Altmark criteria are, the more difficult they are to implement, and the individual public offices cannot be expected to get to grips with the fundamental principle and determine for themselves whether or not aid has been granted on the basis of the avoidance of overcompensation using market compensations; to do so would involve them in a quite unjustifiable amount of bureaucracy.
The local offices could, though, be enabled to do that if â as has indeed already been announced â they had access to workable guidelines with which, for example, they could determine which market was relevant.
I am glad that the Committee, under MrÂ HÃ¶kmarkâs guidance, has turned its attention to the non-inclusion of public SMEs in the definition of SMEs, and I also welcome the conclusion it has come to regarding that.
Public undertakings meet the publicâs needs where they are, and the public regard them as their own property.
By supporting communal public undertakings in their work rather than making it more difficult, the EU will go up even further in the publicâs estimation, and so I would encourage the House to continue pressing for the definition of SME to include communal public undertakings.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to join those who have congratulated the rapporteur, but also the shadow rapporteurs, on their achievements.
I think that it is once again thanks to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we have managed, with a very liberal Swedish perspective and at the same time a Socialist French perspective, to achieve a good outcome after all.
In contrast to my Dutch fellow Member, Mrs in ât Veld, I will not make a case for less State aid.
In my view, this âless is moreâ mind-set is not the most important dimension.
What matters is for what purpose and how this State aid is deployed.
State aid should not only be seen as a deviation or aberration from perfect market forces, but as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives.
It is to be welcomed that the current Commissioner for Competition also sees her portfolio in such a broader economic context, to include the Lisbon strategy, for this strategy is not just about economic, but also about broader socio-economic effects.
This socio-economic context and this additional perspective of employment and social cohesion are also the very aspects I should like to stress on behalf of my group.
I should, in this context, like to mention two points in respect of which I would ask you not to be too dogmatic in your approach.
First of all, with regard to market failure, it is important to look at the bigger picture in that area too, and to take full account of employment and social cohesion.
The other point is the temporary nature of State aid.
Here too, I would ask you to allow for some degree of flexibility, because some sectors might well need government subsidies and government instruments in the longer term â national radio and television spring to mind.
The importance of plurality of the press and a good balance in the provision of information may require longer-term investments of government funds into sectors of that kind.
Public housing is another example.
Given the interests of town and country planning, the integration of minorities and social integration in cities, certain players within the market may well be granted government support in order to achieve those broader objectives.
Finally, with regard to the European and national dimensions, I should like to point out, as indeed MrÂ HÃ¶kmark did in his report, that State aid can be used from time to time to stir up policy competition between Member States, and I should like to ask the Commission to keep an eye on this and to monitor this more closely, and to check whether it is the Member States themselves and not just the companies that are granted State aid that have to have sanctions imposed on them.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, one of Mr HÃ¶kmarkâs central contentions is that the market economy is always the most efficient means whereby resources may be shared out.
If we take Gothenburg seriously, it makes sound business sense to rely on the equilateral triangle between economic, social and environmental development, but the statement is flawed in economic terms.
If Mr HÃ¶kmark â as he himself is right to say â wants small and medium-sized enterprises to be efficient and innovation to be driven forward, above all by subsidy, then what is needed alongside that is good training, good education, and the right infrastructure â not just in the great conurbations, but also, of course, in rural areas.
He is therefore forced back onto the need for territorial, social and environmental cohesion.
If not, the simple fact is that people who live in places without these favourable and natural conditions are put at a disadvantage.
That being so, I do indeed urge that a great deal of care be taken when considering where aid is to be applied, and it also has to be considered whether services in the public interest benefit from it, or else there is no point to it.
In one respect, I can tell Mr HÃ¶kmark that he is absolutely right.
He writes that it makes no sense to give aid to businesses that are already profitable, and in that I agree with him.
When I say that that sort of aid is wrong, I am thinking of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the highly-profitable motor industry into which money is shovelled, only for the firms to then close down and take production elsewhere with the help of more subsidies.
That cannot be what aid is for.
In that respect, MrÂ HÃ¶kmark, you have got it absolutely right.
There are a whole load of models that we have to change.
The threshold is the right one.
It is indeed the case that regional aid is needed for the more backward regions in particular, and it cannot be denied that aid under Article 87 will continue to be needed for those regions currently affected by the statistical effect.
Â Â  I congratulate my colleague, Mr HÃ¶kmark, for the useful report, as unfortunately, over the past few years, we have not succeeded in reducing high assistance levels.
I agree that the administrative aspects of the procedure ought to be simplified, too.
