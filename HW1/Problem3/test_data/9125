Any decision now taken regarding an Intergovernmental Conference would of course have to be ratified by all the Member States of the European Union according to their constitutional requirements.
It is also barely conceivable, or at least unlikely, that, even if an Intergovernmental Conference were to be convened straight away â which, as I said, I do not currently think is appropriate â and it did adopt a regulation of this kind, it could come into force before the start of the European Parliament's next parliamentary term.
In conclusion, I should like to come to the question raised in the debate regarding the cooperation of the European Parliament with any such Intergovernmental Conference.
In this regard, I would just make it clear that any such involvement and the extent of it would of course have to be laid down in the Council Decision on convening the Intergovernmental Conference in which the modalities for involving other institutions in the conference would have to be set out.
Â Â  I have received two motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  â After the incident with Chernobyl reactor number four just twenty years ago, a radioactive cloud enveloped not just this former Soviet republic, but the whole of Europe.
IÂ personally lived through the fear that is born out of ignorance, as the totalitarian regime in the former Czechoslovakia failed to inform those of us living near the Ukrainian border of what had happened, of the threat we faced, or of how to protect ourselves.
The actual extent of the tragedy was only made public some days later.
Breaches of safety regulations, human error and a subsequent lack of information has resulted in unnecessary loss of life among the people of my region.
A devastated environment and the fate of people with incurable diseases are aÂ grave warning to us all.
Ladies and gentlemen, IÂ ask that today we dedicate aÂ momentâs silence to the victims of the Chernobyl tragedy, both those who have not survived to this day as well as those who bear its legacy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, our democracies are based on non-negotiable principles: peace and freedom, mutual respect, equality and, if possible, fraternity.
It was the tragedies of history, and particularly of the Second World War, that finally made our respectful elders acknowledge the need firmly to establish peace on our continent.
The act of remembrance still makes for a healthier world, and to refuse to accept the lessons that history has taught us by denying its events means running the risk of being condemned to relive those events.
For the sake of that, we, as Europeans, cannot tolerate the repeated remarks made by the President of Iran denying the Holocaust, laying claim to a myth and calling for the disappearance of Israel.
It would be disgraceful on our part if we were to trivialise those remarks and to ignore them in the name of goodness knows what intolerable or real economy.
Everyone, including the people of Iran and ourselves, must shoulder their responsibilities and insist that MrÂ Ahmadinejad retracts his unspeakable statements.
We cannot let a country that endorses those kinds of remarks by its President take part in an international sporting event on European soil.
Equally, we could not tolerate its presence in Nuremberg, as that would be an insult to the memory of the Holocaust martyrs.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to raise an issue about what happens to a non-national worker.
Let us say somebody comes to Ireland for a few years to earn some money.
What happens if that person is unfortunate enough to die unexpectedly?
In the last month alone, there were two cases where three Latvian workers and four Polish workers were killed in two separate road accidents.
Obviously the grieving families wish the bodies to be returned home, but in certain cases â not necessarily those I have just mentioned â they were simply unable to afford to repatriate the bodies of their loved ones.
I know of cases in Ireland where local health boards, friends, neighbours, colleagues, etc. raised the necessary funds to bring the bodies home.
However, I do not believe we should leave this situation to chance.
As a Union we facilitate the free movement of persons.
Therefore, either some fund should be set up to help grieving families if they find themselves unable to pay the costs of repatriation and if they are not covered by insurance, or perhaps we might look at the social welfare systems across Europe to see if they could be used to help.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to bring to public attention another example of the European Unionâs hypocrisy when it comes to addressing environmental matters.
It is reported in todayâs that the publicly funded European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is poised to support the highly controversial Sakhalin II project.
This proposal to extract oil from the continental shelf off the Russian island of Sakhalin threatens not only the economy and way of life of the islandâs inhabitants, but also poses a potential environmental disaster of alarming proportions.
Local fishermen and international environmental groups are pleading with the EBRD not to grant a loan of approximately EURÂ 300Â million to finance the project.
Now we see the EU in its true colours, which are by no means green.
Both the European Community and the European Investment Bank are shareholders in a bank that proposes to finance a project which will have exactly the opposite effect to protecting the environment.
This is hypocrisy in its saddest form.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, whenever I hear reports about the situation in the run-up to elections in some developing countries, I tell myself it could never happen in Europe.
Particularly in the EU, we recognise democratic values, we lead civilised election campaigns, and physical assaults do not happen here.
Except that this is no longer true.
In the Czech Republic, the deputy leader of a political party standing at almost 20% in the opinion polls was attacked and brutally beaten by three assailants five weeks before the elections.
The man in question is current Member of the Czech Parliament JiÅÃ­ DolejÅ¡.
Yet we calmly continue discussing the notion of politiciansâ immunity.
In its resolution today, the Chamber of Deputies condemned the rightward tendencies in society.
Ladies and gentlemen, if such things were to become the rule in EU Member States, I would say that we must, as a matter of urgency, do something about it.
Thank you for your words of solidarity.
Â Â  Unfortunately we must â with increasing frequency â face the fact that the countries of Europe, and especially Central Europe, are stricken by floods as a result of climate changes and cruel deforestations.
This is happening as we speak.
A tremendous fight against the floods is taking place along the Danube, mostly in Romania, and along the Tisza in Hungary and in the northern part of Serbia, in Vojvodina.
The waters have already demolished the flood defences in many areas.
I am extremely pleased that the European Union created the Solidarity Fund a few years ago, and is using it.
I think that the situation currently developing in my constituency, Southern Hungary, and especially in the neighbouring countries, may require the use of this Solidarity Fund.
I ask the Council to show flexibility in respect of the utilisation of the assistance, in accordance with the approach of the Commission.
This would enable the affected regions â including candidate and associate states â to actually perceive the fact that Europe helps.
In the Flood Directive under preparation, the European Union should undertake a larger share in alleviating the risk burdens of Member States, giving special consideration to cooperation with third countries.
And this, too, is now a current issue.
I would also call attention to the fact that farmers should receive the direct assistance in the event of flooding.
Furthermore, if in the course of flood defence procedures their land must be withdrawn from cultivation, they should still keep their entitlement to assistance.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, six months ago, I was a member of the European Unionâs observation mission present at the Palestinian elections.
Given this EU presence during the elections in Palestine, I regard the Councilâs decision to suspend aid to the Palestinian Authority as illogical.
We are rejecting the outcome of an electoral process that we supported and praised for the smooth way in which it was carried out.
Is this really helping democracy?
Suspending aid amounts to punishing the Palestinian population as a whole, that is to say to punishing not only the Islamists of Hamas, but also the civilian population, the children, the women, the pacifists and the democrats who were represented, I would point out, by 12 other lists of candidates during the elections.
Suspending aid means dealing a fatal blow to an emerging and fragile State, as the first people to be affected will be the 150Â 000 Palestinian civil servants who also oversee health care and educational services and who provide a livelihood for more than a quarter of the population.
The World Bank has already sounded the alarm bell about the dangers of a humanitarian crisis.
International aid does not serve to support this or that party in power but, in accordance with the Oslo agreements, it does ensure the very existence of the Palestinian Authority and of its basic public services.
I should like to inform you, in solemn terms, of the anxiety shared by myself and by many Europeans.
This decision is counter-productive and will help to strengthen Hamas.
It is liable to make the Palestinian population more radical at a time when it needs aid more than it does lessons if it is to keep hoping for a just and long-lasting peace and to believe in democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the residents of Warsaw, I would like to draw the Houseâs attention to the planned construction of express roads through urbanised areas of the Polish capital.
The project provides for transit roads that will take traffic through the middle of heavily populated residential estates.
Implementation of this plan will pose a threat to the health of hundreds of thousands of the cityâs residents.
Particulate emissions will increase by over 10 times, even though acceptable air levels are already exceeded by 50%, or even by 120%.
Other health threats should not be forgotten, such as carbon monoxide, benzene, hydrocarbons and other chemicals.
The project is based on outdated land development plans, which do not take into account the growth of the city and the building of new residential estates.
It is for precisely this reason that the roads will run directly between residential housing blocks, and one of them will run through the Mazowiecki Landscape Park in the Wawer district.
I would add that this runs counter to the EUâs Natura 2000 programme.
I hope that there are people in the European Parliament who care about the good of the environment in Poland, and also about the health of thousands of citizens in Poland.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, during a parade in Milan yesterday marking the anniversary of the liberation of Italy and Europe from Nazi occupation, a very serious anti-Semitic incident â a really violent case of racism â occurred.
There were protests against the Jewish Brigade, which had fought for the liberation of Europe, two Israeli flags were burnt, and the Education Minister was angrily heckled.
Even worse, the Education Ministerâs father, a partisan who had been held in Dachau and had won the silver and bronze medals of the Resistance, was shouted at and jeered.
This Parliament must send out a very strong signal that such incidents must never again be repeated.
MrÂ President, I make a formal request that in your official capacity you intervene and once again condemn these anti-Semitic, racist incidents, by means of a formal position statement from the President.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to come back to the attacks suffered in my country, France, by some young German pupils while they took part in an educational exchange programme with some schools in the Paris suburbs.
These pupils were greeted with Nazi salutes and were chased by youngsters throwing stones at them.
These are extremely serious events, and I should like to express my indignation to you.
These are, I am afraid to say, far from isolated incidents.
When it is clear that the European idea was constructed, of course, in order to put a stop to xenophobia and to wars between nations, actions such as these are inadmissible.
I wanted to take the floor because some people seem to play down actions such as these by claiming that they are normal.
That version of ânormalityâ is unacceptable, however, and Europeans unfortunately no longer realise this.
It seems to me that it is our duty to react most indignantly.
I should like to say to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, and especially to our German friends, that we do not endorse this type of behaviour and that we are even less inclined to allow such practices to be passed over in silence.
As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I have decided to send a letter to my countryâs Minister for National Education calling for him to take appropriate action faced with these disgraceful acts.
Â Â  âOver the past year and a half, 15 electronics and related companies have ended their manufacturing operations in Europe.
Last October, a request for the European Commission to initiate anti-dumping measures against China, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand was submitted by the Czech company âTesla Ecimexâ and the Lithuanian company âEkranasâ, both of which manufacture cathode-ray tubes.
On 11 January this year, it was reported in the Official Journal of the European Union that an anti-dumping investigation had been launched.
However, âTesla Ecimexâ has already ceased its activities.
In April âEkranasâ stopped.
The companies are unable to compete with manufacturers in Southern Asia and Latin America, which receive state support through the implementation of policies favourable to business.
In Lithuania, 5Â 000 employees, including ones in ancillary companies, are losing their jobs.
Meanwhile, prospects for the electronics market and the sale of âEkranasâ are positive.
I urge the Commission to apply anti-dumping measures more actively and do what it can to aid European manufacturers and honest competition.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, insults and threats forced the Italian minister Letizia Moratti to abandon the parade celebrating 25Â April, which is Liberation Day in Italy.
Without any doubt, such aggression is a disgrace that must be denounced at a European level, not least because it tramples over those values of freedom that unite us in this Parliament and are incompatible with all those who try to intimidate anyone who thinks differently from them.
MrÂ President, I ask that, together, we issue a statement condemning the acts that have been described, specifically the burning of Israeli flags and the intolerant anti-Jewish sentiments.
We also need to express our solidarity with the Italian minister, who was accompanying her own father, a former Dachau deportee now confined to a wheelchair, in the parade.
These are serious incidents, from which we must strongly distance ourselves, particularly because they occurred during a parade that was supposed to celebrate the liberation of our country.
Â Â  Mr President, it has been over a year since King Gyanendra of Nepal seized absolute power.
On behalf of the SAARC Delegation, may I say how pleased we are that the King has now relented and yesterday agreed to the restoration of democracy.
However, this is only the first step towards establishing real peace and lasting democracy.
It is absolutely essential that the Maoists now become part of the democratic process and renounce violence.
I urge them, as the Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation, to listen and act on this message.
Over the last three weeks, the world has witnessed intense protests and suffering in Nepal and we are very relieved to see that peace is finally being restored to the streets of Kathmandu.
However, the EU and all the external partners involved in this process must be vigilant that this positive turn of events is a real watershed; this must not be another missed opportunity for democracy in Nepal.
We will have to watch developments very carefully.
I strongly urge the Commission, the Council and all external partners to take the necessary measures to prevent any possibility of this country relapsing into confusion and violence.
Â Â  Mr President, in November 2005 the European Commission presented the new regional policy initiatives Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica for the first time.
They are new aid instruments which are of particular importance for the new members of the European Union, and which are designed to facilitate funding absorption in the field of cohesion policy between 2007 and 2013.
The initiatives have met with a great deal of support from Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, which for their part are trying to promote the aforementioned new funding opportunities for regional initiatives.
Yet there is no real evidence of a large-scale and effective information campaign, for which the Commission is responsible.
Despite the fact that six months have already passed since the first presentation, it is impossible to find a brochure or even any kind of publication on the subject, let alone in the national languages.
Those directly concerned, or in other words local governments and businesses, receive only perfunctory information.
There is a lack of widely available training on the subject.
The programmes are supposed to be launched on 1Â January 2007, and so I am not sure what the Commission is waiting for.
It is high time that a professional and coordinated information campaign was started.
Â Â  Mr President, the day before yesterday was the 91st anniversary of the Armenian genocides.
This atrocious crime against humanity was committed against the Armenian people of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. It was centrally planned and administered by the Turkish government of the time and resulted in the demise of approximately 1.5 million men, women and children.
Most deaths occurred after horrific acts of torture, massacre and starvation.
In remembering those innocent victims of Ottoman barbarism we must renew our demand to the Turkish government of today to overcome its criminal obstinacy of total denial of the Armenian genocides and at least, even with so much delay, have the decency to say sorry to the Armenian people for the abominable holocaust inflicted on them.
Â Â  Mr President, at the last part-session I revealed the allegation that Romano Prodi had been an agent of some kind of the KGB.
Since then, Mr Prodi has become Prime Minister of Italy.
As such, he will be a member of the European Council and will have access to confidential information.
The KGB â now the FSB â is central for the institutionalised web of organised crime and corruption that dominates Russia.
It is not possible to resign from the KGB any more than it is from La Cosa Nostra.
Therefore, I repeat my request for this Parliament to conduct an investigation into these allegations.
Former senior members of the KGB are willing to testify in such an investigation under the right circumstances.
It is not acceptable that this situation is unresolved, given the importance of Russiaâs relations with the European Union.
Parliament should not be constrained by the fact that former senior Communist Party members from Eastern Europe currently sit on the Commission.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen â the Cold War has not yet ended, even in the 21st century.
I make this unequivocal statement in light of the ban on imports of Georgian and Moldovan wine imposed by the Russian Federation on 27 March.
By labelling Moldovan wine non-compliant with Russiaâs strict hygienic requirements, Russia is destroying the Moldovan economy.
This is a very serious matter.
According to the statistics, 85% of Moldovaâs wine is sold to the Russian market.
This is a coldly calculated act of retribution, because in recent years Moldova has sought closer integration with Europe and not Russia.
Ladies and gentlemen, to this day the Kremlin has been unable to provide the results of a single expert analysis proving that Moldovan wine is poisonous.
Therefore I propose that the European Food Safety Authority should perform an independent analysis of the quality of Moldovan wine.
I also suggest that we as members of the European parliament should hold a wine tasting during the plenary meeting in Brussels in order to determine for ourselves the quality of the wine of Moldova, a country which is seeking to join the European Union.
And I would encourage the businesspeople of the European Union to import Moldovan wine.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, Parliament recently voted in favour of resolutions condemning, for example, the manner in which the elections have been conducted in certain countries, such as Belarus, where it would appear that the outgoing candidate had far greater resources at his disposal than the opposition candidate.
Should we not, however, put our own house in order first?
I have just learned, for example, that in Belgium the National Front leader Daniel FÃ©ret has been declared ineligible to stand for ten years.
This is clearly a novel way for the parties in the establishment, with the judiciary at their beck and call, simply to remove an opponent from the reckoning.
I have no faith whatsoever in the independence of the Belgian judiciary.
I believe there are a number of rogue elements in the Belgian judiciary who cynically and scandalously violate human rights and, in particular, the right of the opposition to take part in elections.
This is taking place in a country that is corrupt, that does not uphold human rights and that should be shunned by Europe.
Let us put our own house in order.

Â Â  . Mr President, around 3Â p.m. this afternoon, I asked at roughly what time I would be given the floor, and I was told at around 5.45Â p.m.
It is now 7.45Â p.m.
I do not know who had the wisdom to compile this agenda, but I do not think it does Parliament any favours to hold a discharge debate about the European institutions at this time of day.
Moving on to the order of the day and cutting to the chase, I would advise the House to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial year 2004.
This may come as a surprise to you, because as everyone knows and as probably many people will say, the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about the Commissionâs conduct of policy for 11 years in a row.
So what is the use of granting discharge?
I have two arguments to put to you in favour.
Firstly, this Commission was in office for roughly one month in 2004 and secondly, this Commission started very ambitiously with a view to achieving a positive Statement of Assurance.
I will return to this in a moment.
Although it is unfortunate that MrÂ Wynn is absent, I should like to start with last yearâs resolution which he compiled and in which he introduced a number of fresh elements, the key one being that we felt that the highest political authority in every Member State should make a declaration at the beginning and end of each financial year to the effect that everything is in order in terms of political control.
It is unfortunate that this demand by Parliament has met with much resistance in the Member States.
There have been a number of developments since then.
An Interinstitutional Agreement has been concluded in which we have reached a compromise with the Council to the effect that it does not matter whether the political level is the highest or not.
We will also accept a declaration at any level that is suitable for this purpose in every Member State, provided that this declaration is made.
I would like to find out from the Commission what it intends to do with the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Another development has been the fact that some countries are now saying that they object to this.
I should like to find out what the Commissionâs response to this position is, because I get the impression that more and more countries are sharing this view.
I have to say in all of this is that it is never the Member States that are solely responsible; it is always the Commission that carries ultimate responsibility.
We should welcome the Commissionâs action plan with open arms.
It is a good thing that common standards are introduced, that integrated control is in place, that there is better cooperation with national courts of auditors, and suchlike. We would also appreciate it, in a different connection, if the Commission were to identify risk areas in the budget, namely what the high-risk and low-risk areas are.
It is therefore important that Member States should shoulder their political responsibility. This is something we also demand from the Commission itself.
Not only the Director-General should sign for the annual accounts; we think that the Commissioner who is responsible for a specific policy area should also be required to add their signature.
I will have to speed through my speech because the clock is ticking.
The President of the Court of Auditors once again published his annual report in November and made an interesting suggestion.
He put forward the idea of a peer review, which means that ex-presidents of national courts of auditors should examine whether or not the methodology and working practices of their counterpart at European level are correct.
We see this as important and applaud this suggestion; we are keen to play an active role in this with the European Court of Auditors.
There is yet more work to be done by the European Court of Auditors.
In the discharge report, a specific request was made for two reports, in the first instance about the management of the funds granted by the European Union to the UN bodies.
What is the added value for Europe if we give the money via the United Nations?
Secondly, what is financial control like over there?
We also want the non-governmental organisation to be the subject of an investigation by the Court of Auditors for a change.
What is the ânon-governmentalâ proportion in those non-governmental organisations?
How much money do they have at their own disposal?
Finally, the next few years will prove crucial to the Commission.
There must be a positive Statement of Assurance at some point.
I am very grateful to the members of the Secretariat of COCOBU for their enormous efficiency and skill, and, needless to say, also to my personal staff.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying that I was somewhat surprised that there seems to have been enough time for so many important things like one-minute speeches, while the question of whether European taxpayers' money is being spent properly is being dealt with around the evening suspension.
Secondly, I would have been happy if I could have reported today, like the rapporteur on the Commission's budget, that Parliament's authorities had done everything properly, and that we just had a few problems because many of the positions created in connection with the enlargement had not been filled, because we had the highest non-implementation rate, in other words transfers, ever seen in the history of Parliament's budget, and a few other issues.
In the last few days, however, a story has come to light that clearly needs to be brought up here because of its peculiarities.
I do think it is wise that we are not going to discharge Parliament's budget at the present.
However, I would also make it quite clear that I find it regrettable that the services of Parliament have not authorised a procedure that would have made it possible to explain why we are not discharging it.
I think that what this Parliament's Legal Service delivered this afternoon in the Committee on Budgetary Control, against the interests of the Members â and, I might add, Mr Vice-President, against the interests of the Bureau â was unacceptable.
It is an unacceptable situation, and that alone requires special consideration.
There is something else that is equally unacceptable.
We need to look into whether the city of Strasbourg, in providing a property on which a Dutch pension fund has constructed a building, has concluded a rental agreement with us for a sum significantly different from the sum that it pays to the pension fund â and not to the detriment of Strasbourg, but to its benefit.
To be absolutely clear, this is not about the issue of having the seat of Parliament in Strasbourg â that is laid down in the Treaties â but about whether it is really the purpose of such a sub-letting situation that, in the rent we are paying to the city of Strasbourg, we are giving a direct subsidy â for that is exactly what it would be â to the city's budget.
Given that this agreement was not just signed yesterday but, if the information I currently have is correct, has been in place since 1980, we also need to look into the issue of who in this House already knew about the situation in the past and who failed to protect the interests of European tax-payers in this connection by concluding the rental agreement directly with the pension fund.
If this had been done, we would have been able to rent the building more cheaply.
If, therefore, anyone in this House knew about this and did not act in the interests of European tax-payers, that is worthy of particular scrutiny.
That is exactly what we are going to do together.
Therefore, I can really only request â it is just a request at the moment, though the Rules of Procedure provide other options for the later procedure â that the administration provide all the information it has at its disposal.
I can also only request the city of Strasbourg to provide all the information it has and to cooperate very closely with Parliament on this matter.
If it does not do so, and if the debate on this is used only as a pretext for arguing that the European Parliament is looking for a good opportunity to leave Strasbourg for good, then the city of Strasbourg itself will have contributed to an event that it did not want to occur.
That is really where my call is coming from â I read the city of Strasbourg's press release from this afternoon, and, from what I understood of it with my rudimentary French, this is not the kind of cooperation I have in mind.
The city of Strasbourg is already profiting from the European Parliament without needing such payments.
That is why I am asking them to cooperate with us to clear up the matter: it is the only way that we will be able to act in the interests of tax-payers, and we will then be able to draw the correct conclusions I therefore regret â although I should like to thank everyone who worked with me in preparing the report, the services, the Committee Secretariat and my fellow Members â that I have to recommend that you vote against the report tomorrow and do not give discharge in respect of the budget, so that we can look seriously into all the matters I have mentioned.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Unionâs political legitimacy is limited and dwindling.
This lack of confidence in the EU is, unfortunately, well deserved.
The EU does not demonstrate a convincing resolve to clamp down on irregularities, fraud and the abuse of power in its institutions.
In practice, there is little readiness to demand accountability.
The instinct is to cover things up.
Whistle-blowers lose their jobs instead of receiving praise.
Cheating and scandals are not investigated, and no legal proceedings are brought in connection with those that are.
Discharge is granted in spite of the fact that we do not know if everything has proceeded correctly.
A majority of this Chamber appears to want to conceal unpleasant truths about the European Union from people so that the EU does not become still more unpopular.
That is a deeply undemocratic attitude.
Our task is to elicit the truth and to demand accountability on our citizensâ behalf, not to conceal the truth from them.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, it was my job to work on the issue of granting discharge to âOther Institutionsâ, of which there are seven in total.
I have found no reason for bringing the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor into question.
Four of the remaining five institutions are open to criticism, but not of so serious a character that there is reason for questioning whether discharge should be granted.
The Council, the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the European Economic and Social Committee are in this position.
Where the Committee of the Regions is concerned, however, I find that further investigations are required before we can take a decision on the issue of granting discharge.
In the course of 2004, the European Economic and Social Committee had problems involving irregularities in relation to the reimbursement of membersâ travelling expenses.
We hope that this problem is now in the past.
There have been problems with the BelliardÂ I andÂ II buildings, and I expect a full account of these in the Court of Auditorsâ forthcoming report.
Where the Council is concerned, many of the risks are to be found, as usual, in administrative activities relating to the building projects in which the Council is involved.
I want to take this opportunity to emphasise the advantages of renting buildings instead of engaging in such huge building projects ourselves.
It would also be helpful if the Council were to come up with clearer definitions of, respectively, administrative and operational expenses.
The European Court of Justiceâs internal audits were far from satisfactory during 2004.
Its internal auditor also acted as the head of the ex-ante verification unit, which is quite simply unacceptable.
Moreover, the internal auditor has not completed any of his investigations since he was appointed in 2003.
Parliament expects to see energetic measures and strong improvements in this area.
The European Court of Justiceâs massive building projects at present under way cannot be anything other than a cause of disquiet.
It is therefore essential that a complete and detailed progress report on this project be made to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The fact that the Court does not at present require judges to declare their financial interests is unacceptable.
Irrespective of whether or not there is at present any legal requirement for them to do so, the Court must prepare its own binding rules in this area.
Regarding the use of official cars, Parliament again calls on the Court not to allow these to be used for private purposes.
Where the Court of Auditors is concerned, the fact that a handful of large Luxembourg-based accounting firms are in a dominant position when it comes to scrutinising the Courtâs accounts is worrying, although Parliament appreciates that it is difficult for the Court to avoid this situation.
It is therefore extremely important for there to be an open, fair and comprehensible tendering procedure.
The Court of Auditors has problems with its organisational structure, which is in need of reform.
This is something that needs to be got to grips with in the ongoing evaluation preparatory to overhauling the organisation of the Court, preferably in accordance with the proposal for reform devised by the British House of Lords.
Again, Parliament should call on the Court of Auditors not to permit the use of official cars for private purposes.
I turn now to our black sheep, namely the Committee of the Regions which, of the âOther Institutionsâ examined, has attracted the most criticism from the Court of Auditors.
During 2004, the internal audit was in practice carried out by a single internal auditor, and a temporary one at that.
An internal auditor dependent on a constantly renewable employment contract must find it very difficult to maintain his or her independence from the management of the organisation concerned.
It is indefensible that the Committee of the Regions should not, then, have had a proper internal audit carried out during 2004, in spite of Parliamentâs robust criticism of that institution in relation to 2003.
We have still not received any explanation of the fact that the internal auditor employed up until May 2004 was in no position to produce any auditorâs reports.
There continues an OLAF investigation into the Committee of the Regions in connection with its reimbursement of membersâ expenses, to which a correction coefficient was applied.
Payments for which there was no underlying proof of entitlement had been granted.
It seems obvious that this should have been discovered by the Committee of the Regions no later than in the course of 2004 and that these payments should then have been stopped.
In spite of this, the Committeeâs managers state that there is no question of there having been any cases of fraud.
In connection with this matter, no clear information has been given, either, of measures having been taken to claim back incorrect payments.
The situation is exacerbated by the fact that these payments were to people in key positions within the administration.
In recent years, the Committee of the Regions has been partly characterised by irregularities of various kinds, showing that the promised culture change within the organisation has not taken place.
It now looks as if OLAF will produce its final report in the middle of May.
It would be irresponsible to grant discharge before we know the results of this investigation.
The reorganisation of the Committee of the Regions has in several cases meant that people involved in suspected irregularities have been promoted, which is also irregular.
The Court of Auditors is continuing with its investigation in connection with the BelliardÂ I and II buildings.
The Montoyer project, too, should be examined.
No explanation has been given to date as to why the person formerly responsible for infrastructure appears to have withdrawn his statement as authorising officer by subdelegation for the financial year 2004.
It needs also to be explained to us why I as rapporteur was not informed of this, and it needs to be made clear to us how the date of theoretical acceptance was established.
Should the damages claimed from the construction company have perhaps been higher?
What is more, the Committee of the Regionsâ internal auditor was refused access to the documents he had requested in this connection.
There are strong reasons also for awaiting the outcome of the Court of Auditorsâ ongoing investigation into the matter before we grant discharge.
I also wish to take this opportunity to inform the Chamber of the odd way in which the Committee of the Regions has been treated by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I had received information from a variety of sources indicating that there was much more to be criticised in the Committee of the Regionsâ area of financial responsibility than the Committee itself had provided information about.
I therefore obtained the Committee on Budgetary Controlâs agreement to our questioning OLAFâs investigators and the Committee of the Regionsâ internal auditors for 2004 behind closed doors.
The meeting was scheduled for the morning of Tuesday, 21Â March 2006.
The Committee on Budgetary Control met at 3Â p.m. on the day before this and began by approving the agenda, whereupon a majority suddenly demanded that the questioning scheduled for the following morning should be cancelled.
A majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control refused, then, to study information that I, as rapporteur, considered to be of vital importance in adopting a position on the discharge issue.
I did not find out why.
I maintain that if the EUâs financial interests are to be protected, the committee needs to take on board all the relevant information on such issues.
The majority of the Committee refused to study the information and then voted in favour of our proposing to Parliament that discharge be granted right now, in spite of the fact that I as rapporteur maintain that we should await the outcome of ongoing investigations by OLAF and the Court of Auditors.
I understand that the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have now had the opportunity to study documents indicating various irregularities.
If Parliament still grants discharge, it will not then be possible subsequently to plead ignorance.
Comparison might be made with what is now happening regarding the granting of discharge to the President in the light of the rents in Strasbourg.
On this subject, Parliament is coming to the conclusion that new information has come to light that must be studied before a decision on discharge is taken.
There is an exact parallel with the situation regarding the Committee of the Regions.
The only difference is that the Strasbourg issue has found its way into the media.
Do newspaper articles have to appear before there is a response from Members of the European Parliament?
Should it not be obvious that Members will decide to vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions until such time as all the uncertainties have been clarified?
I therefore appeal to all Members carefully to consider what they are voting on tomorrow.
Because we have not had all the uncertainties clarified, I would call on you to vote against granting discharge for the Committee of the Regionsâ implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004.
If there is a vote on the report, I would call on you to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by MrÂ Staes and myself with a view to obtaining the facts of the case.
That is what we must do if we take seriously the demand for accountability, which is at the heart of the democratic process.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, as rapporteur on the discharge for the European Development Funds, I wish to start by saying that these funds are an important and valuable tool for promoting solidarity, prosperity in the world, peace, the principles of justice and respect for human rights.
The Committee on Budgetary Control examines the implementation of these budgets of these funds and formulates its opinion on optimum administration with efficiency and transparency.
As far as the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth Funds for the financial year 2004 are concerned, taking account of the report by the Court of Auditors and our exchange of views with the Commission and the Commissioner himself, MrÂ LouisÂ Michel, we propose discharge to the Commission.
We also propose approval of the closing of the accounts of these funds for 2004.
The motion for a resolution proposed by our committee to plenary emphasises the importance of the European Development Funds to the European Union's contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with the primary objective of eradicating poverty.
We express our concern at the fact that only EUR 12Â million (0.4% of the budget) is earmarked for basic education and EUR 74 million (just 2.7%) for basic health, despite the recommendations made by the European Parliament in last year's resolution.
It is very important for us to promote the principles of democratisation, good governance and equal opportunities through the European Development Funds in order to achieve a double objective: firstly, the sustainable development of countries which benefit and, secondly, the more effective take-up of resources; this is incumbent upon the European Parliament as the House of elected representatives of European citizens.
These objectives concern both the European institutions and decentralised services in ACP countries which benefit from the funds and the national administration authorities and the parliaments of these countries.
Another matter we refer to is that, as regards the funds managed by the European Investment Bank, which are not audited by the Court of Auditors or controlled by the European Parliament within the framework of the discharge procedure, we consider that it would enhance transparency and efficiency if information were provided and included in the reports of the European Investment Bank on the European Development Funds.
We also consider that the budgetisation of these funds would remove many of the complications and the management cost, and the implementation of successive funds will help to speed up disbursement and eliminate the relevant democratic deficit.
We are also concerned about the sum which remains for clearance. It must be reduced by promoting flexible actions and with faster results.
Finally, we wish to enhance the visibility of the European Union's external action.
European citizens are proud of this policy of solidarity and citizens of the developing world covet and need it.
It is time for our political objectives and effective methods to be combined with better communication and visibility both as regards our actions as independent actions and within the framework of international organisations, at the UN, the World Bank and other bodies.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the discharges for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has the important task of granting discharge for the financial year 2004 to 14 European agencies that are fully, partially or indirectly subsidised by the European Union.
I shall not dwell here on the specific details or the problems that were found in each individual agency; I shall confine myself to mentioning those items that have emerged as the main points for a joint debate.
I take this opportunity to highlight what I have just said, which is that discharge is given to just 14 out of the 27 agencies that exist.
Indeed, I wonder how many of you are actually up to date with how many such bodies there are and what their real functions are: not many of you, ladies and gentlemen, and I am sure that very few European citizens have any clear ideas on the subject.
It might therefore be worth developing information campaigns for them about the agencies and their functions.
It is no coincidence that, after the debate on my report in committee, a study was commissioned â it is still under way â to analyse and clarify the situations of the European agencies.
The study is revealing what has already emerged from the report, namely a lack of harmonisation among the various agencies, and the likelihood of poor transparency associated with difficulties in Parliamentâs control over them.
To that end, I have called on the Council in my report to start talks as soon as possible to conclude the draft interinstitutional agreement, which the Commission put forward at Parliamentâs request.
In the discharge report on the agencies for 2003, Parliament actually called for this institutional agreement to be set up in order to place all the agencies within a common regulatory framework.
With regard to Parliamentâs powers to grant discharge, I have tried to underline the unfairness of the current situation and would recall that, under Article 185 of the Financial Regulation, Parliament gives discharge for the implementation of the budgets of the bodies set up by the Communities that have legal personality and actually receive grants charged to the budget.
In reality, it is important to note that not all of these bodies are fully or even partially funded via grants charged to the budget.
The conclusion may therefore be drawn that the discharge decision covers both the budget and the non-budget funding of these bodies.
The situation is clearly unacceptable, and it implies that some of the bodies set up by the Union are accountable for the way they spend income received from sources other than the budget, whilst others, which do not receive a subsidy from the budget, are not.
An amendment to the Financial Regulation that was proposed by me and adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control has introduced this very principle.
If the Regulation thus amended is adopted, Parliament will see its powers of control greatly expanded in the coming years, to the benefit of the principles of transparency and democracy.
The analyses carried out by the Court of Auditors were of great help in drawing up the reports.
They revealed a few irregularities of very little significance, and I therefore endorse the decision of the Court of Auditors, which proposes granting discharge to the directors of all 14 agencies analysed.
I am sorry to say, however, that the analysis that the Court was asked to provide is purely technical in nature, and there has been no control of the ways in which the allocated budget has been spent during the current year.
I have stressed this point in the working document accompanying the reports, where I propose that in subsequent years the Court of Auditors should supplement the current assessment with an evaluation of service quality, competences and activities: in other words how efficiently the individual agencies spend their budgets.
Many of the issues that have come up are recurrent, and we can therefore talk of a cross-cutting analysis of issues that have emerged across the various agencies.
One such issue concerns the Financial Regulation, which was devised for the agencies, while the subsequent financial regulations specific to each agency were designed to adhere as closely as possible to the general Financial Regulation created by the Commission.
Although this criterion is generally valid, it is sometimes not suited to the smallest agencies, for which appropriate reforms will be needed.
That is one of the main objections made by the Court of Auditors.
Personnel selection problems are also common to several agencies, since the agencies certainly require greater assistance than larger institutions.
I therefore think it is important that the Commission should make the services of EPSO, the Commissionâs Directorate-General for Personnel Selection, available to them, as well as supplying other cross-cutting services such as training and the legal service.
Another problem concerns internal audits, which for some agencies are an excessive burden.
I therefore believe the Commission should table a report on the current situation, describing both each agencyâs current capacity for performing an internal audit and the internal audit services that the Commission can make available to the smallest agencies.
Lastly, I shall focus on an issue that has generated heated debate and has marked a divergence in thinking between Parliament and the Commission.
The issue concerns the European Agency for Reconstruction, which was set up in 2000 to provide assistance for reconstruction, development and stability in the regions of Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia through the CARDS programme.
Since the programme has come to an end, the Commission has decided to close the Agency by the end of 2008.
In view of the excellent work it has done in recent years, and in order to prevent the precious experience built up over many years of activity from being lost, I have in my report proposed extending its mandate so as to be able to use the agency to provide reconstruction assistance wherever required, for example in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or even the countries recently affected by the tsunami.
This would be in addition to the immediate humanitarian assistance provided by ECHO, the Commissionâs department set up to help in the event of natural disasters or armed conflict in regions outside the EU.
Well, then, I think that is more or less what there was to say about the report, which I hope will be adopted during the next sitting.
Â Â  âMr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Today we are looking at a glass which is certainly only half full, but is gradually filling up.
This year, in addition to the positive endorsement of the European Unionâs budget accounting, revenues, appropriations, administrative expenditures and the European Development Fund, the European Court of Auditors is quite satisfied with the supervision of agricultural expenditures and the aid granted to candidate states.
The expenditures that the Court of Auditors approved of represent nearly one third of the European Unionâs budget.
I am pleased that this progress is also reflected in Parliamentâs reports, and that it has been proposed that Parliament should approve the Commissionâs implementation of the budget.
Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to rapporteurs MrÂ JanÂ Mulder, MrsÂ RodiÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (who examined the European Development Fund) and MrÂ SzabolcsÂ Fazakas, Chairman of Parliamentâs Committee on Budgetary Control, who have skilfully guided the entire process.
Parliament has drawn up an extensive list of recommendations for improvements.
The Commission intends to observe most of these, and to report on this as required.
We all know that the glass is not yet full, but Parliament supports the plan approved by the Commission in June 2005 to devise an integrated internal control framework, as well as the action plan approved by the Commission in January 2006.
Now that we know what is missing, let me concentrate on the missing part.
Firstly, I applaud Parliament for the text of the inter-institutional agreement, which arose as a result of negotiations held with the Council and for the first time mentions issues of budget control and endorsement.
We all know that the implementation of this political agreement will require continued work, and the Commission certainly intends to do its utmost in the achievement of that objective.
We also seek to improve the expression of accountability vis-Ã -vis the European Parliament and the European taxpayer.
We plan to devote a considerable amount of attention to three measures.
Firstly, we will strengthen the procedure for the preparation of Annual Activity Reports and improve its consistency across General Directorates.
We will also make amendments to the Synthesis Report, although not as elaborately as the European Parliament has recommended.
Secondly, we will enhance transparency in the use of EU funds.
Next week the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on the European Transparency Initiative.
As part of the paper, the Commission will propose the introduction of an obligation on Member States to publish the list of beneficiaries of EU funds under shared management.
To that end, the Commission will establish a centralised web portal.
Thirdly, we will continue to increase the participation of national auditing institutions.
Last week, the Commission sent each of these national audit institutions detailed lists of all of the payments made to their respective Member States in 2005, also inviting them to share the results of their audits with the Commission and the Court of Auditors.
This is an initial stage of the implementation of our Action Plan, and I know that several national auditing institutions are prepared to verify the sound use of EU funds in their countries.
Thus the first steps have been taken in this direction, and I intend to raise this matter at the meeting of the coordinating committee of the European and national audit courts, to be held in Poland at the end of this year.
Honourable Members, when I appeared before you last year I said that âmobilising and motivating the Member States will not be easy, and the Commission continues to need your supportâ.
I have enjoyed that support in the past year, and I wish to confirm that we, for our part, will do our utmost.
As a first step, we plan to follow the recommendations you will adopt today.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . âHaving evaluated the use of the general budget for the financial year 2004, the Committee on Development holds the opinion that despite the European Commission's efforts, there remain areas where budget use could be improved.
The Committee on Development supports the opinion of the European Court of Auditors that objective, useful and clear indicators must be determined, which would enable the assessment of aid results, and it is hoped that such indicators will be prepared and implemented in the period 2007-2013.
The Committee on Development views as positive the fact that a means of budgeting aid sectors has been found, which is a more effective alternative than general funding from the budget.
However, based on the experience of the latest enlargement, the Committee on Development urges the Commission to ensure that development policy administrative management capacities in Bulgaria and Romania are reinforced before they join the EU.
Upon assessment of the implementation of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds for 2004, it must be stressed that there is also room for improvement here.
The same as previously, the donor aid is being insufficiently coordinated, a results method still has to be prepared to evaluate Community members' cooperation, without which it is impossible to proceed to the desired âresults based approachâ, as we strive to implement the Millenium Development Goals.
Another point â the necessity for the Commission to have clearer proof of states' eligibility to receive aid, to strengthen cooperation with local representatives and to make use of indicators which encourage the effective use of public finance.
On the subject of development aid, there is a danger that up to 700 million euros will not be used by the end of 2007.
At the same time, the Tenth European Development Fund is being increased and Member States are obliged to increase development aid.
Therefore, just like in previous years, the Commission must put more effort into managing funds for the implementation of development policy.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I find myself in rather an uneasy situation in that I agree with most of what the rapporteurs said on the general thrust of the report and whether or not a discharge should be granted with our vote tomorrow.
I support the PSE Group line in this regard.
Nevertheless, I am here as draftsman of the opinion of the IMCO Committee, and from that point of view I must congratulate the way in which the DGs which we examined â Sanco, Taxud and Markt â behaved on the issues which were pointed out.
One has to point out the fact that the court itself did not single out any observations on the issues regarding implementation on consumer protection and on internal market and customs policy.
Nevertheless, the Committee calls for a more transparent but flexible approach to the way grants are given and EU funds administered.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the draftsman for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I should like to stress that the European Court of Auditors already has a tradition of criticism of the trans-European networks.
For example, in its latest report on transparency, it stated that 'complex annual administrative procedures for evaluating and selecting TEN-T projects have been established by the Commission and these have not always led to relevant information being available for the evaluation'.
In addition, the Court of Auditors recommends that 'the Commission should also develop an explicit methodology for evaluating proposals submitted under TEN-T and publish it in a manual'.
This is overdue.
The Court of Auditors also criticised the coordination, stating that 'the coordination of the various sources of Community funding for transport infrastructure projects by the various Directorates-General does not allow the Commission to detect all cases of over- or double funding'.
In view of the tight budgetary situation, that is unacceptable.
In order to eliminate this problem, the Court of Auditors even makes some specific proposals: 'the Commission should establish appropriate legal bases, procedures and tools in order to improve the coordination of transport infrastructure funding and to identify potential cases of over- or double funding. This should be done, where necessary, in cooperation with the Member States'.
To that I would add that responsible persons must be appointed at all levels, and consequences must be drawn.
There are also deficits with regard to road safety and passengersâ rights.
In the case of road safety, only 60% of payment appropriations were used, and only 11% of the payment appropriations were spent on protecting passengersâ rights.
That, too, must change in future.
I should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the Court of Auditors.
I call on the Commission to rectify these problems and accept the proposals, so that the annual tradition of criticism from the Court of Auditors can be broken next year.
As EMSA states in the annexes, the maritime and aviation safety agencies should in future make better use of their available resources, although the agencies were still new and had certain teething problems in 2004.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should first like to express my appreciation for the work done by the different rapporteurs and, in particular, by MrÂ Mulder for the general budget and MrÂ Guidoni for the agencies.
These are the two reports that directly address the issues that fall under the competence of our Committee.
Firstly, as regards the general budget of the EU, I welcome the fact that MrÂ Mulder took on board in his report two crucial remarks in my opinion that were adopted by our Committee.
The first of these remarks concerns the implementation rate of the budget in the âfreedom, security and justiceâ area, with particular regard to payments.
Although there was an improvement on 2003, when the rate was as low as 68%, the implementation rate of payments for 2004 remained inadequate at 83% and is clearly below the average rate of budget implementation.
This led to a considerable increase in the amount outstanding (RAL) â from EURÂ 160 million to EURÂ 238 million.
Obviously, the Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security must redouble its efforts to improve budget implementation.
This will take on even greater importance in the context of the new financial perspective 2007-2013, assuming it is adopted soon by Parliament, as I hope it will be.
Over the next seven years, the budgetary resources earmarked for the âfreedom, security and justiceâ area will be substantially increased, 163% being the biggest increase of any of the categories or sub-categories of the Union's general budget.
The management of the Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security must be strengthened if it is to do justice to the political priority thus attached to the task of creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.
The second remark taken on board by the general rapporteur relates to the concerns expressed by the Court of Auditors about the way in which a number of Member States have made use of the European Fund for Refugees and, in particular, about the shortcomings of the national control systems in place.
In this sector, as in many other shared management sectors, the Commission is obviously suffering more from the weakness of the Member States than from its own shortcomings.
I welcome the fact that our general rapporteur opted to make this problem a key element of his report. The delegation from Parliament at the trialogue to renew the interinstitutional agreement was right to push for more specific commitments from the Council and the Member States as regards the monitoring of funds subject to shared management.
Unfortunately, we are aware that the results have not matched our expectations.
I should like to say a few words about the agencies, of which there are many in the âfreedom, security and justiceâ area.
If one leaves out Europol â and I should like to take this opportunity, as I do every opportunity, to remind the Chamber of our call to transform this from a merely intergovernmental body, as it is at present, into a Community agency, at the earliest opportunity â if one leaves out Europol, there are no less than four agencies operating in the âfreedom, security and justiceâ area, and that does not include the European Police College (CEPOL).
These four agencies are the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the European Agency for the Management of the External Borders and Eurojust.
Our rapporteur for the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the agencies, MrÂ Guidoni, is certainly aware that the agencies â and he said this a moment ago â are not always well received by some Members and the general public.
He wrote in his report, and I quote: âthe Communityâs agencies do not always have a good image or receive a good pressâ.
He went on to say, and I support him in this regard, that some of them do not deserve this negative image and that it would be appropriate to make EU citizens aware of the fact by using the appropriate channels as often as is necessary to justify the existence of these agencies and to draw attention to their results.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, let me state very clearly that, in my view, and setting aside some justified criticisms of the Vienna agency, the agencies that fall within our sector are well managed. Their work is of high quality, and I do not see what other structures could do a better job of performing the specific tasks accorded to the existing agencies.
This is true, for example, of the Frontex agency for the control of external borders and Eurojust for the improvement of judicial cooperation.
I also wish to take this opportunity to announce â although I am jumping the gun, ahead of another debate â that I shall be tabling proposals to strengthen the agencies in question within the framework of the 2007 budget.
Â Â  . Mr President, we could not have debated the budgetary discharge report at a better time than today.
The recent echoes we have heard relating to the purchase of the two different office buildings in Strasbourg show that more information on the sub-letting of these buildings by the City of Strasbourg is definitely needed.
It appears that the European Parliament might have been considerably overcharged by the City of Strasbourg, which has rented the buildings from a property fund.
Yearly, this overcharging might have yielded EURÂ 2.7Â million. This might have been going on for 25Â years.
I think it is scandalous: not only the subject matter, but the fact that this information has been hidden from us in Parliament until now.
The European Parliament should conduct a thorough inquiry to find out as soon as possible if the allegations of overcharging by the City of Strasbourg are true.
If this turns out to be the case, the European Parliament should immediately consider taking appropriate legal action against the City of Strasbourg.
Moreover, I have been surprised to hear that the Mayor of Strasbourg has refused to answer the questions of the Vice-President of this House on this matter.
I wonder how the communication policy of the City of Strasbourg â usually so prompt, cautious and even pampering towards MEPs â changed so suddenly.
On behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to say that, in general, the budget discharge reports do not give enough relevant information as to how the budget has succeeded in promoting equal opportunities for women in the enlarged Union, nor do they provide the possibility of assessing the impact of the budget from a gender perspective, despite the request of this House on gender budgeting.
In the future, relevant information on gender mainstreaming policies should be delivered by the Commission and this information should be included in the budget discharge reports.
We have demanded it so many times; I think it is time for the Commission to do this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have three points.
My first point is that the timing of this debate is a disgrace: it was supposed to start at 6 p.m. and it is now 9.30 p.m.
It is going to go on all evening.
It is one of the most important issues that we have.
Are we trying to hide something from the public?
My second point is that I am the shadow rapporteur on the Mulder report on discharge for the Commission.
I should like to congratulate my colleague and friend, MrÂ Mulder, on an excellent report and I would like to point out that 80% of money misuse is still happening in the Member States.
The Commission is doing an excellent job.
It is not more control we need, but better control.
My third and final point concerns discharge for the European Parliament.
I have four points on that.
Firstly, it is very important that at this stage we stick to the facts.
We should start researching to see what actually happened.
It is very easy for all of us to wonder whether Strasbourg is the right seat or not.
I do not think that is the issue right now.
Let us look at what really happened.
Secondly, there are two issues at stake here: we need to look at what the administration of the European Parliament has done in the past 25 years, and we need to look at what the city of Strasbourg has done.
It certainly looks as if it has violated the spirit of the agreement we have with the city itself.
Thirdly, we need more information.
I agree with Mr Ferber, the rapporteur on this issue, who said recently that the press release from Strasbourg â to which Mrs Kauppi referred â is .
They need to give a lot more information or they need to change their whole public relations department.
It gives us no information about what actually happened.
Finally, we should vote against discharge for the European Parliament and begin the investigation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should also like to begin by endorsing what MrÂ Stubb said.
It is scandalous that we should be debating such an important matter as the discharge procedure at such a late hour after having had one-minute speeches on subjects such as whether MrÂ Prodi was a KGB agent.
I have to say â with a touch of black humour that nonetheless contains a grain of truth â that, on this particular occasion, it is perhaps just as well that people outside our building are not interested in what we are doing, as we should be a laughing stock, I believe, if anyone could actually see to what we were giving priority on the agenda in preference to this extremely important matter.
I wish to thank MrÂ Mulder, who has done an outstanding job on his report.
I think that the whole process has been helpful and constructive.
Only in that way is it possible to achieve as impressive a result as he has achieved, and one that will obtain a large majority in Parliament.
The discharge procedure is an extremely important one.
I also wish to endorse his recommendation that we naturally grant the Commission discharge.
Obviously, it must be accompanied by a number of observations because, this year too, the basic issue of our dissatisfaction arises.
Unfortunately, not enough has been done.
There are unfortunately too many areas in which we still cannot give satisfactory assurances that European taxpayersâ money is being properly administered.
That being said, there are nonetheless grounds for optimism.
There are a number of areas in which progress is being made.
Take, for example, the Integrated Administrative Control System within the agricultural sphere, in which a procedure has been set in motion that has in actual fact proved to be effective and that, into the bargain, has for the first time caused the Court of Auditors to write directly in its report that there has been significant progress in this area.
Praise is obviously in order.
There is also reason for pointing out in this connection that, under this procedure and specifically with regard to our demand for an annual statement of assurance from the individual Member States, an agreement along the lines we wanted has, in relation to the financial perspective, now been reached between the various institutions.
That is something else about which we should, of course, be pleased.
Finally, I want to say a few words about what has been closest to my own heart in this process, namely compliance with our demand for more transparency and openness.
What is at issue here are the Commissionâs working parties and the many committees that come under the umbrella of the Commission.
We are concerned too with the individual countries in relation to the money paid out.
On this point, I am very pleased with the assurances I see the Commissioners as having given today.
Â Â  , . â Today, I will perhaps attempt to answer MrÂ Stubb and MrÂ JÃžrgensen who asked why we are discussing this question so late and who we want to hide from â society or ourselves.
I would like to remind you that last year, also in April, we voted on the approval of the European Parliament Budget for 2003, where I was the principal rapporteur.
And I proposed that the European Parliament should abandon its work in Strasbourg.
Today, I am the shadow rapporteur and I would like to remind you, that last year Members of the European Parliament decided to retain three work places and to continue sessions in Strasbourg.
Each year, such work or its organisation costs the Community's citizens EUR 200 million.
Mr President, do we have the right to be surprised then that Strasbourg city authority is trying to obtain an unrealistically high price for buildings?
I do not think so because we encouraged it to take such actions ourselves.
The retention of the European Parliament Headquarters in Strasbourg is condemned to continue losing money until we give it up.
It is nothing new that there are economic subjects or persons, who commit fraud or even become corrupt.
But often they are encouraged to behave in this way by a monopoly situation, illogical laws or political decisions.
We ourselves, my fellow Members of Parliament, decided to use the buildings in Strasbourg knowing that they will cost an unjustifiably huge amount of money and will mean losses for the city and its people, as we only use those buildings for a few days a month.
This is elementary economic logic.
Many times it has been calculated and argued that if another institution were to move into the European Parliament buildings, working all year long, then this would be of more benefit to the city economically and financially.
Therefore, we must accept that we all know this, but for some reason we do not want to change the situation.
I believe that the people of Strasbourg, like all the other citizens of the Community, have become the hostages of incorrect decisions we have made ourselves.
I support the proposal to postpone the approval of the European Parliament budget until we have examined how many more losses the people of Europe have experienced.
It is very important to ascertain whether there has been corruption or violations of laws and agreements, but it is far more important, honourable Members of Parliament, to finally make the decision to give up this unjustifiable, shameful waste of European people's money.
We have to work effectively in one place and we must use money where it is most needed.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have three points to make.
First of all, I should like to draw your attention to the amendments I have tabled in connection with the Mulder and Guidoni reports on the agency for reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia.
When we visited Kosovo with an delegation in February, we saw for ourselves the outstanding work that the reconstruction agency had carried out, and we should not simply disregard its expertise.
Hence the request, certainly at this crucial juncture when Kosovo is likely to gain independence this year, not to phase out this agency straight away, but to do it gradually and apply the expertise to other conflict areas in the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan.
Secondly, with regard to Parliamentâs discharge, I should like to make a point of underlining MrÂ Ferberâs excellent input.
He has produced a sterling report.
His draft report was even better than the report that was ultimately voted on by COCOBU, but it has to be said that there are new revelations which need investigating.
This means that ultimately, we will need to vote against his report and against the granting of discharge.
I would like to make it absolutely clear that this does not detract from MrÂ Ferberâs work or from COCOBUâs observations, but is a clearly precautionary measure in order to give ourselves six months to find out what exactly happened and hopefully, we, along with the city of Strasbourg, the French Government, the administration of this House, and with everyone involved, will be able to draw the conclusions in complete transparency.
My third point concerns the Committee of the Regions.
I regret the fact that we did not, prior to the vote in committee, have a hearing with two auditors who would have attended at MrÂ Lundgrenâs request and who would have put to us any irregularities and possible fraud.
Instead, there is now in Parliamentâs secret chamber a chunky, confidential document that suggests that something may be amiss.
This too requires thorough investigation, and so I would ask not only my colleagues, but also this House as a whole, to vote against the Committee of the Regionsâ discharge.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to continue the discussion regarding Parliamentâs discharge.
Parliamentâs budget for 2004 was EUR 1Â 231 million.
If Parliament had just one language and just one place of business, 60% of this expenditure would be saved.
Holding Parliamentâs plenary part-sessions in Strasbourg costs more than EUR 200 million.
Of that, some EUR 10Â million is spent on rent for the Salvador de Madariaga and Winston Churchill buildings.
Parliament receives 20% of all EU administrative expenditure for its own use.
That is such a lot of money that not all of it can be easily spent.
At the end of last year, there was an EUR 85 million surplus of cash remaining in Parliamentâs budget, a surplus for which a use had to be quickly thought up.
The Bureau finally proposed the purchase of the Madariaga and Churchill buildings.
These were owned by SCI-Erasme, a Dutch pension fund, or its subsidiary.
Parliament, however, paid rent to the city of Strasbourg.
During the purchase negotiations, it emerged that for a quarter of a century the city had been charging Parliament more than it paid to Erasme.
The city of Strasbourg was therefore cashing in on the fact that Parliament had its premises in the city.
The city has refused to say how much extra money was generated in this way.
This situation is intolerable.
Our group supports a full and thorough investigation into this.
With that purpose in mind, we are prepared to reject MrÂ Ferberâs report and refer it back to the Committee for further deliberation.
Because of the new areas of confusion that have emerged, we ought to do the same with regard to the report on discharge for the Committee of the Regions drafted by MrÂ Lundgren.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I want to begin by thanking the officials who have helped me with the work on granting discharge.
Their efforts have been admirable and quite extraordinarily extensive.
As has been said, the work has, moreover, been something of an uphill struggle.
Information has now come to light indicating that Strasbourg wrongly charged Parliament rent for a number of years.
I wish to emphasise that, before discharge can be granted, Strasbourg must give Parliament access to all the documents concerning the relevant buildings.
If it does not, Parliament must take the matter to OLAF.
What is more, Parliament must not of course sign any contract of sale until this issue has been clarified.
If the EU institutions had had a clear willingness to investigate and to demand accountability and if the Committee on Budgetary Control had carried out its task properly and acted as the scrutinising body it is supposed to be, these things need not have happened.
There must be a clear willingness thoroughly to investigate irregularities whenever they occur, and not just when the media has got wind of them.
I also wish to add that, in its treatment of MrÂ Ferberâs report, the Committee on Budgetary Control airbrushed out the reportâs criticisms of MEPsâ voluntary pensions system.
It is a system with no legal basis and no provisions regarding what should be done about deficits in the fund.
It is unfair that European taxpayers should be made liable for covering deficits in the pension fund.
The fact that Membersâ contributions to the system are paid from Parliamentâs system for refunding general expenses is also remarkable.
What needs to happen is for members of the fund to pay their contributions out of their personal income.
The system should be abolished.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should firstly like to thank my fellow Member, MrÂ Mulder, for all the painstaking work he has done, as well as thank the other rapporteurs.
It is, of course, regrettable that, this year again, we do not have a straightforward statement of assurance.
As is well known, the EU should ideally be a model for the Member States, especially for the new countries with new and untried administrations.
I doubt, however, whether we are being a particularly good model, given the major problem that exists of our not yet being able to present a straightforward statement of assurance.
I agree with MrÂ Mulderâs observation that it is unsatisfactory that the Member States are not prepared to issue statements concerning the supervision of the resources they have received.
We must ensure that this is done.
It is, of course, also the case that responsibility for the administration cannot lie with the Commission alone but that the Council and the Member States also bear some responsibility.
There are a number of situations or cases in which I am unable to recommend granting discharge, simply because we would then be granting this in the dark.
In some areas we are taking on tasks that, in reality, we cannot carry out.
Proof of that is the situation concerning Parliamentâs accounts, as described today by MrÂ Ferber.
Yesterday we were certain that everything was in order and we were ready to grant discharge, but in the course of the night we knew better.
It is of course by pure chance that we are now in a situation in which we must ask for the discharge to be postponed because we simply do not know enough.
It is of course quite odd that, for 25 years, both Parliamentâs administration and our audit department have overlooked â at least they say they have done so â an extremely dubious payment to the city of Strasbourg.
This is, of course, in reality a payment to a quite superfluous middleman, and if anyone in our administration would have us believe they did not know this, I have to say that I do not believe that the administration is so incompetent.
What is more, it has to be asked whether it really is possible to enter into such financial agreements without carefully evaluating the various options and offers.
No, of course it is not.
Someone has helped someone else obtain an illicit dollop of taxpayersâ money, and, if I know the system, no one will be held liable because, of course, no one knew anything.
As the Commissionâs previous President, MrÂ Prodi, said about the Eurostat scandal: what one does not know about, one cannot be held liable for.
Do not, then, read through the contracts.
In that way you can always say that you did not know anything and so be free from liability.
As I say, we could have got away with granting discharge, but we are not going to grant it.
I am able to recommend that the granting of discharge be postponed, as proposed by MrÂ Ferber.
As for the other areas, our attitude is described in the report.
Â Â  â Mr President, well may we complain about this time.
Almost 100Â million people are currently watching live â not here, but inside in front of the television where the rest of the world is â watching Barcelona against Milan; the score is 0:0, by the way.
And here?
I can see three girls here and 11 boys â and one of them was specifically asked to stay.
One wonders what is political about this debate: this is a matter of substance.
This is about â if we take it seriously, which we are not doing to judge by the yawns of the Commission â the discharge, about billions of euros.
We all know, though â if we really look closely â that nobody here can in good conscience, if he has a conscience at all, agree to the discharge.
We are all well aware of the 'you scratch my back, and I will scratch yours' attitude.
We know that we have allowed this Europe, this Union, to be steamrollered by a Mafia-like system where everybody, quite logically, does just what everybody else is doing.
What, then, is so terrible about the city of Strasbourg?
They are just doing exactly what many of the Members of this Parliament have done too: they are cashing in a bit.
What is happening here is dangerous, very dangerous.
Sixty-one years after the end of the war, we are drifting towards the end of democracy and prosperity for large sections of the population in Europe, because we just let things slide, because the Anti-Fraud Commissioner MrÂ Kallas cannot implement the European transparency initiative about which he has been speaking because his hands are always tied, precisely because there is no more leadership in politics.
Tomorrow, please listen to the conscience that you at least used to have when you entered politics, and reject all the so-called discharge reports.
We need to make a new start â it is the only thing that can help Europe in this situation!
Â Â  â Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the agencies, I should like to thank the thoroughly competent rapporteurs for their expertise and their openness and, in particular, MrÂ Guidoni for his great ability to listen.
I feel it would be opportune to raise a number of points concerning the implementation of the agencies' budget.
The first point I should like to make is that out of the 30 existing agencies only 14 are subject to our control.
It is vital, in my view, that the remaining 16, whose budgets are also funded by European taxpayers, should be submitted for Parliament to discharge.
Furthermore, the enlargement to 25 Member States has increased the burden on the agencies, yet they have not been given the necessary resources to be able to function effectively.
We need to take an understanding approach to these agencies in light of the rather special circumstances surrounding this issue.
On the other hand, contentious issues that crop up repeatedly must be dealt with quickly.
Examples of this include the Environment Agency and the EURÂ 906Â 000 in taxes wrongly collected by the city of Copenhagen between 2000 and 2004, and the Translation Centre for the bodies of the EU and the disputed EURÂ 7.5Â million â that is to say, a quarter of its annual budget â in respect of the payment of employersâ taxes.
These facts have been known for several years but nothing practical has been done about them.
This is totally unacceptable.
As for the future of the Agency for Reconstruction, namely the gradual winding up of its activities in 2008 as laid down by the Commission, I personally do not see any problem with this, in light of the fact that the agency had originally been declared provisional.
Like some of my fellow Members, I could not go without mentioning the issue on everyoneâs lips â the city of Strasbourg.
The legitimacy of Parliamentâs seat is not in any way called into question today, and in any case this would not fall within the remit of Parliament or its Members.
Let me state that the location of the seat is based on the Treaties; it is therefore absolutely not under discussion today.
That being said, the stories circulating of late about the excessive rent that the city of Strasbourg has been charging Parliament for 25 years must be brought fully out into the open.
A parliamentary inquiry committee should therefore be set up and the matter referred to OLAF.
All of the parties involved â Parliamentâs services, the city of Strasbourg, the French and European monitoring bodies â must provide us with as much additional information as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, the risk of debates like this is always that Members start repeating what others have said.
So firstly let me start by repeating the criticism that a number of Members of this House have made concerning the timing of this debate.
It is a scandal that we are not having this debate at a time that would do justice to the importance of the reports that we are discussing.
I would like to agree with Mr Staes in saying that MrÂ Ferberâs report was excellent.
The PSE Group has absolutely no problems with the report as it is presented right now.
It calls for an assistantsâ statute and a dialogue with the Bureau about their political role: these are all things that we welcome.
However, I think that we will see an overwhelming majority from all the political groups behind his proposal not to grant discharge tomorrow, and I welcome that.
It is only right.
It is only right that we will not grant discharge to a report that would say that it is ok that we pay X amount of rent that we now all know is probably too high.
In fact I do not agree with the Members that said that the press statement that Strasbourg sent out today is only adding to the lack of clarity.
It is very clear what they are saying.
It says here on the second page of the press statement that they need money for services rendered and that there is a risk of the building at one point being empty and that risk needs to be financed.
I am sorry, but where was the invoice for this?
We are the Budgetary Control Committee!
We are supposed to check these things, so that is what we are going to be doing.
Another paragraph states that Julian Priestleyâs decision to stop paying the rent is actually a breach of the contract.
I would like to see the contract which states that what we have been paying is the right amount of money.
If it is not the right amount of money, it is only right that we have this committee of inquiry.
Therefore I welcome the decision to start this working party.
I also agree with MrÂ Stubb that it is not a discussion about Strasbourg as our seat, but we all know that it will at some point become a discussion about our seat.
We should all keep cool heads, but my opinion about that latter issue is clear to everybody in this room that wants to know.
Â Â  â I would like to discuss the report on the agencies' budget implementation.
It must be stressed that the endorsement of their financial accounts only reflects the agencies' financial situation, but in order to comprehensively assess the use of agency funds, an audit of the activities of these agencies must be carried out.
After all, the agencies must spend the money appropriately.
At the moment, when reading the audit report, it is completely unclear why one agency was able to carry out several checks in places, and another just a few.
Why in one agency there is one particular employee ratio involved in administrative and operational activities, and in another agency there is a different one.
All of this, in particular the auditors' certification that part of the budget is to be carried over to next year, indicates that the agencies are not managing funds effectively.
Therefore, I would like to propose that the European Court of Auditors debate the possibility of broadening its special annual reports on the agencies and of including in these a âcost-benefitâ analysis of the agencies' activities.
I dare doubt whether institutions with activities like agencies, that is they are not accountable to anyone, are characteristic of an EU which promotes democratic values.
MrÂ Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, often comes to my Committee â on Economy â to respond to questions posed by Members of the European Parliament.
He is accountable via MEPs to the citizens of the European Union.
However, the heads of the agencies are not accountable to anyone, and in its answers to the European Court of Auditors' comments on faults found, the Commission points out that it can only help agencies to solve these problems, but the agencies themselves have to decide whether or not they will implement the auditors' recommendations.
I believe that they ought to be accountable to the appropriate committees in the European Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to say a few words about the report on discharge for our own Parliament, the European Parliament.
This is a huge scandal we have here, what with the rents and Strasbourg.
I obviously share the view that discharge cannot be granted under these circumstances.
It is not enough merely to postpone discharge.
Rather, we must also resolve all the uncertainties before the issue can finally be settled.
That is not, however, the only reason for denying discharge to our own institution.
The fact is that the report on discharge has had an airbrush applied to it, and a lot of the serious criticism of the pensions system has been removed.
I think that this criticism alone is reason enough for denying the European Parliament discharge.
It is not only that our pensions system has no legal basis and is not paid for out of our salaries. It is also badly regulated and has huge deficits paid for by the taxpayers.
Moreover, no account has been taken of the Court of Auditorsâ criticism.
This issue too must be investigated further in the course of the work that lies ahead.
Â Â  Mr President, in the debate on the implementation of the 2004 budget, I would like to draw your attention to several issues regarding the auditing of budget implementation that in my opinion are key.
We have received a very extensive report from the European Court of Auditors.
Over a dozen reports have also been presented in this Chamber concerning the implementation of the 2004 budget.
Despite this wealth of material, however, we still know very little about how the budget was actually implemented and how the funds included in it were spent.
This is due firstly to the fact that the information in the report from the Court of Auditors has a rather general character, because the Court investigates mainly the compliance of accounting entries, or what is known as âaccounting realityâ, and that, as life shows, is often at odds with objective reality.
Secondly, the post-audit findings of the Court often do not answer the most important questions in terms of evaluating the rational implementation of the budget.
Such questions include what funds are spent on, whether the goals set have really been met by means of these funds, whether there have been any misappropriations of funds, and, finally, whether any funds have been wasted.
Finding answers to these questions is essential in order to evaluate the implementation of the budget in a matter-of-fact manner.
The degree to which this information is needed is illustrated by the findings of the direct audit carried out by auditors of the European Court of Auditors regarding the implementation of the Tacis programme.
Almost EUR 7Â billion was spent on this programme between 1991 and 2005.
The programme was supposed to provide financial support to European Union partner countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia undergoing transformations.
For example, in 2005 these countries included Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
With the programmeâs help, 29 precisely defined goals were meant to be achieved.
Auditors of the Court found that only five were achieved.
If the majority of programmes funded under the European Union budget were audited in such a way, we would be able to determine how rationally and effectively EU funds are spent.
Even such a general audit allowed the European Court of Auditors, for the 11th time in a row I would like to stress, to state that the accounts presented are not free of faults.
It would appear, therefore, that the European Union needs a comprehensive system of expenditure auditing, with extensive involvement of the national auditing institutions in the Member States.
Only reports prepared under this kind of system would allow the aforementioned questions to be answered, and the conclusions of such audits could help to improve the effectiveness of budget spending in future years.
Â Â  Mr President, whereas there is much to be said about the deficiencies in budgetary discharge here in the EU and within the institutions, I wish to focus on national misuse of EU funding.
There is a deception I have to say being perpetrated on both the regions of Europe and the EU by some national governments, not least the government of my country, the United Kingdom.
EU funds are required by ArticleÂ 11 of Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1260/1999 to be truly additional, and not deployed to replace domestic funds.
Yet this is not how EU funds are being applied.
I have in my hand a letter from the Finance Minister in my region which admits that EU funds acquired for Northern Ireland are diverted instead directly into the UK central Exchequer and are thereby used to reduce the level of UK-wide taxation and borrowing that is then necessary.
That defeats additionality and cheats a region like mine out of funds intended by Europe to provide true additional expenditure there.
I would therefore call for the regulation governing the new financial perspective from 2007 to expressly require Member States to demonstrate that true additionality is delivered to the regions in whose name funding is claimed from Europe.
Only then will the objective of obtaining genuine economic impact be secured for those regions.
This cheating of the regions has gone on for years.
Now is the time to bring it to an end.
Â Â  â Mr President, transparency engenders trust.
All representatives and members of the European institutions are completely dependent on the trust of the citizens.
In this respect, Europe is much better than its reputation suggests, but in most cases it really is not difficult to create even greater transparency, as I can show using some examples from the 'other institutions'.
Using the example of the European Court of Justice, when will the judges of the Court of Justice finally publish their financial interests?
When will the Court's internal auditor finally complete at least some of the tasks listed in his programme of work and make them available to us?
When will the ECJ finally fully implement the internal control standards?
Then there is the example of the Court of Auditors: when will the members of the Court of Auditors publish their financial interests and thus create the necessary transparency?
The same goes for the Committee of the Regions: why are so few checks and inspections carried out there?
Why was the position of internal auditor only inadequately filled for such a long time?
Why was the Committee of the Regions unable to complete its annual progress report before the Court of Auditors' audit?
There were some particularly controversial discussions regarding the Committee of the Regions during the consultations in committee.
As the rapporteur for the discharge for 'other institutions' for 2005, I tell you right now that I will be taking a particularly close look at this.
On the subject of the 'Strasbourg lease scandal', I will just say a brief word: I greatly welcome the fact that the majority of Members, at least, have been able to separate this case from the more general discussion regarding the seat of Parliament.
Â Â  As regards the Committee of the Regions, I think that the adoption of the 2004 budget discharge is justified.
I appreciate the essentially positive and cooperative approach of the Committee of the Regions, manifested in the fact that it did not make any attempts to avoid or minimise its responsibility for the deficiencies uncovered in previous years and in the course of this year.
It must be mentioned that some of the irregularities â namely the delay in appointing the internal auditor â were due to external factors, and in such cases, the Committee cannot be found responsible.
As regards the property issue that causes the difficulty, the Committee of the Regions does not have an individual, independent responsibility, and our Parliament would not be consistent or constructive, either, if it criticised one institution for something that the other institution administering the same property, the Economic and Social Committee, is not being criticised for.
It is reassuring that due to work of the expert committee of our Parliament and to the partially excellent work of the rapporteur, the irregularities that have been found are already examined by the competent financial authorities.
Under these circumstances, I do not see the necessity or benefit of adjourning the discharge.
In the course of the work of the expert committee preceding this debate, we have already debated everything that can be debated within the competence of our institution, and the adjournment would not assist our own work, the work of OLAF or the operation of the Committee of the Regions.
The comprehensive report of the Court of Auditors regarding the draft on property management, under preparation, provides us with a definite guarantee.
I believe that a constructive approach would be more expedient: let us value the positive steps taken by the Committee of the Regions in answer to our earlier proposals, appreciate their cooperative attitude and give them a vote of confidence, trusting them to continue their work in a similar spirit, as we are preparing to do just that in respect of all the other institutions.
I would just like to add, in one final sentence, that my position regarding all the previously debated Strasbourg issues, too, is that our conclusions cannot not be based on feelings, but exclusively on facts.
Â Â  Mr President, I must begin by protesting at the nocturnal hour at which we are holding this debate and by thanking our Secretary-General, Julian Priestley, for being here.
But it is very important that we reassure the citizens that money is properly spent.
Why is this debate being held at night?
Does somebody want to protect the City of Strasbourg?
Do not give me the answer now; I would simply ask that, when we hold this debate again in six months time, if we do in fact delay the discharge of the budget, the debate should be at prime time, before the newspapers have gone to print, as they have on this occasion.
This debate on such an important issue is being eclipsed by the problem we are facing in relation to the City of Strasbourg, which benefits greatly from having the European Parliament there twelve weeks per year.
Paris protects it.
That is why it has transferred the from Paris to Strasbourg.
Why?
It wants to revitalise Strasbourg; we understand its interest.
The City of Strasbourg, as Mr Stubb has said, has published a note.
If the note is intended to explain the difference between the money paid by Parliament and what the owners of the building receive, we must ask them for 'our money back', to use Margaret Thatcherâs terms Fortunately, we know who has the over-paid money and where it is, and fortunately they are in a position of solvency.
If the investigation that will have to look into this incomprehensible imbalance concludes that the City of Strasbourg must return the money, I am sure that it will do so and that the French authorities will do so.
This debate is very important.
I remember when MrsÂ Cresson, former Socialist Prime Minister of France, here in this Parliament, refused to accept that she had spent some of the money for which she was responsible badly.
In the end, the courts obliged MrsÂ Cresson to take responsibility, and at that point the whole of the Commission had to take collective responsibility.
I hope that things do not go so far this time.
I am sure that the City of Strasbourg will do what it must do to return the money, if its only arguments are really those expressed in this feeble press release that it has sent us.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate Mr Mulder on his report, primarily because within this 2004 discharge he continues the momentum that we created in the 2003 discharge about national declarations.
The wording within those paragraphs is very significant, especially in paragraph 26, which mentions encouraging national parliaments to be involved in monitoring European Union funds.
I would hope that the Committee on Budgetary Control will pursue that and encourage our colleagues in national parliaments to have a real dialogue with us on this.
I say that because of what the Councilâs attitude has always been towards this.
We have also to congratulate our colleagues on the trialogue who got the agreement within the interinstitutional agreement on the declarations â although they do not use that particular word.
However, I am informed â and perhaps Mr Kallas could confirm this â that five Member States have said that they will not comply with what has been agreed in the interinstitutional agreement.
Among those Member States I am told that Spain, Belgium, Germany, France and perhaps Italy have said that whatever it says in the IIA about giving annual statements, they will not be doing it.
It would help if we could have some clarification from the Commissioner on that.
Â Â  Mr President, in the light of the serious allegations concerning the rent and purchase by the European Parliament of two buildings in Strasbourg, this House must emphasise that it is taking immediate steps to investigate these allegations in a prompt, rigorous and transparent manner.
We should not commit the mistake of jumping to premature conclusions.
This is the time to investigate, to ask the questions and to get the answers so that we can throw full light on what has happened.
Let there be no doubt that we shall be asking all the pertinent questions and we shall expect full and adequate replies.
If it is found that Parliament was indeed overcharged, then we shall not hesitate to say as MrÂ PomÃ©s Ruiz reminded us, that we want our money back.
This is taxpayersâ money and we shall certainly ask for it to be paid back.
I support the rapporteurâs proposal to vote against the discharge and consequently postpone it because we have no other option.
This could have been avoided had the Budgetary Control Committee been informed about these allegations before adopting its report on the discharge of Parliamentâs budget a month ago.
In the event, the Budgetary Control Committee adopted its report in blissful ignorance of what was going on.
So our immediate task is to investigate these matters urgently, thoroughly and transparently so as to ensure that the financial interests of the European Union, but also of European taxpayers, are adequately protected.
This is what taxpayers expect from us today.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to join in with the general chorus of concern and surprise at the situation we are facing today on the eve of voting for the discharge for the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004, which, in reality, we had been preparing and which the Committee on Budgetary Control had prepared extremely carefully and on the basis of all the necessary information.
On the very eve of this debate we have been faced with some information that is appearing in the pressÂ ...
I can tell you that things sometimes appear in the press in Spain that are not really 100% true or which have been manipulated; therefore, since the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Legal Service â and quite rightly at this point, I believe â has advised us not to vote, since it was not our report, but rather plenaryâs â since once we have voted for MrÂ Ferberâs report it becomes plenaryâs report â I would ask the Members and MrÂ Ferber in particular â though I cannot see him in the Chamber at the moment â not to make us vote to discharge, when it does not really mean a discharge.
I would ask MrÂ Ferber to avoid a vote which may be ambiguous, wrongly interpreted and manipulated once again by the press.
Instead, I would ask you, before the vote, to consider the possibility of the referral of your report back to the Committee on Budgetary Control, which has not been able to deal with it today, precisely because it was plenary that could decide on it; but to ask plenary to return it to us before recording a negative vote, which means something different: voting no to something without having clarified why we are voting no.
I would prefer it, therefore, Mr President, if possible, if Parliamentâs services and my fellow Members could guarantee that possibility; that before voting no in a manner that could be interpreted as a badly prepared ânoâ, since we only received this information yesterday, we could prevent that by returning this report to the Committee on Budgetary Control, which would do its work again.
Â Â  Mr President, 2006 must be the Commissionerâs lucky year!
Eleven years running with no positive statement of assurance, no signing off of the accounts by the Court of Auditors and barely a mention of this in this debate, which is much too short and exactly at the wrong time of the day for any interest from other Members of the European Parliament.
But, alas, I have to talk about the hot topic of the day, which is, of course, the City of Strasbourg.
It is bad enough that we have to migrate with this travelling circus 12Â times a year to the City of Strasbourg â delightful though the place may be.
But to be swindled for the pleasure of doing it is really adding insult to injury.
Then again, who can blame the City of Strasbourg for trying it on with the European Parliament?
We have hardly shown more than a passing interest in the way that we or other EU institutions spend EU taxpayersâ money.
Just look at the blasÃ© attitude we take on how money is spent in the Committee of the Regions, where we have had two internal auditors report problems to us and our action was, and is, to do nothing.
We have a track record of ignoring whistleblowers and financial problems alike and we are now faced with this.
For the last 27 years it seems we have failed to check whether we have been spending European taxpayersâ money properly.
Supposedly we, the democratic check of the European Union, the pillar of the budgetary authority, have had the wool pulled over our eyes in what is essentially a simple rent scam.
For the past few years I have tabled amendments for various reasons to postpone or not sign off the Commissionâs and Parliamentâs accounts.
I did this because my party at home simply did not believe that taxpayersâ money was being spent properly or accounted for properly.
Alas, we have been proven to be correct.
So what now?
I agree so far with the measures taken and I fully agree to the postponement of the report.
However, each of us, especially those who have served for more than one term here, should think about our actions or inaction in the past to properly check where money has been spent.
This inaction has contributed to this current problem where we have not questioned whether the rent we pay is too high â a simple question really â and one that many of our constituents ask each and every week.
Â Â  Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, and especially MrÂ JanÂ Mulder, who is still here at this late hour, as well as all the committee members for the excellent and hard work they have done over the past six months.
Commissioner Siim Kallas also deserves our thanks for his excellent cooperation with us in all areas, the best proof of which is the fact that he is still available to us at this very late hour for this important debate.
As a result of the current discharge procedure, we wish to take a further big step in the direction of the positive DAS formulated as our joint goal.
The fact that we are finally achieving this goal after eleven years is not only important to us, MEPs, the Commission and the Court of Auditors, but also to public opinion, and therefore to the reputation of the entire European institutional system.
We must prove that we are using the taxpayersâ money correctly, efficiently and in a transparent manner.
While I value the results achieved in this area, in view of the most recent developments I must mention that in the case of Parliament, contrary to the original committee proposal, I must ask my fellow MEPs to postpone the discharge until we receive detailed, comprehensive answers to all questions that have been asked.
We owe this not only to public opinion, but also to ourselves and to the reputation of the entire European Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to echo the previous speakers' thanks to the rapporteurs, who have worked very hard and very conscientiously.
Unfortunately, even the Commission cannot pride itself on a completely flawless financial record during the period in question.
There are questions regarding the Commission's bookkeeping: they have unofficial commercial accounts that we know nothing about, that are not entered in the Commission's balance sheet and that give the impression of an incomplete discharge report.
Tomorrow, MrÂ Mulder will, at my request, submit two oral amendments in which Parliament calls for a report on these accounts and for them to be audited and included in the balance sheet and the budget.
I would ask you to support these amendments.
We ask the Commission to inform us as soon as possible of what is going on with these accounts, and we are grateful to them for trying to settle this themselves.
Commendably, they carried out a written survey among their financial staff in October 2005, with the aim of identifying accounts and their authorised signatories, and specifically those accounts that are directly or indirectly connected with the Commission's activities and that were previously unknown.
In Germany we would call them 'black accounts'.
These accounts are very varied â some of them were already known about, but not by everybody, but some of them were previously completely unknown.
The accounts that were already known include rental income from the former Commission supermarket 'Economat' in the Commission's premises on Rue de la Science, which has now been privatised.
That brings in several million euros.
The fact that access to these accounts is unclear is a cause for concern, and I therefore call for a rapid explanation â more rapid than the Commission has managed in the past.
Many questions remain unanswered, such as why these accounts were, in the past, run without the knowledge or control of the Commission by people who were obviously not authorised to do so.
It would also be nice to know how many of these accounts there actually are.
We know â allegedly â how many of them were known about, but we do not know how many were completely unknown.
It would be interesting to find out why these accounts were not identified in the budget.
I do not need to emphasise how astounding I find it that these quite considerable sums were removed from the hands of the budgetary authority with democratic legitimacy in this regard.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Szabolcs, I feel that we can look upon this moment with confidence.
We have finished most of our work, but we are also saying very clearly that where there is a question that raises serious doubts, we will not simply say âAmenâ, no matter how painful that may be to some.
We sought explanations and guaranteed that nothing and nobody would be able to cover up the truth about what is happening to the Parliament buildings in Strasbourg.
This was what we all did, albeit extremely quickly, and I should like to give a special mention at this point to our Committee chairman, who took charge of the process.
No less worthy of commendation for his efforts is our rapporteur MrÂ Ferber.
Procedurally, the only option open to us if we want to postpone the discharge is of course to vote against, although this is not a vote against the work done by our rapporteur, nor against his report; rather, it is a vote for this work, for what we have been doing and for total transparency.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is what we intend to do tomorrow, with conviction.
I wish you all the best in your work over the coming six months.
We shall certainly find the truth in this dossier.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to add to MrÂ Wynnâs words of appreciation to MrÂ Mulder about his report on 2004.
He has made a number of recommendations for improvements in the discharge procedure, starting with an amendment he has tabled that aims to enable the Commission to fine those countries that fail to pay up the agricultural premiums.
I would like to hear what the Commission has to say about this.
My delegation will, at any rate, be voting in favour of the amendment.
The second compelling point in his report is that he wants the finance ministers of the Member States to sign for any spending themselves.
This is something that receives our unqualified support.
That is the only way of ensuring that the discharge of the European budget will be dealt with adequately, and we have much appreciation for this report for that reason.
Another point is Parliamentâs discharge and the discussion that has come about surrounding Strasbourg.
It is common knowledge that the whole discussion surrounding the European budget in the Netherlands has been greatly influenced by the fact that we still have three locations where Parliament sits or has offices.
We are shocked by what has happened in Strasbourg.
Once again, this must be cleared up and I am convinced that our rapporteur, MrÂ Ferber, will succeed in this.
This shows once again, though, that we are the only Parliament in the world that has offices, or meets, in three locations â the only one! â and we must whittle this down to one if we want the European public to taken us seriously.
For that reason alone, the CDA takes the view that we should not purchase any real estate until such time as the Council can be persuaded to accommodate everything under one roof.
Whether this is to be in Strasbourg, Luxembourg or Brussels is something that we can discuss in due course.
Neither should we blame some, and not others, but this is the time to make that choice, and that is also the reason why we, with regard to MrÂ Ferberâs part report, the Mulder report with regard to the purchase of real estate, take the view that even if the cost can be recovered in ten yearsâ time, this is not the right time, because we first want to force the Council into taking a decision.
Â Â  â Mr President, for a start, it is a disgrace that we are dealing with the discharge for 2004 at this time.
That must not happen again, so let us be serious about making sure that it does not.
Secondly, and even though there are plenty of people who â even before the audit â already know what has been going on, let those of us who are on the Committee on Budgetary Control resolve to deal with this Strasbourg business by checking first and then coming to conclusions.
Thirdly, and simply because MrsÂ GrÃ€Ãle has such a nice way of applauding, we should, in dealing with the statement of assurance, take to heart what MrÂ Wynn said earlier on.
Are the Member States really willing to deal with the signing-off of accounts in the way we have indicated?
Yes or no?
On this point, I would also appreciate an answer from CommissionerÂ Kallas, and I would ask MrÂ Wynn what we are to do if the Council refuses to play ball: do we then let the Inter-Institutional Agreement collapse?
Yes or no?
How important, then, at the end of the day, is it for us that we should get this signature?
Finally, this statement of assurance and the debate about it should not give the impression that we are putting the Court of Auditors under pressure.
I am beginning to get the impression that there are, in Luxembourg, people who think that they are under pressure and that we absolutely must, in future, issue a positive statement of assurance.
On the contrary, what we have to do is to make certain changes in the way our resources are managed, and then the Court of Auditors can come up with some different results; that is the order in which things have to be done, and, in a debate on the discharge for 2004, it is worth bearing that in mind.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to comment on the issue raised by MrÂ BÃ¶sch, Mr Mulder and Mr Wynn regarding the larger involvement of Member States in our overall control and surveillance and audit architecture.
The interinstitutional agreement is preliminarily agreed.
We now of course will wait; this was agreed between all three institutions.
The Council will discuss it in the middle of May and it will be obviously signed in the middle of May.
That is the official position of the Member Statesâ representatives and the Presidency.
It has been signed and I have no doubt that there have been very close consultations between Member States about this issue.
Secondly, there are different views in Member States, but I am very happy to now use the momentum which was mentioned by Mr Wynn.
I have promoted this idea and discussed the discharge and the integrated control framework several times in the Council.
I must say that the positive attitude is increasing.
In the last Council meeting, the ideas were clearly supported by three Member States and some of them have also declared their readiness to carry out some kind of pilot project or to start to share the responsibility immediately.
So there is definitely an increase in positive attitude.
It is more complicated for federal states, but I think we have to work on it; this is a European Union where things do not happen suddenly â except bad things.
In answer to Mr Mulderâs question as to what we will do next: next will be the adoption of this interinstitutional agreement, then certain amendments to legislation, and then practical work to use this cooperation between Member States.
I would like to assure Mr BÃ¶sch this is definitely not a miracle, and these are two separate things.
Today we met the Court of Auditors and we definitely felt a certain nervousness â which was also mentioned by Mr BÃ¶sch â among some members of the Court of Auditors about this.
I clearly assure you that there are two separate issues.
One is the control, audit and surveillance architecture as a system; another is our mistakes â irregularities which will happen and against which we have to fight.
This system of surveillance must be rational and just give answers â are the proper policy-making decisions implemented properly or not?
Nobody wants to have any derogation as regards the evaluation of efficiency in accordance with the rules of fulfilling our programme.
Last year we started to introduce understandings that the Member Statesâ participation is extremely substantial and inevitable if we want to increase transparency and improve the handling of European money.
We have achieved certain steps and we have move forward.
We can be modestly optimistic about it.
Regarding the accounts mentioned by Mrs GrÃ€Ãle, I do not believe â and I have been informed of this by our Chief Accounting Officer â that we have any secret accounts.
All accounts are under control; accounts inside the EU and outside the EU have different regimes as regards checking them, but the new accounting system must secure the proper reflection of all the accounts.
I cannot imagine that the European Union has some accounts which are not known by our surveillance system.
Thank you very much for your comments.
We will see each other soon in similar circumstances in autumn when we start the next discharge, for the 2005.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have just one additional question: is the Commissioner aware of the statement by a number of Member States in which they express their reservations about the agreement in the interinstitutional agreement that we concluded?
What does he think the consequences of that statement will be and how will the Commission deal with that?
Â Â  . Mr President, I have not heard about those reservations, but they will discuss the matter in the middle of May.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
Â Â  For years the European Union in general, and the European Commission in particular, have been strongly criticised for shortcomings in financial procedures by Member States.
It is indeed national governments who actually spend some 80% of the EU budget, and most criticisms of the Court of Auditors relate to them, rather than to the European institutions.
Even if the shortcomings of Member States relate mainly to delays, incomplete paperwork and suchlike rather than to fraud, the general impression created is damaging, and damaging in practice to the EU rather than to the Member States.
That is why it is so important to oblige Member States to take their responsibilities more seriously, and I welcome the progress made on this point, notably thanks to the Parliament using its muscle during the negotiations with the Council on the new Financial Perspectives.
Â Â  I have serious concerns about the European budgetary procedures and no confidence in this system, but equally no evidence of wrongdoing or mishandling in the majority of cases.
The only way to go on this is âNot Provenâ.
We need real improvement in the transparency of these accounts and in the way the EU administers funding.
Only when we have a truly transparent system in all EU institutions and over all EU funds can we have full confidence in these accounts.
Large amounts of European monies are actually spent and accounted for by Member States, local authorities and external organisations, not the European Institutions â it is this that has left auditors unable to prove that the budget is correct, but equally unable to prove it is not.
This is not the same as finding evidence of wrongdoing, and the anti-Europeans do the citizens of Europe no favours by pretending that it is.
There is much in the EU that needs reformed, but it is not all bad.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0106/2006) by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on asset management (2006/2037(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after years of examining the asset management sector, the Commission, in August 2005, presented a Green Paper and asked for comments on it.
It has received something like 121 replies in total, which clearly indicates just how significant a sector this is, for in it, business is booming.
Today, collective investment undertakings (UCITS) are a brand name, and not just in Europe; they are being traded in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong as well, and very soon will be in South America too.
In the European Union alone, the total value of the sectorâs investment assets last year amounted to over EURÂ 4Â 600 billion, which is something like EURÂ 900Â billion more than in 2004.
This Houseâs Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has decided to respond to the Commission's Green Paper by producing an own-initiative report.
As the rapporteur, there were certain goals of which I never lost sight: a functioning internal market in UCITS; an attractive and safe range of products for investors, particularly for small investors; and an efficient asset management industry that would have no need to fear increasingly global competition.
Although the alternative market now exists, it is not yet working properly, and so the consumer does not have the best possible access to comparable products, and the industry cannot benefit from the economies of scale that a large single market offers.
There is a need for revision in three areas: firstly, in the choice of investments, which the national supervisory authorities interpret in differing ways, the consequence of which can be that a fund is approved in one country but not in another.
There are costs involved in developing a product, and if it cannot be marketed throughout Europe, but only in individual countries, there is a considerable cost disadvantage.
One aim, then, must be to find a precise definition of the investments on offer that will apply right across Europe.
I agree with CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, that it ought to be possible, to a certain degree, to add quoted real-estate funds, the so-called REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts), private equity funds and certificates to the mix.
I also think it is worth considering the possibility of including funds of hedge funds.
Secondly, there is what is termed the notification procedure.
The point about this is that the process of applying for permission in a Member State is described as a registration procedure but has in practice degenerated into a licensing procedure.
The supervisory authorities are not applying uniform standards and there is insufficient communication between them, resulting in uncertainty, wasted time and needless additional expense for the industry, whereas a âregulator to regulatorâ procedure would be the proper solution in a genuine internal market.
Thirdly, there is the matter of the simplification of prospectuses.
The Commissionâs recommendation on this has been implemented in different ways from one country to another, so that, today, depending on the Member State in question, simplified prospectuses are either slim brochures or weighty tomes with different information in them, most of which is completely beyond the consumerâs comprehension.
What is needed is for a simple and harmonised prospectus, of between two and three pages, to be developed as quickly as possible and made uniformly mandatory right across Europe, and the industry itself will benefit by being required to supply the same information in every country â in, of course, in each countryâs language.
Fourthly, one has to consider cross-border mergers and pooling, an area in which the considerable fiscal obstacles that still remain need to be removed.
The fifth issue is that of fund processing, in respect of which the industry is making promising efforts, and so we should place our trust in it and take it as read that it will sort out the problems on its own initiative.
The Commission appears to concur with this view.
I am firmly convinced that corrective measures in these five areas will, relatively quickly, help to make the internal market work.
What will also have a positive effect will be the industryâs own initiative and improved interaction on the part of the interested parties, particularly of the supervisory authorities.
The Lamfalussy principle should apply to those areas of the directive that are amended in order to achieve flexibility and facilitate adaptation to rapidly-changing markets.
The Commission has, for some considerable time, been considering whether the directive is capable of being adapted to market changes by means of individual measures or whether it is necessary to adopt a fundamentally new directive.
The conclusion I have come to as rapporteur is that producing a completely new version of a horizontal asset management directive with full Lamfalussy applicability would be a major project demanding many years of work, and that such a waste of time is something we cannot afford and should not embark on.
This is something that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs discussed on three occasions, one of them, indeed, being in the context of an extended exchange of views.
The numerous amendments â amounting to some 150 â have been reduced by means of a series of compromise amendments, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the whole report with only one vote expressing dissent.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by tabling its Amendment 6, is now jeopardising the compromise we have achieved; doing such a thing would, I believe, make a nonsense of our own-initiative report and show this House as incapable of making a constructive contribution even after long debate.
We are not, today, starting from the ground up.
UCITS are brand products â with room for improvement in them, it has to be conceded â but the industry is strong, with some 450 million potential consumers and unnumbered thousands of people working in it.
These people are citizens, and we in this House have an obligation to them.
I therefore propose voting against the Socialist Groupâs amendments, particularly against Amendment 6.
If â contrary to expectations â a majority is found to support it, then we would advise the plenary to throw out the report.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European investment fund industry is re-inventing itself: cross-border competition is taking root; fund managers and service companies are merging; distribution systems are opening up and new products are being offered to retail investors.
Faced with this and with the prospect of profound change, does the UCITS Directive offer an adequate framework for the continued success of the European fund market?
This, without a doubt, is a crucial question for policymakers.
Much lip-service has been paid to the need for a vibrant and dynamic asset management business to provide a secure and profitable home for long-term savings of European households.
Now is the time to start translating these fine words into action.
The report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is a very incisive and balanced assessment of the main challenges before us.
It clearly identifies the challenges that need to be addressed.
The Commission subscribes to the vision that informs Parliamentâs report, namely to build on the solid foundations laid down by the existing directive and not to jettison product harmonisation.
This has served us well to date.
We need to try to make it more relevant to context of modern financial markets.
The work of the Commission and the Committee of European Securities Regulators on the clarification of âeligible assetsâ is vital in this respect.
A draft proposal for implementing legislation will soon be communicated to Parliament.
This is serious and promising work.
Let us give it a chance before reading the last rites to product harmonisation.
Beyond better implementation of existing rules, there will be a need to give those involved in the fund industry greater freedom of movement to enable them better to exploit commercial opportunities of the integrated fund market.
The emphasis should be on concrete, sensible, targeted changes, based on close contact with the market and informed by a strong commitment to making markets work for the end investor.
Many important improvements can be introduced without taking an axe to the UCITS Directive.
The report provides a very clear steer on the areas where change can be most beneficial: simplification of the notification procedure; measures to facilitate cross-border fund mergers and pooling.
The onus will now be on the Commission to come forward with solutions.
Where legislative adjustment is needed to give effect to new single market freedoms, these changes could incorporate the possibility for adoption of technical implementing measures.
Another theme that features strongly in the report is regulatory arbitrage between different families of investment products.
We do not have the full picture yet.
We need to recognise the existence of different institutions and risk features.
However, we have to monitor carefully how different products are sold to retail investors.
This leads us to the disclosure area.
I take note of the strong message from the European Parliament on the simplified prospectus for UCITS.
We should not conclude that the experiment has failed and that we should move on.
On the contrary, the fund market has become a more diverse and complicated place.
There is an even greater need for effective and comparable risk and costs disclosures.
We take to heart the strong message of the European Parliament on this issue.
We will try to remedy the shortcomings of the simplified prospectus.
Outside the UCITS box, we are looking at some of the new asset classes: private equity and hedge funds.
These are increasingly powerful players in European financial markets.
They are driving change right across the investment fund industry as traditional fund managers learn from these techniques and strategies.
We do not need an EU overlay to national regimes for the oversight of these industries.
However, we need a sophisticated regulatory engagement with these important players.
We need to understand the context in which they operate and whether there are useful improvements that can be made to help them to operate in the European environment.
How do we move on from here?
We will give the fullest consideration to the views set out in Parliamentâs report.
We will critically analyse the forthcoming recommendations of industry expert groups on alternative investments and efficiency enhancements.
We will continue to test different scenarios for UCITS revision from a cost-benefit perspective and we will reach a firm view on the types of improvement that are most urgently needed.
This will be presented in a White Paper to be published in the autumn, accompanied by a comprehensive impact assessment.
We will immediately set about translating these ideas into concrete initiatives.
The Commission believes that the UCITS Green Paper and the responses to it â including Parliamentâs report â have underlined the importance of measured but effective action in this area.
This debate and the follow-up actions have helped to clarify where further action at EU level will be most useful.
We are now well poised to begin the task of translating these ideas into effective solutions.
Â Â  â Mr President, when addressing the issue of investment funds in the Union, one must include two vital elements.
The first consists of assessing the proactive role played by the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) in the construction of a single market for financial services, a goal which has yet to be accomplished.
The second involves taking account of the now crucial role of collective management for all customers of financial services, which means virtually every EU citizen.
European legislation on investment funds has been in place for over 20 years and has proved its worth.
We have a âproductâ label that is recognised both at European and world level, and our task, above all, is to ensure its implementation.
Furthermore, it is not so much the current legislative framework that is causing most problems, but rather the differences between the Member States in their interpretation and implementation of the directives.
Given that the Commission is well aware of where the problem lies, I am amazed that it has not used its powers to ensure appropriate transposition of the legislation, not least where the effective functioning of the sector is hamstrung by unsavoury protectionism. Commissioner, you were right to acknowledge that the ball is in the Commissionâs court.
I would also call on the regulators meeting in the Committee of European Securities Regulators to take immediate action in line with the 2001 directives and not to wait for changes to the law.
That being said, I am not opposed to development per se.
The rapporteur has explained that several amendments of a legislative nature need to be made.
These concern, for example, a new simplified notification procedure, the simplified prospectus and the cross-border use of pooling techniques.
As for the issue of the European passport, the report supports the principle of the passport for management companies, but believes it would be premature to do likewise for the function of depositary.
Which brings me to a crucial point. An essential prerequisite of all advances in the field of passports is a monitoring system that is accurate and universally accepted.
How can risk-free monitoring of a body established, say, in Ireland or London and whose funds are deposited in Luxembourg be arranged?
At the first sign of trouble, you will see that nobody will feel fully responsible if the monitoring architecture does not specifically establish responsibilities. In this regard, the system of delegation still has a bright future.
As regards the issue of eligible assets, I am of the opinion that one must be open to products developing on the market but that one must never lose sight of the fact that investors must be protected.
I should like, if I may, to finish by expressing my support for the rapporteurâs remarks about the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
We shall not be voting in favour of those amendments, and I regret that all of our efforts to reach a workable compromise were not accorded the value they merited.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that todayâs meeting was always on the cards because, when we debated the previous directive, we admitted that, as regards the definition of eligible assets for the investment of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), we needed to adapt to the modern world and that the last text we adopted was, in that regard, not exactly ideal.
As you are no doubt aware, Commissioner, we are in a sector that has its own geography because asset management involves UCITS that are produced in some countries and used in others.
What we have, in other words, is a market with importing countries and exporting countries, and this is an important factor in how both sides might approach this work.
Let us not overlook the fact that this work has a purpose, albeit an increasingly complex one, and that is without doubt the most important factor in our meeting.
UCITS are products that in some respects were designed for a broad range of savings, that is to say, for small and large investors.
The danger is that the proposal now before us will make this investment product more complex and will not necessarily provide it with measures to ensure better protection for investors.
Given that problems of mis-selling, to use a nice French expression, have come to light in several EU countries, damaging investor confidence, we must at some point, here or elsewhere, match the more complex nature of investment products with greater protection for investors, whoever they may be.
This is the thrust of one of the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and I hope it will be adopted.
Our group attaches vital importance to the simplified prospectus, because we believe that it is an essential prerequisite for the effective implementation of a âproductâ passport.
I should like, finally, to say a few words about supervision, as we are in a field in which the absence of a European regulator constitutes a major source of difficulty.
This is what makes the circulation of UCITS difficult, because there is mistrust among regulators.
What are needed are a restoration of confidence levels among national regulators and, more to the point, a European regulator with greater powers.
I realise that, by saying this, I am already going beyond the scope of todayâs debate.
I shall conclude by saying a few words about the work to be done.
As far as we are concerned, this should be a two-stage process.
There are some things that we need to do straight away, such as broadening the basis of eligible assets. Thought also needs to be given to the role and responsibilities of the various actors in this branch of activity of importance to the integration of the EU's financial markets.
Â Â  , . â I would like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report and am pleased that we are joined today by a member of the Competition Commission.
