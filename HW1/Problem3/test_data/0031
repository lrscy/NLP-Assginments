We also applaud your aim to match further progress on energy liberalisation with common ground rules on energy taxation, and you can count on our support to broker the necessary deals on the many financial services measures needed by the end of this year if we are to complete the financial services action plan on time by 2004.
President-in-Office, with such a magnitude of tasks you shoulder a great burden.
Re-uniting Europe is rightly your number one concern.
We wish you well and we offer you our support, for it is on our generation this responsibility falls; it is to us this challenge is made and it is with us that hope resides.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to welcome my fellow-countryman and the Danish Presidency.
Naturally I wish the Danish Presidency good luck with a great many of the points in the programme, especially of course with enlargement.
Whilst we are well aware that we should have got the work on the economic aspects of enlargement finished back in Amsterdam and got the great battle over agricultural policy and structural funds out of the way, it is now too late to make these matters obstacles to enlargement's taking place.
I will simply ask the Danish Government to stand by its policy to date: that we must utterly and completely phase out the agricultural subsidies in favour of a fairer world, take national considerations out of the equation and instead place sustainability and the relationship with farmers in the Third World on the agenda.
I would like to give my support to the maintenance of this policy.
However, there are other things that I do not wish the Danish Presidency luck with: I do not wish the Danish Government luck with obtaining influence over a common European refugee and asylum policy.
I come from a country in which racism and such matters are viewed differently.
In Denmark, you can be prosecuted for calling the Government's closest cooperation partner and parliamentary lynchpin, Pia KjÃŠrsgÃ¥rd of the Danish People's Party, what she is called in every other European country and what European Voice most recently called her: an undisguised racist.
You can be prosecuted for saying that in Denmark.
We apply a slightly different definition of racism and such matters than is used in the UN and in the EU and, in reality, by most Danish citizens when talking among friends.
Denmark is also a country in which people have a very special way of looking at aid to developing countries.
We have cut it back, but the Danish Government thinks things are going unbelievably well so long as we are not at the bottom and not in the middle relative to other countries.
It is also a country which attaches a great deal of importance to transatlantic links.
This is also a matter included in the Presidency's programme, where it talks about common interests.
Is it an expression of common interests to cooperate with a country that refuses to recognise the International Criminal Court and to cooperate closely with a country that refuses to sign the Kyoto Protocol?
Is it an expression of common interests, or is it simply that, in this joint fight against terrorism, we have to close our eyes to a great many things: to the Russian war in Chechnya, to how the Turks treat the Kurds, to how Israel is treating the Palestinian people - all because we are in an alliance against terror, a transatlantic alliance?
Many Members of the European Parliament can remember when the Danish minister, Mr Haarder was an MEP and the spokesman for human rights.
It is plain that, in exchanging MEP Bertel Haarder for Mr Haarder the Minister, we did not get a particularly good deal.
We would rather have had you as an MEP, Mr Haarder, to be frank, and I would call upon the government to re-read the speech that Mr Haarder gave when he was the spokesman for human rights in Parliament.
You should re-read it as inspiration for your future decisions.
I come from another small country and as a result, will strike a slightly different note, but you will understand that for us, the Danish Presidency will at any rate have a smooth start as far as a number of aspects are concerned.
You are to us a model of democracy, transparency and of international solidarity - so far, at least - and I hope that this will continue to be the case.
To small countries, Europe is always a bit bigger than it is to larger countries, because the latter first need to look after their own country, which is so big, before they can consider the interests of others.
This is why there is ever greater hope in this Parliament that small countries can help Europe progress more effectively than the large ones, and Denmark's decisiveness, which comes across in your speech, is no exception.
As far as your priority for enlargement is concerned, you rightly refer to the major Copenhagen rights which served as criteria for the candidate countries.
In terms of human rights, in terms of democracy, in terms of minorities, these Copenhagen criteria have provided guidance, and not only hope, but really acted as a big stick, thus ensuring that reforms will be able to take place in those countries not merely on an economic basis but in accordance with our common system of values.
However, many of those candidate countries which we hope, as you do, can join as soon as they are ready, are actually small countries.
Some of them have no more inhabitants than do some historical regions, including Scotland, Wales, the Basque Country, Flanders, Wallonia, Catalonia, and they are actually being somewhat overlooked.
You are only considering Member States, but we ask ourselves how you see the future of the constitutional regions?
Should they all become Member States before they are taken seriously?
Or will you also take the regions into consideration, not only the constitutional ones but also those in the accession countries which you will need if you are serious about solving the problem of the Structural Funds?
Is it, in this light, such a good idea to make such a distinction between reforms and great visions?
As I understand it, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has, in fact, asked you a question without actually articulating it: could you, when you consider enlargement, wait to think about the future of our institutions without having these institutions immediately in the back of your mind and having an opinion of the way in which they should be reformed?
A second critical question has already been raised, both by Mr Crespo and by Mrs Frahm.
It is related to immigration, the fight against illegal immigration, the fight against crime, and asylum seekers.
It is, of course, not your fault alone that the Council, that the Councils, have saddled us with a policy that is a non-policy.
This is not a balanced policy; the Commission had proposals that were far more balanced.
I also wanted to ask you how you intend to bring Cyprus on board if you do not give the Turkish minority any security guarantees, how you intend to solve the Kaliningrad issue, and so on. In other words, we are very interested in the questions which others will be asking, but mainly in the answers which you will be giving today, and especially your actions in the future.
In any event, I wish you, on behalf of our group, every success.
Mr President, I will start by thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Fogh Rasmussen, for a very clear and open speech.
The Danish Presidency will naturally be led with all the professionalism that Denmark can muster; but that is not the same as saying that the Danish Government's very ambitious programme for rapid enlargement to the east will succeed, since this depends after all not just on how good the presidency is.
There are very great and understandable conflicts of interest between the populations of the EU's 15 Member States and only someone entirely insensitive to the interests of the ordinary EU citizen would think that consideration of this factor must be set aside in order to rush through enlargement to the east.
In particular, it would be incredibly worrying if agricultural reform were to be postponed on the grounds that it was likely to become politically impossible after enlargement.
Enlargement towards the east is an enormous task both economically and in organisational terms.
It involves the EU's having to send several hundreds of billions of kroner eastwards each year.
The immigration into the EU of very cheap labour combined with the relocation to the East of our labour-intensive enterprises will bring about drastic social changes in the EU.
Despite the desire of European big business for masses of cheap labour and new markets, it is unwise of the EU to ignore the social problems that will be caused for Europeans.
The great problems that we face may very well overturn the Danish Government's ambitious plan.
It is in the light of this that I wish to criticise the 'now or never' mentality.
The world will not end if a decision on enlargement cannot be made in 2002 - it is only the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who is going round as if he believes that.
That is why I am pleased to hear the President-in-Office reject this idea.
There is a need for cooperation between European countries - first and foremost cooperation on free trade - but it is a distortion to talk about reuniting Europe.
The truth is that the countries of Europe have never cooperated more closely than they do today.
The project will not fall through just because a certain deadline is not achieved - on the contrary, it may be improved by not suppressing the problems and postponing dealing with them.
That is why the presidency should have a Plan B that can be implemented if Plan A is unsuccessful. I will end by expressing the desire for the Danish Presidency, as is its custom, to contribute to the EU's development by listening more to the European voters than we are used to doing.
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Danish Presidency to six months' cooperation.
Their efforts may prove to be historic for two reasons: it may be the last time that the Member States rotate the presidency - that does not have to happen - and enlargement may succeed, or else fail due to too many petty interests.
The June Movement is voting for enlargement, but we make no secret of our criticism of the EU's methods of negotiation.
The candidate countries have to copy every single EU law without the least consideration of their own democracies.
In the Sudetenland agricultural land costs 10% of the price in neighbouring Germany.
If we now force the Czechs to sell to the highest bidder after a brief transitional period, it is not difficult to predict the result and the reactions among Czech voters.
Could we not let the transitional arrangements be more flexible and, for example, not allow the sale of summer homes and agricultural land in the EU until the average income in the Czech Republic approaches ours?
The EU's agricultural schemes are expensive for consumers and taxpayers in the EU and do not secure farmers a proper income.
The subsidy from EU funds to Danish agriculture alone will this year probably be three times the size of the total net income from agriculture.
That is why French, Danish, Polish and all other farmers have a common interest in getting agricultural policy reformed, so that it supports farmers' earnings rather than subsidising unsaleable products, surplus stocks, destruction, the ruin of agricultural production in developing countries, environmental ruin and high prices for consumers for our daily food.
The Danish President-in-Office is a liberal and is closely associated with Danish agriculture. This provides an historic opportunity to get rid of the EU's failed planned economy.
Why not remove all price subsidies at 20% per year, give farmers bonds for the fall in the price of land and subsidise the incomes of those worst off?
If we phase out price subsidies in the EU there will be no reason to allow the new Member States to join the subsidy schemes.
Give them the money to spend freely instead, so that they are not enticed into investing in the wrong things.
The Danish Presidency should also go through the 85 000 pages of EU laws with a fine-toothed comb.
Send the majority back to the Member States, so that the EU only legislates on cross-border matters for which we cannot legislate meaningfully ourselves.
Let the EU become a Europe of democracies instead of a community of bureaucracies and lobbyists.
Mr President, I too should like to welcome the representatives of the Danish presidency, Mr Rasmussen, the President-in-Office, and our former colleague Bertel Haarder, and to take this opportunity to thank them for the name they have given to the programme of the Danish Presidency - 'One Europe'.
Having said that, I hope that the Danish Presidency will remember that there is a small region in Europe which has been subjected to genocide day after day for several years, namely Chechnya.
It is indeed a matter of urgency that the European Union should make arrangements, under the guidance of the Danish Presidency, for a troika visit to Chechnya with a view to observing the destruction and the criminal policy that Russia has been inflicting on that country in recent years.
I hope that the Danish Presidency will be able to mobilise the Council to follow this line in time for the autumn meeting of the EU-Russia Council.
Denmark is also synonymous with enlargement, as Mr Rasmussen reminded us several times.
For my own part, I believe the Union should engage in some reflection and propose a new enlargement.
Europe is not yet 'one'.
There remains the question of Israel, which is essentially the issue of peace, freedom and democracy in that region of the world.
I shall therefore ask the Danish Presidency what it thinks of the proposal that has now been endorsed by 50 Members of the European Parliament concerning the inclusion of Israel in the list of candidates for accession and also, from another destabilised part of the world, namely the Caucasus region, the inclusion of Georgia, which is one of the gateways to Central Asia.
Would the Danish Presidency be prepared to work on the idea of including Georgia in the list of candidate countries?
Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, it is always a pleasure to hear Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen speak and to listen to his visionary observations concerning enlargement to the east.
It is an incredibly demanding task that the President-in-Office has taken upon his shoulders.
Everyone must contribute to the success of the expansion, and that applies particularly to Germany and France, which have formed the core of EU development, strongly supported by Spain.
Enlargement can scarcely succeed without a strong commitment from, and involvement by, these countries.
It is likely to end up costing more money than we think at the moment.
Even if this should be the case, it is no reason to be daunted: we will probably all end up paying a little bit more to support the building up of the infrastructure, administration, etc. that the new candidate countries so badly need.
It would be a poor show if the EU were unable to share a little of its ever increasing wealth with these countries.
It would be prudent for the President-in-Office and his colleagues to send out a clear message that the extra contribution must not stand in the way of enlargement, which must succeed.
The purpose of enlargement is to create an area of peace, freedom, democracy and wealth.
There is every possibility that this can succeed.
The enlargement will increase our opportunities for greater efforts against international terrorism and more effective combating of international crime, including human trafficking.
It is crucial that we support sustainable development with more people in work and a better economy.
The way to do this is to create a more competitive society such that bureaucratic difficulties and inappropriate agreement conditions are phased out, so that we can achieve the same annual increase in prosperity as American society has succeeded in achieving.
Had we been as good as the USA at increasing our productivity, we would have had much greater economic funds with which to do good.
It is therefore crucial that in our development we invest in competitiveness.
In ten to fifteen years' time China and India will head a number of Asian countries that will have a dynamism that will in many ways make enormous demands upon our ability to change and grow.
Let us prepare ourselves while we have the opportunity to do so; let us not get bogged down in unimportant details - let us concentrate on the big, forward-looking policies.
In global competition the ability to produce safe food will play a huge role.
We should secure ourselves a leading place within this area through research, development and industrial innovation, as well as more value creation.
It is important that we acknowledge our global responsibility and together with the Americans try to find a solution to the problems in the Middle East.
The EU represents the group of countries that has the greatest understanding of the circumstances.
We can make a great contribution, but without support from the USA, Russia and the Arab countries our efforts will be in vain.
Finally, I am pleased to hear the President-in-Office state that there will be the greatest possible openness in respect of the Council's legislation.
I take the liberty of interpreting this as meaning that TV stations will be allowed to broadcast the relevant sections of Council meetings.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank President-in-Office, Mr Fogh Rasmussen for the programme that he has presented.
It will be a presidency which will differ fundamentally from previous Danish presidencies.
Cooperation has been expanded in a great many areas and, on top of this, there is the main task that everyone has emphasised, that of successfully negotiating enlargement with no less than ten candidate countries.
We all have a great political and moral responsibility, and it is of course a prerequisite for success that all parties have the necessary desire to compromise.
The candidate countries have undergone a fundamental restructuring.
They have made great sacrifices, but they are now essentially ready.
The ball is now largely in the EU's own court and I think that the Commission has provided a particularly reasonable scheme for funding enlargement in the initial years, and one which clearly separates enlargement from future agricultural reform.
This, I feel, is very sensible.
It will now be up to the fifteen heads of government to come up with the goods.
We will now see whether the EU currently has Heads of State with the necessary quality and strength and with visions that extend beyond short-sighted national considerations.
Narrow-mindedness and neo-nationalism must not place obstacles in the way of enlargement.
The second great challenge is the World Summit in Johannesburg and, here, the EU must go on the offensive and courageously show its solidarity with the developing countries by spearheading the creation of the global agreement, which the President-in-Office also mentioned, with practical political obligations and with a precise timetable.
There will be a great need to put pressure on the USA, which apparently believes that hunger, poverty and terror can be solved by military means and by reserving financial support for those regimes which passively go along with the American script.
I hope that the Danish Presidency will go on the offensive and choose the path of real solidarity with the Third World.
There is also a link here with the EU's asylum and immigration policy, which after all is not just about illegal immigration, as one might sometimes believe.
The strident negative debate on foreigners in certain countries should be replaced by a common European policy based on humanitarianism, in which foreigners are not discriminated against socially, in which conventions are respected and in which it is not only members of a well-educated elite who have access to Europe as refugees or for the purpose of family reunification.
We must not build a 'Fortress Europe' that is based on lowest common denominators but, rather, we should create a link between the much-praised globalisation and our legislation as regards foreigners.
With such a policy - and only with such a policy -positive cooperation from the European Parliament can be anticipated.
In saying this, I should like to express the hope and confidence that the Danish Presidency will solve the tasks ahead of it, ideally in close cooperation with Parliament.
Mr President, I very much welcome the Danish presidency and I very much welcome the fact that in its programme it states that the European Union has a special responsibility for peace and stability in a world which is ever more closely linked.
We are living today through the biggest revolution in the history of the world, with technological telecommunications and transport revolution, as a result of which the world is a much smaller place.
In that case, therefore, we should be in a much stronger position to shape that world, but in particular to ensure, as we are in the new century and the new millennium, that we will make it the first century in which we will no longer have conflict or war in our world and that the European Union will use its influence to bring that about.
Given that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution, that strengthens our position to bring it about.
The first half of the last century was the worst in the history of the world with two world wars.
Yet those same peoples, the peoples represented in this House, all came together and ended their conflict forever and created the European Union.
The principles at the heart of European Union should be sent to areas of conflict anywhere in the world.
I know from my own experience that the three principles at the heart of European Union are the same three principles at the heart of the agreement in Northern Ireland.
Number one: respect for difference - that is what all conflict is about.
Difference should be respected.
Number two: institutions which respect difference; and Number three: working together in the common interest and by so doing breaking down the barriers of the past.
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Patten and his department are working in this area.
But in today's world I would like to see the European Union set up a full department concerned with peace and conflict resolution in the European Commission, with its own Commissioner.
Then we can play our role in the smaller world of today to end the terrible conflicts that take place in different parts of the world and to bring a message of peace and lasting stability to those areas.
Mr President, President-in-Office and Prime Minister. So the day has finally arrived which we all, but particularly you, have been looking forward to and preparing for since you became Denmark's Prime Minister.
I am proud both of Denmark and of you.
As a liberal, it is with particular pleasure that I stand here today.
Now we have a liberal president of the Council, of the European Parliament and of the Commission.
That is a good starting point for getting the working programme of the presidency implemented.
Enlargement overshadows all else.
We liberals have been fighting for enlargement since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
It will secure the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe their rightful place in the future Europe.
Getting enlargement completed on schedule will require not just political skill, but also plenty of hard work.
I know from personal experience that the President?in-Office can deliver both, and thus close the circle from Copenhagen to Copenhagen.
As a Danish liberal I hope that successful enlargement can lead to Denmark again becoming a full member of the EU.
It may seem strange to work towards giving new countries access to full European cooperation when you yourself come from a country that has remained outside the sphere of influence in certain areas.
But Denmark's own foot-dragging in the EU will in no circumstances hamper enlargement.
Enlargement will give Europe's new citizens rights.
It is our duty - but a duty that we are happy to comply with - to give these new EU citizens the same rights as we ourselves have.
An EU citizen can go out and get work anywhere.
Our new citizens must have this right from day one.
I would like to wish the presidency every success in its work on implementing one Europe.
I am convinced that it will succeed.
We in the Liberal group will do everything to help it to do so.
Mr President, as I hail from SkÃ¥ne in Southern Sweden, I believe I have no need to waste polite phrases on the Danish Prime Minister, but can speak directly.
Why did you choose to implement a xenophobic party's policy on aliens on the same day as you took over the presidency of the EU?
What message are you trying to send with this symbolism?
How do you think this is perceived by the rest of the world?
Now, Mr Fogh Rasmussen, you are saying great things about enlargement, but how can people take seriously the fact that you wish to open borders for foreigners in the candidate countries when you wish to close the borders to Russians, Africans, Asians and Latin Americans?
In the newspaper Berlingske Tidende, Bertel Haarder says that the Aliens Act of the Danish Right is a victory for immigrant girls.
Now, a foreigner in Denmark must be 24 to bring in his wife from her home country.
If a Swede or a Greek living in Denmark wants to bring his 18-year old fiancÃ©e from home, there will most likely be no problem.
If, however, a Muslim from the Turkish part of Cyprus wants to do so, what will happen then?
The country is not yet an EU Member State, but if it becomes one, how will you handle that dilemma?
No, is the desire of the Danish Right for enlargement - to use the language of Hans Christian Andersen - not rather a case of 'The Emperor's New Clothes??
You cannot want to drive away so-called aliens and, at the same time, seek to expand freedom of movement in the EU to cover all European countries, some of which are Muslim.
In this way, you are constructing a sort of Fortress Europe, a super-imperialistic state, which the Danish people have rejected.
However, it is clear that Danish governments usually ignore the Danish people.
You are European champions at manipulating referendum results.
Is it not going a little too far to try to manipulate the Irish referendum results out of existence?
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Danish presidency and Mr Bertel Haarder for their presence and for the very ambitious programme to keep to the deadlines for enlargement.
My first question is two-fold.
Do you really believe that you can keep to the deadlines, given the big differences on agricultural policy?
Will there be enough time between November and December to conclude these negotiations within the Europe of the 15?
My second question concerns the so-called presidential decrees and the Bene? decrees.
There are tensions between Germany and the Czech Republic, and also between Austria and the Czech Republic, concerning the recent and very bitter past.
The past should not stand in the way of the present.
For this reason I would like to ask you whether you would use your political influence, Prime Minister, to ease these tensions and to use your influence on the Czech government to respond to the European Parliament's report on the Czech Republic, which asks the Czech side to repeal the relevant decrees by the latest at the time of accession.
Mr President, my first comment concerns something that Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen said.
I am surprised to hear that Mr Prodi is now a Liberal.
When I first met him he was an Ulivo representative.
Recently I read that he sits with the Christian Democrat Group at their conference.
Now he is a Liberal.
The President we have with us in this House today is what we might call a tricoloured President.
But perhaps he will have a little more to say to us about this.
Now, however, I have something to say to Mr Poettering.
Mr Poettering is, as we know, always very keen on dictating messages for others - yesterday it was Mr Aznar; today it is Mr Rasmussen - to pass on to the German Chancellor.
What is really going on here?
In fact what this is really about is the fact that the German Government, in the person of the Chancellor, asked - and was right to do so in my opinion - whether direct payments might not in their current form constitute an obstacle to enlargement if we did not reform the agricultural sector.
Incidentally there is a consensus that they will.
In July Mr Fischler is going to table proposals to restructure direct payments as part of the shift of emphasis towards supporting rural areas as a whole.
I am rather curious to see whether Mr Poettering will then leap to his feet again here and say: that is an obstacle to enlargement!
He will not do so, I can tell you that now, because at that point it will not be relevant to the German election.
Whenever Mr Poettering makes a speech and expresses himself in these extravagant terms, his sole objective is to stir up public opinion about the German election.
Of course this is allowed.
There is nothing wrong with it, elections are an important part of politics, but it would be better, Mr Poettering, if, when this House was discussing Austria, and when we were discussing Italy, you had not jumped up like Savonarola and said that we were meddling in the internal affairs of Member States, only, when your own country was being discussed, to start working the crowds as if you were addressing a campaign rally in OsnabrÃŒck.
After that intervention Mr Poettering might need to catch my eye.
Mr President, I will not join in the German polemic, but wish the Danish Presidency good luck.
A polished, presentable presentation has been given, without so much as a single independent thought.
Danes are, after all, a humble people.
We are and remain the tail of the German bulldog, but the Prime Minister's rhetoric makes it look as if it is the tail that is wagging the dog.
And behind this fine picture - this fine rhetoric - is a reality that encompasses a great many contradictions.
My esteemed fellow MEP, Per Gahrton, expressed one of them. A very remarkable contradiction which lies in the fact that the Danish Government, which now holds the presidency of the EU, is propped up by a party that represents a pronounced degree of hostility to outsiders that borders on racism.
Together with this supporting party - the Danish People's Party, which is also represented here in this House - it has presented a programme on foreigners the contradictions of which were very clearly documented by Mr Gahrton, and I would like to repeat Mr Gahrton's question.
The second point in the rhetoric is the European mastery of the manipulation of referendums - the clear message to the Irish population.
I do not know what this clear message is.
The situation that Ireland is in has not changed, and the Danish Presidency has demonstrated its ability to manipulate referendums previously.
The final and crucial point is the mantra: an area of freedom, security and justice - AFSJ.
Without blinking the Prime Minister, the Danish President-in-Office, talks about a strengthened fight against terrorism.
Now, nearly one year after September 11, we are seeing panic legislation which firstly leaves much to be desired in respect of the elemental Rule of Law, and secondly sets out EU measures that have no basis in the treaty.
I am thinking in particular of the European arrest warrant.
The Rule of Law and democracy are on the way out.
Mr President-in-Office, for the term of your presidency, you have decided to prioritise enlargement. I congratulate you on that, and we shall support you wholeheartedly.
On the subject of that priority, let me ask you three questions.
I am not necessarily pressing you for an immediate answer to the first question, because it is a tricky one, concerning the agricultural budget.
As you know, if we sought uniform transposition of the rules of the common agricultural policy, the agricultural budget would probably be considerably increased, which nobody wants.
As for reforming the CAP, we do not have the time to do that and, in any case, as you said, enlargement must not be delayed.
Renationalising direct aid is appealing in some respects, but it is not an entirely satisfactory solution, because the poorest countries are precisely the ones that could least afford to assist their farmers.
So is there not another avenue to explore, involving the use of a new form of Community preference that would serve both to maintain farmers' incomes and to set very high quality standards?
We recently noted an American plan which is fairly contentious but which could present us with an opportunity to call for a revision of the WTO rules, so that each country or area can plead the case for its own agricultural model?
What do you think of this sort of idea with a target date of 2006?
Secondly, with regard to illegal immigration, the previous presidency made the fight against illegal immigration one of its priorities.
Your priority is enlargement.
At the point where these two priorities meet, there is the problem of Turkey, a country which regards itself as a candidate for accession but at the same time is one of the nerve centres of illegal immigration into Europe.
What do you intend to do about this situation?
And thirdly, in your address you stated that another 'no' vote in Ireland would jeopardise the enlargement process.
Are you absolutely sure of that, Mr President-in-Office?
Would it not be possible to incorporate the relevant parts of the Treaty of Nice into the accession treaty and improve them in the process? From this perspective, would not an Irish 'no' actually represent something of an opportunity for Europe?
Mr President-in-Office, the Spanish Presidency made the fight against terrorism its top priority.
You, for your part, have chosen to prioritise enlargement.
A good political decision - well done!
We must beware, however, of thinking that, in this half-yearly game of musical chairs, our citizens will allow themselves to be duped. We must not ride roughshod over what most of them regard as a fundamental achievement of the European Union, by which I mean, of course, the transition to the euro.
In this respect we still have a great deal to do.
First and foremost, we need genuine coordination of economic policies so that the euro can foster growth and create jobs.
Your country, Mr President-in-Office, has opted out.
Our clear wish for the Danish people is that this situation will change.
But tell us how it is possible, in these conditions, to provide leadership on a matter in which progress depends on political will and determination.
What conclusions do you draw from this for the functioning of our institutions, and how do you intend to organise your presidency in this domain?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, when you were talking about your objectives for the Presidency you also mentioned the conflict in the Middle East.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already discussed this with you in Copenhagen.
My question concerns the recent American initiative.
The American President is using a mechanism that the European Union applies successfully throughout the world.
He names specific objectives, for example a three-year timetable.
He defines criteria against which reforms will be measured and promises to support these reforms if the criteria are complied with.
That is essentially the model that we used in the enlargement process, which started in Copenhagen with the Copenhagen criteria.
That is our model for our relations with the TACIS countries and, Commissioner Nielson, it has recently also become our model for ACP relations, where we have established specific principles which may also trigger sanctions.
My question for the Danish Presidency is therefore as follows: the Commission operates differently in the Middle East.
There we do not establish any principles; so far we have always given aid - and on a flat-rate basis - unconditionally and without encouraging reform.
Do you think it is possible that a new European initiative might be developed under the Danish Presidency together with the United States, based on the tangible prospect mentioned by President Bush of there being a Palestinian state in three years, and that your Presidency might support an initiative of this kind?
... we can see Liberals sitting in the Council seats, a Prime Minister who is genuinely Liberal, and at his side he has Mr Haarder.
I would like to start by saying that you are a brave man, Prime Minister.
Is it really possible to enlarge Europe without Poland?
I know that everyone thinks so and says so, but I find it extremely difficult to envisage that happening in the end.
I would like to hear your comments on the political and strategic realities in this case.
Let me also say a few words about the asylum and refugee policy.
I know that this is a sensitive area, and I know that you view all Swedes as big brother types.
I hope that is not currently the case, Prime Minister, but that you see me as a Liberal and as a friend, a trusted friend who is also able to tell you a few truths.
Sometimes we are wrong, and other times we are right.
I must say that I am concerned about developments.
I am concerned that Europe is about to become a fortress which does not welcome people.
We know that we need so many millions of people.
We need perhaps four million each year until 2050 to keep Europe working and to be able to maintain the prosperity of Europe.
When Europe is enlarged, I believe it is vital to uphold our values, those values which we Europeans want others to share.
I also believe that it is important for us to meet these demands ourselves.
I must say, Prime Minister, that I hope that the refugee policy which you have changed in Denmark is not a sign of things to come in the rest of Europe.
I believe, in fact, that we need more tolerance and more openness, quite simply more liberalism.
Liberalism is what the people of Europe long for.
We can never fight negative forces with negative measures.
Prime Minister, finally I would like to say that I have great faith in your work.
You are completing the work of Mr Uffe Elleman-Jensen.
I would like to say good luck, but I also hope that you will change your mind with regard to the asylum and refugee policy.
Mr President, my fellow Members have said some very important things about foreign policy and that the European Union must not become 'Fortress Europe'.
I would like in my own speech to stress that we must also practise good neighbourly cooperation in our neighbouring regions.
The Danish Presidency in fact offers a new opportunity for this in the Nordic area.
The Danish Presidency's programme makes mention of strengthening the so-called Northern Dimension.
This is welcome news as far as I am concerned, and I would like to propose that the Commission and Denmark, during its presidential term, should together also begin to draft the next Northern Dimension Action Plan, as the current one becomes void at the end of 2003.
I would really like to know what the Commission's position is on this Northern Dimension question.
Does the Commission take the matter as seriously as Denmark, as the country holding the presidency?
This is about cooperation between the whole of the European Union and its northern neighbouring regions and not just cooperation between the northernmost Member States and such counties as Russia, Iceland, Norway and Greenland. This is actually a programme within whose framework we must be able to resolve our common problems.
These relate to the huge challenges we face. For example, the gap that exists between the standard of living in Russia and that in the European Union and the difference in the rate of development are so enormous that this in itself constitutes a threat to security.
There are nuclear power plants, the transportation of nuclear material, and then there is this problem over the Arctic region.
Do the Commission and Denmark also now intend, within the framework of the Northern Dimension, to look into the issue of the so-called Arctic Window in the Northern Dimension, and what in concrete terms do they intend to achieve in doing so?
Mr President, I would also like to thank the Danish Prime Minister, but there was a position on the Cyprus issue that was a surprise for me.
I think there is a small, delicate and, I hope, unintentional change in the text of the resolution of the Helsinki European Council.
The resolution says that the decision on the accession of Cyprus will be taken without a political solution being a pre-condition.
Here, the Danish Prime Minister has said that "a final decision will be taken on the basis of all relevant factors".
This is something very different from Mr Prodi's position, as well as the Commission's position, Mr Verheugen's position, from the European Parliament's position, from the Helsinki position and from the position of the Spanish presidency.
I hope that there is no different intention on the part of the Danish presidency and I am expecting to hear confirmation in the second speech by the Danish Prime Minister, that, although we want a political solution and will try for one, it will not be a pre-condition for the accession of Cyprus.
Mr President, enlargement is a noble project and we owe it to our eastern European neighbours, whom we failed at Potsdam to protect from the yoke of communism, to welcome them back into the European family of nations.
But there are many problems, ranging from the Irish ratification of Nice - though surely a plan B is already there if necessary - to the over-generous direct payments under CAP to farmers and the potential for large-scale immigration, particularly by the poorly integrated and nomadic Roma communities of whom there are very large numbers in eastern European countries.
I particularly welcome the two British Commonwealth countries, Malta and Cyprus, joining and this will increase the use of English in this institution, which I fully support.
But I have concerns over Cyprus, as already mentioned on the other side of the House.
It may have to join as a divided island, with all that this means for possible Turkish annexation of the north.
What pressures can be applied, particularly to Mr Denktash, to make a deal with Mr Clerides to enable a united Cyprus to join the Union in 2004, as, I am sure, we would all wish in this House?
Mr President, the Seville Summit commits the Danish Presidency to certain obligations which need to be fulfilled within a very short space of time.
Specifically, according to paragraph 32 of the Presidency Conclusions, the Council, the Commission and the Member States are each requested, in accordance with their competences, to implement the following measures before the end of 2002: the implementation of joint external border operations, the immediate implementation of pilot projects open to all interested Member States and the creation of a network of Member State officials to liase on immigration.
Bearing in mind the small amount of time available to the Danish Presidency, will you be in a position to support it in the achievement of these objectives which were very clearly set at the Seville Summit?
Mr President, thank you for this innovation which is most welcome.
I congratulate the Danish presidency very warmly and naturally I congratulate my colleague, Mr Haarder, a former good member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy as well as of this group, on his current tasks.
However, friends in the presidency, I have a request for you which, as the Danish presidency, I believe you will wish to grant.
Today in the Treaty of Rome we give rights - human rights and animal rights - but we give no rights to children.
Yet the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ending of the Cold War threw open a devastating picture of child abuse, child neglect, child misery and child hunger and despair such as we have not seen in Europe since the Second World War.
Today, with the enlargement of the European Union, the situation has not got better.
Why do I say that?
Because there is ample evidence, alas, that the breaking down of borders, that the enlargement of the European Union, factors such as globalisation, the Internet and Schengen Agreements have made the tragedy of child abuse still worse.
Children today are at risk as they have not been before; they are trafficked around the globe in vast numbers.
Traffickers, organised criminals and separation from their parents - these are among the many things of which children are victims.
The European Union cannot do everything, but we are uniquely powerful.
What I ask is that you work with me and with the Children's Alliance, a group of us across the floor of this House, belonging to every single group, so that we can secure unanimous support.
We seek to put into the Accession Treaty and into the Treaty of Rome something so simple, just a commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which every single Member State has signed and ratified.
The most important convention in the history of the world, it has the most ratifications.
Only the USA now stands out against it.
The Commission has played its part.
It is in the acquis communautaire.
It should now be in the Accession Treaty and in the Treaty of Rome.
President?in-Office, will you work with me on this?
Mr President, I should like to say a few brief words about Mr Schulz's speech. That was not a question; it was a campaign speech!
I can only conclude that the opinion polls have obviously made him very nervous, and this was also an opportunity like no other!
I should like to ask a question, Mr President-in-Office, about the division of competences during your presidency.
Defence policy will be the responsibility not of Denmark but of Greece even during your presidency.
We are, however, facing some very important decisions, particularly in the Balkans, for example concerning the American involvement there and the transfer of responsibility to the European Union.
This raises the following question: how are you going to ensure optimal coordination between the civilian and military aspects of the operation, which are of course by their very nature inextricably linked?
What role will the presidency play, and what part will be assigned to the Commission?
I have been allocated a schedule this morning that now exhausts the possibilities on the "catch the eye" system.
I urge the more than 20 people whose names are on the list, at their groups, to encourage their presidents to offer more possibility for "catch the eye" the next time we experiment with this.
It has been an interesting addition.
. (DA) First and foremost, I would like to thank you for a good and constructive debate.
I have noted many important and insightful observations that I will take with me when I go away from here today.
I will attempt to answer as many questions as possible, but the time I have available for answering questions unfortunately does not allow me to answer all the questions raised, but I would also like to ask that our European Affairs Minister be given opportunity to answer some of the questions.
A number of election campaign speeches have been given here in the House.
That is perhaps only right and natural, but I do not intend to get involved in the election campaign in individual countries.
Moreover, Mrs Frahm and Mr Krarup, who represent Denmark in Parliament, made contributions that I consider to be part of the discussion of and campaign for domestic policy in Denmark.
I do not intend to go into that either.
I think that the European Union has such great matters to deal with that we might well wish and expect a debate in the European Parliament to concentrate on European visions and not on the petty polemic of domestic policy.
(Applause)
I would like to thank Mr Poettering for his support of the Danish Presidency and I would like to say to Mr Poettering, Mr Watson and Mrs Maij-Weggen, who all raised the matter of openness, that it is the intention of the Danish Presidency to administer the rules on openness in such a way that there is the greatest degree of openness possible within the decisions made.
I shall make no secret of the fact that I would like to have gone further with regard to openness, and I will work towards greater openness in respect of the legislative work in the European Union, but for the time being a decision has been made in Seville and the Danish Presidency will administer it in the broadest sense that we can.
Then Mr Poettering raised the matter of better legislation.
We attach the greatest importance to this and we look forward to interinstitutional cooperation that will bring about better legislation.
We will give this the very highest priority.
Mr Poettering mentions the matter of Turkey.
It is clear that as a candidate country Turkey must be treated the same as every other candidate country, i.e. Turkey cannot be given a date for starting negotiations concerning membership of the European Union until Turkey meets the political conditions - the Copenhagen criteria.
Turkey does not do so at the current point in time.
Then Mr Poettering raised the matter of agricultural policy, as did Mr Watson.
I would like to answer Mr Poettering and Mr Watson jointly, and at the same time take the opportunity to thank Mr Watson for his support of the Danish Presidency.
I agree entirely that we must urge every country and every political leader in Europe not to let the enlargement of the European Union be held to ransom by their agricultural policy ambitions.
(Applause)
It would be a historic mistake of major proportions if anyone were to block the enlargement of the European Union because of disputes concerning a monetary amount which is, after all, of marginal importance.
Let me firstly remind you that the Commission's proposal means that the enlargement of the EU can be carried out within the frameworks of the existing budget.
We do not need more money in order to implement enlargement of the European Union; and secondly, the Commission's proposal concerning the gradual phasing in of direct subsidies to farmers in the new Member States will mean a small, modest amount of extra expenditure - extra expenditure that corresponds to less than one thousandth of the value of total production in the current Member States.
I refuse to believe that any political leader in Europe wants to block the enlargement due to disputes over an amount that is less than one thousandth of production.
(Applause)
I would also like to answer the questions put forward by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, whom I also thank for his good wishes concerning the Danish Presidency.
I would like to correct a misunderstanding.
The Danish Foreign Minister did not talk about using a stick against the applicant countries.
On the contrary, we are preparing for real negotiations with the applicant countries.
I would say to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and also to Mr Bonde, who went into the matter of future reforms of agricultural policy - and here I am also talking as Danish Prime Minister - that Denmark supports future reforms of agricultural policy.
I only wish, as President-in-Office of the European Council, to establish that such agricultural policy reforms should not be made a new condition of implementation of the enlargement of the European Union.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo also raised the matter of the Middle East, as did Mr Laschet later in the debate.
I would like to say that the Danish Presidency is currently considering how the EU can best contribute to restarting the peace process in the Middle East.
I believe that, amongst other things, this will start to set in motion a process which may lead to reforms in Palestinian self-rule; after all, elections are not that far off.
The aim of our current deliberations is to create a basis for a later peace conference in which the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations can be resumed.
I can state that the Danish Foreign Minister will be discussing this matter with the US Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Colin Powell, later today - as is only natural, since we are endeavouring to bring about close cooperation between the EU, the United States and other members of the Quartet in respect of this matter.
It is the intention of the Danish Presidency that the European Union can and should play a constructive part in the attempts to get the peace process in the Middle East restarted.
Moreover, I can tell Mr BarÃ³n Crespo that the Danish Presidency is a great supporter of the community method in the EU.
Unfortunately, time does not allow me to go into more depth with regard to the work of the Convention, but we consider it to be of the utmost importance.
Then several speakers have raised the matter of Cyprus.
Mrs Maes, Mr Alavanos and Mr Tannock raised the matter of Cyprus.
I would like to emphasise that the Danish Presidency will stick to the decisions made in Helsinki, which consist of three elements.
Firstly, a solution to the Cyprus problem, such that it becomes a united island that we can include in the EU, would be an advantage; secondly, a solution is not a new condition of enlargement; thirdly, the Helsinki declaration states that when a decision is to be taken all relevant factors will be taken into consideration.
And I would like to say to Mr Alavanos that there is nothing new in this.
It is a decision taken in 1999 in Helsinki.
The Danish Presidency will act on the basis of this decision and there is complete agreement between the Commission and the Presidency regarding the Cyprus issue.
I will reply very briefly, Mr President, and just make a few things clear.
Firstly, there is absolutely no truth in the idea that Community aid to the Middle East is not subject to controls and conditions.
It is time we put paid to such statements, which come from outside and paint a ridiculous picture of the situation which is completely unfounded and bears no resemblance to the facts.
In company with the other institutions and to an even greater degree than the Monetary Fund, the Commission is supporting the projects for peace infrastructures in the Middle East, which I am sad to say have been destroyed by the war, it is implementing the decisions adopted by the Council on providing aid to the Palestinian Authority and is continuing to effect the necessary controls, although, I regret to say, this tragic war makes it more difficult to carry out the controls effectively.
I would, however, draw Parliament's attention to the importance of giving these unfounded statements, which continue to sully the name of our institutions, short shrift.
I will also reply briefly to the point about the Nordic dimension, which is and will continue to be of great importance to the Commission, both as a tool in relations with Russia and with a view to resolving specific issues and problems.
I will mention just one point, as the Danish Presidency is here, and that is the importance of the constructive, amicable relationship with Greenland and the importance of the geographical, strategic and also human aspects of our relations with that region.
Now, Mr Schultz, a brief comment on the part of your speech directed at me personally.
I have been present on a number of occasions at meetings of the Liberal Party, of the European People's Party and, I am happy to say, at the kind invitation of Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, of the Socialist Party and the Greens as well.
I am not a tricoloured President, I am a multicoloured President, which is much better than a tricoloured President, for being a tricoloured President would be limiting, very limiting in this case!
(Applause and laughter)
Lastly, I would like to thank Parliament for the great vote of confidence in the Danish Presidency expressed by all the political groupings.
This support is deserved and is necessary for our work.
If we are to succeed in an operation of historic import for our continent such as enlargement, we must all be united, and this unity must enable us to overcome the differences between the political groupings and the internal political wrangles too, it must enable us to reach the necessary agreement on outstanding instruments, and it must bring coherent action from all the Union's institutions. In this respect, the interinstitutional dialogue will be decisive in terms of both improving decision-making and preparing for enlargement under the existing rules.
Indeed, our institutions must be fully functional as soon as enlargement has taken place, and we must start the preparations now.
Lastly, we need unity to show that Europe is equal to the huge challenges before it.
Indeed, in the coming months, the political and economic challenges will be even greater than they have been in recent months, and Europe's presence will be essential in the world, starting with Johannesburg, and to an even greater degree afterwards as autumn progresses.
We will have to respond to the new huge demands of civilisation both within the Union, where we must ensure freedom and security, and outside the Union too, where we must contribute to world governance. As I said just now, Johannesburg is only the beginning and the world genuinely needs a new system, a new mentality, first and foremost, and then a new political system.
(Applause)
Thank you for your multicoloured contribution, President-in-Office.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Danish government on assuming the presidency and wish them all success during their six months in office.
They have a formidable task ahead of them and I welcome the top priority that they have given to completing the enlargement negotiations by December.
I support the sentiments expressed recently by the Danish foreign minister, Per Stig MÃžller, when he underlined the need for the EU to deliver on its promises to the applicant countries.
However, we also have a moral obligation to honour promises already given to existing Member States.
The proposals currently being considered by agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler, as part of the CAP mid-term review, are a betrayal of the Berlin Agenda 2000 agreement.
New proposals on modulation and the de-coupling of livestock premiums in favour of a system based on area-based payments spell disaster for EU farmers.
As much as 20% of farmers' total direct payments would be clawed back and transferred to some rural development measures or returned back into the CAP budget itself.
As grain and livestock producers are now totally dependant on direct payments for their incomes, the new proposals would put them out of business.
Farming incomes have already fallen.
Agriculture is the cornerstone of the rural economy in Europe and rural development will be a meaningless platitude if farmers are penalised and impoverished by the implementation of the proposals currently leaked by the EU Commission.
Preparing for enlargement by penalising farmers is morally and politically wrong and could well result in alienating them from the enlargement process itself.
Instead enlargement should be financed from within the current budget by increasing spending to existing threshold limits.
At the moment, the budget is being under-spent by as much as 20%, totalling some EUR 25 billion.
By using these monies, the EU would be demonstrating its political will to proceed with enlargement with conviction and on time.
Mr President, I wish to add my welcome to the Danish presidency and I welcome in particular the commitment to one Europe, which is very important.
My message to you, President-in-Office, is exactly the same as my message three weeks ago here to the outgoing Spanish presidency.
The Commission and Parliament are doing their jobs on enlargement; it is now up to the Council to deliver and to ensure that enlargement takes place.
History will neither forgive nor forget the governments of the European Union if, by squabbling over a few million euro, they delay this historic project.
Now is the time to deliver upon our promises.
It is not the time to introduce new hurdles to the enlargement process.
The reform of the common agricultural policy is important but it is not linked to enlargement.
Again, that is a message you must take back to the Council.
Everybody will calm down as the medium-term review becomes clearer, but that is a message we need you to take back to the governments.
We support you on your three issues.
The criteria are there to be followed and they must be followed.
We will work with you on that.
Nobody should be delayed if they are ready to come in, and December 2002 is the crucial date.
Mr Watson made a rather shabby and silly remark about the United Kingdom.
I have to say that even in his so-called "bleak Britain" anybody - whatever their age - can marry whoever they want.
Perhaps he would like to join with me in inviting young people from Denmark to come to Britain and marry whoever they want and then return, if they so wish.
Now is the time for action not words, as you said.
However, over the next few months a few more harsh words and a lot of hard talk will take place.
When you come back here in December after the summit meeting I really hope that we will all be singing with one voice: wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen!
Thank you.
(Applause)
Mr President, I greatly appreciated the Danish Prime Minister's words this morning, particularly what he had to say about the somewhat sensitive issue of enlargement, and it must be pointed out that he was in complete harmony with the President of the Commission on such a sensitive, key issue.
This gives rise to at least two points. The first is the need to influence public opinion in our countries because, although it is certainly true that the Irish referendum will be crucial and decisive, it is equally true that we must ensure that the enlargement process is explained and understood in our countries, and this is a task which is the responsibility of every Member of the European Parliament.
The second point concerns the referendums which will be held in the candidate countries.
Here, too, we must keep an eye on the process, to avoid a domino effect which could prove to be extremely negative, discouraging, of course, the populist influences emerging more or less everywhere, which paint European integration in an extremely negative light.
Another decisive point is without a doubt the work of the Convention.
In 2003 and 2004, we will have to deal with an institutional overload, what with the elections, enlargement and the Intergovernmental Conference.
I would like to say to the Danish Presidency that there are at least two subjects being discussed in the Convention which will be of some interest to Denmark as well, the first being the question of the role of linguistic minorities in Europe, which is still topical.
This is an important subject for the Member States as well as the candidate countries.
The other subject, which has already been mentioned in this House, is the question of the status within the European Union of the regions which have a legislative power recognised by the individual Constitutions.
Here, too, the subject is of particular importance, for if we do not succeed in genuinely reconciling federalism and subsidiarity the misconceptions regarding the European machinery are likely to increase somewhat.
I would like to mention once again the admirable method employed by the Danish Presidency which enabled all the Parliamentary committees, including the committee of which I am chairman, to hold a series of meetings with the coordinators in Copenhagen.
Here, at last, is the promise of a real, physical Council presence within the committees to debate the progress of the individual reports at the crucial moments before they are debated in the House.
I feel that this innovation - and I am addressing Mr Haarder here - is extremely significant, for we are still, to some extent, suffering from a problem of relations with the Council which is having extremely negative effects.
As regards the subjects which concern the activity of my committee, in particular, I must highlight two points which involve Parliament as a whole and, of course, the group I belong to as well.
The first issue concerns the added importance which will be assumed by the debate on cohesion policy and regional policy as of the coming months.
I would point out that we will have the second interim report on cohesion in January and the third during 2003, which will be the decisive report.
We can therefore say that the discussions taking place during this part-session are crucial.
It is equally important to pursue the work on the White Paper.
In this regard, I would like to point out a matter with which the Danes will be faced that requires urgent resolution, and that is the question of the Austrian ecopoints system.
This is an extremely sensitive political issue to which some solution must be found for, as we know, it is a burden on the enlargement process too, and it is evidence of the transalpine transport crisis.
Mr President, I was anxious to comply with the new rules governing the organisation of debates by drawing the conclusions myself on behalf of my group.
Not everyone, I am sorry to say, has taken the same decision.
I should like to make three observations.
The first relates to the completion of the enlargement negotiations.
I agree with what has been said about the timetable.
Deferring or rushing the final stage of the negotiating process would have destabilising political consequences; in other words, the political price would be too high.
I cannot agree, on the other hand, with what has been said about the Commission's proposals regarding the agricultural budget and agricultural aid.
Mr Rasmussen spoke of reasonable proposals, Mr Prodi of the 'only possible basis?.
We should be aware, however - and you are aware - that these proposals are seen as discriminatory in the countries of central Europe and as a danger signal from the European Union.
Similarly, certain other economic aspects of established Community law and practice are considered by the people of those countries to be excessively severe restraints.
One need only follow the political debate in Poland.
The chosen solution does not seem to be the best way to create a more stable and united Europe, which is the aim of enlargement.
My second remark, of a more general nature, could be summed up in the phrase 'Be wary when things are too quiet'.
Mr Prodi, your reading of the Eurobarometer has been selective.
I believe you are clutching at straws.
If there really is a broad consensus, why should strategic decisions be postponed until after the French and German elections?
Why be afraid of the Irish referendum?
In fact, as we all know, there is a great deal of friction between the European authorities and the people of Europe.
I am convinced that this problem has to be tackled head-on and that the public must be given the opportunity to become far more actively involved in the shaping of European policy and, to this end, in developing a set of policies that can motivate and mobilise people and foster solidarity among them.
This is a vital challenge that our Union must meet.
Finally, I believe the debate has been very interesting in many respects, but it has been rather superficial on the role of the Union in the world.
Let me cite three examples. Only a vague reference was made to Africa.
At the G8 Summit, the action plan for Africa was mentioned, which the Africans estimated to be worth USD 64 billion.
But no funds have ever been committed.
In the European Union itself, the Cotonou Agreement has not yet been ratified by all fifteen Member States, so it cannot enter into force.
We must step up a gear.
My second example is the Earth Summit in Johannesburg and its implications for our entire planet.
Here too, the preparations for the summit have come up against financial issues and run the risk of failure.
What initiatives do you think the Union should take?
My third example relates to the transatlantic links you cited, Mr President-in-Office, without a word on unilateralism or on the incredible decision made by the US Administration to hold the UN and the Balkan peace process to ransom in a bid to obtain immunity from international justice.
I believe we ought to have heard your thoughts on all of these points.
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Danish Presidency.
Firstly, as regards Europe, here is an extremely clear message which it is a pleasure to hear. We too are pulling out all the stops to ensure that this goal is achieved.
But what Europe, President-in-Office?
At the end of this debate, the new form of which I too, for my part, have greatly appreciated, we have three messages for you. Firstly, in contrast with what you have said, in our opinion, your asylum and immigration policies are not an internal question.
There must be correspondence and coherence between what you do and say in Denmark and what you do and say here. Such a wide discrepancy is unacceptable.
We are extremely concerned because Denmark is now in danger of no longer being the beacon of welcome and integration that it was in the past. It is proving that rights and freedoms are never completely won and can change with every new government.
You Danes even dare to mete out the love you give according to the nationality and age of the recipient, and that is something which is really extremely disturbing from a European point of view.
We are convinced that the way you direct the Council will depend not least upon your behaviour in these matters at home.
Secondly, Cyprus.
We were quite concerned to hear your Minister for Foreign Affairs say 'We do not have to do anything. We can leave it to the United States?.
That is not so.
As far as enlargement is concerned, the way the European Union manages these last months of negotiations is absolutely crucial.
Despite the Helsinki declarations and the declarations of other major Councils, we can on no account allow a country which is divided by a wall or a Green Line to enter the European Union.
We - and you - must do absolutely everything possible to resolve this matter.
Thirdly, as regards Johannesburg, although the European Union has an absolute priority, President-in-Office, you did not say in your speech what that priority is for Johannesburg.
In our opinion, there is only one priority: we must make it clear through our words and actions that trade and the market do not take precedence over every form of environmental undertaking or over environmental agreements.
This is the message that must be sent out from Johannesburg, a message that is never, ever heard nowadays, apart from possibly in some of the phrases the Commission has used today in European Union documents.
This is the strategic line that we must take at Johannesburg and this is what I would like to hear you say today.
Mr President, firstly I regret the fact that Prime Minister Fogh Rasmussen got the impression that I was trying to suggest that his commitment to implementing enlargement was anything less than absolute.
I would not dream of doing so.
I merely wanted to acknowledge the Prime Minister's comment that enlargement would take place whatever the circumstances, even if it does not succeed this year.
A couple of my Danish colleagues and also a couple of Swedish colleagues have directed criticism towards the Danish Government's policy on refugees and immigration and also towards its policy on developing countries.
Although Mr Watson excellently drew the comparison between being an asylum-seeker in Denmark and in England respectively, a number of false allegations were made concerning Danish policy; we heard this most recently in what Mrs Frassoni said a moment ago.
In view of this and in view of the fact that three-quarters of the Danish population supports government policy in this area, I would like to ask the Prime Minister or possibly Europe Minister Haarder to confirm two things. Firstly, that the report on human rights for which the European Affairs Minister Mr Haarder was rapporteur whilst he was a member of the European Parliament is complied with in every respect in the new policy on foreigners implemented by the governing parties and the Dansk Folkeparti.
Secondly, I would like to ask the Prime Minister to confirm that Danish development aid in 2002 is firstly the second highest amount in Denmark's history, and secondly the highest amount that any country has provided relative to that country's gross national product.
Mr President, it is not usual to praise one's opponents, but I would like to praise Anders Fogh Rasmussen for a good speech and particularly because, as when our Queen was here, he did not side with the Danish opponents of union.
We can deal with that disagreement in Denmark.
Here we have a joint project involving opening up the EU and I would ask the Danish Presidency to place all agendas, minutes and working documents from the legislative process on the 'dk2002' website.
When the EU acts as legislator there should be the same openness as in the national parliaments, and when administration is carried out by the EU citizens should have better access to documents.
Then I would like to warn the Prime Minister against using enlargement against the Irish opponents of the Nice Treaty.
As far as I am aware, they have all stated that they support enlargement and in technical terms it is quite easy to take declaration No 20 from the summit in Nice and place numbers of votes and seats in the European Parliament in the accession treaties.
Technically it is easy, and the Nice Treaty is no thing of beauty and is otherwise to be amended by the Convention that is in progress and the coming Intergovernmental Conference, as ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, the Chairman of the Convention, so rightly points out in the Danish newspapers today.
I quote in English from the Berlingske Tidende:
On the occasion of Denmark's accession to the presidency of the European Union, the elected representatives of the European Right wish to place on record their admiration of the manner in which Denmark has managed to reconcile its membership of the Union with the preservation of its national sovereignty.
Indeed, Denmark, a country with a glorious tradition, small only in surface area and population, has been remarkable in the way it has conducted its policy on Europe - firstly because it has dared to consult its people directly and systematically on the commitments it intends to make on their behalf, and secondly because the Danish Government listens to these expressions of the popular will.
Even though it was compelled to hold a second referendum on Maastricht, Denmark refused to go over the heads of the Danish people and adopt the single currency against their will.
Today, the krone still exists, and the Danish economy, needless to say, is doing rather better than those of the euro area.
Denmark has also opted out of the common immigration policy.
Incidentally, it is currently implementing its own very sound national immigration measures.
Denmark is not taking part in the common defence policy either.
In the realm of police and judicial cooperation it retains very significant national prerogatives, allowing it to derogate from common provisions.
It has managed to resist or restrict all its transfers of sovereignty in areas that affect the very heart of statehood and has done so in the legitimate interests of the Danish nation.
This has not handicapped it in any respect; on the contrary, it has been a genuine advantage in the negotiations on the accession of ten prospective new Member States that wish to join us but are anxious not to squander the freedom they have so recently recovered.
Denmark is proof that it is possible to take part in Europe without sacrificing more to the Brussels system than is strictly necessary.
Denmark is proof that it pays to be firm in the face of the diktats of anti-nationalist ideology, triumphant though it may seem at this moment, when a convention is drafting a constitution for a centralised Eurocratic superstate, which, by its very nature, is contrary to the real essence of Europe.
I hope the other governments in Europe will draw inspiration from Danish practice and pursue a course that threatens neither their freedom nor their national identities, rooted as they are in a thousand years of history.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have learnt one thing from this debate between the group chairmen, the Council Presidency and the Commission: everyone agrees that there is one single priority for the coming six months, and that is enlargement, enlargement, enlargement.
At the same time I have observed something that I do not think we have ever seen before: complete agreement between the majority of this House, the Commission and the Council Presidency on the procedure and timetable.
We really should work through this together, because this is the only way that we will be capable of completing this historic task.
I am also grateful for the fact that it has been made clear, as we have stated in Parliament's resolution, that no new conditions must be attached to enlargement, and that it has been made clear that we need a reform of agricultural policy, but that this is not a new condition either.
And if the mistakes of Agenda 2000 are now to be rectified, then this should not be to the detriment of the accession countries; those who negotiated Agenda 2000 must accept their political responsibility rather than off-loading it onto the electorate or the accession candidates.
It continues to be necessary to make it very clear that the principle of differentiation still applies.
Even now, with ten countries that will probably be able to make the final leap, they should also be aware that even so, at the end of the day, each individual country will have to be assessed on whether it meets the conditions.
This means that as yet none of them can be absolutely certain.
That is also why a number of things will have to be checked, for example with a country like Poland there will have to be a discussion about whether the central bank will have to remain independent or not.
These are important issues and they will have to be examined in a context such as this; for this reason no country should feel too sure of itself.
Mr President, I should like to encourage you to pursue the Kaliningrad issue.
But I should also like to make it very clear that for historical and pragmatic reasons the solution to the Kaliningrad issue cannot lie in creating corridors.
For the reasons I have mentioned, I do not believe that we can expect either the Lithuanians or the Poles to welcome the creation of a corridor through their country, and because of this we have to show some willingness to compromise when applying the Schengen criteria, but of course here we also need to guarantee the credibility of our secure external border in a Europe that guarantees freedom of movement.
It seems clear to me, however, that this is also a great opportunity to build bridges to Russia.
In the autumn of this year we will have to hold difficult discussions with Turkey, a country that is, for strategic reasons, extremely important for us.
We must make every effort to ensure that, because of these strategic reasons, Turkey remains part of our Europe, but if the price for compromises on the use of NATO facilities for the CESDP and on Cypriot membership is inconsistent compliance with the Copenhagen criteria then this is unacceptable.
I do not believe that this price can be paid because it would call into question the credibility of the entire enlargement process for the future.
I know - because I cannot think of an answer at the moment either - that it is going to be a hugely difficult task for the Council Presidency and the Commission to overcome this problem.
Nevertheless, I believe that we will take this opportunity, that we will make a success of it and that above all we will make it clear that the unification of Europe is not about settling the accounts of the past, but that the unification of Europe is a way of ensuring that the past, which was so dreadful, never comes back, and that this is about giving this continent a fresh start.
(Applause)
Mr President, I am delighted to be given the floor after Mr Brok because what he said was music to my ears.
His intervention was factual and not polemical and was the first such intervention that we have heard this morning from the German section of the PPE-DE Group.
I have heard several times that Mr Haarder was a good colleague.
This can only be a reference to his private life.
Politically he was many things, but he was not good; I know, because for many years I had to work with him in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
If the policy that Mr Haarder advocated there for years, the line of Danish liberalism, actually becomes the asylum and immigration policy of the European Union, then it will have very little to do with being good and much to do with being harsh.
I should like to say one thing to you, Mr Rasmussen: your position as President-in-Office of the Council does not give you the right to ask Parliament not to concern itself with the domestic politics of Member States, in particular when in his own country, in an area that the Seville Council has said is a priority for the European Union, namely asylum and immigration, the President?in-Office is actually pursuing a policy which he even says himself should become the model for European Union policy.
Of course we will be concerning ourselves with Danish domestic policy!
The most important speech from your point of view was that given by Mr Camre.
Mr Camre is of course the representative of Pia KjÃŠrsgaard's party, the Danish People's Party, by whose silk thread your government dangles.
What this party says is very close to the views put forward here by Mr Gollnisch.
If I were you, I would give some thought to whether it is right for a Council presidency to seek to pursue a policy that has the full agreement of the Front National.
The fact is that the message you are trying to get across has nothing to do with tolerance or well-ordered immigration, but everything to do with impenetrable borders and the exclusion of minorities.
In the European Union we need a combination of two things: for as long as there is no well-ordered immigration, illegal immigration will flourish.
That is why we need to restore order to immigration.
In addition to this, however, we need to recognise that immigration happens.
Nevertheless, we cannot have immigration at any price.
The European Union and the Member States have the right to shape immigration and asylum policy.
In exercising this right they are obliged to uphold humane principles.
If you are going to refer to Jean Monnet, Mr Rasmussen, then I have to tell you to apply Monnet's method.
Your government's philosophy is very distant from that of Monnet. And Spinelli, to whom you also referred, was a Communist politician in Italy who was persecuted there.
Whether he would have been granted asylum in your country under the present conditions is something that would require a very detailed examination.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Danish Presidency.
I live as close to Denmark as is possible.
I can see Denmark from my window. It is only four kilometres away across the narrowest stretch of Ãresund.
I am also pleased to welcome the Danish Presidency's major prioritisation of enlargement.
I hope and believe that you will bring this about.
During the Swedish Presidency, we carried the baton a long way forward.
Now it is time to cross the finishing line, and I believe that with care you will succeed in this.
I also have some hope for the UN conference in Johannesburg.
I am currently a little pessimistic, having seen the Spanish Presidency fail to prioritise sustainable development.
I hope you will not incline too much towards the US, for example on environmental issues.
There is a wide gap between Europe and the US on these issues.
We can only hope that the US aligns itself more with us, but we cannot rely on it.
Like many others, I would also like to bring up the asylum and refugee policy.
In this context, I would like to refer to a report by Mr Haarder, in which Member States were urged, in conjunction with the development of a common asylum system, to go one step further than the minimum levels for harmonisation by adopting high standards of protection as the basis for future asylum systems
However, Denmark has done exactly the opposite in the time that Mr Haarder has been a minister.
Denmark has gone from a high standard down to what may be the minimum level, instead of doing as the European Parliament said, namely trying to maintain high standards of protection.
I am disappointed in the Seville Summit in this respect, as it mostly dealt with illegal immigration.
I am aware of the problem and realise that it requires resolution, but this cannot be brought about by a less generous asylum and refugee policy.
Therefore, I am incredibly disappointed in Denmark.
You have responsibility as the Presidency-in-Office to live up to what was said in the European Parliament when Mr Haarder was a Member and Vice-President.
You ought to reflect a little when you receive criticism from your party colleagues in Sweden, from us Swedish Social Democrats, but applause from the National Front.
That should give pause for thought.
We now come to the vote.
The first item is the decision on the conflict of competence between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in respect of the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (COM(2002) 17 - C5-0088/2002 - 2002/0021(COD)).
At the end of a lengthy period of negotiations which failed to produce a result satisfactory to both committees, the Conference of Presidents decided at its meeting of 13 June to refer the proposal to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as the committee responsible in the light of its powers and responsibilities with the proviso that the enhanced Hughes Procedure be applied between the Legal Affairs Committee and the Environment Committee.
The Environment Committee has challenged this decision and requested that the matter be put to the House in accordance with Rule 154(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which it is perfectly entitled to do under the existing Rules.
Before we take a vote I shall give the floor to the chairs of the two committees concerned, and only to them, and then to proceed to the vote.
Mr President, I should like to say right away that the vote taking place in this House today is without precedent.
It is a rather exceptional vote because not only is the competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy at stake, it is, first and foremost, a question of consistency with the Rules of Procedure - as you indicated a moment ago - and with for the commitments we gave in the debate.
There has been a clear pronouncement on the conflict - as you have reminded us - from the Conference of Presidents in favour of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for it is the Conference of Presidents that has to decide on conflicts of competence, as we established with the amendment to Rule 154.
Mr Corbett himself made this proposal to the House and the House acknowledged it.
Indeed, the Conference of Presidents has the tools to conduct an in-depth analysis, in other words to assess matters case by case, and to take a decision.
By voting for the proposal, as I am asking, this House will, above all, be giving the Conference of Presidents the go-ahead to confirm the validity of the Rules of Procedure.
There are many factors that point towards giving competence to the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I should like to point out two of them. The Committee on Legal Affairs has been working on the subject since March 2000, when it was given the competence - kindly note - to deal with the Green Paper on legal liability in environmental matters, the consultation document that preceded the proposal for a directive that is the subject of the conflict.
Today's rapporteur on the proposal for a directive is the same person who dealt with the Green Paper, the extremely capable Mr Manders, who, over these years, has acquired a thorough knowledge of the subject.
In addition, in accordance with the competence attributed to it, the Committee on Legal Affairs has already discussed the issue and, on 21 May, held a very important hearing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the traditional competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs in matters of environmental liability is derived precisely from Annex VI to our Rules of Procedure, which makes this Committee responsible for matters of civil liability, regardless of the sector in question.
This is a proposal for a directive which clearly places civil liability on the polluter's shoulders, and it is on the basis of these problems, these issues, that I now ask Parliament to vote for the motion and confirm the decision that the Bureau has made.
Mr President, the Committee on the Environment believes that this is a measure that should be dealt with by my committee for three reasons.
Firstly, it is based on a part of the Treaty dealing with environmental protection.
It will be dealt with by the Environment Council.
The Committee on the Environment is responsible for environmental policy; the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is responsible for civil liability law.
In fact, this directive creates an entirely new instrument to combat general environmental damage to biodiversity, water and land, and puts an administrative burden on the public authorities in the Member States to help prevent and restore such damage.
It is misleading shorthand to refer to it as an environmental liability directive.
The proposal should be referred to instead as the directive on the prevention and remedying of environmental damage.
Secondly, three Vice-Presidents - whom we spent one and a half days electing two and a half years ago - decided unanimously that this report should be drawn up by the Committee on the Environment.
I have nothing to do with two of those Vice-Presidents as they come from groups which are miles away from the British Conservatives.
The third was Mr Provan who, for all we know, still has a hotline to Mrs Thatcher's handbag.
(Laughter)
The Committee on the Environment therefore voted to sustain its objections to the assignment to the Committee on Legal Affairs although, I have to confess, that it voted by a narrow majority.
Thirdly, our rapporteur, Mr Papayannakis, is already hard at work on this directive.
We appreciate the work Mr Manders has done on the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
However, I have to say to the Liberal Group that it has no chance of persuading Mr Papayannakis to give up his rapporteurship in favour of a Liberal.
(Laughter)
There is one simple reason for this: if the Liberal Group wishes to take over the rapporteurship in the Committee on the Environment, it is bottom of the list.
The following groups have first choice: the UEN, the PSE, the EDD, even the non-attached, and the PPE are higher up the list than the Liberals.
There is one other possibility that nobody has thought of: what happens if there is a tie when we vote?
I suggest that, in the event of a tie, we assign it to the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities which is looking for things to do.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, on a point of order, this morning for the first time the "catch-the-eye" procedure was used in the debate on the Danish presidency's programme.
All of us who were there can attest to the fact that it was a great success.
There were more people in the Chamber than there would normally be for such a debate.
Unfortunately, there was not enough time for everyone to speak as only half an hour had been set aside during the debate.
I should like to ask the Council presidency, through you, to repeat this experiment in future and to set aside more time for it in future debates.
I do not know if that was a point of order, but it was music to my ears.
Mr President, it is not a point of order, it is a reminder.
A year ago today a food crisis was unleashed as a result of the presence of alphabenzopyrenes in olive pomace oil.
The problem of the olive pomace industry has still not been resolved.
The responsibility we had at that time in terms of food safety was very great, but this Parliament also has the responsibility to find solutions for an economic sector which furthermore carries out an essential and necessary environmental role by recycling highly polluting products.
Mr President, I just wanted to draw your attention to a small linguistic problem in paragraph 25.
This paragraph recommends that a process of mutual learning should be started.
In the French version, the term used for 'starting' is la mise en branle. I fear that, in a report devoted to sexuality, the use of a slang term for masturbation might be considered somewhat dubious, not to say obscene, and in my country it will make people laugh at a report which otherwise, I have to say, is more apt to make one weep.
I will make sure that the services avoid the use of argot.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That concludes the vote.
Mr President, I wanted to say - and I should like this to be included in the Minutes - that I did not take part in any of the votes on this report, because I find it absolutely ludicrous that, just a few weeks after having adopted the Lamassoure report, which calls for a strict demarcation of powers - and I endorse most of that report - we should decide to intervene by giving advice to the governments and parliaments of the Member States on a matter outside our sphere of responsibility.
That was a very clever way, Mr Bourlanges, of jumping the queue on explanations of vote.
Mr President, I would advise Mr Bourlanges and the other Members of this House who share his view to ask Commissioner Byrne whether the European Union has not, indeed, got a role to play here.
In his response last night, he clearly stated that sexual and reproductive health also form part of public health, and just one hour prior to my report, we adopted the Trakatellis report which is about this very topic.
I therefore suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that you wait for what is to follow.
Mr President, on behalf of the Greens and EFA Group, I would like to welcome the results of today's vote on GMOs.
We have made quite a bit of progress here in that we have voted against the unauthorised GMOs, in other words, the kind of accidental contamination of GMOs.
This is good because it was just going to leave the door open for multinational companies to use this as a way out.
The threshold has been lowered to 0.5% which is very good.
The report also points out that if lower thresholds are technically possible then they should be achieved.
The licensing procedure will now be for one year.
The licence will last for one year and then be up for renewal, and this will give people time to consider whether the license should be granted a second time.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today's vote was the fact that milk or meat products that have been derived from animals which have been fed on GMO products will not be labelled.
The public have a right to know if the milk that they are drinking comes from animals that have been fed on GMO feed, or whether the meat that they are eating has been derived from animals which have been fed on GMO feed.
There is definitely a clear link here between what people eat and what the animals have been fed.
We can see this clearly with the whole issue of BSE.
It is quite clear that what the animals were being fed had a very serious and negative consequence on the consumer.
The consumer, therefore, has a right to know and a right to choose and it was disappointing that this point was not voted through in the report today.
It is, however, a very substantial move forward.
Europe is showing the United States in particular that we really put consumers first, multinationals do not have the right to dictate to consumers what they should or should not have, and consumers have the right to obtain information and to know clearly what they are purchasing and what they are consuming.
Mr President, I voted against this proposal for a regulation.
It occurs to me that we are spending too long deciding how good or how bad what we eat is, what it is made of and whether it includes GMOs or not, while so many people in the world are hungry and have nothing to eat.
Having said that, with all respect to the report, the Pensioners' Party and I are in favour of GMOs.
I am in favour of progress and progress cannot be halted.
That is my opinion, and I am convinced that the future will see many genetically modified organisms in food.
That is why I voted against the report.
Mr President, I myself say 'yes' to transparency, 'yes' to openness and 'yes' to protection for consumers, a category which of course includes ourselves.
But having said our 'yes' to transparency, openness and consumer protection we have not made as much progress as we had hoped.
Instead of judging the acid test of a solution to be its practicality, the majority of this Parliament preferred an ideological solution.
I believe that even the populist emphasis, which was supported so vehemently, does not solve the problem but rather creates even more uncertainty.
Unfortunately, the approach chosen is, in my opinion, not very practical.
It will cause greater uncertainty amongst consumers, who should have as much information as possible, but also as much information as necessary.
For this reason I voted against, because this is not a practical solution, but an ideological one.
Consumer protection depends on clear and precise information in terms of traceability and product labelling.
Assuming that consumers must be able to choose a GM-free diet, we are opposed to the setting of a limit for the adventitious presence of unauthorised GMOs.
The threshold of 1% supported by the European People's Party and the 0.5% limit proposed by the Party of European Socialists are unacceptable.
Zero tolerance must be applied to unauthorised GMOs in the Union.
Consumers would find it incomprehensible that even an infinitesimal quantity of prohibited GMOs could be tolerated.
The principle of strict traceability must apply equally to products from non-EU countries.
The importation of products must not result in the insidious introduction into Member States of foods made from transgenic crops that we do not allow our own farmers to grow.
We support the amendments that are designed to establish close involvement of the Member States' food safety authorities, as well as of local and regional food and health departments, in the formulation of the opinions delivered by the European Food Safety Authority.
In this minefield of GM regulation, as elsewhere, let us not create the sort of excessive centralisation that distances people from decisions affecting their everyday lives.
The Trakatellis and Scheele reports relate to two interlinked proposals that overlap in their treatment of matters concerning the authorisation, traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms.
It would seem that the way these proposals have been presented, which makes the subject even more difficult to understand, is entirely due to portfolio rivalries within the Commission.
To the general public, who already find it difficult to make sense of Europe, this way of working is intolerable, and that alone should have been enough to justify our rejecting these documents.
Since the European Parliament did not possess the self-respect to do so, it has been reduced to voting on them amidst a fair deal of confusion.
Essentially, the idea is to give certain guarantees regarding the rigour of the procedure for authorising and labelling GM foods.
In general terms, I supported those amendments that tend to toughen the wording of the proposals, and these have frequently been adopted, so the result seems not too bad in this respect.
Regrettably, the Commission has inserted into both of the draft regulations a voting and decision-making method that will sweep aside national freedom of choice.
I shall expound that view in my explanation of vote on the Scheele report.
This restriction was the reason for my abstention from voting on these two reports.
This report rightly condemns the fragmentation and inadequacy of Community legislation on GMOs.
But how could it be otherwise?
The corporate giants in the realms of agri-food, chemicals and biotechnology are clearly not keen on the imposition of excessively restrictive rules and are even less favourably disposed to the introduction of proper scrutiny, particularly in view of the legitimacy of consumers' fears.
It would obviously be possible to subject them to a coherent system of obligations and in particular to enable the general public to monitor the companies in question.
The European institutions, however, are too closely linked to the business community and its interests to exert any real pressure on it in any domain whatsoever.
Not because we wish to side with those who would present genetic modification as a modern-day Medusa, but because we have no faith in choices made by capitalists, choices dictated not by the precautionary principle but by the profit motive alone, we are voting in favour of this report.
Although the proposed measures pertain to the fierce competition that rages between the European and American corporations, these measures could ultimately create a little more transparency for consumers and might even enhance their safety.
It is for these same reasons and with the same reservations, particularly with regard to the protection of confidential data, from which the business world alone stands to benefit, that we have voted for the Scheele report.
. (PT) Consumers' rights to be informed about the products they buy cannot be undermined by the interests of multinationals, who want to disguise the use of GMOs in agricultural and food production.
Hence the importance of reducing or even eliminating the 1% ceiling proposed by the Commission for labelling not to be required, bearing in mind that the proposed threshold will leave a considerable range of products that are processed and produced with GMOs without labelling.
The report is, therefore, a step in the right direction, with the safeguards it introduces, which explains the opposition of the industry itself and of the USA. Its approval has, therefore, become of strategic importance, not only for the European Union, but also for its contribution to stopping the spread of GMOs in developing and least-developed countries.
The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party are to be regretted.
What we clearly need to focus on now is avoiding the worst, given that the priority is to maintain the moratorium on new authorisations in the field of GMOs, because, as everyone knows, these are hindering future options since they are a dead end, with unpredictable consequences for the environment, for the economy and for human and animal health.
I am in favour of a system based on the informed consent of every consumer.
Consumers must possess all the information that enables them to assess the advisability of purchasing the products they enjoy.
To make this choice, consumers must be given objective information.
At the present time, however, certain groups are out to frighten consumers, even though there is no evidence of any harm caused by genetically improved products, far less by products derived from animals reared on genetically improved feed.
I do not see how a food item can be labelled 'organic' if five per cent of its ingredients are of non-organic origin, whereas some people are doggedly determined to stigmatise any product accidentally containing a minuscule quantity of a GMO.
It is high time Europe showed the red card to those green-tinted fundamentalists who have nothing better to do than wage war on GMOs.
The Union must lay down rules reflecting the responsible conduct of countries from the United States to China, including India, South Africa and others, that have been producing and consuming genetically improved products for years without any problems whatsoever. In so doing, we should be following the age-old tradition of the world's peasant farmers, who, through selection and crossbreeding, have genetically modified all the products we have been consuming for centuries.
I am in favour of a directive which gives consumers information that is verifiable and meaningful, so that they are then in a position to decide for themselves whether or not to buy food containing GM material.
The European Union should not require labelling of something which is not present and therefore not detectable in the final product.
This is disproportionate, unenforceable and open to fraud.
I am in favour of the 1% rule.
I regard this is as a level which reliably reflects the possibilities of modern technology.
I oppose the idea that there should be a requirement for the labelling of products from animals fed GM feed.
This too would be unenforceable.
Research has shown that transgenic DNA from GM animal feed is not found in milk, meat and eggs.
GM technology offers us the chance to develop less environmentally damaging forms of agriculture, with less use of pesticides, herbicides, and artificial fertilisers.
I believe that, with sensible legislation that takes account of the need to establish verifiable systems to indicate GMs, Europeans could reap the benefit of GM food and feed - and still avoid consuming them if they wish to.
. (NL) It is uncertain whether genetic modifications in plants and animals will cause serious problems in future.
Despite this, we should already take account of the possibility that life as a whole, as a result of cross-fertilisation, especially in plant life, will change as a consequence, and that diseases will emerge to which man and animal are not entirely immune.
Instead of taking time to look into this properly, this Parliament decided two years ago to create scope for commercial applications.
This means that some undertakings can make a profit in the short term using something which will at a later stage mainly generate costs.
Now that the first line of defence against the possible risks of genetic contamination has been removed, it is all the more important for the second line of defence to remain in place.
Thanks to the labelling of genetically contaminated products, consumers are given the option of not buying them.
This is preferable to placing ordinary natural products in an exemption situation by prescribing that they state that they have not been modified by genetic procedures.
However, it is to be feared that as usual, many consumers, mainly those on a low income, will buy the cheapest products.
For them, paying attention to possible negative effects is a luxury they cannot afford.
Labelling, therefore, only solves a small part of the problem.
. (PT) Given the absence of robust and integrated legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) capable of providing guarantees for consumers and industry, marketing authorisation procedures at EU level have been suspended for the last three years.
I welcome the legislation that we are approving today (on the traceability and labelling of GMOs), because it makes it possible to register and monitor the movement of GMOs on the market and of the foods for human and animal consumption made from them.
This will enable consumers to make their choices and will make the process of product withdrawal easier, should this be deemed necessary.
Nevertheless, we would have preferred these laws to be incorporated into a single regulation and not into two, which is what has ultimately happened at the proposal of the European Commission.
What we have as a result is the unnecessary fragmentation of legislation on GMOs.
Furthermore, the proposal for a Directive contains provisions which, through an excess of zeal, could open the way to fraud and deception, to the misleading of consumers and to the distortion of competition.
The rules must be clear and straightforward.
I therefore support the proposals for amendments tabled by the rapporteur for traceability and consistent labelling to apply to GMOs and products in which genetically modified DNA or genetically modified proteins are detected.
Extending labelling to other products containing no traces of genetically modified DNA or of genetically modified proteins would be extremely confusing to consumers.
Apart from anything, such a provision would run counter to the aims of the regulation and would be as onerous for businesses as it would for consumers.
Mr President, I am in favour of the marketing of genetically modified foodstuffs.
I am, however, concerned that this may happen in a disorganised manner and especially in such a way as to curtail the activities of small traders, small farmers and those working in cottage industries.
In all these documents - directives and regulations - on genetically modified foodstuffs and also feedingstuffs, as in this case, I should like to see more attention given to preventing the progress in GM foods from damaging small enterprises in Europe.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, the European Parliamentary Labour Party, I should like to say that the vote today reflects our wish to advance beyond the moratorium and establish genuine traceability.
Consumers want to know the origins of what they eat and drink, where this can be established and tested.
We need effective proposals to establish the lowest thresholds which can be measured and better definition of what can be properly described as GM free, rather than the ambiguous non-GM.
We voted for the approvable threshold of 0.5%, above which the product must be GM labelled.
But below that it cannot be guaranteed GM free.
We need to create a climate in which labelling is an encouragement to move further to develop real GM-free areas of cultivation and production and not the pretence that we have delivered in this proposal.
The Scheele report endorses a highly exceptionable centralised European system for the authorisation of GMOs, as proposed in communication COM(2001)425 final from the Commission.
This proposal, in fact, refers obscurely to Decision 1999468/EC laying down procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, according to which:
1. authorisation decisions are taken by the Commission, subject to the delivery of a favourable opinion by a 'regulatory committee', composed of representatives of the Member States, which acts by a qualified majority;
2. if the regulatory committee does not approve the Commission's proposal, the matter is referred to the Council itself; if, however, the proposal is neither adopted by a qualified majority of the Council nor unanimously rejected by the Council, adoption of the proposal becomes the sole prerogative of the Commission.
In this way, the use of a GMO may be authorised against the will of a minority of Member States and even, in particular cases, against the will of the majority.
There is no provision for a national safeguard clause at this level - even if, for example, a nation were to vote against the use of a GMO in a referendum.
This procedure is plainly designed to give the Commission a free hand to issue authorisations, leaving governments to explain that it is a European rule about which they can do nothing.
This is how democracy works in Brussels.
The European Parliament has just taken a great step forward in responding to the wishes of European citizens, who are concerned about the impact of the presence of GMOs in their food.
By voting for Mrs Scheele's report, Parliament has clearly stated its demand for the labelling of all products containing GMOs, including products such as chocolate, for example.
The Greens regret, however, that, although animal feed will be labelled, the final product, the meat, will not.
That is the only blemish in this report.
Although farmers can choose non-GM feed for their livestock, consumers will be unable to determine whether or not their meat comes from GM-fed animals.
It is regrettable that Parliament did not follow this legislation to its logical conclusion.
Nevertheless, the Greens welcome this move by the European Parliament towards greater comprehensibility, which will enable consumers to choose freely between products that contain GMOs and those that do not.
The Commission has presented a draft directive on the authorisation and labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs and animal feed.
On more than one point, the draft text reflects the pressure exerted by the agrifood lobby.
It is particularly nefarious to propose an acceptable ceiling for the presence of GMOs in products on sale, given that GMOs are banned on account of the danger they pose!
As Karin Scheele emphasises in her report to Parliament, such a measure 'would undermine all the European Union's legislation on biosafety?.
As for the GMOs that are already authorised, the Commission proposes a very high threshold, below which there would be no mandatory labelling to inform consumers of the presence of those GMOs.
We therefore support the rapporteur's proposal that this threshold be lowered from 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent.
Similarly, we support every amendment that strengthens the directive in terms of authorisation procedure and of the public's right to information.
These seemingly technical questions of labelling and traceability have crucial political and democratic implications, which strike a particularly sharp chord in France at a time when JosÃ© BovÃ©, head of the ConfÃ©dÃ©ration Paysanne, has been imprisoned because of his campaign for a food-production system in which due consideration is given to the rights of producers, the health of the general public and the quality of the environment.
- (FI) I wish to indicate in the way I vote my support for considering the point of view of farmers with regard to GM labelling.
We need more reliable information on origin than we have at present so that farmers can be sure about what the produce they buy, especially from outside the EU, contains.
At the moment farmers cannot completely guarantee that the food or raw materials they produce are GM free.
No responsibility can be taken unless raw materials can be comprehensively monitored.
To ensure that farmers and, at the same time, the others in the food chain are legally protected, it is important to keep the GMO labelling threshold at 1%.
Any reduction in this will not significantly improve consumer protection; on the contrary, the system will be prone to incorrect labelling.
Similarly, labelling eggs or milk, whose checking process has involved the use of GMOs, will be of no benefit, owing to the questionable degree of reliability involved.
Farmers cannot give assurances using current technology regarding the GM content of the raw materials they use.
Extending traceability to livestock products, where GM feed has been used in feeding the animals, is not a realistic idea.
Traceability in such cases would in practice require the origin of all raw materials used in food to be monitored.
The ten-year period for the maintenance of monitoring data, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, instead of the five years proposed by the Commission, is, in my opinion, unreasonably long.
It will prove cumbersome and will not significantly increase levels of safety for the consumer.
For the reasons outlined above I voted in favour of supporting the legal protection of farmers where it related to this issue.
. (NL) I am pleased that we have rediscovered the voice of reason in this plenary session, albeit by a not very large majority.
It really looked as if it had left us for good after the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Extending the scope of the labelling and traceability requirement to include animals that, at some stage in their lives, were fed feedingstuffs which consist of, either wholly or partly, GMO or similar ingredients, or are produced using them, was more than one bridge too far.
Fortunately, these amendments have not made it to the plenary session.
This was unfortunately not enough to vote in favour of this report and the Trakatellis report.
For this, it was necessary to introduce traceability as a relevant aspect of distinction for labelling.
Only then is it truly possible to reach the main objective, namely to offer the consumer a choice between different products.
This choice is not guaranteed at the moment, and that is a missed opportunity.
We will now lead many consumers astray.
Mr President, how often while travelling around Europe have we seen beautiful towns and beautiful agricultural landscapes?
I was in Scotland recently, where I saw some marvellous moorland, a real paradise in anyone's eyes.
How often, though, do we come across cities where, alongside millions of inhabitants, there are harmful, dangerous industries which could overnight become the target of this proposal for a directive, which aims at preventing incidents connected with certain dangerous substances?
In this document, Mr Lisi in his great wisdom has proposed siting harmful and dangerous industries far from inhabited areas.
How can we not agree with this excellent, wise proposal?
That is why I voted for it.
Going beyond the proposals made by the Commission, the Lisi report undertakes a much more stringent revision of the Seveso II Directive.
Some advances merit special emphasis: the introduction of lower threshold values for explosive substances, the inclusion of new carcinogens or of particular mining operations and the inclusion of the storage of certain substances in the catalogue of potential hazards.
The report stresses the need to involve the staff of establishments and to enlist their practical and occupational experience and training in the effort to improve safety.
The desire for transparency and public information and for the involvement of local populations in all safety plans is another very strong point of the report.
However, in the preparation of safety plans, there is still a lack of real consideration of the establishments' own health and safety committees.
Where work is subcontracted, the report recommends that subcontractors' staff should be involved and trained, but it does not question the rationale of subcontracting.
The fact is, however, that the desire of directors to maximise their companies' profitability, a desire that is reflected in their heavy reliance on subcontractors, runs counter to the quest for the highest possible level of safety.
Nor does the report place enough emphasis on the responsibilities devolving on the boards of the establishments in question.
Despite these reservations, I shall be voting in favour of this report for the reasons outlined above.
The succession of disasters at Enschede in the Netherlands, Baia Mare in Romania, DoÃ±ana in Spain and the AZF plant in Toulouse has prompted the Council and the European Parliament to introduce legislation toughening the rules on the handling of hazardous substances.
Better late than never, of course, but even if the report is adopted, as we hope it will be, the legislation will remain insufficiently binding and will not enable us to make the owners of establishments more accountable to the local communities.
It must be stressed that this lack of accountability constitutes a grave danger to the inhabitants of the local area and even much further afield but also, and indeed first and foremost, to the employees of these dangerous establishments.
Nevertheless, it is significant that, in his explanatory statement, the author of this report condemns 'an extreme interpretation of the precautionary principle?, which could 'unnecessarily penalise industry?.
This kowtowing to industry leaders, even in an instrument that is essentially designed to improve the management of risks associated with major accidents, foreshadows other major accidents that will not be due to the hazardous nature of substances but to companies' efforts to maximise their profits.
. (NL) After the major fireworks disaster which destroyed an entire district in the Dutch town of Enschede on 13 May 2000, it transpired that safety existed only on paper.
The company had applied for, and obtained, all the necessary licences, so nothing could go wrong.
People living in the vicinity were not informed about the current use of the storage space, so nobody could become worried or ask for safety measures to be stepped up.
Two days later, I asked the European Commission for maximum openness and the application of the Seveso II Directive.
A few weeks later, along with three other Dutch MEPs, I had an interview with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, during which she committed herself to the proposal to step up the Seveso Directive, on which we are voting today.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was right to further tighten these proposals on the closing down of dangerous companies, training of personnel, provision of information to the public and the active bringing of safety reports and contingency plans into the public domain.
Unfortunately, we have now also observed that an opposing movement is at play.
The Rotterdam municipality is complaining that its position as the world's largest port is at risk because much shipped freight comprises a number of containers with Chinese fireworks which, further to new safety requirements, are no longer admitted.
Antwerp is said to allow such ships to enter its port, upon which the fireworks are transported by lorry to Rotterdam, a process which is even more dangerous.
This problem too still needs solving.
. I welcome this report, which calls for action to guard against industrial accidents in urban areas.
Tragic events, such as those which occurred in Toulouse, France, and in the Netherlands, are sorry evidence that present legislation is not working effectively to protect European citizens.
Only when the EU attains a harmonised assessment of the dangers presented by dangerous substances can we be sure that everything is being done to guard against potential disasters.
Finally, I welcome the call to introduce punitive measures against owners who fail to comply with existing and future legislation.
Moreover, since sub-contractors account for a large part of this industry, it is vital that such measures go far enough so as to include them.
Mr President, this report refers to a decision of Parliament on the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in scientific research and how to disseminate it.
I believe this document is very important - which is why I voted for it - but I must point out that I think it is even more important that the European Union should make an effort to keep the scientists themselves in Europe.
Greater efforts and greater assistance, including financial assistance, should be set aside for those who have always excelled at discovering new ways to improve people's lives throughout the world by devoting themselves to research.
I believe that greater efforts in Europe by the European Union would be very rewarding, not only for today's pensioners but also for those who will in future live happily in Europe.
I am gratified to see the knot being tied today on the legislative package relating to the sixth framework research programme (FRP).
We have honoured our commitments by adopting the report on the sixth FRP as such in May 2002, the reports on the specific programmes in June and, lastly, the rules of participation in July, to pave the way for the creation of a legal and financial framework for the achievement of the research aims formulated for the period until 2006.
At this point let me pay tribute to the work that Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has done.
She has made every possible effort so that the three institutions might find a compromise that could be adopted at first reading.
The Commission is pursuing various objectives, which we have supported from the outset: to establish simpler rules, to create a faster and less cumbersome administrative system and to protect the financial interests of the Community.
Several snags, however, quickly came to light.
I can only address the question of joint and several liability.
The Commission's proposal provided for participants' joint and several liability for grants awarded from the Community budget, including the funds administered by other participants.
The limitations of this approach soon became evident, which is why, after several informal trialogues, the decision was taken to assign liability to participants for their respective portions of the Community funds.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
I wish to congratulate Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl on her excellent report, which I fully support.
Like the rapporteur, I agree with the approach adopted by the Commission of facilitating access to funding by simplifying legislation and by guaranteeing greater operational flexibility for beneficiaries.
I should like, nevertheless, to emphasise a point that concerns the outermost regions and in relation to which I tabled a proposal for an amendment, because I think it is extremely important: I am talking about the need for programmes for the outermost regions to contain more criteria for added value.
The preamble to the Sixth Framework Programme refers to the need to address the specific features of the outermost regions with regard to access to the Programme.
Extending the criterion of added Community value will prevent the outermost regions being penalised, bearing in mind in particular that it might be difficult to find outside partners willing to enter into collaboration with institutes based in outermost regions, whatever the quality of the projects.
Mr President, the second report by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl refers to nuclear research and activity in Europe and in particular everything contained in the Euratom Treaty.
I would like to take the opportunity of explaining my vote for this decision to stress that I am in favour of nuclear energy both personally and as the representative of the Pensioners' Party here in Strasbourg.
Most of all, however, we are in favour of Europe's deciding to say once and for all whether we should develop nuclear energy or stop it altogether: either nuclear energy is dangerous and harmful, and thus it is so throughout Europe, or nuclear energy is the future, it is science, it is progress, and so it should be extended to all the Member States in the European Union.
I am certain that this would be a step forward for all the citizens of Europe, whether pensioners, workers or young people.
Mr President, I voted for the Kauppi report, which recalls what 2001 meant for the euro, the European single currency and in particular the role of the European Central Bank.
I emphasise that part - a little lacking, I must say - of this report that deals with the macroeconomy, that is, the Member States' budgets and their influence on the European Central Bank's initiatives.
I do so in the hope that, in their budgets, the Member States will take care that national pension institute spending in the area of social security is done prudently, in the citizens' interests, and done fairly for all the citizens and not unfairly, as unfortunately happens all too often.
In the foreword to the annual report of the European Central Bank for 2001, Wim Duisenberg presents an interesting personal opinion on integration.
He believes the single currency will inject fresh impetus into the integration process, because it will make people 'ask why it is possible to have a single currency but not to eliminate other barriers between the countries of the euro area?.
He concludes that 'European integration might become more of a 'bottom-up' process, initiated by the citizens of Europe, and less of a 'top-down' process driven by politicians and experts?.
This text contains two implicit admissions - firstly, the present institutional structure is unstable; secondly, the construction of Europe has hitherto been primarily a matter for 'politicians and experts?.
However, the idea that the citizens of Europe might demand closer integration because of the single currency seems questionable to us.
This is no doubt the wish of the Eurocrats, who would like the people finally to tell them how right they have been all along.
But such a mood is certainly not observable on the ground at the present time.
Besides, the process described by Mr Duisenberg is not really spontaneous but tends rather to be remote-controlled from above, through the existence of the single currency.
Manipulation all the way.
We are bound to vote against this report given the assertions it makes, specifically reaffirming the 'overriding importance of the primary objective, that is, maintenance of price stability? regardless of growth and employment rates, defending the irrationality of the Stability Pact, calling for continued 'wage moderation? and insisting on the old capitalist recipe that 'the workers should pay for the crisis? when the gains of productivity transferred from salaries into profits have not contributed to more investment and more employment, but to the enriching of the usual small group.
The report ignores the current economic situation and once again calls for further liberalisations, privatisations, integration of capital markets and, obviously, more labour flexibility and considers the criticism of the ECB's behaviour in relation to the Federal Reserve to be unfair, overlooking the fact that the deflationist policy pursued has contributed to unemployment, whilst the restrictive monetary policy has not allowed skilful use to be made of the period of economic growth in the second half of the 1990s. This criticism is shared not only by various internationally renowned economists, such as Solow, but also by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
. (NL) The ECB is very reminiscent of an old-fashioned money-circulation bank in private hands.
The reason for transferring it from private to state ownership was that money circulation should be a democratically verifiable core task of the government.
This pertains to the policy regarding exchange rates, interest rates, the extent of money circulation and the implications for employment, public goods, environmental protection and the prices of consumer goods.
By disconnecting a centralised European circulation bank from political interference, the link between the electorate and this core government task is severed, and we are back in the old, unsatisfactory situation we were in a century ago.
The fact that every year, a report is discussed in this Parliament may be useful in order to air any conflicting views on the policy adopted in the past and to be expected in future, but the bank should not be concerned with this.
There is even a tendency to blatantly do the exact opposite from what politicians prescribe.
According to Mrs Kauppi, the bank has done a sterling job once again, but opinions may differ on this.
The fact that the euro is achieving parity with the dollar again is caused by the tax level in the US which is structurally too low in relation to inevitable government expenditure combined with the waste in defence.
I am only satisfied with the proposal to curtail secrecy by making the Minutes public.
We are categorically opposed to the cruel, strictly monetarist policy of the ECB, a policy which fosters inequality and increasingly exploits the working classes, while safeguarding the profits of and granting privileges to European monopolies.
On the pretext of adhering rigidly to the Stability Pact and fighting inflation, it calls for lower and lower wages and structural changes on the job market, the main objective being to introduce even more flexible working conditions.
The excuse of a so-called "healthy environment" for companies and investments is being used to endorse the greed of big business, with a total disregard for the economic and social consequences, the uncertainty and insecurity of the working classes and the huge financial burden which they have to shoulder.
The ECB policy of raising or lowering interest rates, shadowing interest rate policy in the United States, is basically dictated by the need to fund speculative projects which, objectively speaking, result not just in unproductive investment, but in "scams" such as the stock exchange scams for which thousands of redundant workers and thousands of duped investors have paid and are still paying the price.
As a result of recent scandals on the American stock exchange, first with ?nron and now with Worldcom and Xerox, and similar scandals which are now coming to light in European companies, small investors' savings are being looted, pension fund and insurance company reserves are being fleeced and thousands of workers are being sacrificed for the sake of massive profits.
Mr President, I welcome this report on behalf of the Green Group and congratulate the rapporteur. Very heavy pressure was brought to bear on her to withdraw or compromise on her report.
She is to be congratulated for standing her ground.
The report points out that abortion rates are high in countries with poor sex education and where contraception is not emphasised.
Abortion, the report states, should not be used as a contraceptive.
I am sure we all agree that this is a concern.
The report states that in order to safeguard women's reproductive health and rights, abortion should be made safe, legal and accessible to all.
In Ireland, according to the Supreme Court decision some time ago in the "X" case, where there is real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and when this risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination is lawful.
This means that abortion is, in fact, legal in Ireland but is not legislated for.
This is of concern to doctors, who do not have a framework of legislation within which to work and therefore feel unable to comply with this Supreme Court ruling.
Access to abortion for Irish women is a concern.
Over 6 600 women from Ireland had abortions in the UK last year.
Recently, the formula under which EU citizens access health care in other countries which is not available to them on their home territory has been invoked.
I would very much like an explanation from the Commission, under the subsidiarity rules, as to how this will operate in practice.
Mr President, like very many members of the PPE-DE Group, I too voted against this document, not only because its contents do not fully reflect our ideas on abortion and the sexual problems affecting European citizens' health but also because in this way I mean to stress the fact that, although I agree that we should talk about this important topic, I really wish we could talk just as often about the health of the elderly, the lives of pensioners and also - why not - what happens as regards relations between the sexes among the elderly.
I wish this were discussed more in this Parliament.
Imagine, Mr President, if there were 200 Pensioners' Party representatives here: it would certainly be discussed much more!
Mr President, I abstained on the Van Lancker report for many of the reasons already mentioned by Mrs Ahern, but I abstained also because there are some very good points in the report.
It clearly states that abortion should not be used as a birth control method.
I am a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Reproductive Health.
I have seen for myself the alarming and terrifying rise of HIV/Aids not just in the developing countries but also in the applicant countries.
I believe that reproductive health services are a right and should be available for all.
There is no legislation for abortion in Ireland.
This report will cause us considerable problems in relation to the forthcoming constitutional amendment.
We have a huge and unacceptable level of abortion in Ireland.
While I fully accept that the European Union has no competence in this matter, the provision of reproductive health - as rightly stated by Commissioner Byrne - is an intrinsic part of a good public health service.
Mr President, I voted against this report because I do not believe it falls within our competence.
Although the report has many good points, it talks about rights.
Rights at whose expense?
Rights at the expense of the unborn child and also, therefore, at the expense of humanity.
Surely humanity cannot be reduced to the level of political wheeling and dealing.
Surely, when we build a better world it must be based on some absolute cornerstones.
Human life cannot be subject to voting.
It cannot be a question of a minority or majority decision.
If our solidarity does not extend to that most vulnerable creature, the unborn child, then we in our human family are building the foundations of tomorrow's world on sand soaked by the tears of the unborn child.
Mr President, this report is not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity and the complex process of enlargement, it also contradicts the fundamental and founding principles of the European Union.
Abortion is damaging to children, women and humankind as a whole!
It is damaging to children because it kills unborn children; it is damaging to women because it degrades women even more to objects of male manipulation - something that is often forgotten - and it is damaging to humankind because it calls into question the beginning, the end and the overall dignity of human life, the dignity of the individual from their conception to their natural death.
That is why it contradicts the fundamental principles laid down by Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi, fundamental principles which have made this EU of ours what it is today and what it ought to remain.
To all those who will criticise Parliament today I should like to say: do not criticise Parliament, criticise that narrow majority that railroaded this report through, and make sure that the next Parliament has a different majority!
Mr President, I voted against this report because the European Union has no competence to legislate on abortion.
The European Parliament should therefore not be debating reports that convey the impression that it does, and to do so raises unnecessary fears on the part of many European citizens.
The problem is complicated further by the fact that Ireland will soon be holding a second referendum on the Treaty of Nice.
Raising the issue of abortion in the European Parliament today gives oxygen to Irish Eurosceptics.
They will cite today's vote on this issue as evidence that Europe wants to foist abortion on Ireland against its will and is, therefore, an undemocratic project.
While this is patently untrue, today's adoption of this report, coupled with the proposed mid-term reform of the CAP, will now make it extremely difficult to secure ratification of the Treaty of Nice.
Regrettably, if this happens, those who supported today's report will have won a Pyrrhic victory and must bear some responsibility if the Irish electorate rejects it again.
I call on parliamentary colleagues to cease compiling reports on issues for which we have no competence and instead concentrate on areas where we have codecision powers in framing European law.
Mrs Van Lancker's report contains much that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats think is good and important.
However, the EU does not have, and nor should it have, competence in this area.
We have therefore chosen to support the amendments whereby text is deleted on the grounds that issues such as abortion and sex education do not fall within the competence of the EU.
We also voted in favour of Amendment No 7 which clearly explains our position.
In the final vote, we voted against the report in its entirety.
This report puts men and women on a par with animals, unable to control their sexual impulses, which drive them inexorably to copulation.
By proposing that the Member States, in an enlarged framework including the accession countries, share experience and best practice in the domain of sexual and reproductive health and rights, the Commission is describing the direction in which it wishes to guide the debate on these subjects, a direction in which recourse to abortion becomes commonplace and the family unit is dismantled.
Wanting the Commission to promote the harmonisation of the various national policies on these matters is tantamount to a desire to rationalise, or indeed standardise, social life in the Member States in utter disregard of their diverse identities.
Favouring the widespread practice of abortion, the report recommends the creation of a framework of counselling services, while mothers in distress are abandoned to their fate.
The height of absurdity is reached when the Commission calls on Member States not to prosecute in cases of illegal abortions!
Moreover, the report heralds a policy of educating and informing young people from an early age.
These measures are a violation of the integrity of children and will only serve to detach them from the family unit, whose key educative role is treated with profound contempt.
The UK delegation of the PPE-DE will be voting against this report as it proposes an extension of EU interference into areas not currently covered by EU competence.
- (DE) Mrs Van Lancker's report on sexual and reproductive health and rights has been firmly rejected in Parliament by the Christian Democratic Group, and I can only support this position.
We must not ignore the concerns of the national catholic lay movements and organisations in the candidate countries.
The subject of this report does not lie within the competence of EU policy-making.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, decisions about such matters have to be made at national level.
I am extremely concerned, above all about the endorsement given to the call for so-called emergency contraception - the 'morning-after pill' - to be standard practice.
This is tantamount to proposing the legalisation of abortion in the Member States and candidate countries.
Given the particular sensitivity of this subject, the adoption of the report will provoke a negative response in the candidate countries towards the enlargement process and put it under unnecessary strain.
The report makes substantial demands of their governments, demands that have not been included in the decision-making programme in any shape or form.
In any case, I am firmly convinced that this kind of behaviour is not the right way to foster confidence in the EU's democratic decision-making process.
The Van Lancker report on sexual and reproductive health and rights is a useful contribution designed to encourage the Member States and applicant countries to develop information on reproductive-health services and to improve access to such services.
There are indeed wide disparities between the various European countries but also between rich and poor within each country.
The same applies to sexual violence, which is a real and widespread phenomenon.
The report therefore calls on all Member States to establish a system for the distribution of free or very low-priced contraceptives, to legalise abortion, to develop proper information and education policies for young people and to support women who are victims of sexual abuse.
This is a report in which the guidance role predominates, since the European Union has no powers in the realm of health policy, which falls within the competence of the Member States.
None the less, it is an interesting and progressively minded exhortation that seeks to improve the situation for those thousands of women who are compelled to suffer abortions in sordid conditions, sometimes at the risk of their own lives.
This has been clearly understood by the reactionary Members who have done everything possible to block the debate and then the vote on the text of this report through demonstrations, threats, floods of e-mails and so on.
Needless to say, we have voted in favour of the report.
This own-initiative report, which the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities was authorised to draw up, has been turned by its socialist rapporteur and her communist and green acolytes into a pamphlet in favour of abortion and contraception.
Fourteen of the 20 recitals and 17 of the 31 paragraphs in this long-winded resolution are devoted to these issues, as if women had no other problems, even in connection with their reproductive health.
The obstinacy with which this united left has pursued its goal here, regardless of the adverse consequences it might have, for example in connection with the second referendum on the ratification of the Nice Treaty in Ireland or with the referenda in the accession countries, and without considering the fact that the EU has absolutely no competence in this field, thanks to the principle of subsidiarity, points, in my mind, to a regrettable confusion about its sense of mission.
This being the case, and because reason and realism were unfortunately not enough to teach these abortion fanatics otherwise, I did not vote in favour of this report.
I wish to make it absolutely clear that abortion must not be elevated to the preferred means of birth control.
Neither can we have the morning-after pill being given out in schools free of charge, as this encourages carelessness and lends it respectability, which at the end of the day releases men entirely from their share of the responsibility and forces women, especially young women, to put their health at risk.
Surely this is unacceptable!
Mrs Van Lancker's report is a veritable nightmare.
It addresses issues of sexuality and reproduction without ever referring to the acceptance of life.
Reading this report, one is given the morbid impression that any pregnancy is necessarily a crisis.
It is certainly true that too many pregnant women find themselves in situations of human or material distress.
So is it not our responsibility to act instead of looking for an escape route?
Abortion is the easy solution, creating a society that is dying because it no longer respects life.
Let us campaign instead for the development of reception centres for mothers in distress; let us give them the real human, material and financial resources they need to alleviate their distress; let us re-evaluate and grant social and economic recognition to the choice of some parents to suspend their careers in order to look after their children; let us simplify adoption procedures, etc.
In the name of a struggle to impose a hedonistic and materialistic ideology, in an utter denial of humanity, people would have us reject so-called unwanted children, just as they reject elderly men and women whom they consider to be a burden.
Instead of this culture of death, let us opt for life from its inception to its natural end and for acceptance of the children who are our future.
. (NL) In a world where men have arrogated to themselves a domineering role, women are condemned to a life of providing for the sexual pleasures of men, of bearing and raising children, and of doing household work.
In a world where all people have equal rights, opportunities and freedom of choice, women decide for themselves how they organise their lives, with whom they want possible sexual contact and if they want children.
In most EU Member States, there is already an arrangement in place by means of which a pregnancy which is not wanted by the woman can be terminated on her initiative in a medically responsible manner.
Better still is to prevent such pregnancies, by, among other things, easy access to contraception and information about it.
Such measures prevent people from having to raise children whom they do not, or not yet, want.
Or from pregnancies being terminated in the old-fashioned, dangerous way using knitting needles and douche bags, or by a costly trip abroad.
I do expect objections to this development from a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, which is expressly founded on gender inequality, but not from mainstream European Christianity.
The Van Lancker proposal does not impose anything on any Member States, but merely encourages us to learn from each other in order to develop the best possible practice.
The report on sexual and reproductive health and rights is, amongst other things, damaging to the equal dignity of men and women.
Besides, by talking of reproductive rights and not of rights to procreation, women end up being likened to breeding animals or machines.
As the Alleanza Nazionale, we reject this mechanistic idea of the birth of a human life and we refute the cultural idea which sets a woman's freedom against the unborn child's right to life.
Also unacceptable is the idea that abortion should become a method of contraception, and we are certain that, for the protection of health, any product deemed to be medicinal should be available at an accessible price and be supplied on a medical prescription.
