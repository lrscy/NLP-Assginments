Mr President, I should like to move the following small addition to recital H, which deals with the execution of Saddam Hussein: 'and deploring the way it was carried out'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)

Promoting healthy diets and physical activity (vote)
- Before the vote:
Mr President, I have a small point concerning Amendment 1, which I tabled as shadow rapporteur on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
That was correct, but I should have also said that the original author was Professor Trakatellis.
I apologise to him for not including his name.
I would hope that the inclusion of his authorship will encourage wider-spread approval across this House for a good amendment.

Limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving personal injuries and fatal accidents (vote)

Discrimination against young women and girls in the field of education (vote)
- Before the vote on recital G:
(DE) Mr President, I have just a brief statement to make on the amendment.
(PL) The report refers to many negative aspects of so-called feminism and segregation, and I therefore consider it is worth highlighting a positive example.
Marie SkÅodowska-Curie could serve as an inspiring example of a woman, mother, wife, scientist, Nobel prize-winner and exemplary European.
That is why I am surprised that Mrs FlasarovÃ¡, the rapporteur, is opposed to Marie SkÅodowska-Curie and I cannot understand why.
Is it a case of woman against woman?
Is it politically and psychologically correct?
- Before the vote on the amended motion for a resolution:
rapporteur. - (CS) Thank you for giving me the floor, Mr President.
I feel that in terms of women who have made a significant contribution to our European Union and to Europe, there are too many to name.
I therefore feel that it is not only Marie Curie-SkÅodowska, a woman for whom I have great admiration, who should be on the list.
This report, in my view, deals with the issues that have been mentioned here.
Thank you.

Explanations of vote
in writing. (DE) I cast my vote for the recommendation on the approval of partitioning systems to protect passengers against displaced luggage, supplied as non-original vehicle equipment, since this, firstly, makes easier trade in motor vehicles between one contracting party and another and, secondly, also guarantees a high standard of safety and environmental protection.
With these considerations in mind, I can do no other than support the harmonisation of the rules applicable to motor vehicles.
I cast my vote in favour of a regulation concerning the approval of motor vehicles with regard to the forward field of vision of the motor vehicle driver.
The harmonisation of regulations applicable to motor vehicles will, on the one hand, reduce obstacles to trade between various contracting parties and, on the other, guarantee high safety standards.
The draft guarantees an adequate field of vision through the windscreen and other windows on the motor vehicle, which, from the point of view of general safety, is to be endorsed without exception.
I will be supporting this report which reinforces our agreement with the Republic of Korea on scientific and technological cooperation.
Seoul is an increasingly important global industrial player and it is vital that the EU engages with this country which traditionally has been closer to the US rather than us.
I presume that this agreement will cover scientific and technological research in the Kaesong Industrial Zone jointly administered by North and South Korea, and in that I am sure the Republic of Korea will welcome our commitment that is currently withheld by Washington.
We are radically opposed to the Council proposal on scientific cooperation between the ÎU and Korea, because the orientation and fragmentation of research contributes to the profitability of the monopoly groups of companies and to capital in general.
It is contrary to the real needs of the workers. It is in the people's interest to fight this reactionary choice for research and similar agreements and the anti-labour policy overall and the EU itself and to fight for radical change so that research can be oriented towards satisfying the contemporary needs of the working and grass-roots classes.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Lithuanian MEP Mrs BudreikaitÄ, on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies.
She rightly points out that sustainable development is based on the idea that the needs of the current generation should be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
It is right to mainstream sustainable development concepts in public policy at European and Member State level, concepts that include economic prosperity, social cohesion and respect for the environment.
This is essential when it comes to development cooperation, which is very difficult to achieve given the planet's demographic development and the need to eradicate poverty.
The EU should be at the forefront of the worldwide affirmation of sustainable development concepts. This, after all, is one of the EU's key missions.
The report omits to mention the underlying causes of the increasingly deep social inequality and disparity in development, of the unchecked exploitation of natural resources and of the massive destruction of the environment around the world, and fails to mention the real culprit, which is capitalism.
Despite this, it does contain a wide range of proposals and points that we welcome, such as the call for the target of 0.7% GNI to be met in order to achieve effective development cooperation characterised by solidarity.
However, we cannot accept the following points, for example:
because 'local authorities in developing countries are not always in a position to provide the volumes of financing required to make major investments in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure networks, for example to supply water or provide sanitation', the report concludes that the solution is 'only supplementary injections of private capital, through public-private partnerships, will be able to provide the requisite volume of funding', thus handing this fundamental resource for life on a plate to private capital;
and making the reduction - rather than the cancellation - of the debts of the least-developed countries contingent on what is termed 'good governance', the criteria for which are dictated by the whims of the major powers.
Hence our vote.
in writing. (DE) Over the past fifteen years we have made progress in combating poverty, albeit far from to the extent we had hoped, for even if we manage to drive a country's economic development forward, this does not mean by a long chalk that poverty has thereby been reduced.
Funds intended for those in disadvantaged circumstances must not be allowed to seep away into corrupt systems or be able to be used even for such things as the purchase of weaponry or the shoring up of dictatorial regimes.
It is here that effectiveness needs to be better monitored if development funds are to be applied in the right place and for the right purposes.
It might also be worth considering concentrating them on what are termed 'anchor countries', which are capable of fast-forwarding a whole region's development, and we should also be open to new approaches, including the use of microcredit as a means of getting the poor permanently back on their own feet.
I just wanted to expand on what I said earlier regarding the way the resolution on Dalits' human rights went through the House without an opportunity to amend it, and in particular to point out a number of factual inaccuracies in the report which never came before either the Foreign Affairs Committee or the Human Rights Sub-Committee for an opinion.
I would like to protest at the way in which Rule 90(4) is being used by certain Members of this House.
For instance, the resolution highlights the incidence of crimes against the Dalits and talks about frequent heinous crimes against them, e.g. murders.
Well, I would like to point out that in fact the incidence of murders in India against Dalits is 2.04%, whereas they constitute 14% of the population.
So actually, if you are a Dalit, you have a safer lifestyle than if you are somebody from one of the other castes.
The resolution makes no mention of the workings of the Prevention of Atrocities Act, which was designed to help convict those who have attacked Dalits, and in addition it makes no mention of the fact that the rate of literacy, although very low for Dalits, is extremely close to the national average.
It does not mention that there is a national reward from the government, basically designed to eradicate untouchability, and there are cash incentives given to encourage inter-caste marriages.
This report is very unbalanced; it is full of factual inaccuracies and I lament the fact, Mr President, that you were not in a position to refer it back to committee, but my case rests.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the European Parliament's Committee on Development on the human rights situation of the Dalits in India.
Although I believe that the European Union should be very careful when it comes to interfering in countries' constitutions, I support this resolution denouncing the unacceptable situation of the Dalits, which is due to the non-application of various provisions prohibiting caste discrimination.
According to the report and numerous studies, the Dalits are the victims of unpunished crimes and offences.
Added to this are the abuses of children and women, who are the victims of two forms of discrimination - caste and gender discrimination - throughout their lives, with sexual abuse being included in this.
Yes, the European Parliament was right to denounce this disgraceful situation.
The treatment of the Dalits in India presents some serious human rights concerns.
There should be a universal right to decent work and non-discrimination and the caste system as it currently exists in India guarantees neither of these right to Dalits.
As the EU and the European Parliament's very foundations are based on shared values, of which non-discrimination is a key element, then it is our duty to voice concern where we see these values being violated and these rights denied to others in third countries.
The huge problem involving people who are, to this day, considered outcastes and therefore 'untouchable' is disturbing.
The social segregation experienced by Dalits can be likened to Apartheid as it used to be in South Africa.
The largest group of these 'untouchables' live in India, where more than 160 million people are affected.
They are often excluded from basic provisions, such as education, health care and clean drinking water, are not allowed to own land and are regularly at the receiving end of violence and exploitation.
This is why I intend to vote in favour of this resolution which insists on the Indian Government stepping up its efforts in effectively stamping out caste-based discrimination and in promoting equal opportunities.
It is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is making specific proposals in order to counter this structural discrimination against a people.
As the Indian Prime Minister himself said on 27 December 2006: 'Dalits have faced a unique discrimination in our society that is fundamentally different from the problems of minority groups in general. The only parallel to the practice of 'untouchability' was Apartheid in South Africa.'
I hope that the EU will be discussing this in its relations with India and will help stamp out this gross social injustice.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to express my support for the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Gabon, as well as the other similar agreements with other ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific) and with certain other States.
These agreements are based on the principle of reciprocal cooperation and are in line with the partnership approach which is being applied to the external dimension of our common fisheries policy.
By means of these agreements, we achieve a twin objective: firstly, we guarantee that the interests of the Union's deep-sea fishing fleet are protected and, secondly, we improve the conditions with a view to achieving sustainable fisheries in the waters of the partner countries.
In this regard, I would like to end by stressing that the Union and our deep-sea fishing fleet, in contrast to others that operate illegally - has committed itself to ensuring that world fishing activities are sustainable and has accepted the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.
We must support this and other agreements, because they promote the development of our partner countries.
in writing. (PT) The new Partnership Agreement with the Gabonese Republic, which entered into force on 3 December 2005, is valid for six years and contains a protocol that will lead to a 40% reduction in the fishing opportunities available to the various fleets of the EU Member States operating in these waters, including the Portuguese fleet.
Furthermore, in common with other tuna fishing agreements, fees for ship-owners have increased from 25% to 35% of the total cost, obviously with the reduction in the Community contribution.
What may now happen is low uptake of the opportunities offered by the agreements, and the scrapping of many long-distance fishing vessels, which is already happening in Portugal.
This situation leads us to question the actual impact of these agreements, the costs of which to the fleets are rising while fishing opportunities are falling.
It is alarming, not least for the Portuguese fleet, that this agreement will undermine the proportionality and the relative stability of the previous one in terms of the distribution of fishing opportunities with other fleets.
Portugal is to lose 50% of the fishing opportunities for surface longliners, with only three licences as opposed to the six under the previous agreement.
I support this report amending the Fisheries Partnership Agreement.
I particularly support the call for greater parliamentary involvement prior to any extension of the agreement.
I am also glad that the development needs of coastal populations are addressed.
(NL) Mr President, I have, needless to say, voted in favour of the resolution on a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, because I am a staunch opponent of capital punishment, not least at a personal level.
I do want to make myself absolutely clear though.
I may be opposed to capital punishment, but I do firmly believe that we should come down hard on crime.
What I am trying to say here is that it is because of the apathy and cowardice on the part of many European governments that, as is the case in my country, serious common law criminals, assassins and child rapists, are systematically given early release, and so it is because of this laxity and this cowardice that people are calling for the reintroduction of capital punishment in Europe.
As an opponent to capital punishment, I can see where these people are coming from, and my view is that proper account should be taken of the complaints lodged by them.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the joint motion for a resolution that was tabled by five political groups and that concerns an initiative in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty.
At a time when the third international congress against the death penalty is being held in Paris, it made sense for the European Union to restate its convictions and to ask that everything be done to obtain a universal moratorium on executions, with a view to the complete abolition of the death penalty.
I write this with a certain sense of pride in belonging to a Member State that, on the proposal of its President, the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, and thanks to the wisdom of its elected representatives, will shortly be amending its Constitution to include a ban on the death penalty, as is already laid down in law.
I voted in favour of this resolution, because I am opposed to the death penalty, which, in the 21st century, is an appalling example of barbarity and a violation of human dignity.
This state of affairs cannot be allowed to go on.
I therefore agree with the proposal to call for a universal moratorium on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly.
I did not sign the draft joint resolution, tabled by several political groups, on a global moratorium on the death penalty, nor do I intend to vote in its favour.
I fully endorse the undertakings Poland entered into under international law on joining the Council of Europe and the European Union, but I do not consider that the abolition of the death penalty in other parts of the world is a solution to the problem of violence and brutality.
I believe it is right to condemn the abuse of capital punishment and its barbaric implementation, as was the case at the execution of Saddam Hussein and of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti.
Nonetheless, the total abolition of the death penalty for criminals, terrorists and bloodthirsty dictators in the most unstable and violent parts of the world is an irresponsible, nonsensical and harmful proposal.
As it seeks to achieve the introduction of this global moratorium, the European Union is unable to offer countries ravaged by violence any significant aid in the area of public security.
Consequently, the Italian Government's initiative, which is to receive the European Union's support today, may also be deemed hypocritical.
The EU has as part of its requirements for membership for Member States that they do not exercise or have on their statute books the death penalty.
It is only right that we try to promote this around the globe.
It is a disgrace from the US to China, from Central Asia to Central Africa.
The problem is that we exhibit a degree of hypocrisy when some executions are more acceptable than others.
It is just as wrong to execute Saddam Hussein and Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma Bomber, as Ken Sara-Wiwo, the Nigerian human rights activist, or the hundreds of victims of Saddam Hussein's brutal, totalitarian regime.
I can only hope that in future we oppose those barbaric public spectacles in the same way we oppose China's executions, as now modern technology allows public executions to be replaced by execution broadcast via mobile phone.
I did not sign the draft joint resolution, tabled by several political groups, on a global moratorium on the death penalty, nor do I intend to vote in its favour.
I fully endorse the undertakings Poland entered into under international law on joining the Council of Europe and the European Union, but I do not consider that the abolition of the death penalty in other parts of the world is a solution to the problem of violence and brutality.
I believe it is right to condemn the abuse of capital punishment and its barbaric implementation, as was the case at the execution of Saddam Hussein and of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti.

As it seeks to achieve the introduction of this global moratorium, the European Union is unable to offer countries ravaged by violence any significant aid in the area of public security.
Consequently, the Italian Government's initiative, which is to receive the European Union's support today, may also be deemed hypocritical.
Fundamental human rights are a core part of the European Union's role and identity.
As an institution of the EU, the European Parliament has a duty to support efforts to spread these values outside of the borders of the Union.
Supporting the moratorium on the death penalty sends out the message that certain human rights should be upheld universally.
I particularly support the reference in the resolution to the disgraceful manner in which the execution of Saddam Hussein was carried out.
in writing. - (FR) Of course, there is France with its judicial imbroglios; yes, there is Iraq, where those charged with judging the Head of State turned up astride the missiles of the invaders; and, naturally, there is China, where everything is up for sale, even bullets for people to blow their brains out with. Then there is Libya and the case of the Bulgarian nurses.
In the 21st century, where, increasingly, the issues are wilfully confused, the death penalty is now carried out in French hospitals, where the old are finished off in order to free up beds and balance the accounts.
It is carried out in the Europe of Maastricht where, by pulling the plug on vital investment, we have killed off our future.
The ideological scourge of the Reverend Malthus - of zero growth and sustainable underdevelopment - has infected our decision-makers.
There would seem not to be enough room at the banqueting table of the human race.
So we leave the old to the mercy of heatwaves and lethal injections, and we retire folk early and reduce their working hours. Tax law exerts its stranglehold, labour law may leave no room to breathe and budgetary law short-changes us.
Meanwhile, at the top of this ladder of Malthusian penalties, criminal law tops off this society of ours with the culture of death. In the Malthusian economy, the 'euthanazi state', the 'precautionary principle' and the ultimate penalty of execution are the bedfellows of pride and complacency.
in writing. - (FR) There is a long list of countries that permit the death penalty, and the list of victims is longer still.
In 2005 alone, 2 148 people were executed.
So what about Europe?
Is it possible to be a European state and, at the same time, to permit the death penalty?
No, it emphatically is not.
Moreover, countries that are candidates for accession to the European Union are actually obliged to abolish it.
We MEPs even think that there is a need to go further than that.
That is the objective of the resolution against the death penalty, adopted today by Parliament.
With the predictable exception of the extreme right, all the political groups in Parliament had already signed the declaration in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty with a view to its universal abolition.
The majority required for the adoption of the resolution has been obtained, constituting an unusual consensus in Parliament.
This majority makes it clear that being a Member of the EU is not only about agreeing to fishing quotas.
Above all, it makes it clear that Europe does not compromise on its basic values.
Europe is at the forefront of the fight to abolish the death penalty, a fact worth pointing out.
I did not sign the draft joint resolution, tabled by several political groups, on a global moratorium on the death penalty, nor do I intend to vote in its favour.
I fully endorse the undertakings Poland entered into under international law on joining the Council of Europe and the European Union, but I do not consider that the abolition of the death penalty in other parts of the world is a solution to the problem of violence and brutality.
I believe it is right to condemn the abuse of capital punishment and its barbaric implementation, as was the case at the execution of Saddam Hussein and of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti.

Consequently, the Italian Government's initiative, which is to receive the European Union's support today, may also be deemed hypocritical.
(SV) Mr President, Mrs Ries's report and the fight against obesity make serious inroads into issues that I think come within the competence of the Member States.
Moreover, the report addresses issues with which politicians ought not to concern themselves at all.
In my view, the individual's perspective is entirely missing.
To state that obesity is a chronic disease is not only mistaken, it is to accept responsibility for people who are overweight or, worse still, to deprive a great many overweight people of the hope of being able to influence their own situation.
Being overweight can, in fact, be a symptom of a chronic disease, but to assert anything more is to create the stigma that the report maintains it wants to do away with.
What, in my view, is most serious, however, is something quite different: namely, the desire to steer the media in a direction that, in the present situation, is opportunistic.
That is unacceptable, and it is not what politicians should be doing.
It amazes me that so many of my fellow Members from Sweden have voted in favour of this report.
We Swedish Conservatives obviously voted against the report.
in writing. (SV) We do not believe that the assessment of what may be referred to as chronic obesity is a political issue.
That needs to be a task for medical science.
We therefore abstained in the vote on this issue.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow Member, Mrs Ries, on a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases.
The number of people in Europe who suffer from obesity has increased spectacularly over the last 30 years.
This development is comparable to what happened in the United States during the 1990s: today, in Europe, 27% of men and 38% of women are classed as overweight or obese.
The European Parliament's proposals are based on healthy eating, physical activity and treatment from childhood and throughout adulthood.
Health professionals, sport, the quality of agricultural produce, school canteens, education, communication and nutritional labelling are all factors, among others, on which the European Union must rely in order to fight this scourge.
It is very important for the European Commission to carry out a socioeconomic study into the consequences of diseases linked to a person's being overweight, not only at the level of health care spending, which we know represents between 4% and 7% of total spending, but also at the level of employment: unemployment, lost time and invalidity.
Earlier this week I called on the Irish Government to bring forward proposals which will have the effect of totally banning television adverts of food and drink products that are high in fat, salt and sugar and which specifically target children under the age of 16.
Child obesity is a serious problem in Ireland and in Europe and this problem must be effectively tackled head-on.
A ban such as that to which I am referring is being introduced in Britain after four years of extensive research and consultation.
This research included 2000 interviews with children, parents and teachers as well as details of family eating habits drawn from a panel of 11 000 people.
This research clearly found that television advertising does have an effect on the dietary preferences of children.
It is estimated by the British Government that in households where children's viewing includes a large number of programmes targeted at adults as well as at children and young people, children would see 41% fewer adverts of food and drink products that are high in fat, salt and sugar.
We are talking about the protection of our children, and that must be our overriding interest at all times.
in writing. (SV) Public health issues are very important, and people with health problems need all the support they can get.
In our opinion, this resolution oversteps the limits of subsidiarity, however.
The issues concerned should instead be dealt with at national and regional levels, which is why we chose to abstain in the vote.
I voted in favour of this report, because the fight against obesity should be a political priority for the EU. After all, 27% of men and 38% of women in Europe are overweight.
More worrying still is child obesity.
More than 5 million children (in the EU-25) are obese and around 300 000 new cases come to light every year.
This is a trend that, as a matter of urgency, must be reversed.
I endorse most of the measures proposed, for example informing consumers from childhood; restrictions on television advertising; nutrition and health claims on food labelling; and greater consistency between the common agricultural policy and health policies.
We welcome the adoption of this report, which, among other points, includes the following key issues: the recognition that promoting a healthy diet and physical activity should be a political priority for the Member States and the EU as a vital component in the fight against obesity, and the recommendation that obesity be officially recognised as a chronic disease.
Obesity is the most common form of malnutrition and arises from an excessive storage of fat.
It is associated with progressive debilitating diseases and constitutes a greater risk of death rate among the rest of the population.
As such it is a growing public health problem.
As the report says, according to data from 2006, more than 300 million people around the world are obese, a figure that has more than doubled in the last 15 years.
Accordingly, in addition to boosting the fight against the disease in terms of providing patients access to healthcare, medicine, psychological advice, and so forth, a prevention strategy must be adopted that involves promoting healthy diet and lifestyles, with particular focus on women and children because, as studies have shown, they are particularly vulnerable to this disease.
Everything that we try to do on the environment and health fronts is aimed at protecting health.
Responsibility for this rests with the Member States, and that is where it must remain.
The idea of prevention is becoming ever more prominent.
The Ries report describes the health risks involved in obesity, excess weight and chronic illness.
Why is it that our children are overweight?
What are the causes?
These issues need to be discussed in order to raise awareness, particularly in families.
The ability to keep our bodies healthy on a day-to-day basis is something that must be communicated through school and general education.
Preventing these illnesses will, of necessity, involve social changes, but that will be accomplished not merely through bans on advertising, providing information relating to health and giving children sports bags when they start primary school.
We live in a fast-living society; when both parents work, time for the family, for bringing up children and for cooking is often lacking.
This makes it ever more important that society should take preventive action, and schools and educational facilities must be entrusted with the communication of day-to-day life skills.
Even so, we must not stop reminding families of those tasks and duties that are inherently their own, and empower them to perform and fulfil them.
Not even the EU can make people be slim and enjoy life and health.
The Member States must produce action plans and measures, but people have to put them into practice themselves.
in writing. - (FR) It is to its credit that, in order to combat excessive weight, obesity and chronic diseases, the European Commission is concerned that everyone should have a healthy diet and engage in physical activity.
The marathon motion for a resolution, with its 18 recitals and 53 paragraphs, produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is, however, unacceptable inasmuch as it proposes provisions recommending dubious interference in the competences of the Member States, partly in the form of a Community legislative framework.
I do of course sympathise with the warning that we wish to sound, faced with the epidemic of obesity affecting three million children and between 20% and 30% of adults at a time when 14 million children and half the adult population are overweight.
In the fight to promote healthy eating habits and the use of high-quality products, we have high-calibre allies in the form of the Eurochefs - an association bringing together 4 000 cooks from 17 Member States who stick to a code of honour, championing the intrinsic quality of food and acting to safeguard rural products.
I believe that we should do well to benefit from their knowledge and their readiness to promote best practices ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
I strongly support this report as well as the Commission Green Paper entitled 'Promoting healthy diets and physical activity: a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases', which the report addresses.
Public health issues are of increasing concern in Europe, and this report provides a welcome contribution.
The report's emphasis on the key role played by schools is to be welcomed, as is the call for action to be taken to address the alarming decline in the nutritional value of fruit and vegetables.
in writing. (DE) The fact of the matter is that we all know what is healthy and what is not, even without labels prescribed by the EU, yet our eating and living habits have changed to such a degree that obesity, with all its consequences for our health, has assumed disturbing proportions.
However, the combination of lack of movement, poor nutrition and too much television also makes people more aggressive.
Various action plans on health have been running for some time, and it is only right that they should start in children's early school years, since it is then that the risk of compulsive over-eating is very great, but nutritional certificates, health-oriented playgroups and even bans on advertising will not get us where we want to be.
It is in the family that the love of sport, which is so important in reducing stress and aggression, and healthy eating habits, must be experienced and encouraged.
Yet it is this, the fundamental building block of our society, that is under constant bombardment from the modern working world, with its flexible working hours, weekend and shift working patterns, and the constantly-renewed call for longer opening times.
When people are tired to the point of exhaustion from a long working day, it is easier for them to grab fast food than to make the effort to cook; they find themselves wanting to flake out in front of the television with crisps and a fizzy drink, and their children imitate their behaviour.
While preaching that people should exercise more, we reduce sports lessons on budgetary grounds or excuse foreign children from them on religious grounds, and sports clubs see their support ebbing away.
I support the report by Mrs Ries on promoting healthy diets and physical activity.
I agree the fight against childhood obesity should be a political priority of the European Union and its Member States.
We should take urgent steps to encourage children to enjoy a healthy lifestyle and to urge Member States to increase the amount of physical education available in schools.
I am glad to see the report recognises the importance and potential of food signposting systems in place in several Member States.
I welcome calls to the Commission to research and develop a scientifically based EU-wide 'front-of-pack nutrition labelling scheme'.
I feel this is a straightforward but very effective way of encouraging people to choose healthier options.
We must act urgently in informing people that their health and that of future generations is in their own hands.
Long-term bad eating habits and a lack of sufficient exercise result in thousands of people in the European Union being faced with obesity every year.
This increases the risk of numerous serious diseases, including heart diseases, higher blood pressure and respiratory disorders.
Not only does this affect public health, it also increases the cost to health insurers in the Member States.
I would therefore argue in favour of an integrated way of addressing the problem.
Providing information, as well as educating, consumers, exchanging best practices among Member States, clear labelling on foodstuffs or campaigns in schools in order to promote healthier life styles: these are all ways of bringing about the necessary behavioural changes.
The battle against the bulge transcends borders.
We in Europe can make a positive contribution and learn from each other's ways of addressing the problem.
Cooperation with the Member States, industry, the media, education and civil society strikes me as being the right way.
in writing. (SV) There is no doubt that obesity and excessive weight are a major public health problem in Europe too, and one that must figure high on our agenda.
It ought not, however, to be regarded, as it is in the report, as a chronic disease.
It is also important that school children be given opportunities for sports education and for physical activity during breaks.
However, it is for each Member State to determine what priority to give to this issue.
In view of the principle of subsidiarity, it cannot be transferred to EU level.
I have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mrs Wallis, which contains a range of recommendations on limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents.
As part of the construction of our European area, we should do everything we can to make our fellow citizens' lives easier.
This applies to the timeframes for harmonising limitation periods.
The introduction of the country of origin principle, at least provisionally, is a very interesting idea insofar as it would confer on victims rights with which they are familiar.
This report sends a strong message to the Commission, and demonstrates that Parliament is expecting a legislative proposal that should be preceded by a study into this issue.
As cross-border traffic has increased, so has the number of accidents involving people from other EU Member States.
An inquiry into the effects of the existence of differing limitation periods and in particular into the number of personal injury cases involving citizens in cross-border areas and differing limitation periods may help us understand the situation.
There are limitation periods that vary from as little as 12 months in some countries to 30 years or more in others.
This may lead to injured people having their right to compensation denied because they did not initiate legal proceedings in accordance with the applicable foreign law on limitation.
The most vulnerable members of society are thus at great risk of seeing their rights curtailed.
That includes those who have been most seriously injured or those who for some reason are incapable of protecting their own rights adequately.
It might therefore be appropriate to find a fair and workable solution that helps the victims and their representatives without insurance costs becoming prohibitive and without undermining the principle of subsidiarity, or that of seeking countries in which the costs to insurers is lower, as may happen when the country of origin principle is applied to them.
I have voted in favour of the proposals on limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents.
I believe it is essential that Europe's citizens can enjoy the freedom to travel in the European Union, and be safe in the knowledge that should problems arise they will not face unnecessary constraints in getting proper legal redress across borders.
This report will play a part in ensuring that.
It calls for the European Commission to carry out an inquiry into the effects of the existence of differing limitation periods on the internal market, and particularly on citizens exercising their freedoms under the Treaty.
It is important that any new legislation in this area is based on sound evidence, not least to ensure that any future law brings forward specific and focused measures to tackle the problems.
I have therefore voted in favour of the Wallis report, which demands that the Commission bring forward the evidence to enable this law to go ahead.
(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what struck me in the report was the emphasis on the fact that women achieve significantly fewer academic qualifications than men.
Only 15% of full professors are women, whereas the number of women graduating from university is higher than that of men, at 59% of the total.
The low proportion of women with academic qualifications cannot be put down to discrimination against young women and girls concerning access to education.
There are a number of other factors behind this low figure.
If we really want to reverse the trend, it is crucial that we define and analyse these factors, and try to address the matter in a targeted fashion. For example, take the need to eliminate stereotypes in organisational hierarchies.
Women are very much welcomed and accepted as members of research teams.
Their capabilities are less trusted, however, when it comes to being team leaders.
Yet it is precisely these positions which enable and allow the formation of scientific schools and contribute to the development of various disciplines and specialisations in university faculties.
Declaring from time to time that the number of women in academia should be increased is all very well, but it falls a long way short of what is required.
What we need to do is to define the conditions of the process carefully and to work on optimising them in such a way that women become more involved.
Thank you.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs FlasarovÃ¡ on educational discrimination against young women and girls.
The current situation, in which fewer women than men obtain post-graduate level qualifications and go on to pursue lifelong learning for reasons of gender, is one that we must combat collectively.
Education is one of the essential prerequisites - albeit not the only one - for citizens to enjoy all their other social, economic, cultural and political rights, and to assume all their duties as citizens.
I have high hopes for the activities of the future Institute for Gender Equality.
It is also essential to fight against the discrimination with which women, and in particular the youngest women, have to contend when they live in communities where gender equality is not respected, by rejecting all forms of cultural and religious relativism which could violate women's fundamental rights.
Young girls, as well as boys, should have access to compulsory schooling.
As the rapporteur says, although there has for a long time been evidence to show that young women and girls are no less capable than men and boys when it comes to education, there is a series of factors that continues to place them at a disadvantage, especially in higher education and lifelong learning.
In 2004, eight out of ten girls studying in higher education in the EU Member States completed their studies.
This figure is higher than that for boys, of whom only three out of four completed their studies, which proves that girls are no less motivated or capable when it comes to education.
Yet the proportion of girls who took their studies further or embarked on an academic career is lower.
Although women outnumber men in university education 59% to 41%, only 43% of PhD graduates and only 15% of full university professors are women.
These figures demonstrate the major inequality between the sexes in terms of lifelong learning and in the continuing vocational education of women outside the academic world, thereby confirming that both phenomena are rooted in the continued inequality between the sexes, which can clearly be seen in pay discrimination.
I voted in favour of this report as it seeks to address the inequalities for women which still persist, mainly in gaining access to and obtaining higher academic qualifications, including at postgraduate level and in scientific research, and in the area of lifelong learning.
There is a need to reform the content of school textbooks and to ensure that the training of educational workers be directed towards fulfilling the requirements of a balanced gender policy.
I think it is important that the Commission and the Member States implement a policy towards national, ethnic and cultural minorities, paying particular attention to a multicultural approach and allowing access to quality education in order to avoid double discrimination.
I voted in favour of this report as it has the potential to eliminate stereotypes discriminating against women in the workplace.
in writing. - (FR) The progress made when it comes to equality between men and women in the field of education is mainly quantitative.
From now on, we need to fight for a qualitative improvement and for a change in attitudes, paying particular attention to the situation of girls and young women, who are the victims of two-fold discrimination.
I therefore voted in favour of the report by Mrs FlasarovÃ¡, which recommends to the Commission and the Member States that they put in place a policy targeted at national, ethnic and cultural minorities, ensuring in particular that a multicultural approach is adopted and permitting access to high-quality education, and this with a view to preventing two-fold discrimination.
The report also asks the Member States to make the option of lifelong education available to women and men who choose to look after their children and to make it easier for women to obtain jobs involving responsibility and decision-making.
Finally, the Member States and the Commission should use all the means available to them to eliminate the stereotypes that contribute to discrimination against women in the workplace.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by United Kingdom MEP Mr Deva on EU relations with the Pacific Islands, calling for a strategy for a strengthened partnership.
The EU has a significant presence in the Pacific Islands, against a backdrop of the majority of island states in the Pacific having recently gained their independence.
The policy of helping the poorest island countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals is a decent and legitimate ambition for the EU.
Whether we are talking about issues such as fisheries, the problem of climate change, the protection of biodiversity, farming and tourism, providing funding for infrastructure, support for education, the fight against corruption, support for democracy in the parliaments of these countries and the use of the euro, there are many areas in which the presence of the EU can bring unquestionable added value, but much remains to be done.
in writing. - (FR) After 30 years of EU-Pacific cooperation, it is now time to move up a gear.
That is why I am delighted about the adoption of this 'strategy for a strengthened partnership'.
It entails a strengthening of political dialogue inasmuch as we have to support our Pacific partners in their efforts to overcome ethnic tensions, as in Fiji, or to promote reconciliation after a civil war, as in the Solomon Islands or in Timor Leste.
Over the next few years, this political dialogue must also enable us to face a major challenge together: that of global warming.
In order to launch this enhanced political dialogue, we can join with our regional partners in organising the 'regional conferences' provided for by the new Cotonou Agreement.
The strategy involves common responses to the economic and social problems of the region and, here too, the priority is to attain the Millennium Development Goals within the timescales set.
The ongoing negotiations on the conclusion of an EU-Pacific regional partnership agreement appear to have got off to a bad start in this respect.
Most of the proposals of the countries in the region have been rejected by the Commission.
It would be paradoxical to vote today in favour of a strategy for a strengthened partnership aimed at development only to find that, tomorrow, the conclusion of a bad economic partnership agreement emptied it of all content.
I voted in favour of this report and welcome the fact that it calls for the banning of nuclear tests and that the Pacific region should be made nuclear-free.
In view of the fact that some EU Member States have a historical relationship and continued links with this region, either in political or in cultural and economic terms, the EU as a whole should strengthen these ties for the mutual benefit of both the countries in the region and EU Member States.
Given the heterogeneity of the region, the dispersal of its communities and the specific problems arising from the insular nature of many of the countries in the region, there needs to be a European approach that is both flexible and balanced, with Europe already one of the biggest international donors.
Coming from Portugal as I do, I can only welcome the rapporteur's calls for the Commission to set up programmes aimed at combating malaria in East Timor.
I feel, though, that this call should be extended to other infectious and contagious diseases that are also devastating the country.
I also welcome the attention drawn to the particular problems of Timor and endorse the call for the Commission to support the Timorese leaders in their efforts to build a democratic, stable, peaceful, free, prosperous and fair society.
in writing. - (FR) In the Pacific Ocean, fishing constitutes a vital resource for the local economies, and ships from all over the world, and in particular from Europe, operate there.
That is the justification for consulting the Committee on Fisheries, of which I am a member, on this report.
The Committee on Development and its rapporteur sought to impose this report on us in October, with no possibility of its being amended, and its request was rejected.
The Committee on Fisheries has therefore been able to propose improvements to the report in the form of better regional cooperation and, above all, the inclusion of overseas countries and territories.
The opinion of the Committee on Fisheries was adopted unanimously by its members in November.
What now happens is that, on the eve of the debate in plenary, we are told that our opinion will not in the end be included and that only a few arbitrarily selected aspects of our opinion will be proposed as new amendments.
In view of our indignation, it was decided to add our opinion to the final report as an 'erratum/addendum', without a vote, which is scarcely any better.
The strategy in question was designed, in particular, to strengthen the political dialogue between the EU and the Pacific islands.
More dialogue between our parliamentary committees, which are not, for their part, separated by thousands of kilometres, would certainly be just as desirable.
in writing. (SV) If a new company statute is to be established at European level, it is important for existing legislation in the Member States on workers' influence, codecision and representation on boards not to be impaired.
Of the amendments tabled prior to the vote, we have therefore chosen to support those by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, because they are better than the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr Lehne, which sends a very important message to the Commission on the need to provide entrepreneurs with a means of ensuring the functioning and development of their businesses in the internal market.
Like Mr Lehne, I feel that the time has come to enact laws to set up the European Private Company as a reliable legal form for small and medium-sized undertakings (SMEs) engaged in cross-border business.
It is not possible, on a sustainable basis, to try to construct the internal market without simplifying life for SMEs that want to develop.
The report contains some very interesting proposals, for example to allow SMEs with capital of EUR 10 000 to have a single entity that can develop in all European countries without having to register in each Member State, and whereby one single set of European rules is observed, rather than various national regulations.
Naturally, workers' rights are not affected by these proposals, which deal solely with the European Private Company.
I voted in favour of this report as the public hearing held in the Committee on Legal Affairs on 22 June 2006 underscored the need for an European Private Company as a legal form for small and medium-sized undertakings engaged in cross-border business.
In order to consolidate the single market and thereby achieve the desired improvement in the economic and social conditions in the Community, one clear priority is the elimination of barriers to trade.

Order of business
The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 8 February 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated.
It has been requested that the draft be amended as follows:
- Tuesday:
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the report by Mr Lehne on the exercise of certain rights attached to voting shares, which was to have been voted on in accordance with Rule 131, be debated and put on the agenda for Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is repeatedly made clear to us by the various discussions in the media that this is an important subject; it is one that we should not simply let pass on the nod, and I hope that the rapporteur, too, can agree with us on that.
As you mentioned, there are two possibilities: Thursday afternoon might well be one of them, but, as there are - or so I gather - fewer Members pressing to speak on Thursday morning, that might be another option, and then the vote could be held at Thursday lunchtime.
Both are workable options.
We would prefer Thursday morning, but have no objection to the afternoon.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not, of course, have any objection to this subject being debated; I am happy to see one.
I would only ask, though, that the vote on it should be held this week, since the committees have come to an amicable agreement on this and the Council intends to agree to whatever we adopt in this House relatively rapidly and promptly.
If we are to take this legislative report on Thursday afternoon, it would probably not be advisable to vote on it at the same time, and hence my request that the debate be scheduled either on Thursday morning or on Wednesday evening, since there are windows left on both days.
If we do that, we could vote on Thursday at midday.
(DE) Mr President, yes, of course, we can have the vote on Thursday afternoon.
There is a reason why I find Wednesday problematic, and it is that I gather that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would like to have Darfur put on the agenda, the plan being, I believe, for this to be discussed on Wednesday evening, but we would like to have the Gahler report moved to Wednesday, on the grounds that a large number of Members have indicated their desire to speak to the reports by Mrs Batzeli, Mr Goepel and Mrs Hall, so we are not going to manage with the time available.
We would be very satisfied if it were possible to discuss Mr Lehne's report on Thursday morning and to vote on it at noon.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has asked that Mr Gahler's report on budget aid to developing countries be moved to Wednesday evening.
Mr Swoboda has the floor in order to explain why.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, as I have just explained, I am working on the assumption that Darfur - which also has to do with development issues - is going to be debated on Wednesday evening.
We would like the Gahler report to be debated that evening as well.
We have informed our group of this, but I do not know whether the rapporteur is aware of this or whether he can manage that time.
The fact is that we will be having a lot of speakers to the other reports, particularly to Mrs Batzeli's, wine being such an important subject, especially in terms of Europe's agricultural development, and so, if that were possible, we would be very much in favour of it.
Mr Gahler has indicated his agreement, and so the formal requirement has been met.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
- Wednesday:
The Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Liberals have requested the inclusion of statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Darfur, with a debate to be concluded by motions for a resolution.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to speak briefly in support of this motion from the PPE-DE Group and the ALDE Group.
Darfur should be a priority debate in Parliament this week and we believe it would be a missed opportunity to delay that debate and resolution until next month.
What continues to happen in Darfur is an international scandal in humanitarian terms.
The Council has today released its conclusions on Sudan and the UN Human Rights Council is trying to get an assessment mission into Darfur as we speak, so the international focus is on Darfur right now.
This Parliament should also be having its say.
That is why the PPE-DE Group and, I believe, the ALDE Group are so insistent on a debate as well as a resolution this week.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, needless to say, the Social Democrats wholeheartedly endorse the request for a debate on Darfur, since the emergency situation is critical and violations persist.
The problem is extensive, and we - the European Union, its Member States, and the European Council - have an important part to play in this.
That is why it is important that we have this debate.
The problem, though, is vast, and our fellow Member was right to point that out.
He made a valid point when he asked the Council and Commission to make a statement.
As I understand it, we have to hold a debate on Wednesday evening, and neither the Council nor the Commission will be present or provide a statement.
We will be thrashing things out among ourselves, and that will, of course, be very unfortunate.
Whilst I, on behalf of the Social Democrats, wholeheartedly support the request, I very much hope that we can also have a serious debate involving the Council and Commission.
That is, after all, what gives our debate real substance and political meaning.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
Mr President, may I enquire why you have not made use of Rule 156 of the Rules of Procedure in relation to the reports from the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners?
Given the extraordinarily large number of amendments tabled, it would be appropriate to make use of a rule that was tailor-made for this sort of situation.
Rule 156 was added to the Rules of Procedure in the reform three years ago in order to provide a filter when we are faced with a very long voting time.
This would enable the committee concerned to vote and to see which amendments have a sufficient degree of support to merit this House's time being used up in voting on them.
All those amendments that have almost no support would be filtered out and save the rest of us an enormous amount of time.
Mr Corbett, this matter was discussed in the Conference of Presidents last week and the majority was against using that procedure.
In that case, Mr President, I just wonder when on earth we would ever make use of that rule.
It was added to the Rules precisely to save the time of this House in this sort of situation.
I must express my surprise at the decision of the Conference of Presidents.
You have every right to express your surprise at this decision.
There are two aspects: first, the majority in the Conference of Presidents; and then, regardless of that majority, the fact that the President can take a decision one way or the other.
This is a further aspect of the question and one which will certainly be considered in greater depth in future in the light of your remarks.
(FR) Mr President, if my memory serves me correctly, the Conference of Presidents objected to the report being referred to committee.
However, if I have correctly understood what Mr Corbett just said, this is a different matter.
If I have understood him correctly, he is proposing not to submit to the vote amendments that received an extremely low number of votes in committee, which is a different matter.
I do not believe that we spoke of this aspect in the Conference of Presidents.
OK, but even that would require a meeting of the committee responsible.
(FR) Mr President, I understood what Mr Corbett was proposing, and that was for the committee to meet tomorrow evening in order to sift through the 180 amendments, so as not to submit in plenary those that did not receive at least 10% of the votes in committee.
If I have understood him correctly, Mr Corbett feels that this requires a meeting to be held in committee tomorrow evening.
The problem is that his committee ceased to exist at the end of January.
Now, if I am not a complete fool, we are in February, and the mandate given to the committee by Parliament expired at the end of January.
Therefore, I should like Mr Corbett to explain to me how a committee can vote on things that no longer exist.
In theory, we would need to reinstate this committee, which could then meet tomorrow evening, and sift through the amendments.
I really do not care; I am simply saying to you that this is the problem.
Mr President, I think the answer is easy: Rule 156 gives complete discretion to the President of our House.
If he chooses to reconvene the committee at a special meeting tomorrow to filter the amendments so that we here only need to vote on those that get more than 10% support, then he is free to do so under Rule 156.
Rule 156 gives the President enormous power in this respect, even if the Conference of Presidents disagrees with him.
That is, in principle, the case, but the President does of course regard the consent of the majority in this House as important, especially when dealing with such thorny issues, and that is why the Conference of Presidents ended up, in agreement with him, deciding as it has done.
I think the vast majority of us would like to vote on Wednesday, and that is the idea behind the whole discussion.
For the future we will go deeper into the discussion and keep in contact with everybody who might have remarks to make.
(The agenda was therefore adopted.)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
We now come to the one-minute speeches on important political issues.
(MT) Mr President, last week the European cruise industry organised a one-day conference in Brussels for all the stakeholders in the industry.
During this conference a report was presented concerning the extremely important contribution that this industry has to make to Europe.
Amongst other things, it was announced that the cruise industry is responsible for providing around 190 000 jobs within Europe.
I believe, Mr President, that this Parliament ought to recognise the importance of this industry, and, consequently, the European Union must do its utmost to pay greater attention to it and place it within the policies it develops.
Thank you.
(EL) Mr President, the Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was murdered recently by extreme nationalists in Istanbul.
The constant threats against his life forced the writer Orhan Pamouk to leave Turkey and take refuge in the United States of America.
The unchecked activities of extremists and the worrying increase in nationalism are not just an internal problem for Turkey; they are a matter for every European democrat.
It is a question of solidarity with the democratic movement in Turkey which is fighting under difficult conditions for an area of freedom of expression and dignity.
Rhetorical declarations of sympathy are no longer enough.
Collective initiatives and action are needed on the part of the European Union and, in particular, on the part of the European Parliament.
Initiatives must be taken immediately towards the Turkish Government by you, Mr President, and by all the political groups.
I therefore propose that plenary should adopt a motion for a resolution as a first specific step in the condemnation of the nationalism and terrorism threatening the weak democratic fabric in Turkish society.
(LT) Mr President, 16 February is the day that Lithuania celebrates the Restoration of Statehood; however, in the calendar produced for the Members of the European Parliament, it is indicated that we celebrate our National Day not on 16 February, but on 1 February.
Furthermore, in this calendar the dates of four of my country's public holidays are mixed up.
Just imagine: the calendar states that St John's Day, which all of the Christian world celebrates on 24 June, is celebrated in Lithuania on 1 June.
This is absurd, total carelessness on the part of parliamentary staff.
I understand, Mr President, that you were not responsible for these mistakes at the time; nonetheless, I would prefer that, in future, you and other managers of Parliament do not allow such errors to occur.
The purpose of these calendars is to enable us to get to know our colleagues from other countries better, including their public holidays.
But in regard to Lithuania, the calendar is a total collection of errors.
We will check that and get the right date put in, namely 16 February.
The twenty-fourth day of June is the Feast of St John the Baptist.
(PL) Mr President, the events of the last few days have shown once again what the meat dispute between Russia and Poland is really about.
It is political and it is about, on the one hand, an attempt by Russia to punish Poland for the independent and democratic direction of Poland's political changes and the withdrawal from Russian influence, and on the other it is a test of the unity of the European Union and an attempt to undermine its solidarity.
The Russian political elite is watching carefully to see whether or not the European Union will unite to stand behind one of its members.
I am convinced that the time for the European Union to grasp the nettle, to state its position and to deploy effective instruments to resolve this dispute is long overdue.
All previous attempts have been fruitless.
The only solution is to raise the issue in no uncertain terms and to show Russia that it has to deal with the might of the entire European Union.
(DA) Mr President, last Friday, something happened that ought not to have happened.
Contrary to the EU's nature protection directives, the Polish authorities gave permission for the Via Baltica road to be built.
The plan is for it to go right through a Natura 2000 area in one of Europe's genuinely unique areas of natural beauty.
This happened in spite of the fact that, back in December, the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Poland.
Now, the green light has been given for contractors to begin felling 20 000 trees this week.
It is scandalous that the authorities of an EU country should be consciously infringing EU legislation.
It is not only appalling for the natural environment, it also in fact undermines legal certainty and the EU's reputation and may become a slippery slope whereby environmental legislation and environmental considerations are set aside as people see fit.
I therefore very much hope that the Commission will live up to its responsibilities, follow up its letter of formal notice as quickly as possible and put a stop to what Poland has set in motion.
(PT) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the victory of the 'yes' vote in yesterday's referendum in Portugal on the decriminalisation of the voluntary termination of pregnancy in the first ten weeks, on the woman's volition.
This result puts an end to all the false obstacles thus far created, including yesterday's referendum, blocking the Portuguese Parliament from exercising its legitimate legal powers on this issue.
The time has now come to make up for years and years of lost time.
I should like to thank all the MEPs from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, who for years have shown solidarity with the struggle of Portuguese women, many of whom suffer the undignified and inhumane experience of being put on trial for abortion.
Yesterday's result is an important victory for Portuguese women and for all those who, like us, have fought for decades for an end to backstreet abortions, for the promotion of women's health and for free, aware and responsible parenthood.
(PL) Mr President, despite the European Union's purported task of establishing a zone of freedom, security and justice, the European media make accusations and persistent attacks against public figures, particularly when they are ideologically inconvenient.
For this reason we are appealing for, and have drawn up a petition asking for media persecution and terrorism to be treated as acts of violence that threaten human rights.
Without any proof, the media have lynch-mobbed a Polish archbishop for the purpose of preventing him from becoming the Metropolitan Bishop of Warsaw.
Similarly, the European media have been pillorying Pope Benedict XVI and have for years been slandering the charismatic monk who created the only truly free radio station in Poland, along with others who oppose the ideas of the logic of disintegration that characterises the new left.
We appeal with the greatest insistence for the values on which the European Union is based, namely human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality, human rights and the right to profess one's religion, to be respected.
Mr President, this is the third time I have taken the opportunity to use a one-minute speech to bring to the attention of this House the fact that another poultry-processing factory in Northern Ireland has closed with a substantial loss of jobs.
It seems to me that we are continuing to lose jobs within the European Union.
We are allowing cheap poultry meat to be imported into the European Union, produced at lower standards than those imposed on our farmers and our processors within the European Union, and putting our own people out of jobs.
In my opinion we are also risking the health of the people of the European Union because this poultry meat imported into the European Union does not meet the same high standards that we expect here.
There is a lot more I could say on this.
It seems that we continue to ignore the dangers of this, and I have to warn this House that we do so at our peril if we put our people, farmers and workers at risk.
The Commission must investigate this and try to put a stop to it.
(FI) Mr President, since the 1960s, 14 people have died in Italy in football riots.
Last week, a policeman with a family was killed in Sicily when spectators threw a bomb at him.
There are problems, however, all over Europe.
It is sad and shameful for Europe that football breeds violence both on and off the pitch.
All those involved in football need to work together to defend the sport's tarnished reputation.
Zero tolerance on racism and violence would seem to be the only way to combat these problems.
Penal measures are not working: we have to come down hard on the clubs in terms of financial penalties, as has now been done.
Suspending matches and playing to empty stadiums will hurt the clubs' pockets.
This way, they will not be able to neglect their responsibility to improve security for long.
This way, the clubs will also start to show a genuine interest in keeping their supporters under control.
Mr President, today I would like to link two issues together.
First of all, the comments from President Barroso with regard to the holding of referenda on the draft constitution.
His inference was that countries might consider not holding referenda.
Well, coming from a country where a referendum must be held on these issues, I find this extremely puzzling to say the least.
On the one hand we have Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m talking about plan 'D' for democracy and dialogue and debate and engaging our citizens; on the other hand we have the comments from President Barroso.
At the end of the day, are we supposed just to inform and consult and debate and discuss with our citizens, but not to trust them when it comes to voting?
The other issue I wish to highlight is that a bill is currently being debated in the Irish Parliament that would give sweeping and retrospective powers to ministers to create indictable offences in order to comply with European legislation.
In this context, the directly-elected Irish Parliament would be bypassed.
So, on the one hand we are bypassing citizens; on the other hand bypassing national parliaments.
I have to say, as a committed European, I think these are worrying times for the EU.
Mr President, last week the Russian authorities presented new charges against the former Yukos managers, Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, who were already sentenced two years ago on highly questionable grounds.
Many Members of this Parliament have followed with great concern the fate of these two men, who can be classed as political prisoners.
A new sentence will probably mean their moral and political execution.
I suggest that a temporary committee should be set up to investigate politically motivated trials and murders which, unfortunately, are continuing in Russia, despite the concern expressed today.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to raise an issue relating to European policy, which is of the utmost importance: the fight against extremism, which is sadly developing throughout Europe right now.
The democratic parties on the right and left, the Liberals, the Greens - all the parties represented here, in this House - have unanimously declared the need to distance themselves from any form of extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and minority exclusion.
We have managed, in this House, to quarantine-off extremists.
That is a huge achievement.
Ladies and gentlemen, can you imagine the vice-president of the UMP in France or the vice-president of the CDU in Germany taking the floor during a demonstration in which extremists are present and banners with neo-Nazi slogans are brandished, and not distancing himself?
I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that all the parties present in this House should stand back from the extremists on all sides, who are wreaking havoc throughout the countries of Europe.
(ET) Although today is 12 February, I would like to return to the end of January for a moment.
On the evening of 25 January, Galina Kozlova, wife of Vladimir Kozlov, Chairman of the Council of Mari El and 2006 winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, was brutally attacked in Yoshkar-Ola.
Galina Kozlova was brought to the neurosurgery department of Yoshkar-Ola City Hospital with cranial damage and a concussion, as well as damage to her sight resulting from the use of nerve gas in the attack.
In spring 2005, Parliament passed a resolution on the violation of human rights and democracy in the Mari Republic in the Russian Federation.
As you remember, this resolution stated that journalists that are not part of the state-controlled media continue to be attacked, persecuted and disregarded.
In 2001, three journalists were killed, and on 4 February 2005, Vladimir Kozlov himself was seriously beaten.
I regret, Mr President and esteemed colleagues, that I must inform you that the situation with regard to minorities and human rights in the Mari Republic has not improved since that time.
(PL) Mr President, MEPs are not subject to anybody's orders.
That is what the electoral rules say in our countries.
But what is the situation like on the ground?
We have in recent days been observing infringements of the independence of MEPs.
Parliament has undergone a crisis regarding the election of the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
On the basis of earlier decisions by the CD coalition, this post was awarded to the Polish Member, Mr Saryusz-Wolski.
Since then the Poles have been subjected to disgraceful pressure.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, telephoned the head of the party applying to chair this committee of the European Parliament and asked him to withdraw the nomination.
The ex-chancellor, Helmut Kohl, telephoned a Polish politician for the same reason.
Furthermore, former Austrian Chancellor SchÃŒssel, together with the prime minister of Luxembourg, sent a special letter about this to the EPL fraction.
All of this in an effort to ensure that the European Parliament's foreign policy is conducted by the previous president, the German politician, Mr Brok.
Is that what is called free and unfettered exercise of the duty of an MEP?
I think not, Mr President.
Interference in this matter by the highest authorities in Germany, Austria and Luxembourg is an infringement of the independence of this House, and makes a mockery of democracy.
I ask that the independence of this House be protected in the future.
(DE) Mr President, I would also like to mention the political detainees Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, who have been charged again, on the basis of obscure accusations, in order to prevent their early release, for which Russian law makes provision.
It is by these means that the justice system is continuing its absurd and clearly politically motivated show trial of Yukos' former owners.
Khodorkovsky's commitment to a more democratic Russian society made him an opponent of Putin, and, their major oil group having been broken up, the greater part of the owners' shares are now in the hands of the state.
If Russia disregards basic human rights - and we have just heard of it doing so in Munich too - then that makes it a very problematic partner for the EU.
We in this House should monitor this trial on the ground and protest against such practices.
(SL) On 1 February this year, unidentified persons set fire to a nursery school in Trieste for children from the Slovene minority.
As a result, the children had to be moved to other, temporary premises.
Similar incidents directed against the Slovene minority have taken place in the past, for instance when a Slovene primary school was set on fire.
Despite six years of promises, the building has still not been repaired.
For this reason, Slovene parents fear that the same thing might also happen in this case.
The Slovene minority demands, quite justifiably, that the authorities in Trieste find and punish the arsonists and protect the Slovene minority from similar incidents in the future.
They also expect the children's nursery and school to be repaired as soon as possible.
I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that, despite many recent promises, the Italian authorities are still failing to implement in full the legal protection granted to the Slovene minority.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, Ahtisaari's Kosovo report is complete.
In Munich, President Putin explicitly stated Russia's objectives in the world and in Europe.
The time for waiting is over; now is the time to act.
The EU's help in leading the Western Balkans towards stability will be the moment of truth for the European Union's foreign and security policy.
The best way to solve the Kosovo question is to obtain Serbia's support, and in order to do that we must support the democratic forces in that country.
We must confirm that we support the continued rapprochement between Serbia and the European Union as soon as that may be possible.
We must state which criteria will decide whether the continuation of that process is possible.
The Serbian Government, which is implementing the fundamental values of the European Union - democracy, human rights and the rule of law - must merit our support on their journey towards joining Europe.
Thus we will be able to foil Russia's threat to veto the Kosovo plan in the UN and use Kosovo as a pretext to support separatists in countries that are part of the European Union's neighbourhood policy.
(SV) Mr President, as a former fellow Member stated, a significant referendum took place in Portugal yesterday.
As you are no doubt aware, it was about no longer treating women who terminate a pregnancy up until the tenth week as criminals.
The Portuguese people voted in favour of the proposal.
I wish to congratulate the women of Portugal on having taken this step towards taking charge of their own bodies.
I also wish to thank our Portuguese fellow Members and those parties that have conducted such an objective, serious and informative campaign.
Each Member State is entitled to take its own decisions concerning reproductive rights.
These are matters that each country has to decide for itself.
However, it is extremely important for us to be able to reach across national borders in providing information, putting forward shared opinions and showing solidarity with women.
I hope that Malta, Poland and Ireland will be able to follow Portugal's example.
(SK) On 22 January radio broadcasting by the BBC was discontinued in Slovakia on the grounds that it was broadcast in English, which is not permitted under a notoriously anti-European national language law enacted in 1995.
Under this law, no radio frequency may be allocated to broadcasts in a foreign language.
The termination of BBC broadcasting has caused great disappointment among Slovak citizens, all the more for the fact that the current government has been emphasising the need to improve foreign language education, of which the BBC was a model.
Although the culture ministry too realises how absurd such regulations are, it is planning to impose stricter controls and sanctions, rather than coming up with a positive solution.
The free movement of services is one of the basic principles of the European Union, and information dissemination cannot be made conditional upon the language in which the information is conveyed.
This case proves that the language law in question does not comply with the principles of cultural and linguistic diversity or the values of the European Union.
Mr President, I wish to raise the event last week in Paris where the International Treaty to outlaw enforced disappearances by governments was opened for signature.
Fifty-seven states signed it and I congratulate them.
I regret that my own country, Ireland, was not among them.
Over 50 000 people have been disappeared by governments over the last 25 years.
Forty thousand of them are still missing and their families do not know if they are dead or alive.
It is astonishing to me that only eight EU Member States signed last week, given that it was agreed last November, following five years of negotiations and a twenty-year campaign.
There are also worrying reports that the United States and some EU Member States are going to refuse to sign this Treaty.
The reason I am raising it here, Mr President, is that I would ask you to have the Commission and the Council clarify in this House that all EU Member States are committed to this Treaty and will sign it without delay.
(HU) The Cuban dictatorship, through the medium of its party newspaper Gramma, accused some new Member States of conspiracy against Havana.
True, the accused states, for example the Czech Republic and Poland, have often raised their voices recently on behalf of Cuban democracy.
However, their efforts can only be crowned with success if the European Union takes a united stand in defence of the island state's democratic forces.
Even in the midst of its own reforms, the EU has to find a way to lend support to those dissenters, inside as well as outside of Cuba, who are raising their voices ever more loudly.
Indeed, the role of Europe in the world will be defined not only by its economic performance but by its commitment, expressed in actions, to the cause of freedom.
Though hundreds are still in prison for political reasons, in my opinion the Fidel Castro brand of socialist dictatorship is already on its last legs.
But for this to herald the advent of democracy, the international community, including the European Union, must stand up unambiguously for fundamental freedoms.
I would like to explain that one factor borne in mind when choosing speakers is who spoke last time.
You may be wondering why one person or another has not been called.
It always, to some small degree, works on the basis that if you got the floor last time, you do not necessarily get given it today, and so the last speaker to be called is Mr Papastamkos, who did not get the chance to speak last time.
(EL) Mr President, five years on from the introduction of the euro, the Union is still not offering equal terms of competition, be it for credit cards or when changing banks by transferring an account to another bank or for other banking transactions.
Consumers throughout Europe are forced to bear unjustifiably high charges.
Also, charges are subject to impressive fluctuations of up to 400% for commercial transactions on credit cards.
According to the Commission, bank charges cost European companies about EUR 25 billion a year.
The message I wish to send the Commission is about whether it intends to exercise all its powers under Community legislation, by which I mean in practice and not just with declarations of a proclamatory nature.
It is high time a single payment area was created.
That concludes this item on the agenda.
Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (debate)
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, we are about to reap the rewards of more than two and a half years of sustained commitment by a huge number of people, both in the Commission and in Parliament, who firmly believe in the added value of the INSPIRE Directive for environmental policy in the European Union.
I know for a fact that this is not the sexiest issue we have ever discussed here, and given the highly technical content, everyone assumed that an agreement at first reading was on the cards.
This was, however, overlooking the fact that some Member States were dead set against any form of harmonisation of spatial environmental information, and that were, above all, also concerned about compensation and licences and saw this initiative as a threat to national monopolies.
No fewer than five Council presidencies had INSPIRE listed as a priority, but it was the Finnish Presidency that managed, during the night of 21 November 2006, to persuade the Member States to end their resistance.
I should also like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking everyone who has done their bit to achieve this success, not least the Commissioner and his staff.
They have done much of the groundwork, in tandem with an international team of experts that has responded with particular enthusiasm, as a result of which no time has been lost.
I should also like to make a point of thanking the shadow rapporteurs and their staff, Parliament's Legal Office, the Secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the conciliation secretariat, the Council presidency and all their staff.
Having discussed the procedure, I should now like to turn to the content.
As you know, INSPIRE seeks to set up an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe in an attempt to assist environmental policy at every level.
Everyone will be agreed that sound policy can only be adopted on the basis of information that is reliable and of the highest quality.
When drafting fresh policy measures, policy makers must allow for the fact that problems that affect today's quality of life have become ever more intertwined and complex.
The areas to which the Sixth Environmental Programme gives attention are this reliable knowledge along with informed participation on the part of the public.
The directive that we hope to approve tomorrow sets down the objectives, and the Member States now have two years to fine-tune their national legislation and administrative procedures.
In other words, by the next European elections, INSPIRE will be a fait accompli and will be based on the existing infrastructure for spatial data of the different Member States.
After all, via a geo-portal, INSPIRE will offer Member States the opportunity of making all geographical databases available as a first step towards harmonisation.
This idea, which everyone obviously welcomes as such, was, however, the cause of heated discussions within some Member States that were anxious to protect their returns on the sale of geographical data, but also with regard to access to information, wanted to impose stricter restrictions than provided for in the Treaty of Aarhus.
It is precisely these two latter challenges that have prevented Parliament from reaching agreement with the Council at second reading.
I should like to repeat to the House that I am delighted that during the conciliation procedure, we managed to ensure that in general, services for searching and consulting spatial information must be made available free of charge.
Only if the conditions are clearly formulated can compensation be applied for so as not to jeopardise the financial viability of some government services.
As for intellectual property rights, Parliament has decided to impose the provisions of the Treaty of Aarhus concerning access to information in environmental matters to the letter and thus not to admit any stricter restrictions on the basis of confidentiality, in line with the Council's request.
I think we have struck an honourable compromise, and I hope that tomorrow, Parliament will be supporting this agreement unanimously so that implementation can really start in the Member States.
I would like to add a brief comment about the scope of applications.
This is virtually inexhaustible once the loopholes have been plugged and inconsistencies between European geographical databases have been resolved, which at the moment, often make planning impossible and, in certain cases, even cause chaos.
The system as it stands is essential to improve and manage the water quality in Europe.
The information collected can also help prevent and control floods.
All in all, I would go so far as to say that INSPIRE is a valuable addition to existing environmental legislation in the European Union, and we will follow its transposition in the Member States from close range and with much interest.
Îember of the Commission.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating you on your election to the office of president; I am sure that you will meet all the expectations of European citizens and of those who elected you.
I shall be very brief.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to the parliamentary delegation involved in the compromise proceedings with the Council on 21 November 2006.
In particular, I should like to thank and congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras, who headed the parliamentary delegation and, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, whom I should like to praise and thank in particular for her exceptional contribution to the discussions throughout the negotiations.
We have secured a sound basis on which to build an integrated infrastructure for spatial information in Europe.
We need this infrastructure for the following reasons:
First of all, good legislative arrangements are based on good information.
Good information means integrated analyses of the environmental problems we face, the reasons for them and the possible repercussions of various solutions.
These analyses depend on geographical data.
At the moment, our policy making is hampered by the fact that these data are scattered over various databases which are difficult to access.
In addition, different data storage rules are used, with the result that it is impossible to combine them with other data, which would facilitate policymaking.
I am delighted that we managed to overcome the final difficulties and reach a satisfactory result.
The Commission approves the text of the compromise unreservedly and I would like to urge Parliament to accept the good result achieved by its negotiating team.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Dimas.
Speaking personally, let me say that I am very appreciative of your good wishes and we will continue to work well together.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first, as a member of the Conciliation Committee, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, and the delegation chairman, Mr Vidal-Quadras, for their excellent work.
The Finnish Presidency also deserves credit for the conciliation process.
The success of the Community's environment policy is largely dependent on the availability of scientific information and the smooth flow of such information.
So this proposal for a directive, which has come about through conciliation, and which will establish a legal framework for establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, is a precondition for scientific evaluations carried out on the basis of environmental legislation.
At various stages of the debate on INSPIRE, the main aim was to remove some of the barriers that in particular hamper the shared use of environmental data among authorities.
In conciliation, general agreement was reached on the principles enabling authorities and other Community bodies to use cartographic and other special data within the scope of this directive and now in the possession of other authorities.
A good end result was also achieved with regard to public access to information.
In the future, a wider range of Internet services relating to the environment will be available.
These services, meant for the general public, will in most cases be free.
It will be permitted to charge for rapidly changing information, such as certain weather information services.
Even before INSPIRE, the Community used certain instruments to enable it first to promote the accessibility of reliable information, especially information on the public sector, and later on to harmonise information in order to make comparisons possible at Community level.
One of them is the Directive on Public Access to Environmental Information, for which I was rapporteur.
The problems noticed during the debate on this have been taken into account in preparing INSPIRE, and I would like to thank everyone warmly for that.
All in all, the directive will create a sound and viable basis for developing spatial information infrastructures in the European Community and making it possible to maintain quality data and services in the Member States.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs Brepoels and the other Members for their work on the drawing up of this report.
I believe the result to be positive, thanks to the work of this House, which has improved it considerably, to the efforts that the Commission has made in helping us - I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Sornosa - and also, lastly, to the understanding of the Council in the Conciliation Committee.
I have absolutely no doubt about the usefulness of this proposal as a fundamental tool for drawing up, applying, monitoring and evaluating environmental policies at all levels and policies or activities which may directly or indirectly affect the environment.
Furthermore, we believe that it is appropriate to base this Community infrastructure on the spatial data infrastructures already established and managed by the Member States, in full application of the principle of subsidiarity, particularly when the Member States have several levels of public administration, as is often the case, in my country, Spain, for example.
Network services are necessary in order to share spatial data across the various levels of public authority in the Community.
Those services must make it possible to locate, process, view and download spatial data, and also to access spatial data and electronic commerce services.
This instrument must serve to exploit as far as possible the benefits and possibilities that the globalisation of data and services offer to governments, to private enterprise, to universities, to society as a whole and, most importantly, to the citizens.
I believe that it is essential because it brings us up to date with something that is already common as a result of the Internet and the information that it provides.
I also believe that it is crucial that it has been designed as an instrument for providing public information.
In this regard, we hope that INSPIRE complements public sector information and the directives on access to environmental information adopted in application of the Aarhus Convention, which we approved recently, and that it deal with a series of issues not provided for in those directives, such as the sharing of data amongst public authorities and issues of interoperability.
Finally, I must express my satisfaction with the agreement reached by the Council with regard to free-of-charge access to the service, in the majority of cases, as well as the chapter relating to the confidentiality of data, which in the end will coincide with the provisions laid down in the Aarhus Convention, on public access to information on the environment.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Women in Turkey (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Bozkurt, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on women's role in the social, economic and political life in Turkey.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in two days' time, it will be Valentine's Day, day of love and affection.
I could not imagine a nicer Valentine's present for women in Turkey than the adoption, tomorrow, of the report on women's rights.
There are 40 million women in Turkey.
They want to be given the opportunity of developing and improving their living conditions.
My report alone will not be able to bring this about, but it is a means for the women and the women's movement in Turkey to claim their rights in respect of their husbands and their fathers, the Turkish Government, but also the European Union.
My report is building on last year's findings.
I have taken note of what has happened since then and what has not.
Legislation, by and large, is now as it should be, even though a few things still need to be done in that area.
The second step is creating a framework in which legislation can be implemented, that is to say sufficient funds and a well-trained government apparatus, with a government that shows sufficient commitment and is not afraid of making that commitment public.
Only if the second step has been taken can we move on properly to the third step, when women notice improvement in their daily lives - a step which we have not yet reached.
People are still working very hard on step two, and that is why women are still seeing little in the way of practical improvements to date, although the government is committed.
Whilst two years ago, women's rights were not yet really an issue, these days, Prime Minister Erdogan opens nearly every speech with it.
The different ministries too devote more attention to women's rights.
Our report of last year has contributed to this, and we in this House should be proud of this.
There are also better government instructions to officials and police on how to deal with women's rights.
The police and the army are being trained and memos contain clear instructions for ministries and municipalities.
These instructions, which are desperately needed, focus on blood feuds and violence against women.
Indeed, the number of sentences that have been passed with regard to blood feuds is still giving a mixed picture.
Some judges are tougher in their sentencing, while others are more lenient.
This has got to stop.
The report also contains other areas that need attention.
Fighting violence against women must be priority number one in government policy for women.
More refuge centres must be created which I intend to visit so as to monitor whether these places of safety meet the quality requirements.
This year, a committee on women's rights and gender equality must be set up in the Turkish Parliament.
A committee of this kind is indispensable if legislation is to take real account of gender issues, and is also an important and essential interlocutor for the European Parliament and the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly.
More objective and accurate data are needed about the situation of women in Turkey, particularly in relation to violence, illiteracy and discrimination.
Fortunately, this is an area that is being addressed by Turkey and the Commission together.
Finally, there is a need for proper anti-discrimination policy if women are to be given full access to education and the labour market.
I should like to make a brief comment about one compromise amendment that has been jointly tabled by the European People's Party, the Socialists, the Liberals and the European United Left, and about which I am sure you have received a huge number of letters.
It is about the use of the words 'Kurdish minority' in the report.
Kurds themselves, as well as the Turkish Government, have indicated that they have difficulty accepting these words.
In order to avoid confusion, we have now decided to say that all women, irrespective of their race, language, origin, religion or political persuasion, must have access to women's rights programmes.
In this light, I would urge you to support the compromise amendment.
Ladies and gentlemen, 2007 will be an important test for Turkey to see how seriously this country is taking women's emancipation.
That country has parliamentary elections coming up in November.
Far too few women are taking part in politics at the moment.
It is not that they are not there.
Only two weeks ago, I spoke with women of nearly all political parties, but their names are not yet included in the electoral lists.
How Turkey solves this, is up to Turkey.
If, however, the political participation of women does not increase, then Turkey will not be able to say that it did not know what to do.
The report contains suggestions, including temporary measures of positive discrimination.
Temporary, because I am convinced that once women become more visible in politics, this will have a snowball effect.
Girls need role models so that they can see that they too may be able to carve out a career in politics.
I am hopeful for women in Turkey.
The country is moving in the right direction, but should not backpedal.
This is why I would make a plea for accelerating the implementation of reforms, and also for actually carrying them out.
The accession negotiations with the EU can work as a catalyst in this respect.
I hope that our report will be able to do its bit.
I would like to thank you all for your support in advance.
I am persuaded that the women in Turkey will also be indebted to you.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, first, I would like to congratulate Parliament and you, Mrs Bozkurt, on the report.
It is an accurate and carefully balanced description of the situation as regards women's rights in Turkey and it is also a valuable contribution to the debate on women's role in the social, political and economic life of the country.
There has indeed been progress in the area of women's rights: legislation has been passed; an Advisory Board on the Status of Women has been established; an official circular has been issued by the Prime Minister, instructing the administration to deal with domestic violence; a joint EU-Turkey project is setting up a database on violence against women; and the 'Let's go to school, girls' campaign has resulted in the enrolment of 177 000 girls in school.
All this is positive and is acknowledged in the report.
However, we also very much share your concerns as regards women's rights in Turkey.
Women's participation in the labour market, political representation of women, education for girls and violence against women are areas of main concern and we concur with the thrust of the analysis and recommendations of the report.
Low levels of participation by women and low employment rates, together with the large size of the informal economy, represent a major employment policy challenge.
We also agree that political participation by women in Turkey is dramatically low and that important efforts have to be made to deal with this issue.
In addition, we cannot agree more with the importance education has for the economic independence of women.
You will know that gender equality is a major theme in the context of the political criteria.
That is why the Commission follows all these issues closely as part of its regular monitoring. We also cover them in the context of the negotiations.
We report regularly on the situation in the annual progress reports.
Inadequacies are also raised in our bilateral monitoring meetings with the Turkish authorities.
In the framework of our pre-accession assistance, the Commission also funds a number of projects aimed at promoting women's rights.
Particular emphasis is given to violence against women.
In 2007 we will support the establishment of eight shelters for women who have been subject to domestic violence.
Gender equality is also given a high priority within the civil society dialogue between the EU and Turkey.
This dialogue aims at improving mutual knowledge and understanding.
Several projects have already been funded, including some involving women's NGOs.
The Commission will continue to promote actively non-discrimination against women in all areas of life.
This will include future projects.
We will also continue to encourage civil society initiatives aimed at increasing public awareness, such as the 'Stop the Violence Against Women' campaign.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to our rapporteur for her work, and I welcome the lively and fruitful debate that took place within the committee responsible on women's role in the social, economic and political life in Turkey.
I should like to make three points in connection with this debate.
Firstly, there is still some misunderstanding in terms of the difference between the simple act of debating the role of women in Turkey and that of concluding from the debate whether Turkey can or cannot join the European Union.
This merging of the two does not help us to focus on the role of women in Turkey, which is an issue in itself.
In this House, we regularly debate the role of women in Afghanistan, the Maghreb and Africa, without Afghanistan, the Maghreb or Africa necessarily being called on to become members of the European Union.
The same applies to Turkey.
From this perspective, I also call on our counterpart from the Council of Europe to demonstrate responsibility and to conduct a dialogue with Turkey as a Member State of the Council of Europe.
I call on my fellow Members to continue to focus on the role of women in Turkey.
We, as women, represent added value for the common good of society; we bring about peace, we have knowledge to share and a special kind of wisdom to pass on, wherever we are, including in Turkey.
Secondly, the debate on the role of women in Turkey reminds the EU Member States of their own responsibilities.
How can we lecture Turkey when we are incapable of fulfilling our duties in our own countries?
We will only be able to criticise Turkey when we are ready to criticise ourselves.
So let us not pretend to sermonise.
Thirdly, we cannot tackle the situation of women by disregarding the role of men.
The fact is that no one dares mention this obvious fact which, politically-speaking, is a very accurate one, but men also have a very important role to play where gender equality is concerned.
During our meeting in Istanbul, Prime Minister Erdogan clearly confirmed his opposition to violence against women.
I called on him to express himself publicly on this matter and to set a good example to Turkish men.
It is not enough to be deeply convinced that violence is not a solution; he has to say it out loud, bolstered by his political reputation.
That is why I am repeating my call to Mr Erdogan from this Chamber.
Take a public stand against violence against women, including in your country.
Mr Erdogan, set a good example of which men can be proud; we can then take a step forward together and improve the situation of women in your country.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say 'thank you' to Mrs Bozkurt for having now presented the second report on behalf of the women's committee and for her very judicious and expert approach to the subject.
The possibility of Turkey joining the European Union means that we in this House must give pride of place to respect for human rights - and in this specific instance women's rights as an integral element in them - as an indispensable precondition for its accession.
Speaking as a member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I see three great blocks on which work is urgently needed.
The first is education and the world of work; the unfortunate fact is that the presence of women on the labour market has decreased from 35% in 1998 to 25% today, even though there are hopeful signs in some areas - in the number of women practising as lawyers and physicians, for instance - but, if the Lisbon Strategy's targets, which include 60% participation of women in the labour market, are to be met, none of this fits together, and, if Turkey wants to be a candidate, it has to be well aware of that.
Education is a key to bringing about development and change; unfortunately, particularly in eastern Turkey, a very large number of women are still excluded from it, and 25% of them are still illiterate.
More also needs to be done - and as a matter of urgency - where the combating of violence is concerned.
Mr ErdoÄan has committed himself to more being done on this front, but that is far from enough; the establishment of women's refuges would be another step in the right direction, and the public debate on violence against women and 'honour crimes' must go on.
Finally, I have an appeal to make in relation to the Turkish elections; it is that there has to be discussion of quotas if Turkey is to continue to make progress.
The existing level of women's participation in parliamentary life - 4% at the national level and 1% in the municipalities - is unsustainable, so urgent action, including such things as a quota system, needs to be taken to deal with this, and that will do a great service not only to women but also to cooperation between Europe and Turkey.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are, today, discussing the situation of Turkish women, making recommendations and suggestions to Turkey, making demands of it and insisting that it make changes.
This report by Mrs Bozkurt is a good one; it will move democracy forward and help to improve the conditions under which Turkish women live, yet all the things that we, this week, are enjoining on Turkey as it seeks accession are things that we would do well to act on ourselves.
Let us, then, once and for all, stop denying fundamental rights to an ethnic group here in Europe.
Let us enable them to put forward their demands and claims here in this House.
Let us, at last, allow them to trade with the EU and with the rest of the world.
Let us allow them to attend schools and universities legally, and let us recognise their qualifications.
Let us allow them to participate in European sporting events.
Let us do away with this discrimination within the EU.
You will be aware of whom I am talking; I am talking about an ethnic group that, in 2004, and by an overwhelming majority, said 'yes' to the European Union and sought reunion with the other ethnic group in their homeland, and whose isolation we then promised to end.
I am talking about the Turks in Cyprus.
What is the winning card up the European Union's sleeve?
What is that thing of which we are rightly particularly proud?
It is that the European Community is a peace-building project.
How is it that we can become so indifferent as to look away when an EU Member State has serious problems with getting two ethnic groups to live together peacefully, when it needs UN troops and is over-militarised and full to bursting with soldiers and weaponry?
If Christian and Muslim cultures cannot manage to co-exist in Cyprus, how is that going to be possible in the far more complicated structure of the European Union?
The EU is losing credibility by being insufficiently committed to addressing its own problems.
It cannot be united in peace for as long as Cyprus remains a divided island.
Let us help not only the women of Turkey, but also the Turkish women of Cyprus, to avail themselves of their rights.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate the rapporteur on the well-structured report that she has presented to us.
It is a document that addresses subjects of prime importance and highlights the status of women in Turkey and hence in the European Union.
Many people say that the progress made by that country on its journey towards EU accession should be judged first on respect for human rights and then on equal rights for men and women.
We agree with that, but I believe that women should gain equal rights in Turkey regardless of any aspiration to join the European Union.
This is an issue that lies at the basis of any modern, democratic country, but unfortunately, in this context, the European Union is not particularly well qualified to stand up as a champion of safeguards and rights.
The rapporteur specifically points to the extreme scarcity of Turkish women in positions of power, and item 41 suggests that adopting a mandatory quota system would be a short-term remedy.
I remain sceptical: if the quota system has proved ineffective for us in the European Union, why should it ever work in Turkey?
I have two contrasting reactions to the approach taken in the report: on the one hand, I am pleased to see that there is no reference to cases of torture or of excessive policing during demonstrations, but on the other I am concerned to note that a great many problems like female illiteracy and honour crimes are still worryingly common.
I am afraid that the time to put them right is still a long way off, much further off in fact than any optimistic prediction.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Bozkurt for her report, which described the situation of women in Turkey very well.
Even two years on from its first publication, and despite the small amount of progress that has been made, I see that there are still serious deficits as regards the equality of women and men in Turkey.
The problem lies mainly in the high level of illiteracy, which stands at 25%, rising as far as 40% in some regions - and the still very small number of women in decision-making positions at local and national level.
What I find even more appalling, though, is the continuing violence against women.
Mrs Bozkurt rightly takes a critical line in her report on the regrettable and continuing lack of exact data on this, and what I find disconcerting in this regard is the fact that, in Turkey, which has a population of 70 million people, there are no more than thirty women's refuges, even though Turkish law requires that a refuge for victims of violence be set up in communities with over 50 000 residents.
As regards honour killings, one gets the impression that the number of them has decreased since the penalty was made tougher, but I cannot dispel my own concern that the increased incidence of suicide in some regions might well conceal honour killings.
The Turkish Government cannot - it must not - stand idly by and let these things happen.
It must compile reliable data and set up women's centres offering women facing the threat of violence not only protection but also emotional support.
That is the only way to offer women and girls, from the very outset, the prospect, most of all, of coming out unscathed from a situation that appears to be hopeless.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the report on the role of women in the social, economic and political life of Turkey calls for a more effective implementation of community concepts as regards the equality and rights of women.
At the present stage, however, it is obvious that the great diversity of the European Union means that many of its recommendations have not had the desired effect and create various conflicts as well as being - contrary to the slogans - a denial of freedom.
There are huge cultural as well as religious and moral differences between the two societies, which is why it would be more relevant to give Turkish women the tools to resolve their own problems in their own way, rather than imposing a mindset and solutions on them that are alien to their traditions and culture.
Our Community is based on the principles of dignity and freedom of nations, as set out in countless documents, and our task should be to provide support to combat poverty and violence and to promote education, rather than imposing an alien world outlook on the Turks, which in itself constitutes coercion of the kind the European Union supposedly does not tolerate.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, although the legal situation of women in Turkey has improved to some degree, we are a long way from being able to talk in terms of success.
If one considers how things work in practice and the attitudes of the broad majority of the population, it is at once clear that most of these improvements have been accomplished only on paper.
In theory, for example, domestic violence - which statistics show is frequently resorted to - now constitutes grounds for divorce, yet the incidence of divorce is lower in Turkey than in many other developing countries.
In what sense can the rule of law be said to apply when the state discontinues prosecutions when the suspect objects to them, and when women under threat only very rarely get protection from the police?
What is the point of making improvements to laws, when court rulings take them to absurd conclusions?
I also believe that the high level of illiteracy among women, and the high incidence of forced marriage, not to mention the increasing number of honour killings disguised as suicide, speak volumes, and, in the event of the poorly educated women losing their jobs - in which they may well work under conditions analogous to those of slavery - they do not even appear in the official statistics.
This falsification of the unemployment rate and the consequent threat of large-scale migration is reason enough for the EU to step on the emergency brake, for the way women are treated in Turkish society and their position in it constitute, as I see it, yet more proof that Turkey is not a European country and will never become one.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I will begin with a word of apology for my late arrival, since I was detained in a meeting of the coordinators of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
I very much welcome the report put forward by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality under the guidance of Mrs Bozkurt, for it is even-handed and constructive, highlighting not only the progress achieved on women's issues but also the deficits that still remain, and spelling out the need for continued and consistent progress down the road of reform on which Turkey has set foot.
Turkey's Prime Minister, Mr ErdoÄan, would therefore be well advised - despite having many elections to fight - to press on with the gender justice policy and encourage women to work independently.
The report gives a good overview of the role of Turkish women in their country's social, economic and political life.
It is good that measures are being planned to combat violence against women, among them the initiative to prevent violence during military service or training in the police force.
The principal exponent of this approach is the Turkish Minister for Women, and it is an important and good one, for it is only by means of initiatives such as these that attitudes can be changed - and they need to be.
Mr ErdoÄan's decree in response to the Turkish parliament's report on violence against women and killings on the alleged grounds of honour and morals is another move in the right direction, in that it incorporates many different aspects of policy on women's issues and instructs all ministries, public institutions and local authorities to be consistent in counteracting violence against women.
It must be said, though, that it now has to be followed up by binding and specific instructions on how to implement this, which have still not yet been forthcoming, for his circular will remain a toothless tiger for as long as there are no specific details of how to implement the necessary measures or proper sanctions against the event of them not being put into effect.
The most recent experience gained in the combating of violence against women indicates just how important it is that such public bodies as the courts, the administration, the police or the health authorities should be involved in it, for, here too, a change of thinking is urgently needed; it has been a too frequent occurrence that women seeking protection have been turned away by the authorities and fallen victim to domestic violence, and that is why we are urging the Turkish government to afford women affected by violence all the protection they need and, where public institutions fail to protect its victims, to set in motion a judicial inquiry and cause those responsible to be prosecuted.
State institutions must also work more closely with independent women's organisations and support the latter financially.
Mr President, this debate is not really about women in Turkey.
Turkey had a female Head of Government 14 years ago.
Eighteen of the 27 Members of the EU have not yet reached this landmark.
Yet that does not stop this Chamber from hectoring Ankara about women's political representation.
No, this report is really about Turkey's membership bid.
It demands, for example, that Kurdish women's groups be explicitly recognised as such: a deliberate provocation to Ankara, which has long maintained that all Turkish citizens are equal before the Constitution.
Once again the bar is being set higher for Turkey than for any past applicant.
We hector the Turks in the most importunate manner about Cyprus, about the status of minorities, about the Armenian massacre.
We damn them either way.
If they repress signs of Islamic devotion, we call them authoritarian. If they do not, we call them fundamentalists.
The truth is that there are many in this House who are determined, in Gladstone's infamous phrase, to 'turn the Turk, bag and baggage, out of Europe'.
Their real concern is not about human rights. It is that the accession of a populous, proud and assertive Muslim country would retard their dream of a federation, of a country called Europe.
Although I do not share their position, I recognise that it is a legitimate point of view.
But it would have been better for all concerned had Brussels been honest, had it said 'no' at the outset and then settled down to work out an amicable bilateral relationship.
Instead we shall string Turks along for perhaps another ten or fifteen years, wring painful concessions from them on foreign and domestic policy, force them to assimilate tens of thousands of pages of the acquis communautaire and then, only then, turn them away.
This is no way to treat an allied nation, colleagues, a nation that guarded Europe's flags for a half a century against the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union and whom we may look to one day to do the same against the totalitarianism of the religious fanatics.
Turks are as entitled as any other people to their pride.
By abusing them in this manner the EU risks creating the very thing it purports to fear: the rise of anti-western sentiment among a people who have long been our friends.
(HU) It is extremely important for Turkey's system of democratic institutions to be further strengthened, achieving those reforms which promote European integration.
A report of the European Parliament at the end of last year noted the slowing down of the reform process, and gave special emphasis to the fact that there is insufficient progress in guaranteeing women's rights.
It is unacceptable that Turkish women suffer discrimination in nearly every area of life: in the labour market, in decision-making and in education, and that they experience considerable disadvantages in comparison with their male counterparts.
Rights guaranteed by law are of no use if their implementation in practice is not ensured.
The political will of the Turkish Government can best ensure implementation of these rights.
For this to happen, a social dialogue is necessary, involving organisations of civil society.
Information campaigns would be the most effective way of drawing society's attention to guaranteeing the rights of women.
The continued violence against women is shocking, and is unacceptable in a country which seeks to adopt the basic principles of European integration.
It is the task of the Turkish Government to find suitable instruments for solving this shameful problem and for gradually phasing it out.
To this end, the European Union can offer help by sharing the experiences of its programmes and best practices.
I am hopeful that Turkey is willing to accept a helping hand, and will truly take action to tackle this problem.
I thank my fellow Member Mrs Bozkurt for her work, for the report is excellent and I recommend its adoption.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Bozkurt wholeheartedly for her excellent and important report, one which I feel is even more important because it comes from a brave European woman of Turkish origin who knows and understands the special circumstances and norms of a Turkish, Islamic, partly secular and partly fundamentalist society.
Looking back many years ago, women in Turkish society were regarded more as objects than human beings.
They have suffered enormously and it is only in recent years that this sad situation is beginning to be remedied.
But although steps have been taken in the right direction, there is still very much that needs to be done.
It is my view in fact that progress is not as much as we would have hoped for.
Indeed, in large parts of Turkey, especially in the south-east, women are still treated as second-class citizens and are grossly discriminated against.
Illiteracy amongst Turkish women is at record levels for a European-orientated country.
Additionally, the degree and extent of violence against women is still unacceptably high and unfortunately is in many cases accepted as the norm by large sections of Turkish society.
The despicable criminal and offensive activity of honour killings still happens only too regularly in Turkish villages and cities.
It is true that the Turkish Government is making some efforts to correct matters.
For example, much attention has been focused recently on better education for women and on educating the police and the judiciary in order to deal more appropriately with violence against women.
A country-wide information campaign and stricter implementation of the law are taking place, but are not having the desired effect, because drastic changes also have to happen at a core political level.
Prime Minister Erdogan himself recently drew attention to the 'deep state' in Turkey that is opposing his Government's reforms and is fighting against parliamentary democracy.
This deep state, supported mainly by the army and other extreme nationalist elements, is impeding progress in Turkey - and incidentally, Mrs Resetarits - is keeping Turkish Cypriots isolated and Cyprus divided.
Such forces do not want liberated women equal in all respects to men.
It is our duty to support this report and bring liberation to Turkish women.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from being clear, this report by my fellow Member, Mrs Bozkurt, has the great virtue of summarising the sad reality of women's rights in Turkey.
Indeed, despite all the declarations of intent from the Turkish authorities and the pseudo-reforms undertaken in the area of human rights, the reality is that domestic violence, honour crimes and forced marriages keep increasing, and that discrimination against women in the workplace and in education still goes on.
However, this finding should not make us forget that, while it is true that these violations of women's rights are incompatible with the concept of human rights, as they are laid down, for example, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the fact remains that Turkey is not European and that its future should not lie in the European Union.
Indeed, even when it turns out that all the economic, legal and social criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Summit have been met, Turkey, 99% of whose population is made up of Muslims and 94% of whose territory is located in Asia, will still not share our values, which bear the stamp of Christianity and humanism.
Turkey is a beautiful country, a great country, with a courageous, proud and hospitable people.
We should, of course, preserve the privileged relations that we already maintain with Turkey as part of the customs Union, but Turkey cannot and must not under any circumstances join the European Union.
(PT) Mr President, the process of assessing Turkey's compliance with the EU's accession criteria involves frequent evaluation of the progress that has been made, not least on human rights.
In this context, Mrs Bozkurt's excellent report places great emphasis on how the situation of women in Turkey is evolving, for which the rapporteur deserves commendation.
I should like to highlight a few of the report's recommendations: incentives for the social partners to promote the involvement of women in social dialogue, calling on the Turkish authorities to establish a monitoring system to keep girls in the education system, a quota system operational in various countries - from the Iberian Peninsula to Scandinavia - to guarantee fair representation for women on electoral lists, instructions for judges to deliver severe sentences for 'honour crimes' and forced marriages, a campaign to promote the image of women as players driving economic and social development, and the inclusion of the social partners and some NGOs in the Advisory Board on the Status of Women.
Mrs Bozkurt's report is thus an excellent contribution to progress in assessing the situation of women in Turkey.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must take this opportunity to tell you that there can be progress on the situation of women throughout Europe.
Yesterday in Portugal, the Portuguese people voted in a referendum to decriminalise the voluntary termination of pregnancy.
This was a great day for Portugal, and an absolutely marvellous day for women.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was probably not the rapporteur's intention, but there is actually no denying that the Bozkurt report is yet another illustration of the fact that Turkey simply does not belong in Europe.
Indeed, it is wrong to think that Turkey is simply a country where a couple of things need fixing and that everything can be solved with a few new laws and rules or with the absorption of some tens of thousands of pages of acquis communautaire, whereupon a new European Member State is allegedly created.
This is absurd.
First of all, Europeans are people who live within a very specific geographical European framework, and that framework does not include Turkey.
In addition, Europeans are also people who form part of a very defined community of law and a community of values, which comprises, among others, gender equality.
Other areas that play a role are culture, mentality and even religion, when this religion, as is the case with Islam, is not restricted to internal perception but wants to impose its outdated and, in many cases, totally reprehensible rules on the whole of the community.
Returning to the subject of this report, I would say that Turkey is without a doubt the most modern Islamic country, but it remains, where women's rights are concerned, a backwater.
Indeed, it is an Islamic country, where women are deemed inferior, something which will not improve as Islamicisation gains ground; quite the reverse.
Let us therefore stop treating the symptoms, rather than the cause, which is the fact that Turkey may well be a neighbouring country, but can never become a European one.
(PL) Mr President, the lack of female involvement in Turkey's social, economic and political life is mainly the result of a lack of proper access to education.
While appreciating the changes that have been made, it needs to be said that there is still a high level of illiteracy among girls and women in Turkey.
Estimates provided by UNICEF show that every year between 600 000 and 800 000 Turkish girls do not attend school because their families forbid it or because just getting to school is difficult.
However, Turkish women face other problems as well.
Violence against women is common, and honour killings as well as forced marriages violate the fundamental human right to make one's own decisions about one's life.
In some parts of south-eastern Turkey, girls are not even registered at birth, as a result of which they are deprived of rights such as access to education or health services.
Women play a very small role in Turkey's political life, and the Turkish parliament does not have a permanent committee on women's rights and equality.
The Turkish Government must implement women's rights legislation as soon as possible so that those rights can be effectively implemented in practice.
Public institutions such as the courts, the police and the health system must guarantee to protect and afford all assistance to women reporting violence against them.
The social partners should also play an important role by promoting the rights of women and organising debates or courses to promote the image of women as equal citizens of Turkey with an important role to play in their country's economic and political life.
Finally I would like to congratulate Mrs Bozkurt on her important report, which I hope will contribute to further positive changes in the situation of women in Turkey.
(ES) I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Bozkurt on her work and on her monitoring of the situation of women in Turkey.
Thanks to her good work, the issue of women's rights is being treated on a par with other policies.
I believe that you are making history in that regard, Mrs Bozkurt.
Congratulations!
As someone who has been closely following this process, your first report, the extremely interesting working meetings that a delegation of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality held in Istanbul and Ankara, and now this second report, I must say that I agree with you that we must now ensure that the legislation on women's rights is not revoked.
Although the improvement in the legislation in this field has, generally speaking, been a success, it is urgent that we create the appropriate environment to make it possible for the legislative reforms to be applied.
It is very difficult to carry on making progress if the important changes introduced into the legislation are not implemented in practice.
Women must be able to see their situation improve in their daily lives.
It is not just a question of their having rights, but also of their being able to complain in practice when they are not respected.
Only by speeding up the practical application of the legislative reforms throughout the territory will we be able to ensure that the new legislation on women's rights is maintained.
I would also like to stress that the Turkish authorities' willingness to tackle cases of violence against women and to accept the use of positive action measures with a view to combating gender inequalities is particularly significant.
I would finally like to highlight the government's willingness to hold dialogue and to better coordinate with women's organisations active in the field of gender equality, and therefore the rapporteur's request that the European Commission provide support in order to facilitate that cooperation seems to me to be highly appropriate.
Congratulations once again, Mrs Bozkurt.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for this discussion and the Members for their remarks.
I think we can all agree that despite recent positive developments, the situation concerning women's rights in Turkey needs to be improved.
While progress has been made towards improving legislation, implementation remains a challenge and needs to be speeded up.
We are now looking forward to further positive developments and hope that the work of the European Parliament and the Commission will support this process.
Last but not least, I would like to underline the importance of the participation of civil society in this effort.
I shall briefly mention some figures which might be of interest to you.
This is in relation to the funds allocated by the Commission.
Combating domestic violence against women: EUR 2.968 million. Strengthening civil society in the pre-accession process: EUR 2.5 million.
Establishing shelters for women subjected to domestic violence: EUR 8.5 million. Through these and many other activities the Commission will continue to support that which is focused upon in this report.
Let me once again express my gratitude to the rapporteur for the excellent work which has been done.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

Inaugural address by the President of the European Parliament
Former Presidents of the European Parliament, Madam Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Council, Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, Mr van der Linden, President of the Assembly of the Council of Europe, Presidents and representatives of the European institutions, honoured guests, and, above all, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the European Parliament, electing a new President every two and a half years - a short time by historical standards - has been the tradition of the European Parliament since its first direct elections in June 1979, but let us not forget that one President of the European Parliament lives through five European Council Presidencies - in this case Germany, followed by Portugal, Slovenia, France and the Czech Republic - and so the responsibility borne by our Parliament is self-evident, particularly at this time when the task of uniting Europe has come a long way, but is not yet complete and indeed, given the current failure of the constitutional process in France and the Netherlands, is still in danger.
Being aware of this responsibility, the European Parliament cannot allow itself to be outdone by anybody when it comes to completing this task of unifying our continent.
(Applause)
We all live within a continuum including those who went before us and those who will come after, and so I would like to thank my predecessor, Mr Josep Borrell Fontelles, most warmly and sincerely on behalf of the whole European Parliament and, in particular, also on a personal level, for his great commitment and indefatigable work as our President over the past two and a half years!
(Applause)
I also extend warm and sincere thanks to the former Presidents who are with us today:
Mr Emilio Colombo, President of Parliament in the days before it was directly elected, and then his post-1979 successors Mrs Simone Veil, Lord Plumb, also known as Henry Plumb, Mr Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, who is still with us here, Mr Egon Klepsch, Mr Klaus HÃ€nsch, who is still an MEP, Mr JosÃ©-MarÃ­a Gil-Robles, Mrs Nicole Fontaine and Mr Pat Cox.
(Vigorous applause)
I extend a very warm welcome to all of you.
It is a cause of great joy to us that you have all accepted the invitation to be here.
Mr Pierre Pflimlin and Mr Piet Dankert are no longer with us.
We remember them with gratitude.
I share with Mr Klaus HÃ€nsch, Mr Ingo Friedrich, Mr Karl von Wogau, Mr Francis Wurtz and Mr Jens-Peter Bonde the privilege of having been a Member of the European Parliament since its first elections in 1979.
Since then we have lived through highs and lows in European politics.
The greatest success has been overcoming the division of Europe.
Our shared values have prevailed.
The accession to the European Union of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - and of Cyprus and Malta - on 1 May 2004, and of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January this year, together with the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, remain for me the miracle of this generation.
We all have reason to be extremely happy about this, now as always.
(Applause)
We all, however, still have to learn from each other and to strengthen our respect and understanding for each other.
We should stop talking about the 'old' and the 'new' Member States.
All of us, together, constitute the European Parliament, and the nations that we represent are the community of the European Union.
(Applause)
In the 1980s, there was talk of 'Eurosclerosis'.
Then, however, along came the single market and the single European currency.
We in this House fought to secure our rights, and will continue to do so.
Today this Parliament is influential and self-confident.
Experience, then, teaches us that we can win successes for Europe when we want them ourselves, when our will to achieve unity for our continent while maintaining its diversity remains strong and determined.
I would like, today, to ask you all to continue in this determination.
We shall only succeed in this, though, if the citizens of the European Union - alongside their attachment to home and their own country - understand and are aware, as Europeans, of what binds them to one another.
A sense of community and a sense of being 'us' are necessary conditions for our shared future.
European unification is not simply a desire dictated by our minds; European unification is also an affair of the heart.
Making this clear to people is perhaps the greatest challenge that we must meet together.
What we have to do is to serve the citizens of the European Union.
Europeans should be proud of what they have achieved by their labours over the centuries in terms of values, freedom, law and democracy.
It has been a long haul.
We know that our European roots lie in Greek philosophy, Roman law, the Judeo-Christian heritage, the Enlightenment - in other words, in our shared European culture.
Together with those, though, there have also been tragic European civil wars, and in the 20th century the totalitarian ideologies, with their contempt for humanity, and then, in 1945, the courage of the founding fathers in following the path of forgiveness and reconciliation, in building a new, better, more peaceful, shared Europe.
We should still remember this today, and rediscover the things that are common to us all.
The great French European Jacques Delors followed Robert Schuman in speaking of the 'European soul'.
The great Polish European WÅadysÅaw Bartoszewski once said: 'Europe means above all else freedom of the individual and human rights - both political and economic'.
They were both right.
I would like to talk about European values.
They are, in essence, founded upon the idea of human dignity.
It is in the dignity of the individual that we respect the other, place ourselves under obligations, and thus build a system based on responsibility and solidarity.
In our practical political activities we should always serve the cause of human dignity, and I would like to encourage all of us to defend that, and human rights throughout the world.
That is not an abstract plea.
We are not the world's teachers, but our humanitarian image and our values become more convincing to others if we live our own lives with credibility.
This has very concrete implications for our policies:
we want partnership with a Russia that is democratic and capable of action, and so we expect the Russian authorities to make visible efforts to ensure that the murderers of Ana Politkovskaya, who did so much for press freedom in her country, are punished appropriately.
(Applause)
We shall never forget that without the United States of America neither National Socialism nor Soviet communism could have been vanquished, but we also have to say to our American friends that GuantÃ¡namo is incompatible with any legal order founded upon our European principles.
(Applause)
We protect human life.
If anyone - as, for example the President of a nation with a great history of civilisation has done - denies the Holocaust, we will firmly repudiate such assertions in order to ensure that the horror of a new holocaust is not visited upon us.
(Applause)
It is our conviction that the people of Israel and Palestine are linked by their common human dignity.
We therefore support equally the right of Israel to exist and the right of the Palestinian people to live in a State of their own.
(Applause)
We stand alongside those who are fighting peacefully for freedom and democracy, and that explains our solidarity with the Sakharov Prize winner Alexander Milinkevich and his fellow fighters for a democratic Belarus free from fear and oppression.
