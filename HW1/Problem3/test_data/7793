Each Member State of the Union ought to be able to decide for itself whether or not to introduce genetically modified organisms on its territory.
Given that European taxpayers are already making a substantial contribution to supporting agriculture, agricultural products ought at least to be healthy, good to eat, and not contain any surprises.
Mr President, on Wednesday this week, Parliament will discuss the Lisbon Treaty, and citizens will watch this House on these institutional questions.
But citizens are even more interested to see European institutions tackle the practical question of European policy-making.
One of the most important issues is transparency and lobbying.
The EU Commission was well-advised, three years ago, to launch a so-called transparency initiative, but now we hear that the Commission wants to present a register in which no names of lobbyists would appear and no meaningful information on how much money is spent on lobbying would be available.
I warn the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and I also warn Mr Kallas not to undermine the credibility you have in Europe on the transparency initiative, but to come up with a meaningful register.
This is what citizens need, to believe in fair policy-making and decision-making in Brussels.
(CS) My original intention was to address an entirely different topic.
Circumstances however, have forced me to express my opinion on a particularly serious matter, the proclamation of independence of Kosovo by Albanian separatists.
I am convinced that this development, which is contrary to international law, will have tragic consequences and repercussions for all of Europe.
It is particularly tragic that the EU intends to endorse this act of separatism carried out at the expense of Serbia, an already heavily tried sovereign state.
This is fundamentally unacceptable.
The whole scenario of this separatist act reminds me vividly of events that took place in 1938 in my own home country of Czechoslovakia.
At the time an act of separatism carried out by German nationalists and also supported at the time by the Western powers was followed by the most terrible war in history.
It is well known that history either repeats itself as a farce or as a tragedy.
We must not allow either of these situations to arise.
I call on this House to oppose this separatist act and infringement of Serbian sovereignty.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, Dear colleagues, I am taking the floor, urged by a huge social, economic, environmental and moral problem which has been eroding the Bulgarian society for 18 years now.
Instead of being resolved, it continues to grow like a malignant tumour with unpredictable consequences.
I am talking about Kremikovtzi Metallurgical Works, which is supposed to play a strategic role in the Bulgarian economy.
Unfortunately, over the last decade and a half, instead of generating revenues to the treasury, it has turned into a canker for the whole society.
It is used only for the private gain of certain mafia groups and as a source to fill the coffers of political parties.
And all this has been going on under the protection of several governments in a row, including the incumbent one.
It is particularly alarming that the current crisis of Kremikovtzi, faced with the real threat of closing down and depriving ten thousand workers and their families of livelihood, is the direct result of the actions of people linked to both the criminal underworld and the top establishment.
These are the former CEO Valentin Zakhariev, the former Prosecutor General Nikola Filchev, and the former head of the specialised police task forces ("the berretsâ) Filko Slavov.
Their names are associated not only with the management of Kremikovtzi but also with the darkest sides of Bulgagria's transition to democracy, including the assassination of the military prosecutor Nikolay Kolev.
As it turns out these people have enjoyed and continue to enjoy protection by the judiciary and the government. They continue to feel above the laws.
I am confident that it is inconceivable for a member state to...
(The Chairman interrupts the speaker)
(RO) Mr. President, dear colleagues, at the beginning of February, the European Commission published the Interim Report on Progress in Romania with Judiciary Reform.
This year's Final Report is prepared for June and will decide whether the safeguard clause will be applied or not.
I believe this will not be the case, since the institutions criticized for staying behind can solve their problems in the four monitored fields during this period.
The enforcement of the safeguard clause would mean non-recognition of the court orders in the Member States, which would affect the citizens and parties to proceedings who are not to blame for the fact that the relevant institutions, the Government and the Parliament, fail to fulfil their obligations.
The enforcement of the safeguard clause should be considered as not to be directed against the Romanian citizens because it is normal for those who are guilty of not meeting their obligations to answer for it, and not the Romanian citizens.
(HU) Mr President, on 13 February Australia's Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a formal apology on behalf of the Australian government for the indignities inflicted on the indigenous Aboriginal population over two centuries.
This gesture speaks for itself, and it is especially topical for us here in Europe.
More than 60 years on from the tragic events that occurred during and after the second World War, there is a country in Europe where three million people - your people, Mr President - were driven into exile, while another half a million citizens were deprived of their citizenship, their human rights and their property.
To this date, no apology has been made.
Europe is built not on nationalism and confrontation, but on apologies and forgiveness, on the politics of reconciliation.
Instead of focusing on collective guilt and scapegoat-seeking, it would be good if the leaders of every Member State in the European Union and in Europe were guided by a commitment to adhere unconditionally to fundamental European values, to respect each other, to apologise, and to protect human and minority rights.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, next Sunday, on 24 February, Estonians will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of their independent statehood.
In spite of being a relatively young state, Estonia has been part of European cultural heritage and shared values since the 13th century.
However, a special feature of the 90 years since the proclamation of independence that we share with our neighbours - Latvians and Lithuanians - is that we have enjoyed freedom for only 39 years, because of foreign occupations.
Therefore, I would like to recall one important fact: exactly 25 years ago, the European Parliament, as the first European institution to do so, reacted to the appeal of 45 freedom fighters from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and adopted a resolution supporting the idea of restoring sovereignty to the three occupied Baltic nations.
I would like to thank all previous and current Members of the European Parliament who courageously expressed solidarity with the three Baltic nations.
Mr President, in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics, the focus of the international community is on China's record for violations of human rights.
However, we must not forget that other species, primarily the tigers, are suffering too.
Their numbers are being devastated due to huge demand - largely from China - for tiger-related products.
The cause of their looming extinction is the illegal poaching of tigers in India.
Even in reserves, keepers have been shot to get at the tigers.
These are then illegally transported across the border to China.
It is estimated that one tiger is killed every day.
At this rate the tiger will be virtually extinct within the next five years.
I welcome the news last week that the Indian Government plans to create eight new reserves to protect their dwindling population of tigers.
Nevertheless, it will take five years to set up new reserves, and in the last five years the population of tigers has already dropped by over 50%.
Therefore, unless the European Union and international community take urgent action in curbing demand and tackling illegal poaching and trafficking, and changing attitudes in China on tiger-related products, the new reserves will be too little too late.
Finally, I hope you will support me on Tiger Protection Awareness Day.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the blatantly racist comments made by Mr Silvio Berlusconi last week, in which he called for zero tolerance towards Roma, illegal immigrants and criminals, are shocking and unacceptable.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Francesco Storace, who is running for mayor of the Italian capital, spoke of 'denomadising' Rome, thereby making it clear that Roma have no place in the eternal city.
Can these statements be happening just 18 days after the European Parliament adopted a resolution on a European Strategy on the Roma?
I would ask my fellow Members from Italy to explain to their colleagues at home why it was that we supported this resolution, the objectives it contains that we formulated together, and why abusing Gypsies is inappropriate in the 21st century.
The open letter published by me in connection with these anti-Romani statements was signed by a total of 72 Roma non-governmental organisations including 33 in Italy, 12 in Hungary, 9 in Macedonia, 4 in Romania, 3 in Turkey, 2 in Moldova, 5 in Bulgaria, and 2 in France.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, Mr Alexander Milinkiewicz, the leader of the opposition in Belarus, has been detained once again in Minsk today.
Mr Milinkiewicz is a Sakharov laureate.
The European Parliament awarded him this prize in 2006.
Mrs Olga Kazulin has also been detained.
She is the wife of Mr Alexander Kazulin, a prominent opponent of Mr Lukaszenko.
Mr Milinkiewicz took part in a demonstration organised by private entrepreneurs, whose freedom of action has been restricted by new provisions increasing their tax burden and restricting their freedom to employ workers.
It was not the first demonstration in which this social group had expressed its discontent.
The march organisers were also detained and interrogated along with Mr Milinkiewicz and Mrs Kazulin, who had not participated in the march.
How many times has Europe watched passively whilst the one of its own laureates was detained?
How many times have human rights been violated with impunity just beyond the Union's eastern border?
(PL) Mr President, last week the Polish media reported the story of Karolina, a young girl whose life has been ruined by her former boyfriend.
Without her knowledge or consent, the boyfriend recorded their shared private experiences and posted the recordings on the Internet after the end of their relationship.
Karolina's family and friends received e-mails containing pornographic material.
As she is not a minor, Karolina is not protected under Polish law and the perpetrator of this action remains unpunished.
The Polish authorities have undertaken to change the law at the earliest opportunity, so as to protect individuals whose privacy and dignity have been violated in this way.
The Internet transcends national borders, however, and there is no common Union legislation to deter potential perpetrators and penalise those who commit actions of this kind.
I appeal to the Commission and to the Member States to combat such behaviour, which could be described as rape over the Internet.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, too many animal sanctuaries in Europe basically serve only one purpose, and that is to dispose of stray cats and dogs.
This sounds cruel in itself, but the real cruelty is only revealed in the methods deployed for this purpose, which entail every conceivable form of barbarity, from poisoning to starvation and clubbing to death.
The worst aspect of this scenario, however, is that these cruel acts are not taking place far away in distant countries; no, as committed activists from Austria have told me, they are happening right on our doorsteps.
Cases of animal cruelty only recently came to light in the Czech Republic, for example.
What is also worrying is the Commission's brief and pithy statement that the protection of domestic animals still falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States.
It seems that the Commission very often acts when it is not supposed to, and takes far too little action when it ought to.
This situation must change, for a national competence does not mean that the EU should distance itself from an issue entirely.
I therefore appeal to all Members not to kill off the issue of animal killing stations in their own countries by remaining silent.
I also appeal to the Commission and the Council to condemn these cruel acts.
Mr President, I am seriously concerned by the misconception that a colleague of mine, Sahra Wagenknecht, spread in an interview with the Russian news agency 'Regnum' on 7 February this year.
She accused the Estonian Government of disregarding human rights, and the European Union of conducting a silent cover-up with regard to the 'Bronze Night' and the trials that followed in Estonia.
I can assure you that the ongoing trials of the people accused of organising the riots are being carried out in accordance with the rule of law and with respect for human rights.
I would also like to remind my colleague that one of the purposes of the state is to guard the sanctity of private property.
The marauding in Tallinn last year had nothing to do with freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate.
Criminal acts were committed, and that is why the state was obliged to intervene.
Justification of crime is no ennoblement to a politician and, fortunately, the views of Sahra Wagenknecht cannot to be said to extend to all the political left.
(PL) Mr President, the Parliament in Kosovo declared independence yesterday.
Serbia has therefore lost the cradle of its nationhood for the second time in history.
I would remind the House that the Turks first seized this province from Serbia in the Middle Ages.
In our times, supported by Member States of the Union and by our own silence, Serbia has once again suffered the loss of this territory, which is so precious to it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Kosovo's declaration of independence constitutes a violation of international law on the inviolability and integrity of borders and countries.
Kosovo's declaration of independence also amounts to opening Pandora's box, because it will foster extremism and nationalism and may fuel extremism of all kinds within Europe and beyond.
We already have to deal, amongst other things, with similar claims in Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the Basque Country.
This is a very ill-judged move as far as one particular Member State is concerned, namely Cyprus.
How is that country supposed to respond?
Cyprus is striving for reunification at the same time as we are supporting separatist movements.
We should not accept the independence of Kosovo, because it poses a threat to the security of Europe and above all to the internal security of Serbia.
(DE) Mr President, Russia will be holding presidential elections at the beginning of March, but there are few signs of a positive outcome being likely.
What has happened in the run-up to these elections?
The opposition has been systematically obstructed and silenced, press freedom comprehensively curtailed, and the arrangements for the elections disrupted.
Let me give you just one example: the Russian opposition politician Garry Kasparov, who is highly critical of the Kremlin, was arrested again by the police last week on completely spurious grounds.
What will happen during the election?
There will be no transparency in these elections, for Russia has put obstacles in the way of election monitoring by the OSCE.
What will happen after the election?
It is highly unlikely that the human rights situation will improve under a President Dmitry Medvedev enthroned by Putin.
The EU must take action here.
The Russian population should not be left to cope on its own.
(Applause)
(HU) Mr President, Kosovo's independence signifies a major change in the Balkans.
This step, albeit painful, seems to be another inevitable rung on the ladder towards settlement in the Balkans.
As far as Kosovo's future is concerned, we need a solution that will secure the collective and individual rights of an indigenous minority, the Serbs, and ensure that they can continue to live as a community in their historic birthplace.
If some of them nevertheless wish to leave Kosovo, however, we must prevent them from going to areas of Serbia inhabited by other ethnic groups, such as the Albanian-populated southern areas or the Hungarian-populated northern regions.
A mass influx of this sort would simply create new tensions between the Serbs, who are understandably irritated at present, and these minorities.
By averting this risk we could facilitate another settlement that would include the long-term, and not merely superficial, regulation of relations between Belgrade and Novi Sad, and between the indigenous minorities in Vojvodina and the state; it could also help to break the deadlock and enable a functioning state to be established in Bosnia.
Desirable developments such as these would be fostered by the system of ethnic rights and tolerance that is now to be put in place in Kosovo.
Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, I wish to point out that there are genuine concerns amongst trade unions in many Member States about the recent European Court judgment on the Laval issue.
The Commission must urgently publish its view on how this decision impacts on the labour relations systems and, indeed, the collective bargaining systems of each of our Member States.
I know the impact in Sweden is significant, and it is much less so in Ireland.
Nevertheless, action is needed to make clear that the EU does not sanction social dumping anywhere.
It is particularly important that the Commission and the Member States take steps to prevent the catastrophist predictions of the Euro-sceptics becoming the common view of the issue.
Genuine concerns need to be addressed and any loopholes for the unscrupulous to exploit must be closed off in European and legislative initiatives by European and national parliaments.
I urge you, Mr President, to convey this matter to Commissioner Å pidla and Commissioner McCreevy, both of whom have a role in this matter.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
In my earlier intervention I mentioned that I am able to speak in my mother tongue here, but am not able to do so at home.
By 'here' of course I was referring to the European Parliament, and 'at home', obviously enough, refers to the Slovak national parliament.
Outside parliament we can of course use our mother tongue; we can even use it in some higher education institutions, albeit to a much lesser extent than is warranted in view of the proportion of Hungarian speakers in the population.
Of the 6.4% ethnic Hungarians in the population, barely 4% are represented in higher education and only 1.6% are studying in their mother tongue.
For the first time in around 50 years, Hungarian-speaking CsÃ¡ngÃ³ children in eastern parts of Romania are able to learn Hungarian again, although in some villages this only takes place outside of school, if at all.
In spite of this, the statement made by Commissioner Orban on the so-called 'second mother tongue' was encouraging.
We are sure that from now on the majority ethnic groups in European countries will place importance not only on the acquisition of the official language of the state, but also on ensuring that other groups living alongside them are able to preserve their mother tongue and learn it at every level in their own education institutions, and that they are able to use their mother tongue in the public administration, in the courts and in the legislature.
2008 is the Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
May it live up to its name.
Thank you.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, All countries are affected by the problem of raising children in a disadvantaged position.
Children's rights and their protection call for an integrated policy.
The reduction of the number of institutionalised children is a wonderful goal but, in all countries, there will always be children in need of care by society because they have no parents or they are socially disadvantaged for other reasons.
What we need is solidarity with these children and these countries rather than ostentatious clout that degrades their dignity.
I call upon the European Commission to undertake the development of special programmes for children in disadvantaged position, taking into account what the Member States have achieved and preventing any attempts at tarnishing their good name.
The dissemination of biased information, as is the case with a home in Bulgaria, should not be encouraged.
This affects the image of my country. It does not contribute positively to the common European policy.
We need programmes for productive education of socially disadvantaged children, regardless of the manner and place in which they are raised; prevention of the exploitation of child labour and the involvement of children in various activities which affect their behaviour negatively.
(RO) The European nationality offers a series of rights and freedoms on the entire EU territory.
For this reason, by signing the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Member States undertook the obligation to prohibit any discrimination.
Nevertheless, a few days ago, I was informed about the case of a Romanian citizen who was not allowed to rent a car in Brussels for the reason of having Romanian nationality.
The employee's refusal was merely based on an internal rule of the given car rental office.
In recent days, I have found out from various citizens of my country of many other cases of discrimination on the criterion of Romanian nationality.
Dear colleagues, it is our duty, as representatives of over 490,000,000 Europeans, to raise an alarm.
Through an active dialogue with our fellow citizens, we can contribute so that such incidents would be avoided in the future.
I consider it to be the European Union's duty, as a democratic entity, to promote respect for the rights of all the Union's citizens by initiating European programmes of education and information against discrimination.
I also request the European Commission to verify whether the Member States comply with the obligations they undertook via treaties, regarding discrimination based on nationality.
(CS) In your contribution you spoke about the importance of ensuring that the International Protectorate in Kosovo remains part of Serbia in conformity with Resolution 1244 and international law.
I am not sure what relation this has with the proclamation of independence of Kosovo, with which you seem to agree.
You are certainly right in saying that it is our duty to ensure that Kosovo become once more multiethnic and democratic.
This unilateral proclamation of independence is an unprecedented breach of international law.
Several hundred thousand inhabitants of this territory, who belong to eight different ethnic groups, were banned from their homes with the silent consent of the occupation forces.
It is difficult to believe that these forces have not been able to create conditions for their return.
Today, instead of helping to create such conditions, you agree with the unilateral proclamation of a second Albanian state.
Mr President, does it not matter to you that the economy of this state seems to be dependant on opium trade in Europe?
The Parliament of the Czech Republic as well as Parliaments of other countries has demanded a solution to this issue through international negotiations.
Let us realise that one-off solutions, as mentioned in your contribution, do not exist.
Any solution sets a precedent.
Let us not allow the breach of the Serbian sovereignty.
Mr KohlÃ­Äek, may I recommend that you read my statement through again.
I think that might clear up any misunderstandings.
(HU) Mr President, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Albanian people of Kosovo on achieving independence, and to pay tribute to the memory of Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
Every settlement plan put forward in the past decade and a half of the Yugoslav region's tragic history has been conceived in terms of peoples' self-regulation, of autonomies, and of power-sharing.
The realisation of the Ahtisaari plan, the latest in a series that includes the Carrington Plan, the Dayton Agreement, the Rambouillet negotiations, and the Ohrid Agreement, also demonstrates that there is still a long way to go before we can consider relations among the different ethnic groups and national communities in our region to have been settled.
It also shows, however, that in future a solution to every crisis can be found by means of international cooperation.
In this sense the Kosovo settlement sets an example and a precedent for us.
We are confident that a successful outcome to the peaceful struggle for autonomy by ethnic Hungarians in Romania, and that of the Szekler Land for territorial autonomy, can also be achieved with the beneficial involvement of the European Union.
(SK) On 25 February 1948 the communists carried out a coup d'Ã©tat and established a totalitarian regime in our country.
This was the result of events that had been taking place in the country since 1946.
Czechoslovakia was gradually losing freedom within the democratic environment of the re-established state.
This is extremely important.
Not only the defeat of Nazism but also the defeat of Communism is part of the heritage of united and peaceful Europe.
Thanks to this event the representatives of ten Member States are able to sit in this House today.
I would like to draw your attention to three issues.
There must be an equal condemnation of the rehabilitation of both the communist and nazi symbols.
Both Communism and Nazism must be perceived as being equal, in particular because of the victims for whom they are responsible.
Both the communist and the nazi totalitarian regimes were established in democratic states through the abuse of democracy.
This is a reason for being vigilant even today, in the European Union.
The victims of Communism would also deserve a minute silence observed in this House.
(EL) Mr President, according to the provisions of the CMO in tobacco, from 2009 the resources that are now given as direct subsidies to growers from pillar 1 will be transferred to pillar 2, which deals with structural measures.
In my country, Greece, tobacco is usually grown in semi-barren areas by poor farmers who have no other options.
Therefore, if tobacco-growing is stopped in certain areas we will have social, economic and environmental problems.
I have also observed that the aim is tobacco-growing rather than smoking.
Thus if we put a stop to tobacco-growing at the same time as smoking, we should all be in agreement, and this is how things ought to be.
This is not the case, however.
The European cigarette industry will continue to produce cigarettes, but all the tobacco will simply be imported from third countries.
We should therefore take the opportunity presented by the CAP review to try to remedy this wrong; we must show that the EU is a place of equality, justice and solidarity.
This is why I ask for the present regime to be maintained after 2009 and for tobacco growers to continue...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) On 4 February 2008, the Romanian Parliament ratified the European Union Reform Treaty.
We welcome this ratification in the Romanian Parliament.
The Reform Treaty reaffirms the principle of equality of its citizens, gives legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, introduces the control of subsidiarity by national parliaments, recognizes universal access to the services of general economic interest, emphasizes the importance of energy security and strengthens the spirit of solidarity between Member States in this field, and imposes special measures to the fight against climate changes.
The introduction of the territorial cohesion concept and its recognition as an objective caused the European Parliament committees, with an important role in defining the structural and cohesion policies, to have increased activity after the ratification of the treaty.
From the point of view of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Reform Treaty legalizes the procedure of co-decision, which is already used in the field of maritime and air navigation and provides a legal basis for the European Parliament to be able to propose support actions for consolidating the identity of the tourism sector.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
This is the umpteenth time that I have spoken in this Parliament about the ongoing contamination of the River Raba over the past seven years.
We have obtained several promises from the Austrian agencies concerned, and indeed the Austrian and Hungarian authorities have devised a plan of action.
The European Union has been observing this process closely, and the river committee set up by the two countries confers regularly - most recently just this week.
It seems that the politicians are doing their bit, but the thing is that in the meantime the river is dying.
Now, moreover, it is dying not only on the Hungarian side, but on the Austrian side too.
Eleven species of fish have so far died out, and 13 are seriously endangered.
Greenpeace has carried out spot checks on water samples on several occasions, and has established that the Austrian factories are illegally contaminating the water, exceeding permitted levels many times over.
On the river itself, meanwhile, there is more foam than ever.
The river I am speaking of is not a sewer, Mr President, but a Natura 2000 site, a genuine river wetland.
The people who live there feel that either the EU legislation is not good, or compliance with it is inadequate.
I think that we in this House must keep this matter on the agenda until it has been resolved once and for all.
Thank you.
I will certainly be doing so.
(RO) Mr. President, dear colleagues, the financial instruments related to the European Union cohesion policy have a major importance in reducing discrepancies between the regions of Europe.
In the case of the newest European Union Member States, the funds allocated by way of the cohesion policy have a crucial contribution to ensuring the future development of the less prosperous regions in these countries.
The absorption rate of these funds in the new Member States is continuously increasing.
The Union has to adjust the resources allocated by the instruments of the cohesion policy to the reality of an enlarged Europe.
Following Romania's and Bulgaria's accession, the guarantee of increasing the financial resources of the cohesion policy after 2013 has become a requirement.
The increase of the cohesion funds is a logical consequence of the recent Union enlargement and it will prove the consistency of the Union's policy as regards the European regions that are less developed and will represent a strong political signal to the new Member States.
(SK) Recently we have had much debate about energy efficiency.
Practice shows that current labelling of domestic appliances that informs consumers about how energy-intensive the appliances are does not represent reliable evidence.
Since most appliances sold in shops belong to category A, clear information about the energy savings generated from the use of the appliance is lost and the manufacturer loses the motivation to produce an energy-efficient appliance.
If we want to motivate consumers and manufacturers, we have to ensure that domestic appliances are sorted according to new energy categories.
The original categorisation of appliances has been in operation since 1994.
I appeal to the European Commission to speed up both the preparation of the new system of labelling appliances and the process of including other appliances in this system that is also under way.
Mr President, I wish to raise an issue in relation to the payment of REPS to farmers.
Over the last 14 years, REPS have been paid at a very early stage once the documentation has been filed with the Commission or with the Department of Agriculture in Ireland.
I now understand that the payments are going to be delayed, and that over 6 000 farmers are already behind in respect of receiving payments.
I also understand that this figure will rise to over 60 000 in the next few months.
The point is that farmers have planned their financial affairs for a 12-month period and have planned with their banks, and now many of them will not be able to make their repayments to the banks as a result of this change.
I would ask for my views to be conveyed to the Commissioner and for this matter to be resolved so that the old procedure -which was in place for 14 years - can be restored.
(FR) Mr President, international law is quite clear on this point.
As far as Kosovo is concerned a state is said to exist when, firstly, it has a population, secondly a territory and, thirdly, public services.
There are no public services in Kosovo, and the Commission only needs to go there to see as much.
The only service that operates there is the mafia.
A state is sovereign when it has full powers of authority.
Proof, as the President of Parliament has just told us, that Kosovo's powers of authority have been in a state of supervised sovereignty.
A state is sovereign when its authority is independent, autonomos in Greek, that is to say when it can decide for itself what it does.
In Kosovo it is NATO and the United States that decide.
A state is sovereign when its authority is exclusive.
Within the territory of Kosovo, however, there are several forces at work, not just a single one.
A state is sovereign when it respects the principle of uti possidetis, the inviolability of borders.
In other words, Kosovo does not meet any of the criteria required of a sovereign state under international law.
And why?
Because after setting up delinquent states and gangster states we are now inventing laboratory states where the European Commission tests and invents federalism by breaking-up countries.
(SK) Kosovo's declaration of independence yesterday probably is, and will be, a dangerous precedent for the development of various countries and regions of the world.
The fact that this act has enjoyed significant political and diplomatic support of the US and of the majority of the large states of the European Union makes it even more questionable, as it has been clear since the beginning that this is a violation of international law.
A much better solution for the Balkans would be for the European Union to contribute to greater democratisation in Serbia.
This would in turn create a more positive atmosphere in the process of consolidation of relations between the Serbs and the Albanian minority in their common territory.
Of course this would clearly be a long-term affair.
It is also naive to think that the calls for the rights of minorities to territorial autonomy, boosted by this precedent, will not become an irresolvable problem even for the Member States of the European Union themselves in the near future.
Mr President, could I support my colleague and urge the Commission not to keep picking rows with different sections of the Irish authorities for the next few months, because we have a rather important job on hand?
Need I spell out exactly what will be required of the Irish in relation to the Lisbon Treaty?
I rise particularly to complain about the way the officials have picked on the REPS payment system in Ireland.
For over 14 years the Department of Agriculture authorities in Ireland - with the acquiescence of the Commission - had a scheduled payment of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme payments to thousands of farmers and their families.
Now this year, in the last month, the Commission have decided that it cannot be paid now, it must be paid at the end of the year.
Please do not pick rows with Irish farmers or any section in Ireland this year above all years, and let them have the monies they are entitled to have, in the way they have been paid for over 14 years now.
Now is not the time to pick rows.
Please hear us.
That concludes the item.
Request for defence of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Witold Tomczak (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Sakalas, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of Witold Tomczak.
rapporteur. - Mr President, in April 2005 Mr Tomczak requested that the European Parliament defend his immunity in criminal proceedings, but Parliament decided, a year later, not to defend his immunity.
On 21 May 2007, Mr Tomczak again requested that the European Parliament defend his immunity.
In the new request, Mr Tomczak presented three new arguments concerning the same case.
The first argument: Mr Tomczak complains that the Court of OstrÃ³w did not grant him access to the files of the case.
However, after examination of his complaint, it was found that Mr Tomczak was granted access to the files when he visited the court himself.
He even photographed at least one of the documents.
The second argument: Mr Tomczak claims that the proceedings are not objective, as the supervisory judge made a request to the judge presiding in the case to deliver the judgment as soon as possible, even without the presence of the accused.
However, this request was issued after Mr Tomczak had failed to appear at the court hearings on as many as 12 occasions.
The third argument: Mr Tomczak alleges that the Court of OstrÃ³w is prejudiced against his person.
However, the fact, declared by Mr Tomczak, that the judge presiding in the case lives in the same town as the prosecutor against whom Mr Tomczak had previously filed charges does not in itself prevent that judge from acting objectively.
In addition, Mr Tomczak has the opportunity to appeal to a higher court and to make a cassation complaint to the Polish Supreme Court.
The argument put forward by Mr Tomczak, who was a member of the Polish Parliament in 1999, that his national parliamentary immunity remained a formal obstacle to the criminal proceedings should be duly considered by the Polish judicial authorities.
The problematic legal consequence that, according to Polish law, Mr Tomczak might lose his seat in this Parliament has been noted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, and its chairman put an oral question to the Commission.
It was answered on 14 January 2008 by Commissioner Frattini, who promised to address the Polish authorities, with the aim of ensuring that Polish law does not discriminate between Members of the European Parliament and national parliamentarians.
After the debate with the Commission, the Committee on Legal Affairs took a decision not to recommend the defence of Mr Tomczak's parliamentary immunity on the above grounds.
It is clear that Articles 8 and 9 of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities are not applicable in the case of Mr Tomczak.
His request should be treated as a request for a decision of the European Parliament to ask for suspension of the proceedings against him, as, for example, is possible under Article 105 of the Polish constitution.
Following its established practice, Parliament could decide to defend the immunity of one of its Members if a suspicion existed that the prosecution was based on an intention to prejudice a member's political activities (fumus persecutionis).
There is no clear evidence of this kind in the case of Mr Tomczak.
In the light of the above considerations, I recommend that the immunity of Mr Tomczak should not be defended.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the main purpose of parliamentary immunity is to protect Parliament itself as a democratically elected representative body.
It ensures the collective independence of this institution against external pressure and guarantees Members freedom of speech and action whilst undertaking their parliamentary duties.
The legal basis of the immunity of Members of the European Parliament is laid down in the 1965 Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities.
Article 8 of the Protocol states that Members of the European Parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties.
Similarly, Article 9 states that during sessions of the European Parliament, its Members shall enjoy in the territory of their own State, the immunities accorded to members of their parliament, and in the territory of any other Member State, immunity from any measure of detention and from legal proceedings.
This immunity also applies to Members while they are travelling to and from the place of meeting of the European Parliament.
Pursuant to the above, it should be noted that the charge against Mr Tomczak does not relate to opinions expressed or votes cast by him in the course of his official duties, because he was not a Member of the European Parliament at the time of the events in question.
In view of the circumstances, therefore, there is no legal basis for granting Mr Tomczak parliamentary immunity.
Mr Tomczak's case has, however, highlighted the lack of consistency between arrangements for election to the Polish Sejm and the European Parliament in Poland regarding conditions to be met by candidates for election, and the circumstances in which after being elected individuals may be deprived of their seat.
This matter was debated at a special sitting and when Poland joined the Union it undertook to comply with the EU legislation in force, notably regarding its direct implications for the internal legislation of a Member State.
I would like to take this opportunity to call for legislation relating to the status of Members of the Polish Sejm and European Parliament to be harmonised at the earliest opportunity.
As things stand at present, a Member of the European Parliament may automatically lose his or her seat as a result of certain actions, whilst a Member of the Polish Sejm may not be penalised in any way for the same actions.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Tomczak's case is an example of the Polish judicial system's failure to recognise that when Poland became a Member of the European Union it undertook to comply with the legal system in force in the latter.
The European Parliament has not yet taken a decision on Mr Tomczak's immunity, but the competent court nonetheless set 15 February, last week, as the date for a sitting.
Not only does such action by the court amount to contempt of the European Parliament, but it also fails to comply with the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure and with the Polish Penal Code, pursuant to which no penal proceedings may be brought against a Member until the European Parliament has ruled on the issue of immunity.
The situation I have outlined leads to the conclusion that in Mr Tomczak's case we are dealing either with an exceptionally incompetent court or, alternatively, with a court intent on convicting Mr Tomczak for a minor incident, which in his case would result in him losing his seat in the European Parliament.
Mr President, I urge all Members to vote against the lifting of immunity in the Tomczak case.
We have had a very good debate in the Chamber.
Everyone has agreed that we cannot allow Poland to set double standards: one for MPs at home and another, much stricter one, for MEPs here.
The responsible Commissioner, Mr Frattini, promised to send a letter to the Polish Minister for Justice to insist on identical rules for waiving immunity.
I talked with Commissioner Frattini after the meeting on 14 January, and met with him again two weeks ago, when he said that he had instructed the services to send the letter.
Last week I was in contact with his office. It confirmed that the letter had been sent, and that I would receive a copy of the letter the same day.
Then somebody suddenly called from Commissioner Frattini's office telling me a different story, saying that the letter was still pending.
So here we are, with no letter and no answer from the Polish Government.
Our rules are very clear: we have to have a vote.
I would therefore ask you to vote against the waiving of immunity, and request that the case be referred back to the committee for a possible new decision once we have received the letter from Commissioner Frattini and the answer from Poland.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I think that the consequences of the issue of waiving immunity are not the same as waiving immunity.
Mr Tomczak was expected and summoned to appear before a court 12 times, but he did not appear at court.
All the procedural and substantive questions raised in connection with Mr Tomczak's case, and especially the question of the alleged insulting language used against the police officers, should be resolved objectively by the Polish judicial authorities.
Therefore, I would like to stress two points.
The question of whether the immunity of Mr Tomczak was properly waived at the beginning of the proceedings, when he was a member of the Polish Parliament, is a question that can be verified only by the appropriate judicial authority in Poland, in this case the District Court in OstrÃ³w Wielkopolski.
There is always the possibility of appeal.
Secondly, the possibility of Mr Tomczak's losing his seat in this Parliament cannot be considered as a motive for the prosecution, as, at the time of the incident of 19 June 2004, Mr Tomczak was not a Member of the European Parliament, and the law applicable to national parliamentarians does not contain provisions for such consequences.
On the basis of the above considerations, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should not defend the parliamentary immunity of Mr Tomczak.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Transparency in financial matters (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on transparency in financial matters.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to speak on behalf of the Commission on this key issue of transparency.
I must thank Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz for this own-initiative report and the Committee on Budgetary Control for its valuable contribution.
The report addresses five main issues.
First, the report gives guidance on the publication of information about those receiving EU funds through grants and contracts.
We are working to implement the terms of the modified Financial Regulation on transparency.
These terms were included through Parliament's efforts and came into force in May 2007.
With regard to direct management, the Commission launched a website last year, with a single portal giving access to all relevant sites in the various directorates-general.
Although we continue to update these sites, the portal still seems a rather confusing and complicated entry point.
The Commission services are working to improve this.
Regarding shared management, the role of the Commission is to 'finalise and agree with Member States on the common standards of these sets of information before April 2008'.
I am quoting here from the draft discharge report by Mr JÃžrgensen.
The Member States will remain responsible for the data.
The Commission assumes responsibility for the standards applicable and checking that Member States respect the terms of the Financial Regulation.
The second issue in Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz's report is the issue of recoveries.
I clearly said in the Committee on Budgetary Control in January 2008 that 'the Commission has so far been unable to give Parliament a comprehensive picture of all our recovery efforts'.
I gave an estimate for the recoveries made in 2006 and announced improvements to our own systems, so that, this year, the ABAC accounting system will include more detailed and complete data on recoveries.
We are discussing the methodology for doing so with the European Court of Auditors.
Information about recoveries would be incomplete without reliable input from the Member States.
For agriculture, the picture is encouraging.
Tomorrow, the Commission will adopt an action plan to strengthen our supervisory role regarding the Structural Funds, addressing this issue among other things.
The third issue in the report relates to the declaration of financial interests and, in particular, to the results of an independent comparative study launched in July 2006, in the context of the European Transparency Initiative, and published in 2007.
The study concluded that most of the European institutions are regulated more intensively than institutions at national level.
The Commission and the European Investment Bank have the most comprehensive ethical rules of the EU institutions.
While the study noted that the Commission has a relatively well developed system for notification of conflicts of interests, it suggests that consideration be given to enlarging the mandate of our ad hoc Ethical Committee to include a broader advisory role.
I invite you to examine the study and draw whatever conclusions you think are relevant for the European Parliament.
The fourth issue raised by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz concerns the composition of experts groups advising the Commission.
I would like to thank Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz for recognising the value of the work done so far.
We will study the recommendations you make for further improvements.
The fifth and final main issue concerns governance within the institutions.
Last Friday, 15 February 2008, was the deadline for Member States to send in 'annual summaries'.
As of noon today, we had received 22 replies from the Member States.
We are assessing the compliance of these reports with the obligations under the Financial Regulation, and we will report to you as soon as we have a clear picture of this, including with regard to the quality of these reports.
In conclusion, I can declare that we are taking transparency very seriously and that the European Transparency Initiative is delivering on many points raised in the report.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the transparency initiative is probably the greatest success achieved by the Barroso Commission.
I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for your words and for the fact that you want harmonisation of the publication of information on beneficiaries of subsidies.
This was a major point of discussion between Parliament and the Commission last year.
As you know, this House and the PPE-DE Group have always stood by you on the issue of transparency because we want to know whether we are meeting our political objectives via the beneficiaries of the subsidies, in other words, the recipients of the funding.
This is about meeting our political objectives, nothing else, and we need to know more than we do at present.
Commissioner, you are working on new ethical rules.
We believe that the institutions need these rules and the Commissioners themselves need a new code of conduct.
However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, may I remind you that it is not up to the Commission to lay down rules for Parliament.
We make our rules ourselves.
We are not public officials, unlike the members of other EU institutions, although imprecise use of language could create this impression.
We have an amendment to paragraph 22, and I would like to ask you very warmly for your support.
We want to replace the list with a reference to the existing rules.
Lists are all very well, but we want an open form of words which allows us to decide whether we want so many, or perhaps more - or, indeed, fewer - criteria.
We are not satisfied - and this is part of the report - with the difficult question of the recovery of funds which have been paid out incorrectly.
Commissioner, I think this is going to be the major issue for us this year and the main point of conflict between Parliament and the Commission.
This is an area which is anything but transparent.
I would ask you to tackle this problem vigorously.
Recoveries cannot continue in the same random fashion as in the past.
We welcome this week's action plan for the Structural Funds, but this needs to be underpinned with credibility, both for Parliament and for the discharge of the Commission.
Our rapporteur, Javier PomÃ©s Ruiz, has drafted a good and interesting report, and I am sure that with this report as the opinion of Parliament, we will help the Commission to make further progress.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to thank Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz for a very good report which I support in its entirety.
Transparency must be a fundamental principle of the functioning of the European Union.
I should like to begin by saying that I consider the sections of the report concerning better information on the beneficiaries of Union funds and more transparent information on the Commission's web pages to be particularly valuable.
These are important issues.
I would also like to state that those parts of the report underlining the importance of divulging and providing information on the financial interests of holders of public office in the European institutions are equally important.
European Union citizens need to be certain that those who handle Union funds and those who oversee their allocation act impartially and not with a view furthering their private interests.
I believe it was right and proper for this issue to be dealt with so extensively in the report.
With regard to the question asked by Mr Staes, this has of course been discussed in the Bureau and a solution will be found.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz's report is a comprehensive one.
The problem areas are set out well and await the necessary measures.
In this connection I would like to say to the Commission Vice-President, Mr Kallas, that during his term there have been major improvements generally to the Union's openness and transparency and he has been extremely active in this area.
Evidence of this are the many new databases on the internet, but the problem, which the report also mentions is - and this needs to be put right - that the search procedures are still unsatisfactory.
This being the case, the material on the search engines ought to be standardised.
In other words, if there is no proper search procedure there is a danger that a lot of information will be obtained but that its very abundance will harm the quality.
The question of the 'blacklist' of proven fraudulent actions needs to be considered.
In principle our group approves of and is in favour of this list, but we need to ensure in particular that the data protection of individuals is guaranteed and that no one will be blacklisted this way for no good reason or because mistaken procedures were carried out.
Then there is the question of the Advisory Committee on Standards in Public Life.
For the Members of the European Parliament, who are directly elected by the people, it is obviously good to have a procedure which is different from that for civil servants, as Mrs GrÃ€ssle has already said here.
The procedure for elected Members must also be at least as strict, however, because there can be no grounds for asserting that ethical requirements should be relaxed as far as Members of Parliament are concerned.
In many countries money used to finance the election of Members of Parliament is public knowledge, and it might be in order for Parliament to move in that direction, so that national declarations on election funding, on the campaign publicity of candidates and on its financing are included in Parliament's databases, making them visible at European Union level too.
Finally I wish to say that political parties and foundations at European level cannot be made exempt from the general obligation to declare interests and sources of finance.
(Applause)
- (NL) Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and I would like to mention a couple of points before making an appeal to the Council and the Commission.
The first point is that we need to publish the recipients of financial support from the European Union.
This concerns the agricultural sector in particular.
We should treat this information with caution and fairness.
We cannot have a situation where some Member States comply with the disclosure requirement and others do not.
There are links on the Commission website to 14 national websites concerning the recipients of agricultural support, which means that there are another 13 missing.
Perhaps the Commission could explain why that is.
Is this information not available in electronic format or have the Member States still not supplied the figures?
In addition to this, the Commission should think about the protection of those recipients whose details are to be published: protection from radical animal rights activists, for instance, a problem that several Member States, including my own, are having to deal with at the moment.
Finally, the fact is that the data are difficult to compare and so more direction from the Commission is needed.
I understand from the Commissioner that he will take the initiative on this tomorrow in relation to the Structural Funds and I am pleased to hear that.
My second point concerns the annual reports on the activities of the institutions, where there has been some improvement, but this is a sensitive topic.
Now to my appeal, which is related to the fact that 80% of the funds in Europe are not managed centrally but through the Member States or in collaboration with the Member States.
We could improve and tighten up transparency and control at European level for all eternity but as long as the Member States do not take responsibility by means of the National Declarations of Assurance, ensuring balanced control will remain difficult.
It takes two to tango.
We can dance the most brilliant spirited dance through the field of budgetary control at European level, but as long as the Member States do not dance along it will never be a prize-winning performance.
I therefore call on the Member States to accept their responsibilities and I call on the Commission to support this process in connection with the national declarations, like a good conductor, shall we say, or like a dance teacher: you should know that yourself, Commissioner.
We on this side would like to count on your support.
(PT) Mr President, I must congratulate our rapporteur and also Mr Kallas on this initiative.
However, in the same breath, I must tell Mr Kallas that I would be much happier if he had taken the steps needed to ensure that the European Commission was complying with the Financial Regulation rules which entered into force on 1 January 2007, particularly on the designation of end beneficiaries of the various Community funds.
It is really a matter of great concern that the European Commission's answer to the question of whether the IMG has been lawfully and properly designated as an international organisation is wholly unsatisfactory.
I would like to know, Commissioner, whether, in addition to this new international organisation, the European Commission has also decided to meet with others, so that we can find out who has access to Community funds without having to go through the tender procedure.
(PL) Mr President, the allocation of funds from the various budget lines always awakens the strongest emotions and debate.
It is entirely understandable that those who are awarded funding should rejoice, and that those who are not awarded any despite their merits should voice their criticism.
If, however, as in the recent notorious Polish case, an entity obtains funding from one government only to have it taken away by another, a number of concerns emerge.
What principles determine the allocation of funds, and what procedures apply?
Are decisions made on the basis of facts or of base politics?
That is why, pursuant to the report by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, we should focus not only on the clarity and transparency of procedures, but also enable society to assess the actions involved in awarding funding.
Publishing information on beneficiaries of Union funding is a fundamental condition of the transparency of the intentions of the European Commission and the government.
Why then are certain countries so opposed to publication?
Do they have something to hide?
This also involves information on individuals holding public office and experts at the European institutions.
Our Union would benefit greatly from the creation of a common ethical space.
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz.
I am not doing it only because he is standing next to me and kicking me in the ankle, but because I think his report is very good indeed.
I would like to make three points, if you would allow me.
Firstly, I think that the aim of this report is basically to improve transparency and improve controls.
Usually you do that three ways.
One is to have transparency in terms of documentation: that is quite well provided for under Article 255 of the EC Treaty; secondly, transparency of finances, which is what we are doing in this report; and thirdly, of course, transparency of meetings.
The sad thing I find in this debate - not so much inside but outside this Chamber - is that there are a lot of anti-Europeans that are using transparency in a very populist way, in the sense that, on one hand, they call for transparency, then when transparency is given, they start attacking people for it.
I find this debate, in that sense, a little bit sad, and I think that, when we go transparent, we should be honest and straightforward about it.
Point number two is on national declarations.
I would like to second what Ms De Lange said about those.
We should always stress that.
I think Mr Kallas is doing a very good job.
The Commission is doing a good job.
But 80% of all the funds are actually spent by the Member States.
That is where we need a little bit more in the financial declarations.
I am sure, Mr Mulder, if he was here, would agree with me.
The final point I have is on the famous, or perhaps infamous, paragraph 22 of this report.
I see where it is coming from, but I think we should not throw the baby out with the bath-water.
Therefore, I would recommend that we get rid of paragraph 22, so that all of us can easily vote for this report, because, after all, being against transparency is a little bit like being against peace and motherhood.
(ES) Mr President, I wish to add my congratulations to the rapporteur, who has produced an extremely interesting report, and of course also thank the Commission, represented by its Vice-President Kallas, for all its work, positive dialogue and cooperation with the House.
Here I simply wish to expand a little on the comments already made, most of which I agree with, and say, beyond the actual need for this information and for transparency, that it must be easily accessible, reliable and comparison-friendly; the information should be organised and classified and be of real practical use, not only for the greatest experts, but for the public at large.
As regards shared management funds, in addition to what has already been said, we need to put pressure on the Member States in this regard, and in particular try to find instruments that improve the situation with international organisations, which often seem opaque.
I certainly welcome the idea of creating a common ethical space.
This is a luxury the Commission can certainly afford, and it could be exported or proposed in certain global negotiations as an example of good practice.
I therefore particularly welcome the study being carried out by the Commission on the ethical codes and standards that may subsequently be applied to each institution.
Finally, I congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for accepting my request concerning a code of ethics for OLAF, which is absolutely essential: on one side we have those responsible and the guilty parties, and on the other the innocent parties, whom we must protect by all means.
(FI) Mr President, first I want to join those who have congratulated and thanked the rapporteur, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, for an absolutely splendid report.
At the same time I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Kallas, who over the years has worked very hard to promote these issues.
The idea behind this report is such that hardly anyone here can disagree with its objectives.
Any form of openness and transparency regarding the misuse of EU funds can only be for the good.
In general the use of appropriations financed though tax revenues must be open.
The taxpayer must always have accurate and proper knowledge of what their money is being spent on.
The public must always be able to tell who is spending the money, and on what, and how much is being spent.
We must in particular adhere to the principle of right of access and transparency when these funds are being misused.
In my opinion, publishing the 'blacklist' of fraudulent uses of EU funds would also pre-empt possible cases of abuse and so promote openness and transparency in the use of EU resources.
This kind of monitoring is obviously made challenging by the fact that the systems in different countries vary greatly, and for that reason it is difficult.
I believe the report is an important step forward, and we need to find a common compromise so that the report can be adopted here and not thrown out because of a few small details.
(DE) Mr President, I think this is a particularly good debate.
However, I would like to warn about the abuse of transparency.
Some populists - although they are not here in this chamber today - abuse this debate in the public arena, but in doing so, make no distinction between the private sphere and what is appropriate in the public interest.
We must not lose sight of this privacy debate.
We are aware that there is also justification for data protection.
Finding a balance here is the right response from the European Parliament for the future.
(DA) Mr President, it is a pleasure to attend the debate today.
I recall a few years back that there were a few idiots who were demanding transparency, but now Parliament consists of nothing but idiots who are insisting upon transparency regarding the presentation of accounts.
In addition, we have a commissioner whom we cannot criticise; instead we must also praise him for his personal contribution towards including the more sluggish parts of the Commission within the transparency reforms.
However, I have not been elected to offer praise; I have been elected to highlight the more thorny aspects of the debate.
Therefore, I would like to ask Mr Kallas whether next year there will be exceptions within the area of agriculture for which there will not be a full presentation of accounts on the Internet, and for which we will not be able to see who receives what and the corresponding amounts in other areas.
Will there be exceptions, or will every expense be accounted for on the Internet?
And what about the working groups: will the names of all the experts be given?
Finally, now that we have progressed so far with transparency, would it not also be a good idea to send an apology to the heroes Dorte Schmidt-Brown, Hans-Martin Tillack, Marta Andreasen and all those who have been badmouthed over the years, but who were the reason that you, Mr Kallas, have been able to achieve such success with your reforms?
(PL) Mr President, clarity and transparency are fundamental principles of life in society.
Particular responsibility for the challenges involved rests with us parliamentarians.
We are the ones who meet the voters and it falls to us to explain the current situation in the Union and its administration to them.
We cannot say: 'It is not us, it is the Commission'.
European citizens look to their Members of Parliament for answers.
All too often, on the pretext of creating transparency, we complicate procedures and impose too many requirements regarding beneficiaries.
For example, we insist on documents that are often unnecessary.
As we build transparency, we must define roles clearly and distribute them.
I repeat, we must distribute roles and tasks between the Member States and the European Union.
Mr President, I want to make two points.
First of all, if we want to follow the Lisbon Strategy we have to know who in the field of science gets the money and what for.
Is it really the best, or are there some divisions between the more privileged Western countries and the other, new ones?
I, as an academic, would claim that there has to be more justice and evenness.
My second point is that, when we give money - with a pretty generous heart - to third countries, to those that are underdeveloped and less privileged, I would like to get some feedback on how that money is used, in particular under those soft programmes like democratisation or similar, which do not produce tangible things but change minds, or entrepreneurship.
We know little of how that money is used in Africa, and in all ACP countries.
I would really claim that we have to have some more knowledge about it.
Mr President, I want to take issue with three of the speakers.
Firstly, Mr SeppÃ€nen, I would like to congratulate him on his speech, because it was extremely moderate, and he is slowly moving - almost - towards the pro-European camp.
Secondly, Mr Bonde: the way in which he talks about transparency makes me believe that he is a federalist.
So, in that sense, I think that he is also moving in exactly the right direction - even if the request to publish all the people who sit on comitology committees is, perhaps, pushing it a little bit!
My final comment concerns Mr RÃŒbig.
I agree with him 100%: the type of populism that we see in the Austrian media from the anti-European side is simply abominable, and I really would not like to see any more of that.
I have one more question for the rapporteur, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz: if there was one thing he would like to take out of this report, what would it be?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank honourable Members very much for their support for this transparency action, which has been a common action: in all issues, the Commission has always felt it had strong support from Parliament.
There are two things I want to say.
The first concerns the information available on end beneficiaries.
I consider this to be an amazing change.
When, together with some Members of Parliament, we started to initiate this at the beginning of 2004, there was no great hope that it would be implemented.
But the political decision has now been taken, and the year 2009 is the final year by which the information on end beneficiaries of 2008 will and must be published.
So, politically the decision has been taken.
This is a great step forward.
Now the technicalities remain to be solved.
That is not easy at all, because guidelines have now been issued on what this information on end beneficiaries should look like.
But of course many of you raised the issue of workable search engines, and this is really not an easy task.
Of course, we will have a portal via which it will be possible to access the information in the Member States, and access information about end beneficiaries.
I foresee a lot of technical problems, but those technical problems - nothing is perfect, and everything takes a little time - definitely should not undermine the importance of this great change.
Concerning the famous national declarations, I must again say that the situation has completely changed in these three years.
When I first appeared in Council to discuss these issues, these were completely out of the question.
Today you have the annual summaries - we had already received 22 so far, and perhaps even more now.
We will assess the quality together, and there definitely will be an improvement.
So the understanding is that we have shared management problems, and we must also share information about the work - how we manage the Structural Funds.
That understanding has increased tremendously in Member States too.
We will also try to fill out the idea of more comprehensive national declarations with specific substance.
You know as well as I do that there are certain Member States that are still very reluctant to have this greater involvement, but we already have a certain degree of involvement.
As concerns international money, that is a something of a different issue.
The issue of how this information should be made available will probably also be discussed within the framework of COCOBU.
However, we are partners in international agreements and do not manage them directly.
Information on what we manage directly must be made available, but we are partners in very big international poolings.
That is a little different.
Concerning expert groups, as I said in COCOBU, I can repeat here that we have a commitment to publish the list of permanent experts.
This is really a question of definition: what kind of experts should be included on this list.
This is a debate, and some experts who fulfil certain confidential tasks of assessing projects and people should not be so transparent, probably.
There are some nuances.
However, the commitment exists and I have been informed that we are ready to publish a long list of permanent experts.
There is the question of all those national experts sent by Member States participating in certain bodies, whose names will be sent afterwards, not before, but there is at least the commitment that there should be no big secret as to who is advising us.
My last point, in response to an issue which was raised, is that the Commission has no intention to propose how Parliament should deal with its own rules, and what the declarations of economic interest should consist of.
I can say only two things: this ethical space is a common space - if something happens in one institution, it definitely has an immediate effect on other institutions.
We must, of course, address all these questions on the basis of common sense, and not go to absurd lengths and into unnecessary details, but only into the relevant issues, in order to avoid a real conflict of interests.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Mr Kallas can feel pleased with himself because he realises the transparency initiative is one which is much appreciated and dear to the hearts of the entire House, and because he has now experienced the support that can be found here.
Mr Kallas, we wish to go further with regard to transparency, and in the report we outlined some of the areas in which progress ought to be made: recoveries, expert groups or the presumption of innocence.
Nevertheless, I urge you: this must remain within the confines of common sense, with no consideration for the populism of certain elements of the gutter press that seems to devote itself to earning money through its populist exaggerations of serious topics in the European Union.
I wish to thank InÃ©s Ayala for her suggestion that OLAF should concern itself with these matters too, and Mr JÃžrgensen, Paulo Casaca, Mr BÃ¶sch, who is present, and my colleagues Ingeborg GrÃ€ssle, Alex Stubb, etc.
I would like to say that Alex Stubb also asked me what I would take out, and I must say that, for instance, I would remove the reference to a spouse's activity.
I remember that the greatest problem in the European Union was caused not by a spouse, but something similar: I refer to the case of Edith Cresson.
By this I mean that we should not be placing such restrictions on ourselves, and we should do what is logical, not what is illogical.
Indeed, even Members of this House also have a right to family life and private life.
I also wish to say that we will continue to set an example for many Member States of how the EU is spending its funds better and more efficiently, with low administrative costs and much more effectively than certain Member States.
In this preliminary mission on which we all agree, several Member States - those that refuse to give explain how they spend 80% of Community funds and then seem to be all smiles when we refuse to approve the EU accounts - use this to justify giving less money to the common fund, limiting EU activity, abusing our accusations that it is the Member States that do not spend correctly and using this argument to refuse to give this House more than 1%.
Thank you, Mr President, and may I also wish Mr Kallas well in securing an objective so warmly supported by Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual reports 2005 and 2006 (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Musotto, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual reports 2005 and 2006.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Kallas for his valuable cooperation with Parliament during its work.
I am likewise grateful to OLAF, in the person of the Director, Franz-Hermann BrÃŒner, for its unstinting support and for the vital work it does, which is far from easy.
Finally, I would thank all my colleagues for their helpful contributions, as well as all the national bodies and institutions that have cooperated with us in this arduous task, especially - if I may - the Italian Guardia di finanza, whose approach in this field has been highly professional.
Protection of the Communities' financial interests is a subject of capital importance which affects us directly as States and as citizens; it must therefore be tackled with all due rigour and determination.
Today's resolution is intended as a practical response to the alarming phenomenon of Community fraud.
The data gathered...
(The President interrupted the speaker to reprimand some Members who were causing a disturbance)
Thank you, Mr President.
We are talking about transparency and there is also a need for common courtesy.
Today's resolution is intended as a practical response to the alarming phenomenon of Community fraud.
The data gathered are worrying: in the areas of own resources, agricultural expenditure and structural actions, irregularities notified in 2006 totalled EUR 1 143 million, compared to EUR 1 024 million in the previous year.
The statistics reveal an ever-increasing number of irregularities.
I would however point out that a large number of irregularities does not necessarily imply a high level of fraud; it may also demonstrate that the supervisory arrangements in place are effective and that there is close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission.
In its annual report for 2006, the Commission rightly emphasised the importance of such cooperation for prevention purposes and for recovery work.
So far, the statistics have relied on very diverse national structures with different administrative, judicial, supervisory and inspection systems.
In particular, we consider it unacceptable that Spain and Germany have not been forwarding information on irregularities to the Commission in electronic form, despite an obligation on all Member States to do so.
The Community rules and the obligations arising from the fight against fraud must be implemented in the same way by all countries.
To this end, closer cooperation between Member States and the Commission is vital to protect the Community's financial interests, which must be perceived as common interests going beyond those of individual states.
Greater synergy is required between the supervisory authorities and local administrations in terms of coordinating and exchanging information.
Keeping the organisation and disbursement of funds at central level necessitates complex implementation arrangements and increases distances between the financial authorities and the final beneficiaries.
Simplification of the rules is another fundamental point touched upon in the report.
The 2000-2006 programming period in fact proved that overly complicated rules contributed to the irregularities detected.
Finally, despite a slight improvement in recovery activity, recovery is still a problem which causes immense damage to the Community budget.
In particular, a period of 39 months between the time when an irregularity is committed and the time when it is notified to the Commission is unacceptable, as such a delay makes recovery more difficult if not impossible.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, Mr Musotto's report covers two years of efforts to improve the protection of the financial interests of the European Union.
A sound system of financial management needs to focus on expenditure and the control and fighting of irregularities, and especially those committed with fraudulent intent.
The report contains many of the same preoccupations as the discharge report, with the protection of financial interests being viewed, of course, as a core element of sound financial management, but the focus is different.
I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, for a very focused report, which concentrates on the main issues and makes many calls on the Commission to strengthen efforts.
Allow me to comment on four of them.
Firstly, the role of Member States: the report makes use of the wealth of figures and statistics on irregularities by Member States, and their financial impact.
It does not hesitate to point out that some Member States perform better than others.
I would stress once again that a high number of irregularities does not necessarily mean a high level of fraud, but it can be a good indicator of effective and thorough controls.
When I presented the Commission report in July, I emphasised the need for Member States to ensure a correct, complete and timely communication of data on irregularities.
A good flow of information between the Member States and the Commission is essential for effective recovery and joint action against fraudsters.
Many of them are doing this, but for some there is still room for improvement.
The Commission, with the support of the European Parliament, will not shy away from reminding them of their responsibility.
I fully agree with the invitation expressed in the report for the Council to take up the annual reports and consider them at ministerial level.
The EU's financial management system is complex, because responsibility is shared with the Member States.
The increased focus on the national declarations, placing responsibility for spending with the Member States, should go hand in hand with cooperation over tackling irregularities and fighting fraud.
I very much welcome the report's focus on systemic and general issues rather than on individual cases, for which, as you know, OLAF is independent in its investigations.
The Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament on the need to analyse in greater depth the structures existing in Member States in charge of combating irregularities, to support them and facilitate cooperation and the exchange of information.
This will be taken up in the 2008 report.
This year's Commission report highlights the topics of risk analysis and risk management, exclusion databases and early-warning/whistleblower tools.
In addition, the report examines the steps taken by Member States to improve recovery of amounts not collected or wrongly paid, as well as the mechanisms under national law for recovery by offsetting.
The report also contains information on amounts recovered and the financial corrections, in particular when a payment has not been made in conformity with Community rules.
The role of organised crime, such as the Mafia, in undermining the EU's financial interests is a subject close to the heart of the rapporteur.
OLAF has contributed to the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA) produced by Europol.
I am happy to report that I have asked both bodies to continue to cooperate on the matter.
Value added tax and customs fraud is where the big money is.
Sadly, it is an area where cooperation with Member States is often difficult.
I will be very brief, and refer to what I will say on the Newton Dunn report, and thank the European Parliament for its ongoing support in underlining the useful role that cooperation at EU level can bring in this area.
My fourth and last comment will be on the revision of the OLAF regulation.
The Commission tabled a proposal in this regard in May 2006.
I remain convinced that it raises the main important issues relating to the effective functioning of the anti-fraud office, namely the flow of information, procedural rights and the complaints mechanism, the role of the supervisory committee and, more generally, governance and accountability.
I very much hope that we can enter into interinstitutional discussions on finding solutions in the very near future and make progress on these important points.
The Musotto report reiterates the desire to group together anti-fraud legislation.
From a political viewpoint I fully support this, but technically it will be a challenging task.
The Commission will be ready to forward the requested analysis to the European Parliament by May this year.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a report on the protection of the financial interests of the EU with the somewhat equivocal subheading: 'Fight against fraud'.
The actual focus of the report is not fraud as such, but rather irregularities.
While fraud presupposes malicious intent, an irregularity can result from negligence or incorrect accounting procedures.
In delicate areas such as financial relations within the EU such terminology, should be used circumspectly.
As the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Development, I regret the increase in the number of irregularities detected in projects financed from Structural Funds.
This reflects negatively on some Member States and their internal control mechanisms.
Difficulties on the part of these countries should not, however, become a reason to re-evaluate the existing system of decentralised controls governing the use of Structural Funds.
The responsibility is evident; it is individual and as such it also has to be enforceable.
Attaining an appropriate level in financial control mechanisms in individual Member States is the first necessary step.
The following step is to ensure the recovery of sums unduly paid.
A possible approach to this could be the suspension of regular payments to those Member States procrastinating over returning amounts paid under irregular circumstances.
The existence of imperfect control mechanisms has the potential to undermine confidence in the Structural Funds system and could cast a negative light on the EU as a whole.
Furthermore, we need controls with greater openness and transparency.
I would therefore like to express my support for the European Transparency Initiative, according to which information on beneficiaries of assistance from Structural Funds would be published.
As we are talking about managing public funds, certain demands should be placed on the beneficiaries of such assistance.
A prerequisite of a better assessment of control systems is closer collaboration with the Court of Auditors, which has to date been lacking.
Whilst it is true that reports from the Court of Auditors make for tedious reading for the European institutions, this should be all the more reason to devote more attention to them, and is certainly preferable to burying one's head in the sand and avoiding responsibility.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FI) Mr President, Francesco Musotto has produced an excellent report on the annual reports of the European Anti-Fraud Office 2005-2006, and I want to express my sincerest thanks for that.
The number of irregularities notified by the Member States rose in 2006 to the equivalent of EUR 1 143 million.
Of this, the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund accounts for an amount of EUR 87 million.
Although this is just 0.17% of the total for agricultural expenditure, EUR 49.7 billion, it nonetheless has to be viewed seriously.
Approximately a third of these irregularities were cases of direct fraud.
With the new Regulation the Member States will be able to recover unjustified payments of aid more easily than before.
That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgetary Control consider it regrettable that the level of recovery of this aid remains low.
The Commission should speed up the recovery process and if necessary apply corrective measures.
Both committees also assure the Commission of their full support in rigorously applying the option of suspension of payments if the Commission does not have absolute guarantees that the Member State which is the beneficiary of funds has a reliable management and control system.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EPP-ED Group is responsible for the report on the fight against fraud for the first time and we are very grateful to Mr Musotto for making OLAF's work and the cooperation with the Member States the focus of his report.
He had to work very hard, having to contend with 630 pages of statistical material from 2005 and 2006 on the fight against fraud.
His review reveals a very mixed picture and I believe that we really need to take action here.
Uncovering irregularities does not appear to be a very important issue for the Member States.
This is apparent from the fact that, yet again, the Council is absent from this very important debate, despite the fact that as the second arm of the budgetary authority, it should be concerned about what is happening to the taxpayers' money, which it is responsible for managing and disbursing.
The rapporteur proposes taking formal steps against Germany and Spain for their violations of EU law.
Spain is only providing paper information about irregularities.
Moreover, this information is extremely sketchy, as is apparent from the 18th Structural Funds report.
Germany is a very specific case.
It takes longer to provide the information than the other Member States, and it is the only country which does not disclose names.
How can OLAF do its job without names?
The fraudsters are hiding behind data protection here, for the fact is, Mr BÅezina, that between 15% and 20% of the irregularities have some kind of fraudulent background.
Germany is also putting obstacles in the way of OLAF's investigative work at local level, notably in cases of customs offences and export refunds.
We are calling on the Commission to report on every Member State and its willingness or lack of willingness to cooperate, and to do so by the time the next OLAF report is due.
From our Group's perspective, the forthcoming reform of OLAF's legal basis must be utilised, first and foremost, to improve the working conditions in OLAF's cooperation with the Member States.
I would like to express my warm thanks to OLAF itself and to the staff who are working in a very difficult area.
I think that the outcomes really do stand up to scrutiny.
However, I am also convinced that these outcomes could be improved through better cooperation with the Member States.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group regarding protection of the Communities' financial interests, I should like to draw attention to the following issues.
Firstly, there has been a significant increase in the sums affected by irregularities in the area of own resources, EUR 328 million in 2005 and EUR 353 million in 2006, compared with EUR 212 million in 2004.
I should also mention the increase in irregularities in the area of structural actions: EUR 703 million in 2006 compared with EUR 601 million in 2005.
Secondly, there has been a marked reduction in the sums affected by irregularities in the area of agriculture.
In 2006 the figure was EUR 82 million, compared with EUR 102 million in 2005.
This reduction is worthy of particular note because very often expenditure on agriculture involves huge numbers of beneficiaries - farmers - who often have to cope on their own with the complicated procedure of accounting for the funding received.
Thirdly, I would like to highlight the statement in the report that some of the main reasons for the emergence of irregularities in budgetary expenditure are the complicated programming principles and ineffective monitoring and control methods.
Fourthly, the call for greater transparency when awarding resources should also be noted.
An important feature of this transparency is a commitment by the Member States to publish information on projects and beneficiaries of resources originating in all Community funds.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this report is a long catalogue of failure.
It graphically illustrates how the amount of fraud, described as 'irregularities', is steadily rising and that attempts to deal with it are failing.
It openly admits that fraud in 2006 in the areas of own resources - agricultural expenditure and Member States' structural actions - totalled EUR 1 143 million. It was EUR 922 million in 2003, so in just four years fraud has risen by over EUR 200 million.
I would remind everyone in this institution that these are not meaningless sums of money, but taxpayers' money.
The EU is funded by its citizens, including hard-pressed taxpayers in the UK.
They deserve better than this for their money.
Governments of all Member States should be saying 'enough' already, and these appalling figures provide all the more reason why the government of my country should honour its manifesto commitment to give the British people a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
(DE) Mr President, it is no secret that the European Union has been battling for years to get its finances under control.
We fund major companies which then relocate from one Member State to another, while small and medium-sized enterprises go away empty-handed.
Indeed, the EU often does not appear to know who it is actually funding and who is pulling its strings.
In my view, a register of lobbyists is long overdue.
The numerous irregularities also leave a bitter aftertaste, especially when they have a direct connection to the EU's institutions.
In this context, freezing the EU funding for Bulgaria until the cases of corruption have been cleared up sends out an important signal.
There is also the fact that some Member States apparently have little interest in recovering funds that have been paid out incorrectly.
If cases from the 1990s are only now being closed, then obviously things are moving far too slowly in the EU.
(FI) Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Musotto.
He has done a very thorough and excellent job.
This report is crucially important, and the fight against fraud is something over which the confidence of the public is either won or lost.
I think there are three very important problems contained in this report which need to be put right.
First of all, it is intolerable that some countries do not even provide information on agricultural expenditure.
Germany and Spain are prime examples of this, and Germany does not even provide details of the individuals and companies which the European Anti-Fraud Office would definitely need in order to be able to address these matters.
This is obviously something we cannot allow: all Member States must obey the rules.
If a few big countries set a bad example, the situation does not look very good.
The second issue is that notification of irregularities can take up to 39 months - more than three years.
That is far too long and does not inspire trust in the notion that the Member States are acting with sufficient vigilance.
The third issue, which is very interesting and important, is that specialised and organised crime is also occurring in this area.
This is now so serious that all measures need to be taken to cut this sort of crime.
This is a very important report and every effort needs to be made to improve the situation in order to gain public confidence.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur.
It is not an easy task, coming in new to such a comprehensive dossier, and I think we can be proud that Mr Musotto has done such a magnificent job.
I think we can say this with confidence today, given that there are no amendments to this report for tomorrow.
That, too, is a tribute to the rapporteur.
Secondly, it is apparently of no interest whatsoever to one of the budgetary authorities to find out what is happening to the taxpayers' money.
Once again, the Council is shirking its responsibility.
Whenever we talk about how European taxpayers' money is being spent and try to seek solutions to difficult issues, the Council simply absents itself.
However, we have seen - and this brings me to the issue of what will happen with the discharges in our committee - that for years in the field of agricultural policy, where we have been resolute in our action and developed systems to control direct payments, irregularities have decreased.
In structural policy, on the other hand, where nothing has been done and where we have sat back and watched events unfold for years, the figures have gone up and up.
This has been apparent for years, and has repeatedly featured in the fraud reports for years.
Commissioner Kallas will see in the 2006 discharge that this is a problem and we will expect him to take action and not just sit back and watch.
That is why I would like you, Commissioner, to say this to those Member States which behave as if the rules that we have all devised do not apply to them, and this is also what the rapporteur says, with the full support of all the previous speakers: we want you to say, 'okay, we will put 10% of your funding on ice.
It will form a reserve, and you can have the money once you have taken appropriate action'.
That is a very practical demand from Parliament.
It is not a plan of action; it is practical action.
This is what we expect from the Commission, and then we will be very satisfied.
Once again, congratulations to the rapporteur.
Mr President, like the other speakers, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what is a very important report.
I am prompted to take part in this debate because of the focus on agriculture.
Other speakers have said that there has been an improvement in terms of the controls and inspections, particularly when it comes to money given to farmers, and there is now the transparency initiative to publish what farmers are getting.
One of the difficulties for those in the farming community is that they believe very often they are guilty until proven innocent.
Obviously, none of us can or will condone fraud, and because there is fraud in the EU budget there is a very poor public perception of the European Union and how it accounts for the money collected.
If the public understood the European budget better, they might clamour a little louder for us to be harder on fraud.
It is important to stress the difference between fraud and irregularities, of which many are discovered, because they are very different.
We cannot punish ourselves for irregularities, but we should punish fraud against the Community budget.
This is an issue involving the Member States - as the last speaker said - because all the Member States signed up to the European Union in good faith and have pooled resources in certain policies, and it is up to us to ensure that the money we have pooled is well spent and that there is no fraud against the public purse.
Member States which are light on fraud, and take a light-touch approach, need to be punished in some way, but it is very important that Member States that perform well in this area are not penalised.
It is therefore important for the Commission to take action at Member State level.
I shall finish by reiterating the very important point that, on the farming side, there is now a very strong feeling among those who farm that they are sometimes guilty until proven innocent.
That is unacceptable, and we therefore need to be careful to get the balance right.
- (NL) Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak again.
Anyone who follows me in my political office and my statements knows that I am a critical politician and that I am also highly critical of the European Union but that I am still very strongly pro-European.
I cannot therefore ignore the words of Mr Clark, who has meanwhile left the room.
Like all Eurosceptics, Mr Clark uses half truths, complete lies and lots of oversimplifications on a frequent basis.
He talked in his speech, for instance, of several million euros worth of fraud, while the report clearly states that we are dealing with irregularities.
He invariably substitutes 'fraud' for the word 'irregularities'.
That is crass, because that is not what it says in the report.
Secondly, he talks as if every disaster that befalls us comes from the European Union.
I would just like to ask Mr Clark to read the report of the British House of Lords on VAT carrousels.
Then he will see that his own authorities have not managed to put a stop to this VAT fraud.
We are talking about GBP 3.5 to 4.5 billion of fraud a year.
That is more than GBP 10 million a day!
That is significantly more ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) Congratulations on Mr. Musotto's report.
I consider that many irregularities from 2003-2006 would have the support of changing the rule of presentation of the Framework Programme 6, for instance, as compared to Framework 5.
In Framework 5, the B party was anonymous and any reference to the country and to the person behind the project was penalized.
In Frameworks 6 and 7, the anonymity disappeared.
In Framework 8 is it possible to no longer resort to this system of advanced submission of projects?
(DE) Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak again.
I would like to thank Mr BÃ¶sch, not only for his praise of our rapporteur, but also for his fairness and help.
Mr BÃ¶sch has been dealing with the fraud report for many years.
Now we have this honour, and I think it is a great sign of strength in the Committee on Budgetary Control that we are in agreement here.
We have focused our full attention on the Member States.
The Commission should also take with it the message that we want to help to bring this lack of clarity to an end.
If we look at the figures on the recovery of funds, we see that we are dealing with a very wide range of opinions.
That is why we are having this discussion as part of the current discharge procedure.
Consequently, I really must ask the Commission to have the courage to say if it does not know certain things, so that we can help.
I think that if we tackle the issue together, then together, we will be successful.
Once again, very many thanks to Mr BÃ¶sch.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments on this report.
We consider the report to be very focused and constructive.
I have just two remarks on an issue raised by very many of you - namely, what is irregularity, what is fraud, and how should one approach recovery?
I can say that we have had one preliminary meeting with the relevant people at the Court of Auditors, and tried to harmonise the understanding of what is what.
That will probably also help in all our future debates on discharge, and of course all the three reports - including the next one - are all very closely interrelated.
Secondly, I have raised this issue with the Council Presidency, and asked it to consider this parliamentary report during its proceedings, by which I mean to discuss this document within the framework of Ecofin.
I hope it will do that.
We will definitely, after the vote on this report, when it becomes an official document, also try to initiate this discussion in the Council, including at the level of the relevant subcommittees.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me firstly to thank all my colleagues for their kind words, and especially Mr BÃ¶sch whose earlier work laid the foundations for my own report.
I should like to emphasise a few points, the main one being the meeting of minds with Commissioner Kallas, particularly as concerns the nature of the regulatory mechanisms governing the disbursement of funds.
The Commission has made an undertaking here.
One important aspect underscored by Mr Kallas is that the more difficulties and complications there are, the harder it becomes to understand the rules and the easier it becomes for organised crime above all and for all forms of unlawful activity to move into these grey areas.
Therefore simplification and, even more, a closing of the gap between those disbursing the sums of money and the beneficiaries is another means of achieving clarity, transparency and ease of understanding of the whole system.
The problem of recovery is a very real one.
The procedures are too lengthy, and the capacity to punish those who defraud the European Community must be ensured by some kind of security or guarantee, to be applied through the banks.
It is essential to devise methods of ensuring disbursement and, especially, of making it possible to recover these sums and hence assisting, improving and facilitating the speed of recovery.
I believe that, thanks to the cooperation, good will and political commitment of all of my colleagues, we have done a crucial job of work.
There can be no doubt that this cooperation, this willingness and desire to stamp out a phenomenon that does enormous damage to the European Community is motivated solely by political concerns.
Of course, the absence of the Council has not made matters any easier; the presence of a representative would have enabled us to find out what the Council thinks.
But Parliament is absolutely united and unanimous on these principles, and we therefore believe that we have done something positive which gives us hope for the future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 19 February 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations on this report, which highlights not only the successes of the recent past, but also some lamentable shortcomings and long-standing debts.
For me this report is very topical because in Hungary a decision has been made to establish a national anti-counterfeiting body.
This body will primarily have a coordinating function linking the Hungarian Patent Office, other government agencies and actors in the economy, including functions connected with European Union-related data services.
We need to prepare ourselves for a long and futile battle.
Knowledge - whether protected or in the public domain - is becoming increasingly widely accessible.
A car on display in one room can be copied in the space of 5 minutes in the room next door.
The result will not be any worse, just cheaper: it is up to us to decide whether to go ahead and buy the more expensive item anyway.
We have to decide whether we are willing to pay for the intellectual achievement, the innovation, even if we have the option of choosing the secondary product or service that has no value added.
To do this requires considerable awareness and commitment.
We cannot expect individual citizens to recognise these connections and make decisions based on values if our legislators or governments are unable to do so.
It is particularly important to reduce the number of irregularities relating to use of EU funds to below the tolerable error rate: fraud of this sort makes the European Union as a whole look ridiculous when it involves EU funds being used in a manner that contradicts the declared aims of the EU.
Application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (debate)
The next item is the report by Bill Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters - C6-0033/2007 -.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, this third report is very much linked to the two previous ones.
Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters is a very important piece of legislation dating back to 1997, when we had 15 Member States.
It was essential to propose an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 515/97 in the light of developments in the last decade, technological progress, successful experience with joint customs operations coordinated in Brussels, and the enlargement of the Union to 27 Members.
I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Newton-Dunn, for the way he has guided this proposal through Parliament.
I would also like to thank Mr Audy, who drafted the opinion.
The two committees, IMCO and COCOBU, worked closely together using the enhanced cooperation mechanism.
Their excellent work has enabled a compromise to be brokered between the various political actors.
Thanks to the constructive approach of Parliament, a first-reading adoption of this legislation can now be achieved.
Customs authorities apply controls on goods entering and exiting the Community based upon a common risk management framework, including the use of random checks.
In this context, their task is generally not limited to the enforcement of customs legislation: they also apply Community law in the fields of VAT, excise and agricultural legislation.
I also note that the issue of the fight against VAT fraud and the need for closer cooperation between the Member States and the Commission is strongly emphasised in the Musotto report which we have just discussed.
For this reason, it is crucial that customs authorities and the Commission are allowed to exchange VAT information.
In the case of certain types of data, the new Article 2a makes such an exchange of information possible.
The Commission regards this as the first step in the direction of closer cooperation in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests against VAT fraud.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
I believe this should be a very uncontroversial proposal by the Commission.
As the Commissioner said: enlargement, more Member States, new technology, new equipment, computers.
We need updated Commission legislation to allow good cooperation across internal borders in the Union against the bad guys - the organised criminals and so on.
I talked to the director of a major Anglo-Dutch company last week and he says that he finds organised crime is increasing and - I use the word which he used - 'exponentially', increasing incredibly fast, and yet the Member State governments do nothing about it, because the public does not know the full picture and does not push the governments, so they say, 'Well, don't worry, everything is okay'.
We have a serious problem.
So we need this proposal from the Commission, and everybody should agree and it should go through.
There should be nothing more for me to say, but actually there is a whole story to tell you, Mr President, which I would now like to do.
To my amazement, my own Member State, the UK, threw in a veto in the Council of Ministers, saying that they would not agree to this.
They did not tell me, though I am British, and from the same Member State.
Not a single Labour MEP from the Labour Government in London tabled an amendment to anything, but they chose my good Conservative friend, Christopher Heaton-Harris, a very honourable man, who is going to speak, to pick up the Labour Government's objection and he tabled an amendment, which is slightly weird, but I wish Chris good luck; he is entitled to do that.
But what was the Labour Party doing in all this?
So, I thought, this is very strange, and there are a lot of other British objections and vetoes and opt-outs going on in lots of different policy areas, so I thought I would investigate what the overall UK policy was on all these directives that they are opting out of, what was going on?
I went to OLAF, which deals with fraud in the EU, as we know.
OLAF tells me that the UK refuses to cooperate with it, even though the UK loses billions on VAT carousel fraud.
London says, 'If we give OLAF a finger, they will take our whole arm, so we are afraid, and we will not cooperate'.
This is very weird, so I made further enquiries in London.
How does this work?
And I am told this is what happens: the Commission makes a proposal, then a junior official in the appropriate government department in London has to write a briefing paper to recommend what the Government should do about it.
He is very careful; he is a bit nervous; he does not know what to do, so he says, 'We must not do anything about this.
I recommend great caution.
I do not think we should approve.
Perhaps we should even opt out'.
And his careful paper - because he wants to be promoted and not sacked - goes up the tree in his department, and officials who are busy doing other things say 'okay' and tick it.
Other government departments asked for their opinion do not know either, so they say, 'It seems okay to us'.
It goes finally to a cabinet committee chaired by our Foreign Secretary - and he has a million other things to think about - and so it gets rubber-stamped.
So, suddenly, the Government's position in London is negative, cautious, in favour of an opt-out: 'We do not understand.
We do not really know what is going on'.
Very strange indeed!
So what happens next?
Well, back to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in the Parliament.
The blockage in the Council has meant that I have attended several informal tripartite conciliations with the Council, first of all led by the Portuguese, now led by the Slovenes, in both cases excellently.
And, although no UK official has ever briefed me about anything, and I was therefore the only British person present at the conciliation, even though the British Government apparently has a veto situation on this, it went through.
Finally, the Commission and the Council have found a form of words which has enabled the British objection to be got round, or overcome, or whatever words you like to use.
So the amendments before the Parliament, for voting tomorrow, were all approved by the IMCO Committee and I hope very much that Parliament will vote for them tomorrow.
But what is going on in London, Mr President, I just do not understand.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Audy, who is draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, has been delayed at the last minute and so I am speaking on his behalf.
The correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters plays a decisive role in ensuring that the internal market functions properly.
It is also essential for protecting the financial interests of the Community and, more generally, those of European economic operators and citizens.
The customs files identification database will allow the different services of the Member States and the Commission to cooperate more effectively.
Some of the amendments are aimed at implementing the Court of Auditors' proposals with a view to making the database more useful.
The draftsman shares the Court's concerns about the integrated approach to managing the various databases relating to the fight against fraud, but considers this to be a discussion going beyond the bounds of this Regulation and therefore one which should be conducted in a different context.
The draftsman, Mr Audy, supports the Commission's proposals aiming to promote the added value of cooperation at European level, in particular the European data directory and the platform of services.
In the absence of a more uniform legal framework, an exchange of best practice will ensure an increasingly coherent approach in the medium term.
On the question of financing, the draftsman emphasises that expenses must be clearly identified so as to avoid an overlap between this proposal and other instruments, such as the Hercule II programme.
Finally, the draftsman would like to keep the legislative procedure for the decision on other communication and information exchange systems, including the mandatory opinion of the Court of Auditors, rather than apply the 'comitology' procedure.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Newton Dunn, another honourable Member of this institution, for eloquently painting the picture of how EU matters are dealt with - or how he believes they are dealt with - in London.
Perhaps I can explain what was going on in London and why they came to a Conservative Member of the European Parliament rather than go to a Labour MEP, or indeed to himself.
Actually, I think they should have gone to him, and I cannot believe they did not.
He might not believe me, but I had more contact with the current Presidency-in-Office than I did with anybody from London or the British civil service.
But perhaps it was just the fact that this young civil servant he described had forgotten to read the newspapers and believed that the general election had been called in October, that my party had won it and that the Prime Minister had not dithered, and that, therefore, he was dealing with a member of the Government party.
Alas, that is not the case.
But I do understand what he says about London being concerned about giving OLAF a finger and it taking an arm.
This actually goes back to the structure of OLAF itself, to the wise men's paper back in 1999, and the fact that OLAF is simply not independent of the Commission - something that will be addressed in the future.
There were other problems with this particular dossier: the fact that VAT was being dragged between pillars, possibly - and we needed to get legal advice on that - and the fact that much of this information is already exchanged electronically.
The British Government did believe - and I can see from reading between the lines how it came to that conclusion - that it would need a permanent coordination unit and would need to second people to this, therefore having lots of people in a place rather than just exchanging information electronically.
However, there is no problem with the amendments. There is no problem with the debate.
This should go through very quickly, and I hope it does.
Thank you, Mr Heaton-Harris.
Now that all is clear in London, Europe too feels more at ease.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for having produced an excellent piece of work and for having collaborated so well on what is a particularly sensitive issue.
At a time of increasing trade not only within the Union but also with third countries, the opening-up of markets and expanding commercial activity are set to represent key development factors for Europe for years to come.
However, the gradual removal of the barriers that define the European Economic Area also opens the door to a host of fraudulent activities that threaten the viability of the internal market, with Community producers, and by extension European consumers, counting among the first victims.
This problem is especially prominent in the agricultural sector, where the crucial measures that have been put in place to provide farmers with financial aid and solidarity have attracted the greedy eyes of international crime on both a small and large scale.
In this context, and given the shortcomings of the present controls, Europe is preparing to arm itself with a new regulation that will permit a better distribution of data among the Member States with regard to the movement of goods and the various investigations that are being carried out in the different countries of the Union.
I welcome the compromise that has been found with the Council, which now gives us a more balanced document, the details of which are to be voted on tomorrow by the Members of this Parliament.
While continuing to protect the various aspects of private life, the agreement should help improve the effectiveness of surveillance procedures and lead to better coordination of actions undertaken between each of the Member States.
In the area of customs controls, as elsewhere, I am convinced that Europe can only develop through greater combination of effort and by the pooling of our respective resources so that we can give our citizens the level of protection they desire.
In this respect, any improvement in the measures we have for combating fraud cannot be achieved without also maintaining a consistent level of regulation, for this is essential if we are to retain sound and effective control from above of the commercial activities under way both within the Union and with third countries.
Mr President, I rather enjoyed the remarks by my eminent colleagues from the UK and their storytelling about how things are done in the UK.
I think we should write that down and translate that into many languages, because I think it happens in many Member States that junior officials have a dossier and prepare various reports on it.
I think we should not point the finger at the junior official but rather at the department that allows that to happen.
I would just like to put to the House that there are concerns about the UK and Ireland - and maybe the Commission can update me, if there is an update about this particular issue - because, while there is support for the principle of mutual assistance between the customs authorities, I think that both Member States, Ireland and the UK, have reservations on the exchange of information between these authorities on the use of VAT numbers in Article 2a(f) and contend that the exchange of information using VAT numbers is de facto, the exchange of fiscal information falling outside the scope of the proposed legal base.
So perhaps there could be a comment on that.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I also enjoy seeing how things are debated in the UK.
However, I can assure you, with regard to what had just been said, that this does not happen only in the UK.
I have met several chiefs of finance, and several ministers, and promoted the idea of mutual administrative assistance, and can state that this reluctance is not just limited to the United Kingdom.
It has been viewed as a suspicious matter, but I can assure you that there are no grounds for this kind of suspicion.
As an investigative body within the Commission, OLAF can only provide a platform for cooperation, and it is absolutely clear that value added tax fraud can only be fought in cooperation between Member States and the European Commission, because, basically, major fraud can only happen cross-border.
So there is a real need for better cooperation, and to exchange information.
I cannot comment on the last question, as to the substance of the information.
We are only talking about smoothing the fight against value added tax fraud, which is a major type of fraud.
That would indeed be the case, and I am very happy to hear the opinion being clearly expressed that Parliament would support this legislative proposal in the form proposed.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank everybody who spoke in the debate.
To the very perceptive comment from Ms McGuinness, representing Dublin, I would say: when she said this is widespread and should be written down, she probably is aware that there was a very famous TV programme about 15, or even 20, years ago in the UK called Yes, Minister, in which the minister, who was a bumbling idiot, imagined he was in full control and was eventually promoted to Prime Minister.
But the words 'Yes, Minister' were actually the words of his civil servants, who were telling him what to say and what to do - 'Yes, Minister.
No, Minister. Of course, you are all-powerful, Minister.'
But it was the civil servants who were in control.
This was happening 20 years ago and, clearly, it is still happening today. And it is happening all over Europe, which is very interesting.
So perhaps we need an updated European programme - Ja, Herr Minister or SÃ­, SeÃ±or Ministro.
But perhaps scriptwriters could actually entertain us with a new programme on the same theme, because the old truths remain as true as ever.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 19 February 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) The latest two enlargements have resulted in a significant increase in the length of the European Union's land and sea borders.
This calls for closer cooperation between Member States and between Member States and the Commission.
It also requires coordination and cohesion of actions aimed at combating international economic and financial crime.
I agree with the rapporteur that the role of third countries should not be overlooked in relation to these activities.
I fully support authorising the Commission as appropriate, so it can provide technical aid and training to liaison officials from third countries and from European and international agencies and organisations.
I welcome the proposal to improve the procedures for transferring data obtained from another Member State to third countries.
I am confident that the proposed changes will have a positive impact on limiting financial irregularities.
I should like to highlight the text of Article 18a regarding the creation and management by the Commission of a directory to help detect consignments that may not comply with legal provisions in the areas of customs and agriculture.
In this connection, I believe specific provision should be made in the text to enable every Member State to access the aforementioned database if it submits a request to the Commission to that effect.
As it currently stands, the text refers to assistance to the relevant authorities.
Community Customs Code (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Common Position adopted by the Council on 15 October 2007 with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) (11272/6/2007 - C6-0354/2007 - (Rapporteur: Janelly Fourtou).
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have come to the end of three years of hard work I am delighted at what has been achieved in respect of the key points in this document.
The customs union is one of the pillars of the European Union and an essential element in the functioning of the internal market.
The present Community Customs Code, which was drawn up in the 1980s and adopted in the 1990s, is now outdated.
Our customs services are faced with new challenges.
In 2007 world trade totalled nearly 16 billion dollars, or 31% of global GDP, and the European Union alone accounted for 20% of the total volume of global imports and exports.
The customs services are therefore responsible for maintaining the smooth flow of trade and the controls that are needed to provide for this, while at the same time ensuring that the safety and security of EU citizens is protected.
If a satisfactory balance is to be reached the control methods used have to be modernised and the level of cooperation strengthened between the different services and economic operators.
The Code also has to be adapted to other radical changes that have occurred in the international commercial environment, mainly resulting from the growing and irreversible recourse to IT and electronic data exchange technologies.
This particular subject was also the focus of a report that was drawn up by my colleague Mr Heaton-Harris and adopted by Parliament last December.
The first reading of the modernised customs code was adopted on 12 December 2006 and the German Presidency managed to secure a political agreement on 25 June 2007.
Parliament adopted 51 amendments to the proposal at first reading, 34 of which, mostly of a substantive nature, were taken over fully or in part in the Council common position.
The main subjects of disagreement were the status of authorised economic operator, the right to act as a customs representative, centralised customs clearance and comitology.
The status of authorised economic operator, which is directly related to the events of 11 September, was introduced by the so-called 'security amendment' Regulation, whose aim was to offer greater facilities to operators and hence offset the new burdens they had to shoulder in order to cope with security-related aspects.
Your rapporteur is satisfied that the concept developed by Parliament at first reading has been taken over; this involves drawing a distinction between two types of authorisation, namely 'customs simplification', on one hand, and 'safety and security', on the other.
This pragmatic solution allows for the different needs of the economic operators.
Turning to the subject of customs representatives, emotions have been running fairly high in those countries which have had a long history of this profession.
While the Council has not adopted Parliament's proposals to the letter, it has nevertheless proceeded from the premise that customs representatives and authorised economic operators should interact along the lines we desired.
Your rapporteur believes that the Council has arrived at a good compromise.
Moreover, this solution has been accepted by customs representatives associations, even though they have lost their monopoly in certain Member States.
As far as centralised customs clearance is concerned, we have another novelty in that the Council has introduced a new Article 106, taking the view that it is more logical and transparent for all of the provisions of the Code related to this concept to be encompassed within a single article.
Henceforth all economic operators may benefit from centralised clearance on the territory of any one Member State.
In cases involving several Member States they have to satisfy the eligibility criteria for authorised economic operator status.
Finally, of all the areas in which this document has made significant progress we can also be very pleased that we have broadened out the comitology process to cover 44 provisions of the modernised customs code.
For this reason I am calling on Parliament to support the Council common position without amendment.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, after more than two years of active interinstitutional work, we are now very close to the completion of the codecision procedure on this proposal, thanks in particular to the commitment of Ms Fourtou and the support of the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
I am very pleased that the legal framework for a future-oriented reform of European customs will - hopefully - be in place this year, which marks the 40th anniversary of our Customs Union.
That will provide encouraging impetus for the work that still lies ahead of us.
The customs union is usually presented as an 'old' pillar of the Community.
It cannot, however, be reduced to a simple legacy of the past.
It is in operation today - and not just to ensure the collection of own resources.
More and more, customs administrations, legislation and procedures will secure the internal market, contribute to consumer protection, support the external aspects of common policies and, at the same time, contribute to the facilitation of our international trade.
To this end, customs legislation will evolve to respond to major changes and challenges, inside and outside the Union, and resort to the most effective rules and efficient techniques.
What will modernisation of the Community Customs Code actually mean?
First, better customs regulations, including simpler and streamlined rules and procedures, clarifying the rights and obligations of economic operators and guaranteeing their more uniform treatment, while providing for an equivalent level of security and safety.
Second, a progressive computerisation of all customs formalities, with a view to a completely 'paperless' environment for customs and trade, whose development will be supported and framed by the e-customs Decision (No 70/2008/EC) of the Parliament and of the Council, adopted on 15 January 2008.
These changes include interoperability between national computerised customs systems.
They will allow, in particular, customs clearance of goods at the place of establishment of the declarant, irrespective of the place of entry into, exit from or supply within the Community of those goods - so-called 'centralised clearance'.
They will also permit an exchange of data elements, in real time, between customs authorities, in order to perform risk analysis and improve controls within the framework of common risk management.
By supporting the Commission's proposal at first reading, Parliament has acknowledged the essential contribution of this legislative initiative to the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.
The Council common position of October 2007, which incorporates most of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, is considered by the Commission to be a well balanced compromise.
The Commission therefore welcomes Ms Fourtou's report recommending approval of the common position without amendment.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Ms Fourtou.
I am always in awe of her grasp of the detail in this very complex matter.
The Modernised Customs Code, as the Commissioner has heard me say before, is an amazingly boring but ever so important piece of law from the Commission.
In 1975, when the United Kingdom voted in a referendum that we should actually be having now (a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty) - a referendum to come into this club - we thought we were voting to come into a free-trade area.
What people got was, in fact, a customs union, and since I have been here I have been working hard on this particular report, because getting this Customs Code right and modernising it correctly is possibly the most important thing we can do until the whole thing is rejuvenated, as the Commissioner said, within the system of e-customs, making trade much more easy and duty collection much more simple across the Union.
However, as with all things European, we do not move forward as quickly as some of us would like - if we move forward at all.
There are still barriers that are contained within this text.
Some are pretty much built-in, until there is a complete wipe-clean of the slate and we start all over.
What is an Authorised Economic Operator?
What qualification should customs representatives - or AEOs, as they are known - have?
Could these be used in the future as barriers to stop people coming into the business as start-ups, or indeed existing businesses running in Europe spreading across the rest of it?
This Modernised Customs Code is actually a very good document, on balance, but it could have been very much better as well.
Alas, we have to compromise in this House a little too often, but I hope that, on balance, this will be good for the continent of Europe.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, in my opinion, the Community Customs Code as presented by the Commission and debated by Parliament and the Council has proved an exemplary procedure.
Our rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, has put in an enormous amount of work on this and in the end, as is almost always the case, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed on the final text we will be adopting.
I think that, as Mr Heaton-Harris has already mentioned, the European Union is above all a customs union, and so the customs code is an important component to allow it to function.
However, the customs service as such does not function as a totally free operation: the authorities are involved to a great extent, since certain goods and values affect us all.
What we are talking about here is smuggling and some of its more dangerous varieties, such as arms and drug smuggling, and controls of capital outflows.
It is therefore logical that the Community Customs Code should include the normal restrictions operated by each of the Member States, and make an attempt at harmonisation.
I feel the points of debate we had here were satisfactorily resolved by the dual concept of customs representation rights and the Authorised Economic Operator: the idea of two concepts that are theoretically different but can find common ground for harmonisation.
I think the solution adopted is quite a good and proper solution.
Commissioner KovÃ¡cs insisted on the concept of centralised customs clearance insofar as the customs union constitutes a single unit.
It does not, of course, make sense for there to be differences between the various customs facilities.
I feel this is a good and practical solution that will allow us to operate in the appropriate fashion.
The last aspect to be mentioned is the comitology procedure.
Both the Commission and the Council have now acknowledged the importance of Parliament's involvement in the procedure.
The agreement reached means that the 28 provisions with respect to which this procedure was applied with the involvement of Parliament have now increased to 44, i.e. Parliament may intervene in an increasingly effective fashion in the creation of provisions for the customs code.
Finally, Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Fourtou for her work and the Commissioner for his efforts to encompass the proposals of this House.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is undoubtedly much more than just a customs union.
We will not reduce it to a customs union in today's debate and in the decision we take tomorrow.
Nonetheless, the customs policy at the EU's external borders is an important element of the European Union's activities and a functioning internal market.
The ÃVP Europe Club in the European Parliament welcomes the proposal for a regulation on a modernised Community Customs Code.
Why?
Because it streamlines customs procedures, because it establishes the basis for simpler, speedier common customs procedures at the external borders, because it means that the radical changes in the international trade environment - for example, in relation to information technology, electronic data, etc. - will now be taken into account, and because customs representatives will now be subject to clearly defined common criteria, which will result in greater reliability and professionalism.
