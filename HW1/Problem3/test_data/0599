It would have afforded the opportunity to disseminate the European label even more quickly and effectively.
An important issue is the involvement of non-governmental organisations and associations.
It is essential that expert opinion and protection of consumer interests have some influence on the awarding process.
This can only benefit the status and merit of what the label stands for in terms of ecology and the consumer.
The aim of our amendments is to increase the participation of associations.
There is much to be said on the question of fees.
We need to introduce a system which covers the costs and it is therefore not right at this stage to fix maximum fees, which would seem premature until such time as we know the actual costs involved.
In this regard I would disagree with Mr Schnellhardt because it seems to me that even though the well-known national labels do give rise to costs, suppliers are still happy to acquire them.
It is right, however, that there should be a cost reduction for SMEs and for products from developing countries.
Overall, we must succeed in establishing the European label in Member States which do not have their own label.
If the common label has a function at present, it is that of filling the environmental label gaps in Europe.
The path which we are taking is the correct one, but a recognised common European label is not yet in sight and a major effort is required in this area.
Mr President, the present proposal reinforces, improves upon and tightens up on the voluntary eco-labelling system which has existed in the EU since 1992 and which has not, unfortunately, been as successful as had been hoped.
We know from the Nordic Swan and the German Blue Angel that the eco-labelling of products is an extremely significant and powerful tool for getting consumers to change their purchasing behaviour and to shop in an environmentally friendly way.
That is, of course, what we all want, namely to be able to shop in an environmentally friendly way and so influence producers and the development of society in ways which favour ecologically more sustainable products and services.
I think that the Council' s position is fairly commendable, and I am also satisfied with the amendments from the committee and from Mr Schnellhardt.
I consider, however, that the proposal needs to be reinforced in certain ways, above all when it comes to the role played by consumer and environmental groups and the co-existence of different eco-labelling systems.
Those who argue the case for having only the one eco-labelling system are making a big mistake, I believe.
I am totally convinced that, wherever there are well-functioning eco-labelling systems, it will be possible also to introduce the EU flower that much more easily and more quickly.
It is about getting the consumer to look for and to choose eco-labelled products. Once purchasing behaviour has been altered, it is extremely simple.
The key to success lies, to a very large degree, in the credibility of the environmental and consumer groups and in the good opinion in which these are held.
If these groups are involved in the right way, eco-labelling will also develop very much more quickly.
If you would allow me to make a point of order...
Mr President, the proposal we are now debating for a revised Community programme for awarding the eco-label has been significantly amended since the Commission' s original proposal.
It has also been altered a great deal since its first reading by the European Parliament. Happily, all these changes are, on the whole, improvements.
Those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that we have obtained a relatively good hearing for the views we already held at the first reading.
For us, the following principles were important when we assessed the proposal in the course of the journey. First of all, this common eco-label should not replace or get in the way of national eco-labels which are, in fact, at present functioning significantly better than the EU flower symbol when one considers both the number of labelled products and the extent to which consumers are familiar with the various labels.
It is therefore especially important that the idea of prohibiting national eco-labels has been abandoned.
I also believe it is important to realise that there is nothing to prevent the existence of parallel eco-labels.
In Scandinavia, which perhaps has what is at present the most efficient eco-labelling system, there are now already a number of eco-labels complementing, and operating fairly well alongside, each other.
Secondly, we want the environmental movement to have a decisive influence over both the awarding of labels and the criteria for receiving them.
Our experience shows that the labels would, in that way, be given greater credibility.
Moreover, this system functions excellently where it has been introduced.
We are therefore especially pleased that the idea of a more commercial form of organisation has been abandoned.
I also think it is good that the idea of a graded eco-label has been done away with.
It is easier just to have the picture of a flower.
A graded system, like the one that existed originally, would probably cause more hassle than it would be worth in terms of additional information provided.
We are also pleased that the proposal is to cover the service sector, too.
All in all, we think that the common position and the amendments which have been submitted, including the amendments from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, make this into quite a good report.
Mr President, whilst recently at my sister-in-law's house, I noticed that she had a container of "eco-friendly" washing-up liquid.
When I congratulated her on this, she looked rather guilty and admitted that the green bottle now contained normal detergent, as the alternative product was not only more expensive but needed four times as much and even then it did not get the dishes clean; by refilling the container, she could both do the washing up effectively and impress eco-warrior friends.
The moral of this story is, of course, that to compete in the mainstream market, eco-products must give a performance close to their alternatives.
Only then can these products move out of the niche market they already have and into the mainstream.
The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity.
The German Blue Angel and the Nordic Swan have led the way in eco-labelling.
To scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water.
In the long term, I can see the merits of the single European eco-label, but this must not be imposed on those with existing schemes.
A single scheme has advantages for business: for example, only one registration fee and inspection, standardised packaging, and advantages for consumers who will not be confused by a plethora of labels.
Eco-labelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances, but why stop there?
Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register.
In addition, groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together.
In the United Kingdom, we have a flourishing ethical financial services sector, offering savings and pensions which invest from a green perspective.
These should not only qualify for an eco-label, but be allowed to sell their products without hindrance throughout the EU in a single financial services market.
Mr President, first of all, I wish, of course, to thank the European Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in particular the two rapporteurs, Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Poggiolini, for the very constructive work which has been carried out in reviewing the regulation on eco-labelling.
The proposal for a revised Community programme for awarding the eco-label is mainly aimed at making the programme more effective and more open and at improving the methods used.
It ought to make the programme more attractive to manufacturers, distributors and consumers.
In particular, the proposal accords greater responsibility to the bodies responsible for eco-labelling and to various interest groups when it comes to establishing ecological criteria.
The Commission considers that these objectives will be fulfilled thanks to cooperation with, and interest on the part of, the European Parliament and the Council.
I believe that the relationship between the Community' s eco-labelling programme and the national eco-labelling programmes is better and more clearly defined in the current proposal.
The proposal also reinforces the interested parties' role and participation.
This applies, in particular, to various interest groups and to the environmental bodies dedicated to eco-labelling.
Their participation is crucial if the present voluntary instrument is to be favoured and made more widely available in the correct way.
It is one of the few European instruments which will, in fact, be able to play a key role in supporting sustainable consumption.
With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, the Commission considers that these have helped improve the exposition of the regulation.
With regard to Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 8, which propose active participation on the part of environmental and consumer organisations, the Commission shares the view that their support and participation is crucial if eco-labelling is to be balanced and credible.
We are therefore able to accept these amendments.
With regard to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 7, which relate to certain aspects of cooperation and coordination with national eco-labelling programmes, the Commission is convinced that common supporting activities are important, particularly with a view to making the Community' s eco-labelling better known.
We are therefore able to approve these amendments, too.
Amendment No 5 proposes four ways of making the fee structure more flexible and easier for those who apply to be accepted.
The Commission supports this overarching objective.
After all, eco-labelling is, of course, voluntary, and the fees ought not to be so high that those who make the most effort in the interests of the environment are prevented from applying for the eco-label.
Amendment No 6 concerns fee reductions for small and medium-sized companies, as well as developing countries, and emphasises that these should be appreciable.
The Commission is able to support this amendment, too.
To summarise, the Commission is therefore able to approve all the amendments.
Mr President, I wanted earlier on, as I concluded my previous speech, to make a point of order to which I should like to alert the President and the Bureau.
Before the vote tomorrow, it needs to be made clear that certain amendments to the present report have not been translated.
They are only to be found in English.
This applies, for example, to Amendments 7 and 8.
These are only available in English, which is totally unacceptable.
If we are to be able to vote on this report, these amendments need at least to be read out before they are voted on.
That was the first point.
The second concerns, for example, the work programme for environmental strategy...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you very much for pointing out the position regarding amendments.
The services are looking at this and I hope that they will be ready in time for tomorrow.
We cannot allow the debate to continue because we are running out of time.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your contribution.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Incineration of waste
The next item is the recommendation for a second reading on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the incineration of waste (C5-0274/1999 - 1998/0289(COD)).
On Amendments Nos 36 and 37, which have been distributed, I am shown as the joint mover of the motion.
I discovered this yesterday evening and notified DG1 of the fact this morning. DG1 acknowledged that a mistake had been made by the translation service.
I then asked for this to be corrected. DG1 refused, saying that they did not have the time.
I should like to say that I think this is completely unacceptable.
They have had more than 12 hours in which to correct the amendments concerned.
I feel very put out that these have been made publicly available with wrong information about who the movers of the motion are.
It is a question, then, of Amendments Nos 36 and 37, of which I am not the joint mover of the motion.
Thank you very much for pointing that out.
We will try and make sure it is corrected by tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the Members for their fruitful cooperation.
As a result of this, we have been able to table various amendments in a joint effort and reach agreement on a number of issues.
This is illustrated by the compromise we reached on the scope of the directive.
I would also like to thank the European Commission for providing the information and technical advice, which was extremely helpful.
In a civilised society, it is to be expected that waste should be processed in an effective and environmentally responsible manner.
In the European Community, this will increasingly be done by incinerating waste and recycling energy.
This process will obviously need to be closely monitored for emissions of dangerous substances.
Once we have reached a point where, in order to counter the adverse effects on the environment, dangerous and organic waste, in particular, is no longer dumped, incineration should then inevitably deliver environmental benefits.
By tightening up emission standards, a balance was struck at first reading between what is viable over a period of about five to seven years and what is necessary from an environmental point of view.
The emission values currently proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are a reasonable compromise.
It should, however, be noted that stricter requirements are already in place in a number of Member States.
It is one thing to prescribe sound environmental standards but quite another to comply with these.
Compliance requires adequate control which, in turn, requires proper monitoring.
Just imagine a situation in which we laid down excellent standards for emissions of dangerous substances such as dioxins but, on the other hand, left the way open for exemptions from all kinds of monitoring obligations.
We would then run the risk of not, on balance, making any progress, and the quality of air would not improve.
In addition, we also need to avoid a situation where it becomes clear there are long-term health risks for a reason which may not be immediately obvious, namely that the emission of harmful substances is not measured.
We cannot justify the occurrence of illnesses, such as cancer or blood diseases, which we have not prevented because there was no obligation to measure the emission of harmful substances by incineration plants.
Mr Florenz was among those who were right to point out that clear measuring regulations are vital.
I expect, therefore, that we will be joining forces in order to put a sound monitoring process in place.
As far as the scope of the directive is concerned, I am pleased to say that, thanks to good mutual cooperation, we have reached an acceptable wording.
However, we need to bear in mind that, with this draft, we have deviated a long way from the first reading, in view of the fact that only untreated timber was then regarded as an acceptable exception.
Regarding the definition of coincineration plant, it is unfortunate that we were unable to reach agreement on this beforehand.
After many discussions involving various Members and the European Commission, a simple solution, which may well be acceptable, has been found in the form of Amendment No 43.
If waste were used as a replacement raw material, such as in the recycling of glass, the relevant process would fall outside the scope of the directive.
If, on the other hand, only part of the waste were to be used as a replacement raw material, then this process would fall within the directive' s scope.
As for the recycling of energy, I would like to point out that, in November of last year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the integration of environmental concerns into energy policy, in which it was requested that special attention be given to the application and development of the best methods for energy recycling.
Consequently, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has made a recommendation that energy recycling by means of combined electricity/heat production should also apply to the incineration of waste.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has asked for ammonia levels to be measured.
It is wrong, however, that the standards for ammonia should not apply to all installations.
Accordingly, I have, for reasons of consistency, proposed an ammonia standard for cement kilns and for ordinary waste incinerators.
As far as the continuous sampling of dioxins is concerned, this appears to be quite feasible.
Belgium has started to use such a measuring technique in the wake of its dioxin crisis.
A cumulative sample is taken for a one-month period.
After this period, this sample is measured and the result gives a good indication of the levels of dioxin emitted during that month.
Needless to say, this is a more effective monitoring method than the random measurement method used twice a year.
According to experts, the costs are not higher since the measurement of cumulative samples is far cheaper.
As such, the cost of the equipment for continuous sampling is recouped within the space of a few years.
At first reading, considerable improvements were made to the Commission proposal thanks to a great deal of support.
It was at that stage that expectations were raised amongst the citizens.
I strongly urge MEPs to meet these expectations.
A consistent approach taken by the European Parliament will benefit our credibility amongst the citizens, especially those citizens living in the vicinity of plants which incinerate or co-incinerate waste.
Mr President, Commissioner, we feel that this directive is far from satisfactory because it involves a combination of two texts, one on the incineration of dangerous waste and the other on the incineration of non-dangerous waste.
This raises problems for us at several phases of the incineration process: the reception, processing and handling of the waste.
One might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters.
We can find the answer in Mr Blokland' s report, which is violently opposed to the coincineration industry.
Paradoxically, however, by the same token, the rapporteur is in favour of mixing dangerous and non-dangerous waste.
What is the advantage of this for the environment?
Our Group has no wish to favour either type of industry, since both are extremely useful to waste management in Europe.
The practices of each Member State must be taken into consideration, while maintaining the existing industrial balance and investigating how the environment can be better protected.
This is what the common position proposes.
Priority must be given to the emission limits for the most harmful substances, i.e. NOx, dioxins and furanes.
Moreover, the common position suggests an NOx limit value for the incineration of dangerous waste for the year 2007. Such a thing does not yet currently exist.
As regards dioxins and furanes, the limit values have now been made mandatory for all types of waste.
Until now, they applied only to non-dangerous waste.
It is therefore unfortunate that the Blokland report is putting unrealistic solutions forward when it is known that a good many directives on waste management are not yet applied or are not properly applied by Member States.
If one wishes to go too far, one becomes counter-productive.
It is completely unrealistic to wish to review the limit values of this directive every three years, if one considers the considerable investment that the industry would have to make.
What the industry needs is legal certainty and reasonable time periods.
The real problem is that in Europe we do not have a proper definition of what waste is, resulting in ongoing confusion when we have to revise a text on waste or to present new proposals.
Commissioner, waste management in Europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Blokland on this report.
We know that waste incineration is a very difficult and highly technical area, but I think that a creditable piece of work has been done in connection with this report.
Unlike Mrs GrossetÃªte, I think that the common position and Mr Blokland' s report will, as a matter of fact, make a significant environmental contribution in connection with waste incineration, whether we are talking about hazardous or non-hazardous waste.
I believe that we are, in this way, obtaining a good tool for preventing and limiting environmental damage in connection with waste incineration and for preventing and limiting the associated risks to human health.
Moreover, there are also some good resources which are being put to use.
I shall certainly support the demand that proper waste planning be carried out, with waste being duly sorted, so that we have a situation in which waste incineration is linked to the EU' s combined waste legislation, with the incineration problem correctly placed in the waste hierarchy.
I also think it is good that we should now be told very precisely which plants are covered by these rules and also which types of waste are thus exempt from them.
Regarding the very difficult question of defining coincineration plant, including cement factories - in connection with the handling of which there has been some quite aggressive lobbying - I want to say that I think we can support Amendment No 43, which I think defines the common position well.
Finally, there is the absolutely crucial point about establishing emission limits in relation to air and water - whether we are talking about heavy metals or dust, ammonia, dioxin, sulphur dioxide or other hazardous substances.
I think that defensible levels have been identified in this connection, and a reasonable balance has been struck between incineration plants proper and the combined plants.
It is a balance that I hope will be maintained, including during the vote tomorrow here in the plenary sitting.
Again in contrast to Mrs GrossetÃªte, I want, moreover, to say that the levels set here for emissions are realistic. They are technologically feasible and they are, in actual fact, already being applied in a number of the Member States.
The existing plants which do not at present fulfil the requirements are also to be given a good few years in which to be adapted to the new requirements laid down here.
I hope therefore that, by means of the vote tomorrow, we can make our contribution to solving the health and environmental problems involved in waste incineration so that the enormous quantities of waste which we produce every single day do not cause more serious health problems or greater damage to the environment than is absolutely necessary.
Mr President, Mr Blokland has carried out an enormous task.
This subject is incredibly involved.
Moreover, the lobbyists have been something else.
I should never have believed that there were so many of them concerned about waste in Europe.
You might have thought it was gold rather than waste they were talking about.
One never knows, but it perhaps bodes well for the future that a recycling industry is developing which possesses such competence and power in terms of financial resources and personnel.
Obviously, the EU must create a sustainable system for protecting air, land and water.
This is a common commitment and a common responsibility.
It clearly ought, too, to be regulated at European Union level.
But is this the right level at which to produce such very detailed technical descriptions as this Directive is attempting to produce?
Ought it not, rather, to be the case that decisions should be made on permitted emission levels for various substances, on the measurement systems and on how the measurements are to be carried out and that, subsequently, the principle of subsidiarity should be applied?
It is true that, when it comes to the ways in which waste is dealt with and is co-incinerated using large quantities of biomass fuels, there are really quite enormous differences between northern Scandinavia (where the transport routes are also long) and the densely populated areas of Central Europe where the problem is, quite literally, more one of waste incineration and of refuse collection and disposal than of, for example, generating combined power and heat.
I should like us at some point, but not now, to debate the opportunities for creating framework legislation in this area.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland on this report which will set Europe-wide standards for incineration, including for the first time emission standards for dioxins and furanes; this should lead to more competition between different methods of waste disposal, and as a result help bring to an end the transport of hazardous waste across Europe in search of the cheapest waste operators.
With the predicted increase in incineration, it is vital that overall EU legislation on waste disposal and on air quality is consistent and comprehensive.
We must look at the whole hierarchy.
Incineration may increase as stricter controls are put on landfill, but it does not go hand in hand with recycling and environmentally friendly waste-disposal methods.
Building new incinerators is a costly and long-term venture which in turn has to have a long-term return for the investors, so it would be in their interests for waste to continue to be burned.
This means that there is a danger of over capacity which will lead to encouraging incineration for reasons of profit, rather than encouraging the reduction, recycling and safe treatment of waste, which is our goal.
This Parliament must protect the health and quality of life of the people that we represent.
There is no safe threshold for dioxin emissions and more research is being done on the effects of micro-particles on human health and the environment. So we have to ensure that there is frequent testing and monitoring, that regular and detailed information is made available to the public, and that real action is taken against breaches of the rules.
Measuring emissions twice a year may give an early indication of what is happening in an incineration plant and in the air that the local community is breathing. Measuring once every two years would not do that.
So we must set the highest possible standards and not make exceptions which will weaken this very important legislation.
Mr President, you cannot dispose of waste by dumping it in the sea, shooting it into space, or by simply incinerating it.
It has a habit of reappearing, often in a more harmful form.
Incineration can be the cause of illnesses, air pollution, climatic change and a rise in the sea level.
A great deal of waste is incinerated these days, but not, in fact, by these expensive installations equipped with flue-gas cleaning devices.
These installations are not being brought up to date.
In fact, they are closed down if it appears that it is cheaper to co-incinerate waste in the cement industry and in electricity plants.
This is why it is important that incineration should cost the same across the board and meet the same high environmental requirements.
It is a fact that left and right do not often see eye to eye on many issues - rightly and understandably so - both within and outside this Parliament, as they represent opposing interests and visions of groups in our society.
This issue, however, should form an exception.
Anyone, rich or poor, must be able to breathe, remain healthy and keep their feet dry. Only a reckless short-term vision and the pursuit of quick profits can explain why attempts are still being made to weaken this directive.
Amendments of this kind reduce the directive to rules for those who would poison us and threaten the world with another flood.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore supports the proposals made by Mr Blokland and hopes that destructive amendments will be withdrawn or rejected.
Mr President, waste management is now central to achieving the highest standards of environmental protection.
Regrettably, our consumer society is contributing to an increasing volume of domestic waste and there is also growing concern in relation to industrial waste.
Thankfully there is now an awareness among citizens of the importance of protecting the natural environment, and in my view the social and economic climate is conducive to achieving this objective.
In previous debates I referred to the need to reduce waste: here the manufacturers of food and consumer goods have an important role to play, particularly in relation to packaging in its various forms and the importance of using products compatible with recycling, which is of course my preferred option.
We are all conscious of the need to reduce the volume of waste now disposed of in landfill sites and every effort must be made to find more environmentally friendly alternatives.
In my view, we will not be able in the foreseeable future to totally eliminate landfill sites but we must not only reduce, on an ongoing basis, the volume of material going to landfill but must also be more selective as regards the materials disposed of.
While incineration is getting a lot of adverse publicity, and recent planning decisions in Ireland have certainly raised the crucial question of the location of incinerators, it is difficult to envisage a complete programme of waste disposal without incineration, particularly in relation to toxic waste, and in this regard consideration must be given to finding locations where the facility will not impact badly on the natural environment.
Finally, Mr President, it is obvious we need further informed debates in helping to allay the citizens' concern on the health aspect of incineration, a matter which has been addressed through extensive research carried out in various Member States and through the experience gained in the many state-of-the-art facilities now in operation throughout Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work.
The recommendation for second reading before us is an extremely important legislative resolution, not just for the environment but also for the economy of the European Union.
This can be seen from the many letters which we receive from environmental associations and from the economic sector, not least of course the cement industry, but also many others such as the wood-processing industry, the paper industry, the metalworking industry and so on. I think that we must regard both sets of arguments as important, those of the environmental associations and also those of industry, because industry has also put forward arguments from a genuinely environmental viewpoint and not just from an economic viewpoint.
We should treat this seriously.
Not all amendments which are probably well intentioned from the environmental viewpoint are necessarily an improvement on the current situation.
I think this can be seen from some of the amendments which were put forward in committee with regard to coincineration and which now reappear as amendments in plenary.
We cannot in any way guarantee that in restricting coincineration we will actually achieve what we want environmentally.
Above all we want to save fossil fuels.
If we set up the hurdles wrong here, then we will not achieve the right environmental objective.
For this reason, our Group rejects the amendments which have been resubmitted by Mr Blokland, the Greens and others.
However, I think that there are still some amendments decided on in committee which we can support in good conscience in order to improve the common position.
For example, I tabled a motion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy relating to NOx emitted during coincineration which, at least for new installations, is somewhat more ambitious than the Council' s proposals.
I think it is realistic and, as the industry in question is saying the same, albeit with its hand in front of its mouth, we should be altogether more positive.
I think, therefore, that we are on the right track in accepting much of what has been decided in the committee, but certainly nothing which goes any further.
Mr President, unusually tonight I am not speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, largely because I have some particularly strong views about this directive.
I do believe that Mr Blokland has produced the wrong report at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.
It is not so long ago that we addressed this issue and produced a set of rules that were appropriate to the situation, and which Mr Blokland was seen to be happy with at the time and did not complain about.
Given a task to do, Mr Blokland has produced a new and revised report that has certainly exceeded anything that we have done before.
We cannot say that it is all wrong.
Indeed there are many sensible proposals put forward in areas where the technology makes it possible to advance.
But quite frankly we cannot expect, having already given industry one set of rules to implement only a year or two ago, to hand them a completely new set of rules so quickly.
We have to expect that it will take time to implement this report.
Mr Blokland has also exceeded in many ways the brief he was given.
In particular, the scope of this proposal goes far further than previous directives and brings into its legislative fold a great many processes which require separate legislation, and need to be separately regulated because they are inherently different from the simple process of combustion.
If one is being kind to this directive one could describe it as being good in parts, like the curate's egg.
Unfortunately, this is going to give environment policy a bad name.
We should not be constantly re-regulating incinerators.
We should be seeking ways to avoid incineration in the first place.
Parliament's objective in waste management strategy is not to constantly tighten rules on existing incinerating plant, it is to change the role of waste management, to change the type of waste management that we do.
We would be much better concentrating our efforts in the next few years on recycling, re-use and other methods of reducing the waste heap.
If we do not, we will very soon find ourselves back with this problem again.
Mr President, I certainly agree with Mr Bowe's final summary.
Although the common position places firm controls on permitted emissions from waste incinerators, I know that whenever proposals to build such an incinerator are made in my country, people rise in protest, they distrust the operator's claims and I have a degree of sympathy with them.
So I and many of my colleagues will be backing most of Mr Blokland's amendments because we want the highest possible standards.
I have no problem at all if these prove technically difficult to achieve - no problem, because Britain has a shameful record of having the lowest household waste recycling in Europe and great room for improvement.
Many of us believe that any government in our country will encourage the construction of waste incinerators as an alternative to encouraging the alternatives.
It would be a case of "throw it on the furnace" and putting it out of sight and out of mind which to my mind is a false approach.
We have to concentrate on reducing waste, recycling what is left and leaving incinerators as a last resort.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Blokland for his report which strives to improve the Commission's proposal, and the authors of the other amendments which do so as well.
But incineration has to be considered as a last resort and - as has been said already - waste reduction, re-use and recycling are the main things we should be striving for.
I just wonder about Mr Bowe's statement about the need to reduce, recycle and re-use waste.
Will his position remain the same when he is debating the packaging directive?
It will be interesting to see if he sticks to his principles there.
The only thing incineration does, as Mrs Evans has said, is to encourage the need for more waste.
It will not be economically viable if you do not have enough waste to keep the incinerators going.
We also must remember that waste does not disappear.
It is turned into dioxins and also toxic ash - what will you do with that?
In Ireland, some operators are proposing using it in building materials.
What will be the long-term consequences of that?
In Ireland, regardless of what my colleague Mr Hyland said, we have an appalling record on waste management.
We have one of the highest landfill records in Europe.
Now it seems the government are moving from landfill to incineration and it is being presented as the green option.
They say: "We are turning waste into energy - isn't that wonderful?" when in actual fact they are trying to hoodwink the public into believing that this is something that is ecologically sound.
The recent court case in Ireland which decided against the siting of an incinerator in an agricultural area was extremely important.
It is very important that we get our act right, that we look first and foremost at waste management.
For any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided.
We have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place.
Mr President, the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy underline generally the high levels of environmental protection, and for that reason many of these amendments are acceptable.
There are differing infrastructures for the treatment and incineration of waste in different countries, however, and, as a result, the same provisions are not in fact the same for everyone.
In Finland and some other countries the sorting of waste in close proximity to where it originates is very advanced.
Thus, we do not incinerate mixed waste, as they do in certain countries.
The incineration of mixed waste is bad environmental policy.
Sorted waste can be incinerated effectively together with other fuels in a so-called coincineration process.
The amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy unjustifiably lump together the incineration of mixed waste with parallel incineration.
That might have an adverse effect, as a result of its indirect economic impact, on levels of environmental protection in the countries that sort waste.
For that reason, Amendments Nos 14, 17, 18 and 27 should not be adopted.
Finally, I would like say that the cement industry lobby should not be put in a competitive position that is better than that enjoyed by the hazardous waste disposal plants.
Mr President, I find myself in agreement with Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mrs Paulsen and - rather alarmingly for both of us - with Mr Bowe.
But I want to make a particular point in relation to an alarm which has been raised in the United Kingdom by the agricultural sector literally in the last few days.
A number of United Kingdom MEPs have been contacted by farming interests, who are very worried that the incineration directive will apply to all on-farm incinerators in the United Kingdom.
There are said to be several thousand of these, and the full effect of applying the controls outlined in the directive would be to put up the costs for each incinerator to operate by an estimated Â£200 000.
Typically, such incinerators deal with animal waste from the agriculture sector and with the disposal of empty pesticide containers at a rate of less than 50 kg an hour.
Both processes satisfy the criteria of best practicable environmental option and are accepted by environmental inspectors in the United Kingdom.
No exception has been moved for these under Article 2(2) and the closure of incinerators following the entry into force of the directive would pose enormous problems of cost and of disposal of animal waste for UK farmers.
My question to the Commissioner, which I hope that she will able to answer when she comes, is this: since we have not moved an exception to take account of these on-farm incinerators, is this the first time the European Commission has heard of this difficulty?
Have they received any representations from United Kingdom ministers?
Can the Commissioner say when an opportunity for revising the directive to introduce these exceptions - supposing Parliament would ever agree to them - might arise, and does it feel that such an exception for animal waste and for the burning of empty pesticide containers in on-farm incinerators would in fact be likely to gain acceptance?
I have given the Commissioner notice of these questions.
Mr President, the treatment of waste and the whole policy on waste is becoming an ever more important part of EU environmental policy.
To be able to act sensibly and correctly we have to bear in mind something that has already been spoken of here, which is to say the waste hierarchy: the prevention of waste, recycling, the exploitation of its energy-producing potential through incineration, and its final treatment.
The Commission' s proposal is not a total response to this idea, and is rather based on the notion that everything must and can be burnt.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy added the necessary amendments to promote the waste hierarchy to its common position in its second reading, and I hope that these points of view will also be adopted in tomorrow' s vote.
I also hope there is support for the proposal that was very much endorsed by the Committee to facilitate the incineration of waste produced by the paper and cellulose industry at the production site.
This waste is an important energy source not only for the industrial plants themselves but also for the surrounding community.
As the waste hierarchy is implemented in very many different ways in different Member States and in most countries they burn both hazardous and non-hazardous waste in the same incinerator, very strict rules are required.
However, in those countries where the recycling of waste is reasonably well established, such as Finland, and where they know what is being incinerated where, tighter controls will not improve the state of the environment; on the contrary, it might make it worse, as the incineration of waste will be prevented in small incineration plants and transportation will increase.
But, as regards impurities in the air, it would be necessary that exceptions to the strict standards would only apply when the party incinerating the waste can truly demonstrate that no more emissions are being released into the air than what the licensing conditions allow.
Mr President, the directive on the incineration of waste is well intended but I think those responsible for preparing it have gone into too much detail.
I am mainly worried about the so-called coincineration of waste.
Sorted community waste and, for example, the fibrous pulp sludge that is produced in forest industry processes serve as good fuel supplements for many heating plants.
The draft, however, calls for ongoing, expensive, to some extent impossible, and environmentally unnecessary monitoring of plants that are engaged in harmless coincineration.
The end result will run counter to the original aim: non-hazardous sorted waste, which is a valid form of fuel for heating plants, will have to be driven to a landfill site to add to methane emissions or it will have to be transported hundreds of kilometres to large incinerators, all the while polluting the environment.
There are many amendments in the report that are problematic.
I think the matter should either go back to the Committee or the Council' s common position, at least its main features, should be adhered to.
Mr President, honourable Members, efforts to set limits for pollutants produced by waste incineration and to introduce specific control procedures are indeed a positive step.
It is unacceptable for pollution to be transferred from the air into water and the ground.
The directive makes some headway in that direction.
Nevertheless, the problems inherent in waste incineration still remain, since it is the actual burning process which produces toxic substances, including dioxins.
This applies even more to domestic waste which contains negligible quantities of toxic substances before it is burned.
Treating dangerous and non-dangerous waste in the same way therefore exacerbates the problem.
What is more, the cost of installing and operating incineration units is far higher than the cost of mechanical recycling or sanitary landfill.
In a nutshell, the legislative proposal under discussion will not solve the problems inherent in incineration as a waste management method.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Blokland for this report; he has had a very hard job to do.
Drafting environmental legislation for the whole of Europe is a demanding task, as circumstances in Member States differ enormously.
I myself come from a country where we have already opted for a policy that corresponds amazingly closely to the EU strategy on waste.
Only Finland has already embarked on perfectly feasible practices, as you have heard this evening.
Therefore, it is tiresome to see that the same mechanisms that are needed to guide those countries that have been lax in their attention to the matter of waste disposal, are forcing the more advanced countries to take a step backwards.
This should not be happening.
Mrs Paulsen, was right: this is exactly where compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is needed.
If more stringent requirements regarding emissions are being illogically imposed on the use of waste as fuel than for other fuels, fuels classified as waste will cease to be used.
There are no alternative proposed uses for waste: it would be deposited in landfill sites.
That will add to the formation of methane, as a result of putrefaction of organic waste, and the greenhouse phenomenon.
This holds true especially for the incineration of harmless sludge produced by the paper and cellulose industry.
It is important that Parliament amends the proposal for the directive in this respect in accordance with the Committee' s amendment.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted some proposals that, if realised, would make it harder to practise ecologically justified coincineration.
For example, the limit values for emissions for fuel that is not waste in coincineration are required to be the same as for waste as fuel, even though the same material may be incinerated and give off higher levels of emissions, under EU legislation.
Another example is the call for the ongoing monitoring of the ammonia content of gas from chimneys.
That will add substantially to the costs of monitoring with no benefit to the environment, as the monitoring obligations have not just been imposed on those plants where ammonia emissions are generally produced.
Investments that do not bring a value added element with regard to the environment mean less investments that are of benefit to the environment.
Mr President, Mr Blokland, ladies and gentlemen, waste management is a complex task.
This is confirmed yet again by our discussions and the particularly powerful lobbying.
I therefore approve of the European Union' s approach which is to adopt an overall strategy in relation to this major environmental and health issue.
Nonetheless, personally speaking, I have always been rather worried to see the incineration of dangerous and non-dangerous waste dealt with in the same legislation, and I expressed my opinion on this point at first reading.
The majority decided in favour of coincineration.
My opinion is that today we must fight to prevent the emission standards for dangerous waste being relaxed.
The volume of waste to be incinerated is going to be significantly increased.
The figure of 31 million tonnes in 1990 has been mentioned. This year we are talking about close to 60 million tonnes, and waste incineration generates, as everyone has mentioned, the emission of particularly dangerous substances into the atmosphere and soil.
The debate has focused on coincineration.
I find the maximum standard of 40% excessive, but I should like more especially to stress, just briefly, the fact that the increasingly widespread use of dangerous waste in coincineration units is liable to lead us to accept the production of this type of waste, with a particularly high risk of hearing, tomorrow, that serious investment has been made with a view to constructing coincineration units. They therefore now have to be made to run profitably, leading to an increase in the volume of dangerous substances transported, with all the risks that this entails.
In conclusion, while mentioning that penalties must be applied in cases of non-compliance and perhaps also that support should be provided for the authorities modifying their household waste incinerators to comply with the standards, it is still essential to stress that our top priority is, and must continue to be, avoiding the creation of this type of waste and recycling as much as possible.
Mr President, we all know that disposing of waste in an environmentally friendly manner and utilising its energy by means of the latest technology is a requirement of our time and wholly appropriate.
The directive on the incineration of waste contains important starting points for introducing compulsory high environmental standards throughout the European Union which have already been in place in some Member States for a number of years.
And this is important and necessary.
The aim of the directive is to establish emission levels which ensure harmless and environmentally friendly incineration of both dangerous and non-dangerous waste in incineration and coincineration plants without presenting any risk to human health.
People are sensitised today and have fears of a high level of air pollution and the illnesses which can result and so the policy must also create completely clear framework conditions to limit the risk.
Nevertheless, I must say that Mr Blokland is proposing some regulations and stringent conditions for the directive which go way beyond the objective.
The operating conditions for incineration plants, as proposed in Amendment No 11, are neither appropriate to the objective nor practicable but, quite simply, superfluous.
Science and practice have shown for some time now that such a measure does not prevent high emissions of hydrogen chlorides and dioxins.
In practice, Amendment No 11 would also mean that many halogenated substances, for example PVC, which frequently occurs in mixed domestic waste, would be excluded from incineration in waste incineration plants.
A further point is to ensure that the directive does not give rise to any protected markets.
Industries which use coincineration plants in their production process have, for many years, successfully concerned themselves with achieving high air purity standards in incineration.
Many companies are also dependent on the use of waste to retain competitiveness and jobs.
Millions have already been spent on measures to reduce energy consumption.
In my opinion, we should not disregard these efforts ....
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I should like to make two brief points which may well be relevant should this go to conciliation, as I suspect it will.
The first is the impact of this directive on the existing specialist toxic waste incineration industry.
These incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the coincineration plants.
My concern is that the high calorific value waste will be cherry-picked for coincineration and this in turn will push up the cost of the specialist toxic waste incinerators which will mean that they will have to actually buy in fuel in many instances to achieve the high temperatures which are required to destroy things like dioxin.
We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators.
There are only three at the moment in the United Kingdom.
If we had fewer of these plants, it would mean that hazardous waste might well have to be transported for large distances, which is not acceptable for both political and practical environment reasons, and it would also push up the cost of incinerating this toxic waste.
The second point I would make is to underline the point made by Dr Jackson.
I come from a region in the United Kingdom with the highest density of pigs.
Now traditionally fallen stock has been disposed of by burial on the farm, but with these very large units this is just not a practical way of disposal, so many of the units have installed their own incinerators - small incinerators using less than 50 kg per hour.
If these incinerators are not used, people may well have to go back to burial.
I think this mix-up has been due to a misunderstanding between the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture in Britain, who thought there were only sixty incinerators of this type when in fact there are several thousand.
This problem also applies to hunt kennels which feed fallen stock, and dispose of offal and - bizarrely - to pet crematoria, although I understand that human crematoria are not covered as dead people are not classified as waste.
In conciliation could I ask you to make allowance for these farmers who have invested in cleaning up the environment by installing incinerators, and for whom the cost would be excessive should they not be able to continue.
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland for the considerable commitment he has shown and for his well prepared recommendation for second reading.
Together with the Council' s determination to arrive quickly at a common position, the report has helped with the efficient reading of the Commission' s proposal.
The proposed directive on waste incineration goes to the heart of environmental legislation: the protection of public health.
The proposal will help reduce dioxin emissions from incineration by 90 per cent.
As from 2005, when the directive begins to apply to existing plant, dioxin emissions from incinerators will be insignificant.
Together with the directive on waste deposition, the directive on waste incineration will put a stop to methods of treating waste which do not take account of future generations' needs and interests.
Both directives constitute a firm basis for the sustainable treatment of the waste hierarchy, with improved preventative measures, better recycling and environmentally safe deposition of waste.
I should like to remind you that there already exists a directive on a waste hierarchy.
It is therefore obvious that, in this case, it is recycling that one should attempt, in the first place, to regulate.
Unfortunately, Mr Bowe, it has been 11 years since the technical requirements in these directives were last reviewed.
43 amendments have been tabled.
Of these, the Commission is able to approve eight in full, five in part and three in principle.
The following amendments are aimed at clarifying the Commission' s proposal.
The Commission is able to approve them in part, in principle or in full: 4, in principle, with the exception of the last section; 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11, but only the elucidation of the two seconds; 12 and 14, second section; 17 in principle, but not the requirement continually to measure the levels of ammonia and mercury; 18, first section; 19, 22, and 24 in principle; 25: the figure of 500 milligrams for nitric oxides in new plant, together with the proposed new paragraph at the end; 27 in principle, together with Amendment No 43.
The Commission is not able to approve the first section of Amendment No 14.
If the word "untreated" were to be deleted, it would no longer be possible to use mixed household waste in co-incinerators, something which would also apply to waste which had undergone extensive pre-treatment.
The second section of this amendment is, in principle, acceptable.
By introducing an explanation of the word "untreated" , the paragraph can be made less ambiguous.
The European Parliament' s Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 7, which are aimed at introducing provisions concerning the treatment of waste, cannot, for reasons of principle, be approved.
The Commission' s proposal is aimed at introducing limits for emissions and at establishing operative conditions for all waste incinerated or co-incinerated, and this should not influence the legislation concerning the treatment of waste.
The Commission is not able to approve Amendments 5 and 15 which are designed to introduce links to standards of air and water quality.
Legislation of this kind already exists or is at present being prepared, for example the directives concerning air quality and coordinated measures to prevent and limit pollution, together with the proposed framework directive concerning water.
The amendments would involve the provisions in these acts being duplicated or becoming more ambiguous.
Amendments Nos 3, 16, 30 and 33-35 are not compatible with the directive' s structure and cannot therefore be approved.
There has been a certain amount of confusion concerning Amendment No 13 where a number of language versions have been changed but not the English language version.
This amendment cannot, however, be adopted by the Commission.
Articles 12 and 15 of the proposal concern access to information and reporting.
They are now worded in such a way as to guarantee that all players have access to the information they require.
The Commission therefore considers that Amendments Nos 20 and 21 are unnecessary.
Amendments Nos 36-39 are designed to tighten up the requirements with regard to measurements.
The Commission is not able to accept these because they would place an additional burden upon those responsible and because no justification of their real value can be provided.
Finally, Annexes II, IV and V are, as you know, the heart of the Directive, establishing the limits for emissions in the cases of coincineration and incineration.
As I have already mentioned, the Commission accepts the proposed limit of 500 milligrams for nitric oxides in new cement kilns.
This is also justified from the point of view of cost-income analysis.
Any further amendment for the purpose of making the limits stricter or of removing from certain plants the right to be regarded as exceptions would threaten the delicate balance achieved in the common position.
The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32 40, 41 and 42.
With regard to Mrs Jackson' s question about the incineration of dead animals on farms, I would provide the following clarification. The incineration of dead animals is not included under the directive, and this in accordance with the exceptions defined in Article 2.2.
As I have noted previously, the Commission accepts parts of Amendment No 4, which refers to Directive 74/442 and which indirectly makes it possible to exclude the incineration of infected animals on farms.
We consequently accept this principle.
The Commission is to investigate the possibility of extending the exception concerning radioactive waste also to include exceptions such as infected dead animals.
I understand that there is a debate going on in Great Britain, and perhaps in other places too, concerning the incineration of, for example, empty packages of insecticide etc.
It is not, of course, the intention that these should be incinerated. That sounds dangerous.
Nor does it sound as if one should be burning them at home in one' s backyard.
I do not want to exclude our needing to review how the exceptions are to be worded once we have obtained more information and know exactly what types of plant are concerned.
There was a certain amount of confusion because we at first believed that we were concerned here with dead animals and infected dead animals, of which we thought exceptions should be made.
My understanding from the interpretation was that the incineration of dead animals is not covered by this directive under the terms of Article 2(2).
I am looking at Article 2(2) and I cannot see that exclusion set out there.
It talks about vegetable waste and vegetable waste does not cover dead animals.
However, I will get clarification from the Commissioner personally.
Infectious animal waste is not covered by the scope of this directive in its common position form because it is covered by Directive 90/667.
The adoption of Amendment No 4 to Article 2(2) might give the Commission the chance to revise the text so as to include a specific exclusion for infectious animal waste.
As things stand all other animal waste is covered by Article 2(2)(a)(v) of the directive and Directive 90/667.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Ozone in ambient air
The next item is the report(A5-0062/2000) drawn up by Mr Davies on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to ozone in ambient air (COM (1999) 125 - C5 - 0047/1999 - 1999/0067 (COD)).
Mr President, given the importance of the directive on national emission ceilings to this report on a proposal for a daughter directive, it is a little surprising that the order of debate is as it is, because without reduction in the key trans-boundary pollutants we are not going to reduce ozone.
This report sets national targets for ozone levels and proposes action plans for dealing with local problems of exceedance.
To save time I am going to assume that the respiratory and other health problems associated with ozone are understood, and that every Member of this House will want to reduce them.
The disputes between us will be about costs and time-scales, and perhaps also about the accuracy of the Commission's methodology and the achievability of the targets it has set in this directive.
Let me deal directly with the Commission's core proposal, the setting of a target for 2010 of 120 mg per cubic metre for ozone, not to be exceeded on more than 20 days per year.
Commission proposals for environmental improvements need to be both ambitious and realistic.
These proposals are certainly ambitious but many governments dispute whether they are politically realistic, and having just come from a difficult - albeit ultimately successful - group meeting of my own, I know that many Members have doubts.
In particular, representatives of the Mediterranean countries point out problems resulting from the strong sunlight they enjoy.
I point out that the Commission's methodology has taken full account of this but I look at their faces and still see a degree of scepticism.
I did wonder some months ago whether to table amendments, which would suggest a less ambitious outcome, but which would perhaps be more acceptable to Member States.
But the Commission's 120 mg target is in line with World Health Organisation proposals, and who am I to suggest that they should be challenged?
The number of days of exceedance could easily be adjusted, but that is something to negotiate only when necessary.
It is a good target and, if it is at all possible, then it should be retained.
The position I have taken in preparing this report is to say that those who want tougher targets than the Commission has proposed should have their views rejected.
But equally it would be wrong for us to water down the draft directive.
That is why I am sorry to see amendments tabled which reflect the Industry Committee's position.
It seems to have been overlooked by many that these amendments, if carried, would leave the European Union in a much weaker position with regard to ozone targets than is enjoyed by the United States of America.
We are aware of growing problems of ozone across Europe, but if we are not even prepared to match the standards being set by the USA, one of our great commercial rivals, this would indeed be a great shame and a sorry reflection on our commitment to environmental improvement.
I ask Parliament to support my proposals, to give its backing to the Commissioner and to let her play her part in negotiating a common position which is both ambitious and politically realistic.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put forward the proposal of the Industry Committee which was adopted by 40 votes to 4 and which deals with target values in particular.
There is absolutely no doubt that in tightening up or adopting the ozone directive we must find a reasonable compromise between the justifiable demand for improved air quality and the possibility for European economy and society to reasonably adapt in particularly polluted regions.
For this reason, unlike the Environment Committee which has responsibility in this matter, we have not taken on board the proposals of the Commission wholesale, but have modified them.
I know that the experts at the Commission will vigorously oppose this, but we think that we can propose a compromise given that the guide value of 180 Âµg/m3 is not disputed, nor indeed the critical value of 240, only the target value.
We would like to propose for this a 30-year programme which, although based on the WHO value of 120 Âµg/m3, provides for a phased reduction in the number of days on which this value may be exceeded: 40 days in 2010, 20 days in 2020 (which is the Commission' s target for 2010) and no days in 2030.
This is a concern in particular for the warmer regions of Europe, namely coastal regions, which have to cope with a particularly high external ozone penetration.
I think we have put forward a reasonable compromise here.
In any case, we are prepared to compromise with the Commission, particularly as we assume that only this type of compromise will also find approval in the Council.
For this reason we are venturing to re-introduce this proposal on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, even though it was marginally defeated in the Environment Committee.
We hope that you will consent to it.
Mr President, Commissioner, I agree that the most important difficulty with this directive is the diversity of criteria with regard to the establishment of target levels and time-scales for the reduction of the ozone concentrations in the atmosphere: the famous items 2 and 3 of annex 1.
We in the Group of the European People' s Party consider it necessary to support the main lines set in the Commission' s proposal, especially with regard to target levels, which coincide with the guidelines of the World Health Organisation on air quality and which establish the permissible concentrations of ozone at 120 Âµg/m3.
Nevertheless, it seems to us to be inadvisable to accept the amendments which make 2010 the time limit, the only one in the short term, and set 2020 as the time limit for long term objectives.
In this respect, we think it is essential to allow for greater flexibility with regard to the periods of adaptation to the said target levels, given the real difficulty of controlling ozone concentrations when setting figures purely on the basis of the existence of previous data, as is constantly seen in certain climatic conditions, especially, as has just been mentioned, in the Mediterranean countries.
Our Group therefore vigorously defends Amendments Nos 26 and 28, which establish a progressive and realistic achievement of the proposed objectives, by means of a progressive scale according to the number of days in a year the target levels can be exceeded.
However, we consider very positive the amendments on the countries which are candidates for accession to the European Union, so that they may participate as soon as possible in the achievement of the Union' s objectives - and we congratulate Mrs Davies on this initiative - and it also seems important to us that the action plans are of a local nature and that the possibilities for reducing ozone concentrations are studied on a case by case basis.
I believe that a vote in favour of the amendments proposed by the European People' s Party is a vote for progress in the control and monitoring of one of the most serious pollutants to date, initiating, in a decisive and homogenous way, in all the Member States, actions for its elimination as a threat to the health of persons and ecosystems, without deluding ourselves as to the real possibilities of completely eradicating it in the short term.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Chris Davies for this report.
Adoption of the Commission' s proposal and of Mr Davies's report will mean a considerable improvement in air quality for Europe's citizens.
I think there are two crucial points here.
The first is that the WHO' s guidelines should be adhered to.
I think that this would be an important step towards preventing serious illnesses and premature deaths, especially among particularly vulnerable sectors of the population, including children.
The second thing I think is very important is that specific dates should be set, both for when in 2010 we are to achieve the provisional targets and for when in 2020 we are to attain the long-term objectives.
I think that setting dates is very important to our also in actual fact attaining the objectives.
In addition, I should like to make a couple of remarks on the amendments inspired by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and which are intended to weaken the Commission' s initiative by allowing much greater exceedances of the WHO's recommendations and by significantly delaying efforts to achieve the targets set by the WHO.
The amendments would not only impair the Commission' s proposal but also constitute a deterioration and retrograde step in relation to the situation of which we are now, in fact, aware in Europe.
As Mr Davies also mentioned, standards are, in actual fact, lower than those in the United States.
I do not know how one can call the proposals a happy medium or compromise, as Mr Langen did a moment ago.
I think they are completely incomprehensible and irresponsible.
They would involve serious health and environmental consequences for the people of Europe, together with a bill for Europe' s health services to the tune of billions.
I would therefore very much recommend that we support the Commission' s proposal, together with Mr Davies' report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Davies on his excellent report.
I would also like to thank the European Commission for its sound green proposals.
Back in July 1995, Strasbourg was labouring under ozone smog.
On the initiative of the Green Group, the European Parliament then adopted a resolution to halve the ozone standard stipulated in the 1992 directive.
The European Commission' s proposal has made a lot of headway in this direction.
Ozone smog is still on the increase.
It is now even permeating the southern European skies during the winter months.
It has paralysed the traffic in northern Italy over the past couple of weeks and, during the summer months, countries such as Denmark and Sweden also suffer with ozone smog.
Ozone smog is now to be found everywhere in Europe.
Ozone is always an aggressive substance.
There are no safe ozone levels, despite what the World Health Organisation claims.
This is why the Green Group proposes allowing just fifteen exceedances of critical loads per annum.
This number is slightly lower than the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
My group can also support the twenty exceedances proposed by the Committee.
However, it cannot back the proposal made by the Christian Democrats and UNICE Employers' Union of forty such incidents per annum.
This is far too many and thirty years is a ridiculous time limit, given the fact that the problem is taking on such proportions.
In order to reach this strict ozone standard, the NOx emissions from traffic, in particular, and the emission of volatile organic substances will need to go down drastically.
This is the topic of Mrs Myller' s report.
In the case of an ozone alert, we also need to be able to take short-term action.
The Dutch Government makes so many concessions to the transport lobby that it fails to realise this.
For my group, the car is no sacred cow.
Mr President, I too wish to thank Mr Davies for the report he has prepared.
It is an extremely important report, especially from a health perspective.
Seen from an environmental point of view, it is also intimately linked to the next subject, namely Mrs Myller' s report.
I am convinced that these two reports together provide a sound basis for positive developments in Europe in the fields of health and the environment.
During the short time I have in which to speak, I should like to try to scotch some of the flourishing myths which exist with regard to the ozone issue.
This especially applies to the situation in southern Europe.
The climate in southern Europe is often used as a reason for, or explanation of, the high levels of ozone which are often to be found in the summertime.
It is true that climates with long periods of high pressure increase the presence of ozone.
At the same time, research shows that the reasons why ozone affects cities such as Barcelona, Athens and Milan and many of the tourist resorts along the coast must be sought elsewhere.
The reasons have to be sought in traffic levels, in industrial processes and in energy production.
It is also these matters which we can influence by means of the Directives concerned.
It is therefore something of a pity that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy should have such a detached attitude towards the present Directive and only see it in a perspective which favours industry.
Instead, we ought to see what happens when the limits set by the WHO are constantly exceeded and when people (both residents and tourists) are constantly exposed to a danger to their health.
We know that the risks are greatest for people who are in the open air a great deal, especially children.
We know that exceedance of ozone limits directly affects children' s lung capacity.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy ought to consider this when the present directive is voted upon tomorrow.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their support of the Commission' s proposal and draft report.
Within the European Union, we have achieved a certain amount of success when it comes to improving air quality.
Nonetheless, ozone still constitutes one of the most serious environmental problems.
On more than 60 days every summer in a number of locations in Central and Southern Europe, ozone levels exceed the target values set by the World Health Organisation.
The Fifth Environmental Action Programme established the long-term objective of ensuring that these limits were not in fact exceeded.
If we are to be able to solve this problem, we need to take measures with clearly defined subsidiary objectives.
The Commission' s proposal therefore for the first time establishes clear limits upon ozone levels which, as far as possible, are to be attained by no later than the year 2010.
The target value in terms of protecting people' s health means that the WHO' s guidelines must not be exceeded on more than 20 days per year.
Programmes for reducing emissions are necessary in those cases where the target values are not attained.
The directive on national emission ceilings, which is the next point on the agenda, will lead to improvements in ozone levels so that the target values in question might for the most part be attained.
The proposal is nonetheless a clear expression of the political will that exists to attain the long-term objectives in the directive, too.
Attaining the World Health Organisation' s target values is only the first step.
In reviewing the Directive in the year 2004, we must therefore analyse how and when we can achieve the long-term objective.
The Commission is able wholly to approve Amendments Nos 3, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14 and 15.
Amendment No 5, section two, is also acceptable in view of the fact that the Member States have to prepare emission reduction programmes before they can implement them.
With regard to Amendment No 9, the Commission is also able to approve some of the changes in their entirety and the majority of them in principle.
We approve those changes relating to short-term measures which are to be implemented in each zone in which the threshold value is exceeded.
We also agree that the Member States should inform the public as to whether they intend to prepare and implement short-term action plans and, if so, in what ways, and that they should also inform them as to how often such measures have been taken.
We believe it is necessary for this information to be reported to the Commission. However, that issue is more at home in Article 10.
We cannot, however, accept that short-term measures should only be taken at local level.
Nor do we believe that the Member States should be enjoined to analyse whether short-term measures are an effective tool in each individual case and in each individual place where the threshold value has been exceeded.
The Commission is able to approve the principles behind Amendments 10 and 11.
We are going to redraft subparagraph 1c in order to take account of the idea behind the last section of Amendment No 9 and Amendments Nos 10 and 11.
Amendment No 12 can be approved in principle.
The Commission believes that progress by the Member States ought to be presented in a form which permits direct comparisons between countries, if that is possible in practice.
The principle in Amendment No 16 is also acceptable.
The Commission agrees that climate changes ought to be emphasised.
This ought, however, to be done in a broader perspective and not only in relation to changes in fuel consumption.
Amendment No 2 advocates coordination between Member States and Applicant States.
This can in principle be approved, but some rewording is required if misinterpretations are to be avoided.
We cannot, however, approve Amendment No 1.
Even if the Commission agrees that it is important to involve the Applicant States, there is no reason for reiterating this in a directive aimed at the Member States.
Nor is Amendment No 8 acceptable when it comes to predictions of exceedances of information thresholds.
The use of prognosis models is specified as a prerequisite of thresholds for alerting the public, something which would make the way in which the public is informed or alerted less reliable.
This is an issue on which practical considerations and the possibility of practical implementation must be taken into account.
Finally, we must reject the first and third sections of Amendment No 5, together with Amendments Nos 17 and 18.
In the present situation, we quite simply do not have enough information available to be able to predict when the long-term objective of not exceeding the World Health Organisation' s guidelines can be attained.
In addition, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 28.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow.
Atmospheric pollutants
The next item is the report (A5-0063/2000) by Mrs Myller on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (COM(1999) 125 - C5-0047/1999 - 1999/0067(COD)).
Mr President, the European Union has ambitious goals for the environment, which were set forth, for example, in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme and the acidification strategy presented in 1997.
These programmes stated as their aim the protection of people and nature from the adverse effects of air pollution, meaning that critical ceilings in respect of nature and people would not be exceeded.
The Commission' s proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings is an important step in achieving the aims the Union set itself: to protect its citizens from the adverse effects of air pollutants.
The legacy of past decades is going to take some time to put right, however.
We are still not even aware of all the technical potential for ridding ourselves of sources of emissions entirely.
For this reason, it is reasonable to proceed in stages, as the Commission has proposed.
The first stage is the Interim Environmental Objectives to be achieved by 2010, which means cutting health-threatening ozone loads by two-thirds by that year.
We cannot be satisfied with just this, however, as, after this target has been met, there will still be too many areas where pollution counts exceed levels that are dangerous to people and nature.
Owing to this, I have recommended in my report a long-term goal, in addition to the interim one, and a final target for 2020.
In that way, we would finally be able to reach a point where critical levels and loads are not exceeded and everyone will be protected effectively from all known health effects of air pollution.
In this connection I would like to draw your attention to my amendment, in which, owing to a translation error, there is a wrong word in your copy of the document.
In place of 'reached' it should say 'exceeded' .
I hope that this will be sorted out before tomorrow' s vote.
How, then, do we achieve a situation in which air pollution does not exceed tolerance levels for humans and for nature?
The Commission' s proposal sets limit values for each Member State with regard to certain kinds of interrelated emissions, which cause acidification, increased ozone in the inner atmosphere and soil eutrophication.
Dealing with these problems and the emissions that cause them together has proved to be the most cost-effective way of tackling the causes of air pollution and bringing it under control.
The biggest disagreements in the implementation of the directive relate to the limit values, i.e., the emission ceiling set for each country.
The UN Economic Commission for Europe has also examined the objectives for reductions in the same sources of emissions as in the proposal for a directive now under discussion, and, as a result of these talks, the so-called Gothenburg Protocol was signed.
There is a clear difference between this proposal and the Commission' s.
If we were to accept the ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol, we would never reach the targets that the Union has set itself regarding air pollution.
Comparing the differences between the Gothenburg Protocol and the Commission' s proposal with regard to the effects on health, the annual reduction levels proposed by the Commission would save the lives of as many as four thousand people a year in Europe.
Although it is beyond dispute that the ambitious targets set for the environment have been found to be an essential ingredient in people' s health and safety, there have been pleas for lower ceilings, on the basis that cleaner air costs too much for industry and communities.
It has to be said, however, that there is very considerable exaggeration with regard to the costs involved.
If, on the other hand, we calculate the benefits that better air quality will bring to people and the natural environment, as well as to buildings, we see that the economic benefits are four times greater than the costs.
We still have to work on the proposal for the directive so that, for example, the situation with regard to the applicant countries and those questions too that relate to the EU' s neighbouring regions can be better taken into account.
Mr President, the industry committee, after much discussion and serious consideration, is overwhelmingly opposed to the Commission's proposed ceilings, and this is across all groups and nationalities.
The UN ECE ceilings were agreed by all our Member States, by the applicant countries and globally, in a protocol signed at Gothenburg as recently as November 1999.
Why did the Commission come up with these even stricter and substantially more expensive ceilings only one month later?
I understand that the groups, the whole Parliament, are split on this issue, between supporters of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and supporters of the industry committee's line.
Members of Parliament should be aware of the serious implications for our industries and agriculture, for our competitiveness, for jobs and - yes - for people and our constituents if the Commission proposal wins through.
The industry committee urges this House to vote in favour of the amendments which are tabled in my name and in the name of Mr Bowe.
These are the amendments passed by the industry committee.
The UN ceilings are quite ambitious enough for us to reach our internationally agreed targets in reasonable time.
The industry committee wishes to see these limits fully and properly implemented across the European Union and globally.
The Commission can then concentrate on ensuring this occurs, on perfecting the models that are used and perhaps come up with new proposals in two or three years' time on the basis of much more convincing arguments regarding the relevant costs and benefits.
Support the Purvis amendments and the United Nations Gothenburg table of national emission ceilings.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Myller for her report and her ambitious treatment of the directive proposed by the Commission.
Even if the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy appears rather as if it had been caught napping and has only just woken up, the fact may, at all events, be conveyed that the problem of acidification is scarcely a new issue. Instead, it has been with us for as long as industrialisation - for 100 years.
Research into the question has been going on for 30 years.
None of us ought to be in any doubt about what the sources of acidification are, nor about what we should be doing regarding this issue.
Some accuse the Commission' s proposal, and also the report, as being excessive and far too costly to implement and say that the calculations that have been made are utopian.
This is, however, wrong because we know that the Member States themselves have contributed to the report which serves as a basis for the whole directive.
There is more justification for criticising the fact that we have not included the energy scenario we have emphasised elsewhere, for example in the Kyoto protocol, and which involves burning fewer fossil fuels in order also to solve the climate problems we are facing.
With all due respect to the Gothenburg protocol - and despite the fact that it has taken its name from my home town - I have to say that it is, in fact, just not on to compare this with the directive which we have to take a decision on tomorrow.
One might well wonder why the Commission' s directive appears only a month later, rather like a punishment directed against this UN directive, but that has to do, of course, with nothing other than our own sluggishness in dealing with the issue.
If we had been a little quicker off the mark, the present directive would have been on the table - signed, sealed and delivered - long before the so-called Gothenburg Protocol.
The word "impossible" has been used about the directive. I should like to say, however, that what is impossible is the situation which we have at present.
The impossibility lies, therefore, not in the directive but in the current situation.
Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs Myller who I know has thought long and hard about this report.
It seems to me that the debate comes down to this: do we believe that the Gothenburg Protocol was the best Member States can realistically achieve?
I recognise that the Commission and environmental groups believe that in practice much more can be delivered but nonetheless some Member States have committed themselves to significant reductions in air pollution - though that is certainly not true of all of them.
Some Member States seem to have gone into the negotiations with a few calculations on the back of an envelope and refused to compromise in any way to set themselves any realistic targets.
Others have not even used the same methodology, the same basis of calculation as others.
So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense.
It can give us no confidence whatsoever.
It is a messy political compromise and nothing more.
I do not know how much more the Commissioner can achieve but we should be seeking reductions in air pollution and we should be giving her our support in her efforts to negotiate them.
We should support this report and give her our backing.
Mr President, Mrs Myller has produced an excellent report, and our group too thinks we should go at lot further than the Gothenburg Protocol on this.
In all probability, drafting this directive was like a national auction, and the end result is very modest when we think what the real challenges are.
But, in any case, it is important that the European Parliament should now defend at least that policy which the Commission has chosen.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes that even stricter goals should be set for 2010 than the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has recommended.
We want to emphasise that an integrated strategy must be adopted to reduce emissions.
We have to remember that, in any case, we have the implementation of the Kyoto commitments ahead of us, which will mean insisting on more efficient use of energy and simply using less of it.
So, in our opinion, this directive must take into consideration that added benefit is to be had from an integrated strategy as regards implementing its objectives.
We are very satisfied that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy included issues of shipping and air traffic within the scope of this directive, and we are convinced that the benefits to be gained from adhering to an integrated strategy are enormous.
Mr President, in order to meet the objectives for air emission levels prescribed in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, we need this directive on emission ceilings more than anything.
If we want to combat acidification, manure pollution and smog formation, we need to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, ammonia and volatile organic substances.
The Council' s conclusions concerning the EU acidification strategy have raised expectations which now have to be given substance.
This could even be done in a cost-effective way, as is evident from the explanatory note to the Commission proposal.
We all know by now that six months ago, higher emission levels were agreed at Gothenburg within a UN context.
These values, however, are the result of a political compromise between states, and the results of the model used by the Commission have been overlooked.
This model is sound and the results are well founded.
Also in view of the fact that, with these emission ceilings, the objectives of the EU' s Fifth Environmental Action Programme still cannot be met, a relaxation of the values is unjustified.
The first step towards achieving the emission ceilings is undoubtedly a dynamic implementation and enforcement of existing directives, such as the Auto-oil programme.
In addition, we need to lay down new legislation in this field as soon as possible. In this connection, I would once more urge the Council to produce a common position on large furnaces as a matter of urgency.
Finally, additional policy, for example in the field of volatile solvents used in paints and varnishes, as well as in car spraying, will continue to be necessary.
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur.
Now to the issues: it is obvious that there are differing opinions in this House on whether the proposal of the European Commission is too ambitious.
Many are saying that it cannot be implemented using current technology or only at an exorbitant cost.
The Commission itself says that the proposal can be implemented cost effectively.
I find it interesting that the European Commission is assuming in this that energy consumption in the European Union will increase by 8% in the coming years and that there will be no change in the proportions of energy forms used and therefore no reduction in the proportion of fossil fuels.
In my opinion this is not ambitious; if anything, the opposite.
We in this House have always agreed that we must reduce the proportion of fossil fuels and that we must save energy.
If we do not achieve this, then this is a declaration of environmental bankruptcy.
If the perceptions of the European Commission as regards this basic assumption become reality, then there is no need for us to talk any further in this House about climate protection.

We must increase energy efficiency, improve energy saving and promote regenerative energies whilst, at the same time, recognising that nuclear energy produces neither CO2 nor SO2 nor NH3, volatile organic compounds or NOx.
If we are honest about it, I think that the two ideas are not mutually incompatible and for this reason I would also like to expressly oppose certain Member States demanding exemptions under the directive if they renounce nuclear energy.
This cannot happen within the context of collective environmental responsibility.
All the same, I would like once again to stress the fact that the Commission proposal is not too ambitious, but if anything a little too unambitious.
I will support it tomorrow in the vote and I hope that the majority of the House will do the same.
Mr President, I certainly welcome this report and I gave it a lot of support in the Environment Committee.
I creates a proper framework in which we can work in the long term to reduce emissions.
The vast majority of the amendments I can support.
There are one or two that went through that I have some doubts about, particularly Amendment No 7, which I cannot see as being environmental at all, or as contributing to the overall attempt to reduce the amount of ozone-depleting substances at ground level anywhere in the Union.
I want to come to the issue which Mr Davies has addressed, namely, where we should start from.
With what targets are we to start?
Mr President, a series of quite practical and well-argued and debated figures were arrived at just before Christmas at Gothenburg under the UN/ECE protocol, and it seems to me that is the logical place to start.
It would not to my mind be the right place to finish, but it certainly would be the right place to start and it is the reason why I was convinced when I was there in the debate in the Industry Committee, as none of my colleagues from the Environment Committee were, that it was the right place to start.
It seems to me that the Commission figures are aspirational.
Yes, we could go there - we should be trying to go there, but I do not think we should be starting there.
We should be starting with the UN/ECE figures, with the Gothenburg protocol and revising them as is proposed by Mrs Myller in her report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have, of course, nothing against the principle of the directive.
It is an important instrument for future environmental policy.
The Member States are given a clearer brief.
They know what they should be aiming for.
Upon examination of the table with the different ceilings for each Member State, however, I get the impression that there are double standards.
I note that, for example, my country, Belgium, has to meet the maximum possible level, rather than the economically viable level, but that, at the same time, areas in its vicinity which are just as polluted as my country can pursue a much laxer policy.
That is because a large country can use its better regions to offset its bad practices.
A small country is not in a position to do this.
I shall give you an example.
From your statistics and maps, it appears that in northern France, which is just as polluting and polluted as Belgium, matters can be processed at a lower level.
According to your calculations, the implementation of this directive costs each Belgian EUR 103 per annum, compared to EUR 15 for each person in France, including northern France.
That is eight times less. This is partly due to the fact that we are a small country and we are surrounded by polluters.
One per cent of the GDP per annum is too much of a strain for my country.
I would therefore ask you to give me your backing for Amendments Nos 16 and 17, in which I request that the Belgian Government be given the chance to re-evaluate the situation based on the annual reports.
Mr President, the biggest environmental problem in my own country is the acidification of land, forests, lakes and watercourses.
Acidification leads to the death, or reduced growth, of forests and causes fish to die and fewer plants to grow.
Acidified water also releases heavy metals which constitute a health problem.
The countryside in the Nordic countries is particularly vulnerable to acidification because these countries are largely lacking in means to protect themselves against it.
Acidification occurs due to acid rain, caused by air polluting emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels.
In Sweden and Finland, we have taken extensive measures in order to reduce national levels of air pollution.
We are making major efforts to add lime to lakes and wetlands.
We are, for the most part, complying with the emission targets proposed in the now current directive.
However, more than 80 per cent of the acid rain over our country comes from air pollution not in our own countries but in other West European countries.
We are therefore appealing for your help.
Many North Europeans believe that it is only through environmental cooperation with other EU countries that our problems with acidification can be solved.
To the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy I want to say that the UN resolution in accordance with the Gothenburg Protocol is far from being adequate.
I am convinced that the EU can be better than the UN at solving the environmental problems in Europe.
The proposed EU directive against air pollution can, in fact, constitute an important step towards combating the acidification of the countryside, mainly in the northern area of the EU.
In addition, significant reductions in the percentages of unhealthy ground-level ozone, mainly in big cities in the southern part of the EU, can at the same time be attained.
We ought therefore to have a common interest in applauding the present EU draft directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a fair wind is blowing the way of the environment and the European Parliament welcomes this.
Indeed, by virtue of an unusually fortunate coincidence, directives on waste incineration, on limit values for national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, and ozone in ambient air all feature on today' s agenda.
Previously, atmospheric pollution used to be associated with roads and traffic.
Today, however, on a large scale, it refers to the whole world, and on a small scale, it even means the house we live in.
In short, it means our whole ecosystem, and action must be taken.
Setting emission limits for the four main pollutants is a sure way to help to reduce pollution, combat acidification and limit the harmful effects of these pollutants on human health and on plant life.
In its proposal for a directive, the European Commission proposes quantified national emission ceilings, which must be met by 2010 for the four pollutants I have just mentioned.
Furthermore, it estimates the costs for each Member State of complying with these limits.
I think that this is a good strategy.
Mrs Myller' s excellent report makes a lucid evaluation of the European Commission' s proposal and considers it to be balanced; the report also seeks to strengthen the proposal in some areas.
In particular, the committee approved a compulsory review of the directive by 2004, which will enable there to be a review of the limit values stipulated and measures adopted to ensure that these limit values are respected.
All of this seems quite reasonable.
Nevertheless, I must ask a question here.
Why should we not allow a Member State to prove that it is being treated particularly unfairly because of the way the directive is implemented, as a result, for example, of its geographical situation and its climate and the fact that these leave it at a major disadvantage?
Would this not be wise?
The EU system for combating atmospheric pollution is thus being extended, strengthened and refined.
EU environmental policy is becoming more and more the environmental policy of each Member State, with obvious advantages for all Europe' s citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, the emission ceilings in the Commission' s proposal are very ambitious, more so than those agreed in the UN Economic Commission for Europe under the so-called Gothenburg Protocol, and so they should be.
For my own part, I am ready to endorse the compromise prepared by the PPE-DE Group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, according to which we shall comply with the Commission' s proposal except with regard to the area of ammonia emissions, as the proposal will not cause great problems for my own country, Finland, or our neighbour, Sweden, as has become evident on many occasions in this discussion.
However, I also understand those views that advocate electing the ceilings proposed under the Gothenburg Protocol.
However the voting goes tomorrow, I believe the Commission should continuously monitor developments in all Member States, and promote action to help industry to make the necessary changes.
It is important that the environmental objectives are achieved as cost-effectively as possible throughout the whole Community.
Air quality in Europe has improved considerably in recent years.
Emission levels have decreased significantly, at least in the energy sector, in transport and in industry.
In recent years, there have been more and more EU acts in the area of the environment and new targets have been set for industry.
I think it is something of a problem that the targets are repeatedly changed before any proper assessment has been made of the effects, in practice, on the environment and the costs to industry of the legislative measures that have been adopted.
Before further obligations are imposed it is important to ensure that the action that has already been agreed is implemented in the Member States in every respect.
These two goals are not, in my opinion, mutually exclusive.
Finally, I believe there should be international agreements on ceilings for emissions for shipping and aircraft, and, at this stage, they should not fall within the scope of the directive.
Regarding long-term goals, I am of the opinion that there should be no strict deadline, but that Member States should endeavour, in accordance with their own goals, to meet the norms by the time stipulated or earlier.
Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, we have made great strides in tackling acidification and also pollution in recent years.
I hope that this proposal will be another important step in this direction and that is why I especially want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Myller for her valuable work.
The Gothenburg Protocol is a step forward.
However, it is nowhere near enough.
The protocol goes only halfway towards the goal for acidification already agreed by Parliament and the Council.
A substantial number of people will die early if we do not adopt the measures proposed by the Commission.
The protocol is the result of a process in which there is too little pressure on the reluctant to do what they should.
We cannot let this deflect the Community from agreed goals.
The costs of the Commission's proposal must be kept in perspective, even on the Commission's highly pessimistic estimate which would not take full account of Kyoto or non-technical solutions.
They amount to only 0.08% of Community GDP in the year 2010.
Member States will have to do some of the things that will let them meet proposed emissions ceilings more cheaply if they are to live up to their Kyoto commitments.
Saying that the ceilings are too difficult is dangerously close to ignoring Kyoto.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
The Commission can accept fully Amendments Nos 3, 8, 9, 13, 19 and 21.
The Commission can accept in part the principle underlying Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
We will draft a recital which does not appear to restrict the Commission's right of initiative, for inclusion in our amended proposal.
We will also include a reference in Article 9 of the directive in order to make the new recital operational.
It follows that the Commission does not accept Amendment No 27.
The aim of the Commission's proposal is to leave as much flexibility as possible to Member States, but we cannot rule out further Community action if this would help Member States to meet emission ceilings more cost-effectively.
The Commission can also accept in part Amendment No 11 which would make further changes to Article 9.
We agree that review of the legislation should take account of aircraft emissions, further emission reductions in regions bordering on the Community, measures taken in applicant countries and transport factors.
The Commission cannot however agree to bring forward the dates for reports to Parliament and Council.
In 2003 the Commission will have almost no data from Member States on which to report and base any decisions.
The Commission will not know in 2011 whether or not ceilings were met in 2010 because of the time that must be allowed for Member States to compile inventories.
We accept in part the principles underlying Amendment No 12.
We will therefore redraft Article 9(3) to incorporate much of the material in the proposed amendment.
The Commission accepts the principles of Amendment No 23.
The reference to countries outside the UN/ECE process must be restricted to those who have supplied data and whose emissions are relevant to pollution in the Community.
The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 24, 25 and 26 in principle, and will also take them into account when it redrafts Article 9 as part of its amended proposal.
The Commission has a great deal of sympathy with the concerns underlying Amendments Nos 16 and 17.
Allowance should be made for the fact that smaller Member States have less room to spread the load.
However we are dealing here with transboundary pollution, so the Commission considers that adjustments to ceilings for individual Member States can only be made as part of a general review of ceilings.
We will therefore propose a new recital and changes to Article 9, which will ensure that effects on smaller Member States are properly taken into account on review.
The Commission can accept that part of Amendment No 20 that would insert "an appropriate" into Recital 9.
We do not accept the remainder of Amendment No 20.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15, 28, 29 and 32.
They seek to replace emission ceilings that are designed to meet the agreed Community target for acidification, and to protect our citizens' health, with the emission ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol.
Gothenburg ceilings fall far short of what is needed as has already been said.
The Commission considers that, if Member States take seriously the Kyoto commitments, the emission ceilings that it has proposed will not be difficult to implement.
We may well be able to go further by 2010, but this is something that can only be decided when we know how Member States will meet their Kyoto targets.
We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 31.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments No 4 and 14: under the principle of subsidiarity it is for Member States, not the Commission, to determine penalties for breaches of national legislation.
Furthermore, Amendment No 14 seeks to restrict the Commission's discretion under the Treaty to decide when to bring infringement proceedings.
Amendments Nos 5, 18 and 30 are also unacceptable.
The Commission is committed to pursuing long-term objectives for protection of the environment and human health, but we simply do not have enough information today to predict when long-term objectives might be reached.
The Commission must reject Amendment No 6.
Emissions from international maritime traffic and cruising aircraft cannot be wholly controlled by individual Member States, nor even by Community action, and cannot therefore be included in national emission ceilings.
Action where appropriate must be taken in the International Maritime Organisation or the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
Last week, the IMO agreed to a proposal from the Community to declare the North Sea a sulphur dioxide control area.
The Commission will examine whether further such proposals should be made to the IMO, and whether international action is also needed on aircraft emissions.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7.
It is based on a misleading comparison with the solvents directive, where processes may involve high temperatures.
Non-volatile organic compounds are automatically excluded from the definition of "volatile organic compound" in these proposals since they are not found in the air in ambient conditions and do not contribute to ozone formation.
The proposed definition is identical in the Gothenburg Protocol.
We must maintain technical consistency.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10.
It would remove an essential obligation for Member States regularly to update emission inventories.
Finally, Mr President, we do not accept Amendment No 22.
The Commission's proposed wording on the key issue of public information is in line with agreements on the first two air quality daughter directives.
Finally, I should like to answer Mrs Oomen-Ruijten because she asked about the proposals on large combustion plants.
The answer is that the Council failed to reach a common position in December and the Commission is supporting the Portuguese presidency in its effort to make progress in parallel with the progress on this proposal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environmental legislation
The next item is the joint debate on two oral questions to the Commission on structural fund programmes in the Member States and national implementation of EU environmental laws (B5 - 0014/2000 and B5 0208/2000).
Mr President, I would like, on behalf of the committee, to move at least one of the oral questions.
First of all, I sympathise with the Commissioner's desire to get better implementation of European Union law.
That is something which the committee as a whole is keen to see.
I want to quote from an article in the United Kingdom Sunday Telegraph this last Sunday.
The opening paragraph is "The European Commission has told Britain that it will lose up to 200 million pounds in grants for poorer regions unless it implements European Union laws to protect birds and their habitats".
I would like to know if the Commission is making these threats and, if it is, whether it feels that it has an entitlement to do so.
That is a question which my German colleagues who are moving the other question want to follow up.
The Environment Committee is very interested in finding ways of incorporating environmental considerations into other policies.
The question is: is this a constitutionally viable way of doing that?
What we are exploring here tonight in this crowded House is the question of linkage.
Linkage, in other words, using the threat of the withdrawal or withholding of funds to try to get better implementation of legislation in what may sometimes be a rather unconnected sector but in this case is quite a closely connected sector, is one that from time to time European Members of Parliament look at and then veer away from when they realise that it might affect the regions that they represent.
That is something which we find reflected in the views not only of some of the German Members here tonight but also in some of my British colleagues.
We need to ask to what extent the European Commission is prepared to use the provisions of Articles 12 and 41 of the general regulation on the structural funds to delay granting money where there is inadequate information on the impact of the projects which have applied for the money on the environment.
At its worst, we want to avoid the possibility that the aims of the structural funds and the European Union's concern to protect its natural habitats may collide.
For instance, you may want to build a motorway across one part of the European Union in order to spend structural fund money and bring jobs to that part of the Union, but should you not be careful if that motorway is being driven through what should have been designated a protected site by the national government?
Such possibilities have arisen in the past, especially in relation to major infrastructure projects.
We want to avoid that, but we believe that such collisions could result form the failure of the Member States to implement the habitats directive and the birds directive also, and in particular to submit to the Commission by as early as June 1995 a list of sites potentially of Community importance, either as hosting natural habitat types or representing the habitats of animal and plant species of Community importance.
We must ask: without such information, how can the Commission be certain that structural fund projects, which are usually large, will not damage sites potentially of European Union-wide importance?
Future generations will not forgive us if we allow irreplaceable habitats to be destroyed, whose preservation we actually voted for eight years ago when we adopted our report on the habitats directive and then again in 1997 with the changes to the annex of the directive.
The fault lies with those Member States which have failed to observe the directive, and that includes my own.
If doubt hangs over their entitlement to structural funds, that is the fault of national governments.
That doubt has now fallen over the position of the United Kingdom and its entitlement to Structural Funds because the United Kingdom government has not fully implemented or complied with the provisions of the habitats directive.
It is in the power of the United Kingdom government, the German government and other national governments to remove that threat by complying with the habitats and birds directive.
In the United Kingdom, structural funding for counties such as Cornwall, which I represent and which has recently been granted Objective 1 status, faces a twin threat from government indolence on this directive and from government incompetence and meanness.
Even if the European Commission uses its best efforts in the United Kingdom there is no guarantee that the scrooge-like United Kingdom Chancellor will find matching funding.
Mr President, the FFH directive is an issue which has concerned us for some time now and we are currently experiencing a few teething problems.
However, to begin let me say the following: the FFH directive is an important directive and creates a new climate in Europe for the protection of nature, the environment and birds.
I would not want to change or spare anything in achieving this.
I also find it encouraging that the Commission is consequently taking care that EU legislation is being implemented.
All the same, in the case of the FFH directive the question arises as to whether the legislation which we have adopted is actually implementable and I can see obvious weak points.
As I see it, the FFH directive is an instance where the legislation is not matched to the feasibilities of the regions.
I see a problem in the various legal interpretations in the Member States due to the partially unclear definitions in the EU legislation, whilst, on the other hand, there is a lack of strong subsidiary aspects and approaches.
Revision of the FFH directive, including the current difficulties in implementation, should not, I think be excluded.
Alongside this general criticism of the FFH directive, however, I also see a particular problem with the amalgamation of the EU environmental and structural policies.
Article 12 of the structural funds regulation adopted on 21 June 1999 provides for the possibility of sanctions in the event of violations in the following areas: implementation of environmental legislation, breaches of public contracts and failure to observe equality between men and women.
To date, the Commission has only threatened sanctions in the case of the FFH directive.
Does it also intend to initiate sanction mechanisms in the other areas?
In my opinion, this is a very problematic course of action.
The EU has a quite different means of enforcing sanctions, i.e. the European Court of Justice.
The possible cutting or withholding of money from the Structural Fund is a form of sanction whose effect on the regions concerned cannot just be disregarded.
What will happen with projects which are already under way and what will happen, above all, in those cases where a region does not receive any money from the Structural Fund?
What sanctions will the Commission then impose for non-implementation of EU environment law?
That the Commission is also totally unsure is shown by the fact that it initially wanted to include the entire state in the sanctions, then only a region, as you pointed out to Environment Minister Trittin, Commissioner.
I would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here.
Mr President, hearing the debate unfold and watching my colleagues and the clock, I am not sure what I want any more: protected areas for fauna, flora and habitats or protected areas for ecologically minded delegates.
At the moment, I am more interested in protected areas for delegates, but that is another matter.
Our question to you, Commissioner, has another purpose.
I would have liked to hear your answer first, but you have chosen to speak at the end of the debate.
We are discussing something here of which most know the history.
The fauna-flora-habitats legislation should have been implemented by 1994 - it is now the year 2000.
The European Union list of the relevant nature conservation sites should have been ready in 1998 - it is now the year 2000.
The Member States should have notified the Commission of their sites by 1995 - it is now the year 2000.
Many Member States, including my own, did not do as required.
Germany, for example, implemented the legislation in 1998 instead of 1994 - only four years late.
But what does it matter?!
As a result, the European Union list is obviously not ready.
And how could it be?
Many Member States and many regions have not announced their sites.
Now Mr Schnellhardt has even suggested that perhaps we made a mistake with the fauna-flora-habitats directive.
Perhaps, Mr Schnellhardt, you are right that it wasn' t totally practical, it wasn' t perfect, it wasn' t quite right.
Unfortunately, however, it is not the procedure in the European Union that if you don' t like a piece of legislation you don' t bother observing it.
If that were the case, then there would also be areas and matters which you and I would not like.
But we do have this unfortunate system in the European Union - what you call legal certainty.
We do have this unfortunate system - it is what you call legislation, which has been adopted in this European Parliament with the consent of the Member States.
It must be observed!
It might perhaps be a bit too strict and too legalistic, but that' s the way it is: we are living in a European Union with a legal system.
Mr Jarzembowski is the one who supports this most of all because he comes from Hamburg which is one of the few regions of Germany to be nominated, along with Berlin, my own area, although as city states we have it particularly easy, I think I can say with some justification.
However, I do not want to pass sentence on Mr Schnellhardt, who comes from one of the new federal states who do not have things quite so good.
That is an internal German problem which we will resolve at another time and in another place in the House.
Today, Mr President, we are talking about the fact that Europe is losing its countryside and about the fact that Europe must observe legal certainty.
I shall come to my final point: Commissioner, it you do not succeed in going to the European Court of Justice and bringing to account those Member States which are not properly implementing legislation, you will lose your authority and your legitimacy.
You must do it!
If you think the legislation is no good, let us revise it.
If you think it is sound, go to the European Court of Justice, and be quick about it!
Mr President, it is a pleasure to face the Commissioner for the fifth time today at this unearthly hour.
I congratulate her for her efforts in trying to make sure that the habitats directive and associated directives are properly implemented.
I wish her well.
I have heard that some in the Commission believe that they have managed to squeeze more out of Member States in the past six months than they had in the previous six years.
If that is the case then it is good news indeed.
But the Commissioner is riding between two horses: one seeks to protect endangered species, the other seeks to assist the poorest parts of Europe.
In fact, it is a position in which I too find myself to some extent.
Some simple questions: how long is the Commissioner prepared to perform this balancing act?
Just how much must Member States do to meet her requirements?
Is she really prepared to tell people such as those whom I represent in Merseyside and the North-West of England that they must lose Structural Funds because their governments have failed to comply with the habitats directive?
That is the balance I suppose.
Fundamentally and finally, is she prepared to compromise to find solutions, if the undertakings being given by government or the work being undertaken by governments takes longer than we would wish?
For example, if a Minister goes down on his knees, cut his wrists and writes a pledge in letters of blood that he will deliver the habitats directive in full within an agreed timetable, is she prepared to assist the region and provide structural funding in such circumstances?
- The question on how the Structural Funds respect our environmental legislation is a critical one and I appreciate the interest expressed in this matter by Mrs Jackson, Mr Poettering and Mrs Schnellhardt.
We had a discussion on this subject in the Commission meeting today particularly as regards the link to the habitats and the birds directives.
The main principle is clear: the actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund should contribute to the protection and improvement of the environment in the European Union.
This is confirmed in the new regulatory framework for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund and in the Commission's related guidelines.
We should remember that both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds finance important investments into environmental infrastructure such as waste water treatment facilities or waste management systems.
Let me make one thing clear first to avoid misunderstandings.
The general regulation on the Structural Funds states that 'operations financed must be in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty, with instruments adopted under it and with Community policies and actions' .
Contrary to the suggestion in one of the oral questions, this does not represent a new obligation on the Member States.
In fact, it is based closely on the previous framework regulation on the Structural Funds for the programming period 1994-1999.
The Structural Funds Regulation has been approved by the Member States and the Council.
With regard to protection of sites under the habitats and birds directives, it is important that we do not give money to measures which adversely affect sites deserving protection - paying out money with one hand and maybe fining a Member State with the other hand.
This is what we confirmed in the Commission this afternoon, and Michel Barnier will set out our decisions in a letter to the Member States in a few days.
In this regard, the Commission intends to use all the possibilities offered by the new regulatory framework for the Cohesion and Structural Funds.
In following up the letter sent to Member States by Commissioners Wulf-Mathies and Bjerregaard on June 23 1999, the Commission will insist that, in the programming documents for the period 2000-2006, there must be a firm and irrevocable commitment guaranteeing that the programmes are consistent with the protection of sites under Natura 2000.
Member States will be required to notify sites if they have not already done so within an agreed timetable, and to guarantee formally that they will not undertake action leading to the deterioration of potential Natura 2000 sites.
The Commission will then use all the means at its disposal to ensure that commitments entered into the programming documents are fully respected.
It intends to monitor the situation in the Member States, including the use of on-the-spot checks.
The Commission's representative in the monitoring committee for each programme will also seek to ensure that Member States' obligations with regard to Natura 2000 are fully respected.
In addition, should a Member State not honour its commitment to provide the lists under the habitats and birds directives within the timeframe set in the programming documents, the Commission will take immediate action.
This includes in particular excepting specific situations and with respect to the principle of proportionality - possible recourse to the provisions of the Structural or Cohesion Fund regulations in relation to the suspension of payments.
Of course, all this is in addition to the ongoing infringement procedures against a number of Member States for their failure to implement these directives.
In summing up, what we decided in Commission today is that we will insist that Member States send us their Natura 2000 lists: they should already have been sent, as has been stated many years ago.
We will use the means at our disposal to ensure that they honour the commitments that they have entered into.
Without the lists neither the Member States nor the Commission can ensure that we protect important nature sites when carrying out Structural Fund operations, for the simple reason that we do not know where these sites are.
One more word on the habitats directive.
The Commission does not agree that there is a lack of clarity in this directive.
The directive is intended to establish a frame of reference which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, leaves the detailed implementation to the Member States.
While the Commission has no plans to revise the directive, its services are ready to provide guidance to the Member States on its implementation and we are finally starting to move on this.
The only sites which the Commission takes into account under the habitats directive are those put forward by the authorities in the Member States.
So-called shadow lists can only help in efforts to identify sites inside the Member States.
At Community level, they can contribute to scientific reference material in the creation of inventories of natural habitats and existing species.
Thank you for clarifying that matter, but we are still rather distressed at the statement you have just made because we were under the impression that the previous Commission was working on the simple principle of 'no lists, no funds' .
You are now going back on that principle; you are going back to the Member States to ask them to provide the lists.
They are seriously late.
They have completely failed to meet the requirements of the European directives.
So, today, it is still not clear to us whether you intend to utilise the technical, legal and political means available to you in order to enforce European directives.
As a result, I can see the Member States laughing their socks off at this new position because, in the final analysis, once again they have gained a little more time and it is nature conservation which is going to suffer.
From reading the various reports of the European Union, and the European Environment Agency, it is clear that environmental damage is still continuing.
The question I am asking, then, is as follows: today, when accepting the draft Community support framework for Portugal, did you demand the list of protected sites under the terms of the directives?
Mr President, my first report as an MEP was on precisely the same topic as that which we are discussing here today: the environment and the Structural Funds.
And, of course, I came to the basic conclusion that projects financed by the Structural Funds should not, under any circumstances, damage the environment of the Member States and, to that end, greater consideration should be given to the environmental dimension at all levels when programming and implementing the relevant Union policies.
I still believe this today; our main objective must always be sustainable development, i.e. development which respects and promotes the environment.
Therefore, Parliament should take this line and call on the Commission, in its vote, to implement the Structural Fund programmes in a way which takes account of Community environmental legislation, particularly with regard to directives on the preservation of natural habitats and wild birds. At the same time, however, we should avoid over-reacting.
We should not suspend all the programmes or refuse to approve any of them just because we cannot guarantee that the odd regulation will be upheld.
This reminds me of a Greek proverb: you cannot chop off your head just because you have tooth ache.
I am not suggesting that we contravene legislation.
Rather, I am suggesting that we go ahead and implement the programmes and, at the same time, monitor the implementation of legislation and ensure that the Commission keeps Parliament informed.
It is important to remember that very important measures and projects are financed under the Structural Funds in the most problematic countries and regions of the Union, countries and regions which desperately need help in their endeavours to develop and converge with the more developed Member States.
We should also bear in mind, Mr President, that measures promoting the environment are often financed by the Structural Funds.
If we were to suspend all the programmes without exception for the reason given by a number of speakers here, we would be doing our environment more harm than good.
Mr President, there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation.
I was surprised to see you quoted in my press as threatening to cut off European funding.
I consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve.
You will know that in the case of the UK, at a moderation seminar, the Commission agreed a timetable to allow for review and inclusion of additional sites.
In Paris a timetable was set to allow for a revised list to be presented in July with another moderation in October 2000.
We are determined, after years of foot-dragging by the previous Conservative Government - Mrs Jackson's party - to meet our requirements in the UK, in good faith, to follow the proper legal and proper consultation to ensure this directive is complied with.
This process is ongoing and I have no reason to believe that any plans submitted for regional funding breached the EU habitats and wild bird directives at this stage.
Therefore, I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution.
But let us be clear.
Any refusal by the Commission to approve the programme - for example, in Merseyside - thus undermining Â£2 billion worth of investment, or any other Objective I area, including Cornwall, involving 5 million people in the UK, would actually breach - you said this Commissioner - the well-established Commission principle of proportionality, namely the obligation to pursue the least restrictive way of ensuring compliance with EU legislation - in this case the habitats and wild bird directive.
We therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends.
In the final analysis any breach of EU legislation must actually go the European Court of Justice.
I cannot accept that such a balance means the cutting off of vital lifelines of EU funds to the poorest and neediest regions.
Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on.
I therefore ask the Commissioner to take collective responsibility for ensuring that Structural Fund programmes are implemented in time.
That is your responsibility as a member of the college.
Unlike the last speaker I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your threat to cut off European funding.
It should not just be an idle threat.
You should carry it out if Member States do not act responsibly.
I come from a Member State which benefits from European funding but I am appalled at its track record on the implementation of the wild birds directive, on the habitats directive and many other directives.
We are, per capita, the worst country as regards complaints.
It is about time the European Commission took action and decided that if you are not willing to abide by the rules then the funding has to be cut off.
If this affects my own country, then so be it.
Member States have to comply with European regulations.
Former commissioners wrote to the Irish Government saying: "If you do not have on your list habitat areas to be protected then when you put in your national plan how are we going to assess whether it is in compliance with European directives?"
You must stick to that.
If Member States are not willing to comply with the directives, cut off the funding.
I would support you one hundred percent.
- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are too many projects and programmes funded by the EU that do not comply with the objectives of sustainable development and nature conservation required by the Treaties and by secondary legislation.
It is easy to demonstrate this: on the one hand, we allocate almost half of our resources to agriculture, but we nevertheless continue to fund an intensive form of farming designed to achieve high levels of productivity, whatever the cost, ignoring the support available for organic farming and extensive farming.
On the other hand, we spend a third of our resources on the Structural Funds, but the projects funded under those funds are the first to contravene directives on habitats.
Portugal is a perfect example of what I have just been talking about, and as it is a perfect example, it merits a thorough explanation.
In Portugal there is not only no definitive list of protected sites of Community importance for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network, but even though it is compulsory, there are no plans, rules or mechanisms for the management and protection of sites that have already been selected.
In other words, the Portuguese sites that already form part of the Natura 2000 network are completely at the mercy of unscrupulous groups of financiers and construction companies, because of the lack of instruments to protect them.
The most serious case is that of the tourist development that has been approved for the Abano area of the Sintra-Cascais national park, and I call on the Commission to intervene in this as a matter of urgency.
In Portugal, however, it is the state itself that is currently preparing to carry out projects, some of which are being funded by the Structural Funds, for sites which have been or will be classified by the EU as part of the Natura 2000 network.
Unfortunately, what is happening in Portugal is not unique - it is merely a good example.
I therefore hope that the Commission will bring its legal authority to bear and refuse to approve any funding for the third Community support framework until Member States send in their lists for the Natura 2000 network.
Mr President, what is at stake in this debate is whether the EU's commitment to sustainable development in theory, actually means something in practice, whether when push comes to shove, we are prepared to make some very difficult decisions.
Sustainable development is supposed to be about integrating economic development with environmental concerns.
That is what the EU has signed up to in countless treaties from the Rio Earth Summit onwards.
That is what Article 6 of our own EC Treaty obliges us to do - to integrate those policies.
At the heart of this debate is the issue of economic development coming right up against environmental constraints.
We are going to be increasingly faced with hard decisions on this.
It will be a very good test of what our commitment to sustainable development really means.
At a recent plenary session, we talked a lot about coherence in EU policies.
Members from all over this House were rightly emphasising how important policy coherence is, yet here we have an outstanding example of policy incoherence.
That is why the Greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the Environment Committee.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to your address very carefully, but I have not fully understood it.
I will read the communication from the Commission very carefully, but perhaps you can help me to understand matters.
Are you of the opinion that the Commission can block entire approvals for plans, or is it just payment of funds for individual projects?
That was not at all clear.
Let me say two or three things.
Firstly, I think that Community law must be seen as a whole.
Community law provides that if a Member State fails to implement legislation, or implements it incorrectly, the State will be brought to justice.
You should do that!
You should not try to achieve through the back door, through the non-payment of money, what you are unable to achieve through legal action and orderly process. This is something which I do not think is quite right.
If you are saying that Member States are contravening Community law, breaching Community law, then bring these Member States to justice!
But to fail to do this in favour of the back-door approach of trying to stop the payment of money in order to indirectly force the hand of the Member States is something that I quite simply consider to be wrong and even cowardly!
Secondly, Commissioner, the Structural Funds are not given out to damage the countryside.
They are given out to create jobs and to kick-start the regions.
We must not therefore, in order to achieve another objective, obstruct or abandon the original aim of supporting disadvantaged areas.
What is more, it should not be the case that one Commissioner sets himself up as some sort of Supreme Commissioner who can then dictate to the other.
None of us want anything for the environment to be left undone.
But it isn' t on, Mr President, Commissioner, that regions might suffer because Member States are failing in their duties!
Here too we must watch out!
- (PT) Mr President, following the words of my colleagues which prove how necessary the resolution we are discussing actually is, I should like to use my speaking time to condemn two particularly damaging cases which affect my country, Galicia, but which could equally be taking place in other European countries.
In Pontevedra, practically within the city limits, and occupying a particularly sought-after location by the sea, the huge industrial chemicals complex built by the public companies ENCE and ELNOSA, which produce cellulose pulp and chlorine, is contaminating water and air with the connivance of the Galician and Spanish authorities and in spite of the continuing protests of the local population.
In Vila Garcia de Arousa, repositories have been installed in a wharf financed by the ERDF to hold 80 000 cubic metres of hydrocarbons, which pose a serious threat to fishing and related activities which provide jobs for 18 000 people, if these hydrocarbons are handled on a regular basis or if accidents with transporting vessels occur.
Mr President, I believe the issue of ensuring integrated and correct implementation of the Community' s environmental policy is perhaps the greatest challenge facing the Member States today.
Unfortunately, however, the requirements of environmental policy are not being respected and are not being properly incorporated when programmes and projects are formulated and approved in the Member States.
The problem is in fact much worse; in addition to the fact that environmental legislation is being contravened in projects and programmes which have received Community approval and funding, it is also being contravened during the implementation of projects and programmes in receipt of private or national funding.
I should just like to draw your attention to paragraph b and point 3 and 8 of the resolution which takes account of precisely this issue.
