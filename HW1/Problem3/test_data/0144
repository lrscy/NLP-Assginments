I can assure you that, like you, we believe that there should not be any presumption that the law is being breached in concentrations, and that they are, therefore, effectively different from cartels, for example.
That much is clear.
I would like to reassure the rapporteur, MrÂ Della Vedova, the draftsman, MrÂ Doorn, and also MrÂ Karas, MrÂ Mann and other Members about this basic principle.
It is therefore only right that our powers of enforcement should not be any more extensive than necessary.
Nevertheless, our priority objective is to ensure that these powers are sufficiently effective to allow the Commission to discharge its duties and to protect consumers against the risk of harm from anticompetitive concentrations, and I believe that the powers we have proposed are necessary to this end.
Of course, you may well argue that, as control of concentrations is an area different from other aspects of competition, less draconian powers are needed here than those required, for instance, to combat cartels.
Although I have said that these are two different areas, forgive me if I come to a different conclusion about enforcement powers.
Why?
Because concentrations have a unique Â one-off if you likeÂ  structural impact on the market, which is irreversible.
For this reason, there is an argument that it is even more vital for the Commission to have effective powers to collect information, as otherwise we may reach a decision whose consequences for competition would be irreparable.
My final point, MrÂ President, concerns workers' rights, a subject raised by MrÂ Berenguer Fuster, MrsÂ van den Burg and MrÂ Santos, and an issue on which other Members disagreed with them.
I believeÂ - like those dissenting voices -Â that we are all working within the social market economy, and we consider workers' rights to be of the utmost importance.
In fact, as has already been mentioned, appropriate instruments exist at Community level, but we believe there is a need for appropriate allocation of the various instruments to a range of different objectives.
The regulation on concentrations is principally concerned with the components of the social market economy, and we do not, therefore, believe that it should be cluttered with measures to stimulate or safeguard employment: there are other instruments for that.
In any case, the notifications are in the public domain, so that interested parties, including trade union representatives, are kept fully informed of whatever merger operations are in progress.
We have, in any case, welcomed, and, what is more, at times actually sought the input that workers' representatives can provide in the procedure.
I would like to thank all the speakers once again for their contributions and, in particular, MrÂ Della Vedova and MrÂ Doorn.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0311/2003) by MrÂ Rack, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network (COM(2002) 769 - C5-0635/2002 - 2002/0309(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you all remember the terrible fires that occurred in French, Italian, Austrian and Swiss road tunnels in 1999 and 2001.
In order to prevent any repetition of these disasters, or at least to ensure that if they do occur the consequences are not so tragic, at the beginning of the year the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive seeking to establish minimum safety requirements for tunnels.
The Commission also received encouragement for its approach through several resolutions adopted by your Parliament, specifically following the fire in the Gothard tunnel in October 2001.
The Commission proposal targets all road tunnels over 500 metres long that form part of the trans-European network, totalling around 500 tunnels.
Tunnels in the trans-European network are actually used by drivers of all nationalities and it appears that the consequences of fires can be considerably diminished if persons finding themselves in such situations have access to standard safety equipment and to homogenous information on the best attitude to adopt in order to protect themselves.
The proposal contains both technical and organisational requirements.
Without listing all the measures, the most important ones can be summarised as follows: extremely long tunnels must have fully working equipment, in particular emergency exits and improved ventilation systems.
Automatic fire detectors must be capable of informing tunnel users of any potential danger.
The Commission also proposes that emergency signals with a uniform safety standard should be installed and should be easy to understand for all users.
We believe that all the proposed technical measures are necessary.
Some people have been surprised at the highly technical nature of the proposal but if you compare the measures envisaged for the technical regulations set by international courts, or at national level, you will realise that these are necessary in order to cover the essential aspects.
At the organisational level, roles and responsibilities will from now on be clearly divided between the main actors involved, who are: the administrative authority, the tunnel user and the person or body responsible for safety.
These measures will apply to new tunnels, and also to existing tunnels, which will have to be brought up to standard in line with a timetable spread over ten to fifteen years.
Member States that have more than the Community average number of tunnels in their territory will have a longer deadline for bringing their older tunnels into line with the directive.
The task facing the engineers responsible for the safety of these tunnels in the Member States is a long one and the directive must be adopted as soon as possible.
As a result of the meetings that we have already held with some of you, I know that we can count on you to reach rapid agreement with the Council on this dossier.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although tunnels are among the safest parts of the European road network, accidents in tunnels often result in grave consequences, among which the psychological effects are not to be ignored.
In tunnels, people feel shut in.
The three major accidents in the Tauern, Mont Blanc and St Gotthard tunnels â to which the Commissioner has already referred â made the peculiar characteristics of accidents in tunnels tragically apparent.
When these accidents occurred, Parliament pressed the Commission to initiate action on tunnel safety.
Some time elapsed before the Commission, at the beginning of this year, submitted its proposal for a directive on minimum requirements for the safety of tunnels in the trans-European road network.
Let it be emphasised from the outset that this proposal by the Commission is a good one.
Our amendments were an attempt at making it even better, and I believe that we succeeded in doing so by dint of cooperation with the Commission and good dialogue with the Council, which, working in parallel with us, agreed a few days ago on the content of its Common Position, which it is â or so I hear â keen to complete tomorrow.
We can expect, at second reading, to come to very quick agreement on a common directive, aiming to make European road transport safer, and in the hope that we will do so as soon as possible.
In the longer term, though, we cannot be satisfied with this outcome.
Our joint proposal â as I would like to call it â still has an array of cosmetic blemishes and real defects.
Let me start by pointing them out.
Our text focuses on one partial aspect of the issue of tunnel safety.
In essence, we are demanding high standards in building work and elsewhere, but it is equally important to make improvements to the way in which people use tunnels.
There needs to be better general training of drivers, and there is a particular need for better-trained drivers of passenger and freight vehicles.
Nor can we be content with improving the safety of tunnels that are part of the TENs, while taking no account of the other road tunnels.
We must act as quickly as possible to incorporate into our system the candidate countries and the others that intend to join us, and, as there is more to Europe than the EU, countries such as Switzerland, Norway and others as well.
The Commission has held out to us the prospect of certain things being done in response to these points.
To some extent, though, it is the jurisdiction situation that prevents us from using legislation to work towards what we need, so, together, we have a certain amount of persuading to do.
The candidate countries and those Europeans who are not yet in the EU have already, this time round, participated very actively in our work, and we hope they will continue to do so.
I will take it as read that our proposalâs good points largely speak for themselves, but there are a number of details to which I would nevertheless like to give special mention.
We tried very hard to lay down clear lines of responsibility.
We worked hard to achieve flexibility, so that the users of tunnels can enjoy a properly high level of safety without delay, particularly where tunnels are old and in need of repair.
We also attached particular importance to the practicability of what we were proposing in very many individual cases, of which the particular problems of tunnels in cities may be taken as representative.
One issue whose importance has been particularly stressed to me back home has to do with the safety of disabled people.
I hope that we have come to the right conclusion as to what they need, and we have made constructive efforts to ensure that they too, in the event of a calamity, can expect a minimum standard of safety.
My final task as rapporteur is a thankful one.
I would like to thank the many people who have helped to achieve this outcome in which we all share: the Commission and its staff; the various partners in dialogue from the Member States, but also â even though I am repeating myself â from Switzerland and Norway, and the Members of all the groups in this House and their assistants.
Last but not least, I would like to express my personal gratitude to the member of the Committee secretariat, Mr Haug, for his many hours of dedicated work.
I hope that, at second reading, he will support us as efficiently as he has done to date, and that things will work together so that we have, as soon as possible, better laws on safety in European tunnels.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurâs amendments to the Commission proposal are excellent, and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses them.
Most of the amendments tabled by Mr Rack are intended on the one hand, to prescribe realistic safety standards for tunnels, and, on the other, to avoid the system for responsibility for implementation of common safety standards becoming too complicated and bureaucratic.
I believe that he deserves particular credit for this.
As the rules on the safety of tunnels tend very much to have been drafted with the tunnels in the Alps and similar areas in mind, but would make for major problems with traffic flow in those tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network that run through towns and cities, we endorse the rapporteurâs proposal that the administrative authorities be empowered to grant derogations from the general regulations for special tunnels in urban areas, as the minimum intervals â of 100 metres between HGVs, for example â would result in substantial tailbacks and hence in greater damage to the environment in tunnels in cities, the tunnel under the Elbe in Hamburg being one example.
Similar considerations apply in the case of the obligatory examination of HGVs equipped with additional tanks before they enter a tunnel, which, thank God, is to be dropped as a result of the rapporteurâs vote.
Let me conclude by saying that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the demand that building work to improve the safety of tunnels should receive general financial support from the TENs budget, as such measures could well overstretch the financial resources of individual Member States, and as improved safety in tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network is in the interest of all citizens of the EU.
If I may put that in more specific terms, Commissioner, most tunnels are situated in that lovely country, Italy, and if Italy were to bear alone the cost of making transport safe, it would make for a problem for us all.
That being so, I believe it to be important that the Community should â Mr Swoboda is catching my eye at this point â use TENs funds to cover a share of the work on improving tunnels in those countries that have long ones, as the reason why we want to improve the tunnels that these countries provide â whether we are talking here about Austria, Italy or even Switzerland and France â is the safety of those who travel through them, who are not only Italians and Austrians, but also many Danes, Germans and people from the Netherlands.
This means that this aspect of finance is one that we should particularly take into account.
Again, though, many thanks, Mr Rack, for your outstanding report.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by thanking Mr Jarzembowski for the way in which he acknowledges the great value of transit areas for Europeâs road users as a whole, in view of which I do not doubt that he will play a very active part in the Conciliation Committee when it considers the transit issue.
Thank you for that!
I wanted, of course, also to extend warm thanks to Mr Rack for his report and for the work he has done.
It has indeed not been an easy task, but it has been a technical one, having much to do with the safety of our fellow citizens and with the protection of their lives and limbs.
Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out how difficult it is to weigh in the balance maximum safety on the one hand and costs â which have to be affordable â on the other.
If one were to look at this solely from the point of view of the safety of human beings, one would have to demand immediate rebuilding, with bi-directional tunnels and so on. If, though, one considers these things in relation to costs â which one also has to do â then a new middle way has to be found.
I agreed with the rapporteur that the rather stringent regulation that the Commission proposed was a good foundation.
It became apparent, though, in the course of debates in the committee, as well as in discussions with the Council and, eventually, with the Commission, that some points might well call for a gentler approach, and so we came to a compromise, but one that takes account of the essential safety aspects.
Mr Jarzembowski has already made reference to the special conditions that apply in cities.
We have always attached great importance to the clear demarcation of responsibilities, so that there should be no lack of clarity about who is responsible for what in matters affecting the safety of tunnels.
That is why the establishment of supervisory bodies and the appointment of a safety coordinator for each tunnel is so very important, for we can see that the principal problem with safety measures of this kind is that nobody really feels responsible.
It is also important that rules for this should be laid down by the European Union and that we in the committee accepted the Commissionâs proposals with only minor modifications.
I share the view that we should, of course, not limit ourselves to building work, but that measures should also be taken to organise traffic.
On that, I would have liked to see better account taken of several amendments, but it has to be clear to us from the outset that diversions, speed restrictions and rules on the intervals between vehicles are necessary in those places where they make sense and will not lead to serious traffic jams, as is professional training for drivers of heavy goods vehicles â for it is particularly in connection with the transport of hazardous loads that we have seen particularly serious accidents.
Just as is stated in the motion, I take the view that the Member States will of course have to comply by doing this not only with reference to the trans-European networks, but also, and to an adequate degree, in the other tunnels and in the other parts of the road network.
So let me reiterate my belief that this is a good report with a realistic approach, and say that I agree with the Commissioner that we and the Council need to come to a shared solution without delay.
Once again, then, many thanks to the rapporteur for the work he has done.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having seen a wide variety of serious accidents in tunnels in the European Unionâs road network, discussion of how to guarantee a high standard of safety throws up, yet again, the crucial question as to the extent to which the European Union should lay down detailed and specific technical rules, or, to put it another way, how much leeway there has to be for various ways of adapting to change.
Mr Rackâs compromise is the right one, and for finding it he deserves our gratitude.
I do, nevertheless, have five comments to make.
Firstly, and quite apart from all the flexibility involved in allocating tunnels to safety categories, it would have been desirable to lay down standardised indicators for assessing the safety of tunnels, which it might then have been sensible to use to analyse all the tunnels in the European Union, rather than only those forming part of the trans-European networks; this would have brought with it even greater added value in terms of improving safety.
Such indicators would also make it possible to carry out a risk analysis or an evaluation of dangerous situations and accidents on the basis of common benchmarks.
I therefore find it regrettable that the text no longer contains the Commissionâs proposal on the standardised application of harmonised norms to working methods in conformity assessment bodies.
Secondly, there is the closely-connected question of whether it is right that the tunnel management should, as an organisation with its own functions, also be able to be the body that investigates accidents.
I do not think it should, as one cannot exclude the possibility of conflicts of interest, which would be detrimental to the maintenance of safety.
Thirdly, I fully support the new ruling that, where tunnels impinge upon the territory of two Member States, joint investigating bodies are to be set up to exercise the necessary functions.
Fourthly, it appears to me that, quite apart from the measures for which this report provides to impose minimum requirements for the safety of tunnels, there is a whole range of other actions that could help improve safety, and do so more simply and probably at less cost.
In this I include what Mr Swoboda has already said about additional rules for tunnel usersâ speed, the distance between their vehicles, the giving of particular signals, markings, and so on.
My fifth point is that all the technical measures that have been proposed can have little effect when a driver is over-tired.
Modern technology notwithstanding, what is ultimately crucial in road transport, as in so many other areas of society, is the human factor.
I would therefore like to call upon the Council â even though it is not represented here â to deliver a final position on the Regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport.
Â Â  Mr President, we pay a high price for road traffic.
And this time I am not referring to the Frenchor the German, but to the death and mutilation of people with a value as human beings that cannot be expressed in money terms.
Every year, some 40Â 000 men and women die on our roads, the equivalent of two full jumbo jets crashing every week in the fifteen EU Member States.
Annually, more than 200Â 000 people are scarred for life through injury and/or a handicap.
Never do we in any way take note of these statistics.
Last week, a delegation of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which I had the pleasure of chairing, visited two long tunnels with two-way traffic in the Alps.
One of those was the Mont Blanc tunnel â 11.6 km long â where, in March 1999, a burning lorry caused an inferno, thereby claiming the lives of 39 people.
Our visit started with a brief moment at the monument that was erected in memory of those victims.
During the three years that this tunnel was subsequently closed, considerable investments have been made in a large number of facilities, which have been discussed in this report.
Nevertheless, the sight of lorries passing each other in both directions on a total width of no more than seven metres is still a frightening one.
Mr Rack has rendered the proposal more effective without underestimating the seriousness of the risks.
We therefore hope that the Commission is willing to recognise this.
Â Â  Mr President, mountain ridges are a hindrance to crossing traffic, and so, tunnels offer the only solution to provide the shortest possible connecting route.
It is an expensive solution; construction of such tunnels initially claimed many lives, and it was until recently used only in exceptional circumstances.
The nineteenth century saw the start of railway tunnels, to which were added, in the twentieth, tunnels for cars.
Meanwhile, engineering is increasingly enabling us to build tunnels under cities, under protected areas of outstanding natural beauty and under sea straits.
These days, tunnel piping is inserted even under flat land consisting of soft, waterlogged peaty soil, as is the case in the Netherlands.
Not only are tunnels now used on a much broader scale than in the past, but they are also used much more often.
As a result, there is a considerably greater risk of explosions, fires and of people being suffocated.
Until the recent fires, starting with the one in the Mont Blanc tunnel, far too little attention was paid to these risks.
Meanwhile, economic interests mean that two-way lorry traffic across busy roads in one tunnel pipe is still permitted.
Where this traffic is halted temporarily, it meets with protests from those living in the vicinity when it is allowed to resume.
On the basis of experience gathered to date, I have reached the conclusion that tunnels without separate lanes and without parallel escape tunnels are unsuitable for use by large numbers of cars and by heavy goods traffic.
Roads offer individual drivers too much freedom for dangerous and deviant behaviour.
Tunnels offer more options for rail traffic, but here too, escape routes are required.
Moreover, it is likely that the two extremely long tunnels that will run under Switzerland, and the Brenner base tunnel, designed to run from Germany to Italy under Austria, will be suitable only for freight traffic.
My colleague, Mr Markov, has already addressed the issues of supervision and cross-border tunnels.
Whilst I unreservedly support proposals to improve emergency exits and to make them suitable for wheelchair users, or other measures to step up safety requirements, I do not consider them to be adequate.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the lack of money in the public kitty, scarcely anyone can really object to improving safety standards on Europeâs roads in view of the yearly accident statistics, which show over 40Â 000 dead, and 1.6 million injured, some of them seriously.
In Thuringia, the German province from which I come, the longest motorway tunnel in Germany was opened a few weeks ago.
Even though it is also â as predicted beforehand, the safest â many drivers still find using it highly stressful.
When the Commission launched its draft directive on the improvement of safety in tunnels, I was, on the one hand, glad that it is fundamentally in accordance with the third action programme to improve road safety, which we had welcomed, but I was also concerned and disturbed by the prospect of an enormous increase in bureaucracy and of the high costs resulting from it, which, it appeared, would devolve upon the Member States.
After all, tunnel routes were not and are not among the most dangerous or accident-prone stretches of road in our Community.
Today, my fears have been allayed, as the rapporteur â to whom let me now express my particular gratitude and appreciation â has managed after all to tighten up the draft directive, to further develop and restructure it, to make it less bureaucratic and its technical provisions more flexible.
In this process, vitally significant safety aspects have not been disregarded; on the contrary, it has been possible to extend them, for example, by taking into account the safety needs of people with disabilities, which makes sense and is â and, I think, in view of this being the European Year of People with Disabilities â positively necessary.
It remains to me to urge that this be speedily transposed into national law and to express the hope that it will have a tangible and positive effect on our road users, both in psychological and in real terms.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rack, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for wholeheartedly embracing this highly technical proposal and for then managing it in a pragmatic and constructive way.
I am pleased to note, first of all, that there is a broad degree of consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the measures to be adopted.
Differences of opinion, where they occur, only relate to aspects that are relatively minor in comparison with the aims that are being pursued here and which are: to achieve, within a decade, a substantial improvement in the level of protection provided for users of major trans-European road network tunnels.
With regard to Mr Rackâs report, I should like, MrÂ President and Mr Rack, not to go through the 78 amendments one by one, but to divide them into groups.
Parliament has been given a set of highly technical amendments which are intended, if I am not mistaken, to bring the Commissionâs proposal more into line with the text that has resulted from the work of the Council, which has itself held many meetings with experts on this issue.
In principle, the Commission has no major objection to these amendments because we feel we have endeavoured to prevent the Council from deviating from the proposalâs original intentions.
The Commission also wishes to highlight several amendments that pay specific attention to persons with disabilities, to ensure that they are able to escape in the event of a fire.
We are, in principle, in favour of the directive making specific reference to disabled people.
The experts tell us that, in the event of major fires that cannot be put out, users have only a very short time around ten minutes in which to reach shelter.
Unfortunately, therefore, persons in wheelchairs, who move more slowly, are at greater risk than able-bodied people.
We believe that all of the directiveâs provisions will lead to considerable improvements to the protection of the disabled.
Some amendments are intended to modify the terminology used in order to designate the various levels for which clarification of responsibilities is sought.
The Commission does not wish to accept these amendments, because moving away from terminology which now appears to be almost universally accepted would not help us to achieve our goal of clarification.
Some amendments relate to aspects not covered by the directive but which are important for tunnel safety or for implementing measures.
I am thinking in particular of the amendments relating to driver training or to the financing of tunnel repairs.
Although these are only simple recitals, they fall outside the scope of the directive and we do not feel able to accept them.
In fact, when you add them up, the Commission can accept totally or in principle 52 amendments; it can accept one other in part and there are 25 amendments that it cannot accept.
These somewhat stark figures are not an accurate reflection of the real situation, which is that between the Commission and Parliament, and I think I can say between Parliament and the Council, there is greater agreement than the figures suggest on the essential aspects of the dossier.
I therefore wish to express the hope that the three institutions manage to take a decision so that the directive can be adopted rapidly.
As I said, the engineers face a long haul in order to bring the tunnels into line with the provisions of the directive and this work must be begun as soon as possible.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0303/2003) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries (COM(2002) 637 - C5-0070/2003 - 2003/2034(INI)).
Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna will take the floor as a replacement for the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, who has been called away to attend to other higher duties.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a very important person is missing from the Chamber today, our rapporteur.
Mr Cunha, as our President has said, has been called away to take up other political duties in his homeland, in the north of Portugal, and that is where he has gone.
I would like firstly to congratulate him, as does the whole of this House I believe, for the good memories we all have of him and we wish him great success in his new role.
Today we are debating his report, and I have the honour, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, of presenting it to you.
We are dealing with a very complete and very positive report, enriched with the amendments approved in our Committee on Fisheries.
It describes all the enormous possibilities offered by international fisheries agreements, both for the European Union and for third countries.
There remain in this Parliament certain recalcitrant Members who are dubious about the international fisheries agreements, but fortunately there are far fewer of them than in 1994 when we discussed this issue in this Parliament.
The vast majority recognise their enormous advantages.
Recently, 24 developing countries, who met in Galicia on 16 and 17 September at the , approved the conclusions of the fourth Conference of Fisheries Ministers, all of them calling for the maintenance and increase of international fisheries agreements as instruments for trade and development cooperation.
That the benefits are mutual, nobody calls into question.
And neither that they are essential to both parties.
And that there must be no discrimination or differentiated treatment between certain agreements, such us those in the North, and others, such as those in the South, either.
The development cooperation in the field of fisheries represented by international fisheries agreements is obvious; and that, through them, the European Union is achieving responsible fishing in these third-country fishing grounds and the development of a sustainable fisheries sector, is also obvious.
The developing countries, at the fourth world conference which I have just referred to, all called for more cooperation, for more investments in their countries, for more scientists, for more joint undertakings, and this is undoubtedly the way forward for the future.
Namibia, for example, is today a world fishing power, a zealous guardian of its fisheries resources and sustainable fishing, and this is all the result of European investments.
Neither should we forget the essential commercial aspect of these fisheries agreements for the European Union, where they generate work for our fleets, jobs for our fishermen and work for our processing industries.
Europe has the example of the adversity caused by the failure to renew certain fisheries agreements, as in the case of Morocco, which is still a controversial issue for this Parliament.
And now it is also aware of the urgent need for relocation in other fishing grounds, within the context of these agreements, and for formulas, such as mixed undertakings and temporary associations of companies, when recovery plans are approved in accordance with scientific reports, which the European Union is the first to respect, such as those which are currently taking place in Community waters and non-Community waters, in external waters, as in the case of halibut in the NAFO.
In summary, the international fisheries agreements are an essential mechanism for the European Union and for the third countries, since both parties benefit mutually from them, as the Cunha report points out in a crystal clear fashion.
I therefore hope to have this House's support tomorrow in the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna was right to note at the very outset that the one person missing today is the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, whom I am therefore unable to thank personally for his report on our communication on fisheries partnership agreements.
Since becoming a Member of the European Parliament, Mr Cunha has done splendid work in drafting a whole array of reports on fisheries matters, for which we owe him a debt of gratitude.
When I read the report, I was glad to note that the Commission and Parliament are pursuing the same objectives by way of future fisheries agreements.
The Commission has always taken the view that the sustainability of fisheries needs to be ensured not only in Community waters, but also outside them.
This agreement, therefore, is intended to put a greater emphasis than in the past on the environment, but without neglecting economic and social objectives.
Deep-sea fishing is crucial to the economies of many coastal regions in the Community, and so support for it needs to continue.
The report calls on the Commission to draw up a sound financial chapter, and also to regard a financial contribution as both part of a trade agreement and as development aid.
With that I can wholeheartedly agree, but let me say, for the avoidance of misunderstandings, that the financial contribution is, on the one hand, to be paid in respect of the fisheries rights that are conceded and, on the other, is meant to help the third country to manage its stocks in a sustainable manner.
It is to be credited to the third countryâs budget.
The Commission will then give the country with which the agreement is concluded active support in the form of know-how, enabling it, for example, to make fisheries controls more efficient or to improve research into the condition of stocks.
I am convinced that new partnership agreements of this kind will be of great benefit both to the developing countries and to the Community.
Â Â  Mr President, it has been brought to my attention that Mr Hudghton raised a point of order earlier today in this Chamber under Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure.
He referred to a debate in the Scottish Parliament and a statement by a Conservative Member of that Parliament to the affect that it is incumbent on me, as Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, to represent the views of the UK Government.
Firstly, may I say that I cannot answer for statements made by members of other parliaments, whoever or wherever they may be.
Secondly, in view of the fact that the UK Government is a Labour government, and I am a Conservative, it would be rather strange, to say the least, if I felt obliged to represent their views either in my capacity as Chairman of the Fisheries Committee or indeed in any other role.
Mr Hudghton seems unusually exercised by my role as Fisheries Committee Chairman these days.
It is a great pity that he chooses to divert his energies into cheap, political point-scoring, rather than standing up for Scotland's beleaguered fishing industry.
However, he may rest assured that I conduct my role as Chairman of the Fisheries Committee in an even-handed and democratic manner.
Turning to the Cunha report, may I firstly place on record, as Mr Fischler and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna have done before me, the great appreciation of the members of the Fisheries Committee and indeed of most if not all of the Members of this House for the work undertaken by Mr Cunha during his term of office as an MEP representing Portugal.
He has now, of course, returned to Portugal to take up a very senior position and we all wish him well for the future.
I am sure that we will see more of him in the days to come.
The high quality of the work undertaken by Mr Cunha has indeed been reflected in this report on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries.
Many people are currently expressing anxiety over international fisheries agreements entered into between the EU and these third countries.
Documentary film-makers and indeed some international NGOs have beaten a path to countries like Senegal and Mauritania in West Africa, intent on exposing the ravages of greedy European fishermen.
Against a background of collapsing fish stocks in EU waters, due, allegedly, to massive over-fishing, these critics claim that Europe is now hell-bent on exporting its problems to these developing nations.
Other critics point the finger at the ubiquitous Spanish and French fleets, claiming that such third country agreements, although funded by the EU, are only of benefit to Spain and France.
It is time to set the record straight, and the Cunha report sets out to do this.
Firstly, we should explore why the EU finds it necessary to enter into such agreements for international fishing rights.
When Spain joined the EU it brought with it a distant water fleet of heavy trawlers, which had plied the world's oceans for centuries.
Having only a narrow continental shelf and with limited fisheries resources of their own, Basque and Galician fishermen were catching cod off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador five hundred years before Christopher Columbus 'discovered' America.
France has a similar tradition.
However, just as fast as EU fish stocks are collapsing, stocks of migrating fish are being savagely cut as a result of the new regulations that we are imposing through the common fisheries policy.
At the same time, consumer demand for fish in the EU is rising.
We are now only 60% self-sufficient in meeting this demand.
Consumers are turning away from red meats because of fears about BSE, foot-and-mouth and other scare stories, and are turning to fish as a healthy alternative.
To meet this surging demand, the EU has two alternatives.
Either it can import fish from outside the Community, increasing our balance of trade deficit and exporting valuable fishing jobs, or we can harness the expertise of the Community's distant water fleet which may well be largely Spanish and French, thus maintaining EU employment in the fisheries sector while, at the same time, ensuring that EU hygiene and food safety standards are maintained.
The choice is not difficult.
Nevertheless, while contracts entered into with third countries have seen EU trawlers from Spain, Portugal, France, Ireland and, to a lesser extent Greece and the UK, deployed around the globe from the Southern Oceans to the North Pole, there has been rising concern at the exploitative nature of some of these agreements.
In Mauritania, off the West Coast of Africa, it was claimed that Spanish trawlers were hoovering up thousands of tonnes of fish, depleting local stocks, driving native fishermen out of work and causing famine amongst the coastal communities.
That is why the EU had to develop a new system for drawing up these agreements.
In future, third country agreements must be a partnership between the EU and the contracting nation, embracing a continuous monitoring process to ensure that a sustainable fishery is maintained.
We want a significant proportion of the contract price to be devoted to buying fishing rights.
But, and this is equally as important, we also want a significant contribution to be devoted to conservation and development objectives, with monitoring and surveillance high on the list.
The EU has recognised its responsibility to the countries with whom we enter into these agreements, while at the same time maintaining its long tradition of distant water fishing to keep a steady supply of good, healthy fish on Europe's tables.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, if I may, I too will begin by stressing MrÂ Cunhaâs excellent qualities as a Member of this House and as a citizen of Europe.
I would also like to emphasise how much he will be missed in this Parliament, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in the Committee on Fisheries.
I might add that I wish him every success with his duties in his senior position in the government of a great Portuguese region, the North.
Even though I am a member of a different political party from MrÂ Cunha, furthermore, I do not have the problem of which the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr StruanÂ Stevenson, complained here.
Since he is not a member of the UKÂ Labour Party, MrÂ Stevenson distanced himself from UKÂ Government policy.
I do not have the same problem, but that is just a question of style: the British style on the one hand and, on the other, the Portuguese, Iberian style.
If I may, moreover, MrÂ President, I would like to begin by underlining how correct and balanced I believe MrÂ Cunhaâs report, as well as the Commission communication, to be.
I wish I could be as reserved as CommissionerÂ Fischler, who to all intents and purposes confined himself to expressing his agreement with the report, which he felt endorsed the content of the Commission communication.
That much is true.
There does not seem to be any major disagreement between us on this matter.
I would say that the European Union has developed a very interesting type of diplomacy in the field of fisheries.
As MrÂ Stevenson also said, that diplomacy has led to a very interesting and very original model for fisheries agreements, one which we might even consider exemplary and which could quite happily act as a model for distant water fisheries negotiations between other countries.
That diplomacy should continue to develop freely, I would argue, with a view to upholding the interests of the European Unionâs distant water fleet.
This fleet must not be considered as belonging to Portugal, or to Spain, or to France: rather, it should be understood to be a European Union fleet, since the Commission is our only spokesperson, our only representative in these international relationships.
MrÂ President, I support MrÂ Cunhaâs report, as well as the content of the Commissionâs text.
I hope that distant water fishing in the European Union will continue to develop along the three axes of the conservation of resources, support for the poorest communities and also equal treatment for those working in the fishing industry.
To conclude, I would say that we must combat illegal fishing and flags of convenience, which are, at times, the worst enemies of genuine fishing and fishermen.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking Mr Cunha for producing such a worthwhile report and by wishing him well in his new role.
Our debate takes place in a context where, first, some stocks in certain northern waters are in crisis and others are endangered.
Second, many more are being over-exploited on a global basis.
In addition, a report published last week by the International Food Policy Research Institute indicates that, if China is included, developing countries now account for more than 70% of the production of fish for food including both wild fisheries and aquaculture.
The consequences are that the EU is dependent on imports of fish and that many EU fishers pursue their activities in other waters.
The ELDR accepts, therefore, that there is merit in negotiating fisheries partnership agreements with third countries, rather than leaving matters to bilateral arrangements which may lack consistency both between each other and in supporting the requirements of sustainable development.
We do, however, have very strong views about the nature of any agreements made by the EU.
First, the agreements reached should be genuine partnership ones and of mutual benefit.
We believe that our amendment to paragraph 7 gives fuller expression to this idea than the original paragraph.
Second, the agreement should be both responsible and transparent in budgetary terms, so we have amendments calling for renewal of agreements to be dependent on evidence that past monies have been spent as intended.
We also call for an equitable - that is just to say a fair or just - sharing of payments by the EU vessel owners involved.
On paragraph 11, whilst it may be right to forecast an increase in the number of agreements reached, we cannot be certain of this and would prefer by oral amendment to replace the words 'the increase' with 'any increase'.
Third, the agreement should promote sustainability.
We are pleased with the extent to which the report makes reference to the principles involved and hope to see these built on where the details of any future agreement are concerned, notably by introducing specific provisions for protecting the environment.
I would urge the House to support both this report and their amendments to it.
As Mr Stevenson has already said, we must ensure that we do not try to solve our domestic problems by exporting them to developing countries.
Experience already tells us just how counterproductive such an approach would be.
Indeed, wherever we come from in the EU we have a very strong interest in ensuring the sustainability of fisheries not only in our own waters but beyond.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would like to add to the congratulations directed at MrÂ Cunha and to the praise for his work in the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
With regard to this report, I would like to say that international fisheries agreements are undoubtedly a highly important aspect of the common fisheries policy, since they ensure that fishing activity is maintained in many regions of the European Union, and provide direct employment for 30Â 000 people.
They help reduce the Community trade deficit in fish products and account for more than 20% of all Community catches.
For these reasons, we should give this report our full support.
Studies indicate that every euro invested in these fishing agreements generates economic activity to the value of threeÂ euros, meaning that the benefits clearly outweigh the costs.
It is important, therefore, to improve and enhance this area, even taking account of the conclusions of the Fisheries Council of OctoberÂ 1997, which has been mentioned here already.
This is even more important, moreover, given that there are those who would cast doubt on these agreements.
I would like to remind you, however, that the Commission should take account of certain important aspects of these agreements.
One of those central questions is that of appropriate funding.
While coherence is certainly needed between the common fisheries policy and development policy, it should not be forgotten that these agreements are essentially commercial in nature: though they should take the development angle into account, the funding for these fishing agreements should come from the fisheries sector, while funding for development policies should derive from elsewhere in the Community budget â from increased amounts for cooperation and development, to be more precise.
More partnership agreements should be developed, therefore, balancing the interests of the various countries and parts of the fleet concerned in an equitable way.
I would like to conclude by echoing the rapporteurâs statement that it beggars belief that different conditions should apply under agreements within the European Union: under certain agreements, the vessel owners pay fishing licence fees, while under others they pay nothing.
This problem, therefore, must be resolved urgently, as must the issue of paper quotas and the opportunity for unused fishing rights to be temporarily transferred.
I hope that our support for MrÂ Cunhaâs report will also convince the Commission to take equal note of the proposals he presents in the course of his work.
Â Â  Mr President, we have heard tonight about how the Commission has actually changed its position in relation to developing a new system of fisheries agreements.
It is all very well just changing the name of 'fisheries agreements' to 'partnership agreements', which sounds very good.
'Partnership' sounds like something that is fair and equitable, but, at the end of the day, what we need to see is that this is what actually happens.
At the moment we are only talking about discussion documents from the Commission and when I hear some of the other speakers talking about trade diplomacy, we have to be very careful that this is not about coercion.
When we talk about fisheries agreements, looking at Mr Cunha's report and comparing it with one we may have seen five or six years ago in this Parliament, it is better.
However, if you look at the underlying majority view of the Committee on Fisheries and, indeed, of this Parliament, it is that the purpose of agreements is to supply European consumers with fish and to keep European fishermen in work.
Any other consideration is secondary.
This is not acceptable.
We cannot talk about sustainability and development as two separate items.
As regards exporting our problem in relation to overcapacity within the European Union, this has been the tradition up until now: fisheries agreements have been used to export our excess capacity to other parts of the world.
When we talk about the countries that are benefiting, I know that when I first came to this Parliament, Ireland was not one of these countries.
It clearly is now.
Irrespective of what countries are benefiting from within the European Union, what we need to look at is how the developing countries are actually benefiting.
I do not see anything yet to prove that the European Union has not merely a sustainable approach to fisheries agreements, but also an approach that takes into account the concerns of the developing countries.
We have an agreement at the moment that there will be a separation in relation to payments.
This will distinguish the development aspect from the other aspects of the fisheries agreements.
But that is not enough.
We need to get proof from the Commission that this is what is going to happen, because it is completely unfair to talk about fair trade, an equitable approach to developing countries while at the same time using developing countries by exporting our capacity to those countries.
We have to take that into account.
Finally, we have to take into account what happened with Morocco.
Are our European taxpayers' monies going, in the future, to pay for the collapse of other fisheries agreements?
I am talking in particular of Mauritania.
This is something that needs to be taken into account.
Developing countries are not going to take for granted the situation that has been put to them with the only choice they have.
We have to live up to our responsibilities and cut down on our excess capacity.
Â Â  Mr President, I am amazed to hear Struan Stevenson use the argument that we have to have these deals to maintain the historical fishing piracy of Spain and France.
The world changed in 1976, as the empty ports of Hull and Grimsby can testify.
We would not even be having this debate if it were not for the total, abject failure of the CFP and the need for more and more waters.
And yet, as early as 1994, the warnings from Senegal were there for all to see, at least for those who wanted to.
These deals have caused havoc and destruction, both environmentally and socially, in some of the poorest parts of the world.
What is the response from the Commission?
It is the use of this wonderful word 'partnership', which, as yet, means nothing.
But the Commission's spin goes a bit further than that.
It says that if it were not the EU doing it, then it would be private enterprise, and there would be somebody out there who is 'worse than us'.
I have seen Kenya, where private enterprises have been causing problems, but in my view two wrongs do not make a right.
Perhaps the only good news is that a growing number of Members here are beginning to wake up to what these deals really mean and the opposition in this Parliament is now up to over 100.
In England, we regard the maritime blind eye that was turned by Nelson to be an act of bravery and honour.
But this is not the case with Commissioner Fischler, who continues to turn a blind eye.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the Cunha report rightly emphasises the enormous economic importance, for both the Member States of the Union and the partner States, of the twenty-one international fisheries agreements concluded by the Community.
Whereas the European Union faces a large shortfall in the increasing amount of fish it consumes and has to import almost half of that amount, the fisheries agreements alone provide one-fifth of total Community catches, worth around EURÂ oneÂ billion and constitutes a particularly significant source of employment both for European countries that have a tradition of distant fishing and for their overseas partners.
This production takes place under controlled, supervised and responsible conditions, giving European consumers solid guarantees of traceability and of fishing methods that are vastly superior to those provided by third-country imports.
These fisheries agreements, which serve a commercial purpose, are a good investment for the Union and those who wish to call into question the appropriateness of these agreements and halt their progress would do well to take a close look at the study produced by the Ifremer Institute, which proves that every euro we invest in this framework generates economic activity worth three times as much.
The economic balance-sheet is also broadly positive for the partner countries.
Investment must therefore be pursued, and even taken further, particularly in the framework our network of tuna agreements.
As rapporteur for the EU-Mauritius agreement, I have been able to assess the scale of the mutual economic interests involved in this key sector that those working in the field in Europe have developed with a number of ACP partners in the Indian Ocean and with Latin American partners.
These agreements are a source of supply and of processing activity for European countries and a source of jobs and development for partner countries, and must consequently be supported and extended.
When the Commission talks about the coherence that is needed between the various Community policies, it must ensure in particular coherence between the common fisheries policy and trade policy.
Hence a misjudged concession made at the WTO on tinned tuna imports in the context of a general removal of customs tariffs, could undermine years of effort and investment, destroy a mutually beneficial sector and lead to relocations that heavily penalise our partners first of all and then us.
I therefore wish to draw the Commissionâs attention, Mr President, to this issue, as our Assembly did when it adopted the amendment I tabled during the vote on my report on the agreement with Mauritius.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my best wishes to Mr Cunha; may they go home with him on his new political journey.
Let me follow that up with an old adage â not to say an old truth â to the effect that Europe has too few fish; the waters around the Member States cannot meet our demand for them.
That is a fact, and it is one with which we have to deal.
Let me take this opportunity to emphasise the fundamental point that we have not started by emptying European waters of fish, only to seek out new fishing grounds in which to do the same thing.
It is far more a case of traditional European fishing grounds having been lost as a result of the extension of the exclusive economic zones to 200 nautical miles, which happened as long ago as the 1970s.
It is in order to compensate for this loss that the EU has concluded fisheries agreements with third states.
Today, we have twenty-one of these agreements with countries in both the North and the South.
The contribution they make to Europeâs economy is an important one; it might even be described as irreplaceable.
We, for our part, get the fresh fish that we urgently need, whilst important jobs are safeguarded at home and abroad in the fishing and fish-processing industries.
With such a resource as fish, though, a resource that is finite and sensitive to adverse environmental factors, economic considerations must not obscure environmental ones or blind us to conditions in the third countries.
That is why I very much welcome the Commissionâs new joint approach.
I also believe that it needs to be brought to life, and it is more compatible with our objective of sustainable fisheries.
The agreement is nonetheless concerned with a commercial activity, that is to say, simply with fishing in foreign waters and with the economic yield derived from it.
I take the view that the amount of funding should reflect the real value of the fishing rights.
Fisheries policy should not be used to cloak the objectives of development policy.
That is what we have specific budget lines for, and that is why I am not the only one to take this line.
I would like to see fisheries agreements in the future too â modern and sustainable ones, founded on partnership â but the benefits and burdens must be shared out fairly among all parties.
Furthermore, we cannot look at these things from the perspective of using European money to provide permanent subsidies, if only a few Member States end up reaping the rewards.
Nor should we forget the decisive point that Parliament must be better informed in view of the large amounts expended from the European Budget.
Indeed, I take the view â and I am certainly not the only one to do so â that Parliament must have a part to play in negotiations, not tomorrow, but today.
This is where something, at last, needs to be done!
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, in his absence and wish him well in his new job.
Third-party fishing agreements have come under a lot of scrutiny recently, with headlines such as 'EU fishing fleets devastate Third World' and 'West African nations to ban EU fishing fleets'.
A recent WWF report highlighting the problems in Angola makes for interesting reading.
On the one hand, the EU is providing emergency aid to Angola but, on the other, has signed a fishing agreement which would take from Angolan waters vital fish stocks which go to some of the poorest people in the world.
According to UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme, which focused on Mauritania, Argentina and Senegal, all countries have noticed a depletion in their stocks after signing third-party fishing agreements.
In Mauritania, catches of octopus have halved in the past four years and in Senegal two thirds of the country's export earnings are reliant on fish exported to Europe.
Over half the fish we consume in the EU now comes from outside the EU and half of this is on the basis of third-party fishing agreements.
Of primary concern is the subsequent depletion of fish stocks, the dependence of local communities in developing countries on these stocks for their own food, the poor enforcement rules and catch limits and the apparent contradictions that seem to exist between the EU fisheries policy and EU development policy.
All these issues concern many MEPs.
The need for environmental impact to be taken into consideration with third-party fishing agreements is paramount.
I like the fact that the rapporteur has underlined the importance of sustainable fisheries and is highlighting this fact, which should apply to all vessels within the waters affected.
However, I regret that, for example, in Angola where 35% of the EUR 15.5 million paid is supposed to go towards small-scale fisheries projects, it is actually unclear if this money will go to this aim or not.
These concerns are very real and that is why I support the ELDR's Amendment No 2.
This amendment would make new fishing agreements dependent upon the presentation of satisfactory evidence that monies paid under the previous agreements for targeted measures have been spent as intended.
We should not be seen to be renewing agreements where the third party has not fulfilled their side of the bargain.
However, fishing agreements should not be signed if they would be detrimental to the long-term socio-economic interests of the country concerned.
Third-party fishing agreements play an important role in providing the EU with fish.
However, what are we going to do when their fish stocks run out?
We should not be destroying the viability of countries and crucial stocks for the future for short-term gain.
Third-party fishing agreements must take into account the future viability of stocks.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I would just like to start by warmly thanking all those who have spoken in this debate for their constructive contributions.
My concluding remarks can be relatively brief.
In particular, I would also like to express my gratitude for the great deal of support that our report has received.
The one thing that has to be clear is that we cannot apply double standards.
The principles that we in the Community apply to our own Community waters must also apply in agreements with third states.
That is particularly the case when a sensible and effective conservation policy is needed, but also when seeking to ensure that any decisions taken are based upon current best knowledge.
It is by these principles that we want to be guided in future.
What do we actually mean by a partnership agreement?
A partnership exists when, to coin a phrase, the parties to it can meet on the level, with neither dominating the other.
That is what we intend to ensure in future.
This is about cooperating not only when we want to fish in a third stateâs waters; it is, moreover, about us playing our part and working with these countries to enable them â provided that they have an interest in this â to build up their own fishing industries, not only as regards the catching of fish but also its processing.
This is an essential aspect of the development that we want to promote â as we indeed should.
All this, of course, can only work if these states are wholeheartedly interested and collaborate fully, but we are discovering in practice that such is increasingly the case, and so I can see our concluding of these agreements developing a very positive way.
I can only say that these principles must be put to the test in concrete negotiations, when Parliament, too, will have the opportunity to ascertain whether or not every one of these newly-concluded agreements comes up to scratch.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the Middle East.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you once again for giving me the opportunity of coming before a plenary sitting of the House.
I am here to address you on what is currently a highly topical issue, namely the MiddleÂ East.
I know this is an area of great concern to you all.
The MiddleÂ East is giving us cause for alarm once again.
Yesterday, the Committee on ForeignÂ Affairs, HumanÂ Rights, CommonÂ Security and DefenceÂ Policy adopted the report drawn up by MrÂ MenendezÂ delÂ Valle.
This sent out a further signal of Parliamentâs strong determination to be actively involved in the peace effort.
I am confident this report will be most helpful in the search for peace.
It has indeed already proved its worth.
I have held several discussions with MrÂ MenendezÂ delÂ Valle. We worked together to ensure the report contained the elements that could help to find a solution in line with the European approach.
The last few weeks amounted to a respite. They were characterised by tense calm.
Sadly, that calm proved all too fragile. It was shattered dramatically by the events of recent days.
We have received yet another reminder of the extent to which tension, violence, destruction and death are part of daily life in the region.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am bound to admit to you that I too am overcome by a feeling of frustration.
I am frustrated because the MiddleÂ East is still bleeding to death.
Life after life is still being lost needlessly.
I am frustrated also because the Israelis and Palestinians have been unable or unwilling to meet the solemn undertakings given at Aqaba a few short weeks ago.
I am frustrated because tension in the region has risen to alarming levels.
I am frustrated because fewer and fewer people now believe the solution lies in the RoadÂ Map sponsored by the Quartet.
Above all, I am frustrated because the despair that has overcome so many Arabs and Israelis might also take root amongst us.
It might overcome our political leaders and our citizens too.
It is imperative not to allow this frustration to cloud our vision.
On the contrary, the very gravity of the situation and our shared concern must spur us on to greater efforts.
They should motivate us to remain on the alert and assume all our duties and responsibilities.
Each and every one of us is wondering what further action can be taken.
We are asking ourselves if there is anything more the Union can do, and whether the RoadÂ Map retains any validity.
We are also concerned that the present situation might degenerate into a regional conflict.
All these concerns have been raised in public and no doubt in private too.
I should now like to take a few minutes to deal with each in turn.
I will begin with the RoadÂ Map.
I believe the concern expressed is justified.
It could certainly be argued that there is little point to a programme of actions to be taken on specific dates, if the parties required to act are disinclined to do so.
It is certainly true that without the commitment of all the parties, progress will be negligible.
I must also state quite clearly that whilst I recognise the tremendous difficulties confronting us, I do not believe there is any alternative to the RoadÂ Map.
The much longed-for and shared objective of ensuring that two states, Israel and Palestine, can live in peace and security must not be abandoned following the tragic events of recent days.
The RoadÂ Map sets an ambitious objective.
It is to be met in 2005 when both the aforementioned states should be in existence.
Still greater involvement by the international community is therefore called for, if that were possible.
Above all, the onus is on the Quartet to step up its efforts.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe sponsored the RoadÂ Map initiative.
Europe was also involved in devising and setting up the Quartet.
We proved capable of creating a new political platform to facilitate direct involvement by the UnitedÂ States within the framework of joint action.
The debate over who might be an honest brokerwas defused.
The members of the Quartet met in NewÂ York a few days ago.
I can assure you that despite recent gloomy prognostications, the Quartet is still active.
It remains the focal point for all peace efforts.
Members of the Quartet formally undertook to meet again before the end of this year.
An announcement to that effect was made at the end of the meeting.
As a result of pressure from Europe, it was also agreed that the special representatives should meet regularly. These individuals are resident in the area.
They are therefore in the best position to provide Members of the Quartet with an overview of the situation, so that the appropriate joint measures may be taken.
Closer cooperation of our efforts will also be fostered.
A mere declaration of the continuing validity of the RoadÂ Map will not suffice, ladies and gentlemen.
Specific actions are required if the current stalemate is to be transcended.
Each party would then be able to detect in the other a willingness to move forward.
Such measures need to be designed to build a minimum of confidence, and they must be verifiable.
During the drafting stages of the RoadÂ Map, past experience led us to insist on the need for a verification mechanism.
It is now urgent for the latter to be operational as soon as possible.
MrÂ AbuÂ Ala, the new PrimeÂ Minister of the PalestinianÂ Authority, is likely still to be working on the formation of a new Palestinian Government, probably in extremely trying conditions.
He might have succeeded by now.
I have known MrÂ Ala for several years and respect him.
MrÂ Ala has built up a wealth of experience in very difficult circumstances.
This new Palestinian Government must assume its responsibilities at the earliest opportunity.
I have spoken to MrÂ Ala by telephone almost every day.
There is absolutely no doubt that, as regards security, MrÂ Ala must begin by bringing order to the Palestinian security services.
He would be following the lead of MrÂ SalamÂ Fayad, the minister responsible for the financial sector.
MrÂ Fallad has done a good job in bringing order to the latter. Horrific terrorist attacks of the kind perpetrated all too often against the citizens of Israel with such devastating consequences simply cannot be tolerated.
The attack in Haifa on the eve of YomÂ Kippur is a further example of what must never again be allowed to happen.
The Palestinian Government needs to put an end to this scourge, in the interests of the Palestinians themselves.
Likewise, economic and social reform must continue, for the benefit of the people of Palestine.
Europe will offer MrÂ Ala and his government strong and active support for such efforts.
If the efforts of the new Palestinian Government are to bear fruit, however, it is vitally important for it to be able to count first and foremost on the support of the IsraeliÂ Government.
There are also a number of key obligations on the IsraeliÂ Government pursuant to the RoadÂ Map.
Israel is required to put an end to its policy on settlements.
It is also required to stop building the security wall. This wall encroaches into territory beyond the 1967 borders.
Further, Israel is called upon to put an end to its policy of targeted killings.
In addition, Israel is called upon to stop other practices we believe to be violations of international law.
Israelis and Palestinians need a chance to renew cooperation.
I cannot conclude without saying a few words on regional stability.
There should be no doubt as to the determination of the EuropeanÂ Union, its MemberÂ States, institutions and citizens to combat and condemn terrorism.
The IsraeliÂ Government is entitled to take measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
Indeed it is its duty to do so.
Nonetheless, if terrorism is to be dealt with effectively, it must be dealt with within the framework of international law.
That is the bottom line.
The MiddleÂ East is a very volatile part of the world.
Action by the parties involved must be such that it reduces rather than increases tension.
Our Arab friends are also called upon to maintain their commitment to the peace effort.
They should also reactivate the initiative launched by SaudiÂ Arabia and formalised at the BeirutÂ ArabÂ LeagueÂ Summit in March of last year.
That initiative remains valid and enjoys the full support of the Quartet.
Clearly, the next few weeks will be decisive.
It is essential for all members of the Quartet to remain committed to the process in the days to come.
This applies in particular to the UnitedÂ States.
The road to peace will be long and difficult.
That has already become apparent.
We know what the objective is and are aware of the difficulties to be encountered on the way.
The EuropeanÂ Union must continue to take strong and decisive action in the MiddleÂ East.
Its actions also need to be creative and consistent.
As I said earlier, the next few days and weeks will be crucial.
Peace will have another chance, if PrimeÂ MinisterÂ Alaâs government gets to work and discharges its responsibilities regarding security, and if the IsraeliÂ Government is able to demonstrate restraint and generosity so as to reduce tension.
It is important not to play into the hands of the terrorists.
For our part, ladies and gentlemen, we shall do all in our power to move the process on as you and all men and women of good will would wish.
We remain in touch with all the parties on a daily basis.
It is to be hoped that the present vicious circle can be broken.
The EuropeanÂ Unionâs personal representative is in the region every day.
We are doing all we can to prevent violence increasing and spiralling out of control.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we all realise the difficulty of the task before us.
Nonetheless, it is essential for us to continue to work day and night to prevent the situation worsening until there can be no possible solution.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, has just explained, the political situation in the Middle East has reached a very low point.
Apart from the difficulty in implementing the Roadmap so as to find a way out of the dreadful situation in which the Middle East has been plunged for some time now, new threats are looming on the horizon.
Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, however, we must look to the future, find out why we have failed and take remedial action.
If we accept that the two-state solution still has the widest support, despite the building of the wall, despite the settlement problem and despite the attacks by Hamas, then the Roadmap needs to be put back on track.
Perhaps the gradual approach that has been chosen, whereby the toughest issues are left until last, should be rethought.
Solving the difficult problems first â like refugees and territorial division â may help to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of peace.
Best practice acquired throughout the world may shed some light on how to approach the non-negotiable issues.
As Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle has observed in his draft report, any peace plan depends on the honest commitment of both sides â and, I would add, of the international community â to implement it.
It is this commitment that currently seems to be lacking: we therefore have to re-establish the political will to make the two-state solution work.
On the Israeli side, polls show that the majority of the population favour the two-state solution, although, according to many observers, a large part of the current Israeli Government will not accept the creation of a genuine Palestinian state on the West Bank.
This rejection of the two-state solution and the failure to implement the Roadmap seem to be based on ideological reasons or on security fears.
Building the wall, the security barrier, which runs deep inside the West Bank, is a consequence of both schools of thought, but it does not solve the concerns that lie at the root of either one.
Both Palestinians and Israelis will, in fact, be left on both sides of the dividing line, many Palestinians will be subjected to great humanitarian suffering and some of the settlements will be left on the other side of the wall.
The European Union has always recognised Israelâs right to defend itself, but security does not consist solely of preventing terrorists from carrying out their abhorrent attacks; first and foremost, it is a matter of winning the peopleâs hearts and minds.
Building a wall may be an acceptable measure, provided it is kept within Israeli territory.
Israel now has to adopt a sufficient number of measures to strengthen trust.
All extrajudicial executions and all punitive demolition of homes must stop.
All outlying settlements on Palestinian land built since September 2000 must be pulled down, and all activities carried on in them must stop, since they are obstacles to the two-state solution.
On the Palestinian side, the government seems to believe in the two-state solution, which means accepting the creation of a Palestinian state on the 1967 land; among the people and opposition groups, however, rejection of this solution is gaining ground.
Hamas and others do not recognise Israelâs right to exist, as shown by the terrible suicide attacks and other terrorist acts.
In addition, there seems to be a growing lack of any ability, power or willingness to set up efficient institutions, especially in the security field.
The new government under Prime Minister Abu Ala must take effective control of the Palestinian territories, undertake clear action against those who organise and commit violent attacks on the Israeli population, and publicly reaffirm Israelâs right to exist.
It is equally important to make resolute progress on preparing for the elections, drafting the constitution and involving civil society in the reforms.
It is understandable that the international community should be focusing its attention on the security issue, but we must not forget the need to strengthen institutions and undertake reforms.
This is an important aspect, and we should not lose sight of it.
Having institutions that work well is the basis for long-term stability and security for both Palestine and Israel.
The international community should be more decisive in setting targets against which the results achieved by both parties can be measured, in effectively monitoring all areas and not just that of security, and in offering rapid, effective support from donors.
Is there any hope?
Both Israelis and Palestinians have to be persuaded that they have something to gain by moving on from todayâs terrible situation.
Both sides have signed up to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to a guarantee of secure borders for the state of Israel, not to mention full acceptance of Israel by all countries in the region.
The international community must now do everything it can to persuade, coax and put pressure on both sides to honour the commitments they have made.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we face a very tragic situation in the Middle East.
We all thought that after the Iraq War, more intensive efforts would be made to find a solution to this apparently unending Middle East conflict.
Unfortunately, this hope has not become reality.
We appear to be in a situation of hopelessness, and the spiral of violence is continuing to escalate.
On behalf of our group, I would like to state very clearly that every suicide bombing is a crime against the young people who carry it out and a crime against the Israelis whom they take with them into death.
This must be made very clear.
We also say, however, that the âselective murderâ response, as Mr Solana has said â the policy of âan eye for an eye, a tooth for a toothâ â does not help to make peace possible.
I would like to thank Commissioner Monti for what he said about the wall, for his great ability â we know he has other abilities as well â but I would particularly like to thank him for saying what he did, and for the way he said it.
I would like to thank him very warmly for that.
If you would permit me to make a personal remark, I can trace my political commitment back to when, at the start of 1962, I saw a wall in my own country.
That is something that profoundly affects peopleâs hearts and spirits.
I am profoundly convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that the construction of this wall is a very great tragedy.
It is a tragedy for Israel too, because it will simply lead to more hatred and revulsion.
It is not a measure that will genuinely promote peace, and in my view, the wall will not increase Israelâs security either.
It must also be said that the illegal settlements are an ongoing factor preventing a peaceful solution.
Let me say, not only on my own behalf, but also on behalf of my parliamentary group, that if a wall is constructed which leads to more hatred and more humiliation, this is a further argument, to my mind, for having an international peacekeeping force to keep the two hostile parties apart.
I hope that a debate will begin, for once, about whether an international peacekeeping force âŠ
âŠ involving Europeans would be a way forward.
From our point of view, it is clear that the aim must be for Israel to exist in secure borders.
The aim must also be a Palestinian state in secure borders.
We call on the key actors â Prime Minister Sharon, President Arafat, and the new Prime Minister Abu Ala â to give peace a chance and to overcome what are perhaps personal dislikes.
Dialogue is essential, and Mr Solana, I would like to thank you particularly for what you are doing.
I believe you really are doing what you have described, and that you are working day and night and talking to the key actors.
Now, of course, the development must continue.
As desperate as the situation may appear, human and political life is never entirely hopeless, for if it were, we would have to give up our efforts altogether.
For this reason, a further effort is required from the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia to ensure that the actors on both sides start talking to each other again.
Perhaps we have an even greater responsibility than our American friends.
After all, we always demand a great deal from the Americans.
We criticise them when they do something and we criticise them when they do not.
As Europeans, we should now, for once, take the initiative, especially since our American friends have other concerns with the start of the presidential election campaign â and we know how important are the groups in America whose support a candidate needs in order to be elected.
We Europeans should therefore launch a genuine initiative here.
Let me conclude by saying something that especially concerns the issue of human dignity.
There are no second-class people.
Everyone is equal, and everyone is equal in human dignity.
This applies to the Europeans, it applies to the Americans, it applies to the Palestinians, it applies to the Israelis, and it applies to the Chechens and to everyone in the world.
In the European Union, we are currently in the process of adopting a constitution, and this constitution is a process underpinned by values.
I think we would do well to make people the focal point, and that is why we must adopt initiatives at this time to ensure that the dignity of the Palestinians is respected and the dignity of the Israelis is respected and that both nations have the chance to move into the future together in peace, in a democratic system.
We should play a strong and pro-active role in this context.
I would like to thank Mr Solana very warmly for all that he has contributed to date, and I hope that we will be more successful in future than we have been so far.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have just heard the sad news of the murder of MrÂ JoseÂ AntonioÂ BernalÂ Gomez, PressÂ AttachÃ© at the SpanishÂ Embassy in Baghdad.
I trust you will convey the deepest condolences of the House to the GovernmentÂ ofÂ Spain.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would also like to express our condemnation of the Haifa attack.
This attack took place at a particularly sensitive time for Israel, coming as it did on the eve of YomÂ Kippur, the DayÂ ofÂ Atonement.
We express our condolences to all those Israeli and Palestinian families suffering as a result of this escalation of violence.
This has come about despite the resumption of dialogue on 30Â April, which represented a glimmer of hope and a window of opportunity.
We endorse the content of the Menendez del Valle report.
It is worth highlighting that, although there are differences of opinion and divisions amongst us Europeans on a number of matters, the MiddleÂ East is one issue on which we are broadly in agreement.
This consensus between all the MemberÂ States of the EuropeanÂ Union dates back to the 1980Â VeniceÂ Declaration.
The broad support for these proposals in the House is also worth noting.
Further to the statements made by MrÂ Solana and CommissionerÂ Monti, I believe there is also clear agreement that we must maintain our political, diplomatic and economic effort.
MrÂ President, the issue is not whether the RoadÂ Map is valid or not.
The issue is that we must go down the road to peace, however difficult and dangerous it proves.
After all, the RoadÂ Map is simply a way or a means of achieving peace.
In this connection, we believe we should make it clear to our Israeli friends that terrorism has to be dealt with within the framework of international law.
The attack on Syria in the wake of the terrorist incident is unacceptable under international law.
It violates the territorial integrity of a third country and contributes to a dangerous escalation of tension in a part of the world that could most certainly do without it.
I also believe we should make it clear to the IsraeliÂ Government and to MrÂ Sharon that the solution to the conflict does not lie in implementing the law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
It does not lie either in calls for the murder or removal of the elected representative of the Palestinian people.
I recently attended the celebrations at TelÂ AvivÂ University in honour of ShimonÂ Peresâs eightieth birthday.
Bearing in mind statements made by MrÂ Peres, statements by other prominent Israeli leaders and statements by MrÂ Arafat and by the PalestinianÂ Authority, it appears a number of concessions have been made.
I refer firstly to the recognition of the right of the StateÂ ofÂ Israel to exist.
This is recognition granted not only by us but also by the PalestinianÂ Authority.
Secondly, it has been recognised that peace can only be achieved through negotiation.
Thirdly, it has been recognised that negotiations must be based on the 1967 borders.
All this is to the credit of the PalestinianÂ Authority.
MrÂ AbuÂ Abas represents this approach.
He addressed the House when MrsÂ Fontaine was President, and was one of the negotiators of the OsloÂ Agreements.
I would like to add also that the PalestinianÂ NationalÂ Authority could become a role model in democracy for the whole of the Arab world.
I have in mind the activities it is currently engaged in and indeed the possibility of fresh elections, if the latter are permitted.
In short, a hard intransigent approach leads to strengthening fanatic, anti-democratic and aggressive attitudes.
I shall now turn to the matter of the building of the security fence.
MrÂ Poettering spoke eloquently on the basis of his personal experience.
I should point out too that from the GreatÂ WallÂ ofÂ China to the BerlinÂ Wall, all such walls have proved utterly useless.
We should appeal to the good sense of the Jewish people. They owe their very survival to the absence of walls.
We must appeal to them to come to their senses and stop building a fence that does not even respect the 1967 borders.
This fence will also make it impossible to achieve what we in the EuropeanÂ Union have succeeded in doing, namely establishing a network of inter-connected interests.
Links of this kind are just what the MiddleÂ East needs.
They would result in fewer arms, greater opportunities for cooperation and economic development and greater opportunities for coming closer together.
Finally, I would like to support the action taken by MrÂ Solana and also by our Representative in the MiddleÂ East.
I believe the Quartet must continue its work.
The possibility of establishing an international mandate involving the deployment of an international force on the ground should be considered too.
This would be a peace-keeping buffer force supporting the efforts to be made by both parties.
In conclusion, MrÂ President, the RoadÂ Map cannot be allowed to fail.
Fanaticism, terrorism and intransigence cannot be allowed to ride roughshod over common sense and a just and dignified peace.
I wish you well, gentlemen.
You can count on our support.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I listened carefully to the statement by MrÂ Solana.
Clearly, the MiddleÂ East is an area of major concern for us.
Only this morning I was reading the , a Zurich daily with a fine reputation the world over.
It contained an article calling for speedier distribution of funds to victims of the Holocaust.
You may well wonder how these two issues are linked.
They are linked because they both relate to an event that took place in Europe, and that event gave rise to the conflict in the MiddleÂ East we are debating today.
In the same newspaper I read that the UnitedÂ StatesÂ Congress is preparing to impose sanctions on Syria.
Sanctions will certainly not help to improve the situation.
That is not the way to put an end to conflicts.
Two days ago, MrÂ NaserÂ Yusuf, the nominee for MinisterÂ ofÂ InternalÂ Affairs in MrÂ AbuÂ Alaâs new government, refused to swear allegiance to YasserÂ Arafat.
MrÂ ArielÂ Sharon acted in the same vein recently too.
He declared he was ready to attack enemy targets wherever they might be.
This is a threat. It imperils the very stability of the area as described by MrÂ Solana.
Such a threat to the stability of the region will inevitably result in counter threats.
In yesterdayâs Syria was reported as stating that it is of course prepared to defend itself against any aggression.
Clearly, the situation is particularly difficult and extremely complex.
The EuropeanÂ Parliament is preparing its position on the basis of the report drawn up by MrÂ MenendezÂ delÂ Valle.
I should like to focus on the first part of the report. In it, the RoadÂ Map is presented as the only possible solution to the current conflict.
In this part of the report too, particular emphasis is placed on education for peace. Careful consideration should be given to the latter.
There is some doubt as to whether education for peace really does exist amongst the Palestinian and Israeli people, or whether what actually exists is education for hatred.
There is nothing to be gained from the latter.
I believe this matter deserves attention.
Discussion of what should happen following implementation of the RoadÂ Map and the ensuing peace conference is best left until the time comes.
I believe it is too early to discuss issues such as Jerusalem, Israelâs withdrawal to the 1967 borders and refugees.
There are other more urgent matters to deal with just now.
In this connection, I should like to say a few words about the security fence.
The sections built beyond the 1967 borders amount to an act of aggression.
The sections on the borders may prove to be a mistake. Nonetheless, if it is instrumental in preventing the death of even a single victim, the fence will not have been built in vain.
In conclusion, I should like to refer to an article by MrÂ SamuelÂ Hadas. He was the first Ambassador of the StateÂ ofÂ Israel to the KingdomÂ ofÂ Spain and also to the VaticanÂ CityÂ State.
In his article, MrÂ Hadas maintains that the Quartetâs RoadÂ Map for the MiddleÂ East is the only way forward.
He also states, however, that currently the way forward seems to lead into a maze from which there appears to be no way out.
MrÂ Hadas concludes by stating that there will be no magic solutions.
In his view the UnitedÂ States is the only power able to assist, or in other words, to pressurise the parties to get the peace process back on track.
As an aside, I must say that in my opinion it is actually for the Quartet to apply pressure to the parties.
MrÂ Hadas further states that until the UnitedÂ States and the international community understand that in the present circumstances Israelis and Palestinians are not in a position to get the peace process back on track themselves, both parties will continue to teeter on the brink of the abyss.
I am convinced that the onus is on the international community and especially on the Quartet.
I believe Parliament must support the Quartet and the EuropeanÂ Union as they contribute to the MiddleÂ East peace process.
Â Â  â Actually, Mr President, I would rather not have spoken this morning; I would rather have kept silent, just like the Israeli women in black who have been silently saying âStop the Israeli occupationâ ever since 1988.
I have too much love and respect, however, for my groupâs chairman, Mr Wurtz, who has asked me to speak, and for my colleagues, but, most of all, a symbolic gesture might not work here and so I will have to use words.
I must say, Mr Solana, that I feel frustrated, embittered and, above all, highly indignant.
Indignation is a political concept, not a state of mind, and I am indignant because, every day, I feel caught up in a spiderâs web in which the law, justice, freedom and the truth suffocate and die every day: they perish in the Dance of Death performed by the Sharon government, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
On the one hand â and it is not trite or futile to repeat this â there is an army that is militarily occupying a country; on the other, there is international law, which is constantly being flouted and which we now repeat like a litany.
International law should be obeyed, but not a single resolution is being obeyed.
I have no hesitation in considering Hamas and Jihad to be enemies, even though, as I am non-violent, I have eliminated the concept of enemy.
It is clearly criminal to send young people to kill themselves and others; those who do so are responsible for these deaths and I consider it a crime, but please let us also break out of this inertia, this diplomacy that causes more deaths every day and contributes to this crime.
I feel responsible, together with you, all of you, for what is happening in that country, because it is not enough just to call for compliance with international law.
Of course, it is a good thing to go there, and I, too, thank Mr Solana and I thank Mr Moratinos very much, although I have to say that, at the time of the Quartet, Marc Otte was, in fact, absent because of Ariel Sharonâs blackmail at the most sensitive moment when they were resuming talks on the Roadmap.
We were not there at that moment, because we rightly recognised that Ariel Sharon had been legitimately elected.
Yasser Arafat, too, was legitimately elected, and he cannot be accused of representing everything that is evil.
He is not my leader â I am an autonomous, free-minded independent â but it must be admitted that Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years, and that is no minor matter.
Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years and he certainly cannot be in military control of the Jenin area, where there are Israeli tanks, bulldozers and soldiers.
He cannot.
He can do what the government under Abu Mazen and now Abu Ala has been trying to do: to come to a political agreement with all the forces, including Hamas and Jihad, the moderate wing, let us say the wing that accepts peace or accepts a total cease-fire.
Every time, however â it is not just a trivial thing to say: it really is true, and that is how it is â every time, some leaders get killed.
This is of no small importance, and I am very grateful to Mr Poettering and I would not like him to feel embarrassed because the left likes him so much today or because I usually respond to problems in a cross-party way.
I thought Mr Poetteringâs speech was marvellous, to the point and perfect, even on the subject of the wall.
Commissioner Monti, I think you should go and see the wall.
As Mr Poettering said, the wall separates, destroys and kills freedom and the chance to communicate.
That is not the state that people want to create for Palestinians and Israelis: we want a state in which Palestinians and Moslems communicate together.
That wall is an obscenity, it is clear to everyone, I have seen it, I went to see it last Saturday.
In Adudis, it cuts the whole village in half.
An article in the Israeli newspaper, , by Gideon Levi, who is an amazing journalist, tells of how, in order to cross the road, children have to squeeze through the gaps in the concrete: their thin bodies get through but their schoolbags do not and they throw them over to the other side.
It is an obscenity that must be stopped.
Now, I am convinced that there are many things that can be done; I am also convinced that Parliament must take itself more seriously when it drafts and adopts resolutions.
I am tired of writing resolutions and building bridges: the resolutions need to be enforced.
We have been saying since time immemorial that we need to set up an arms embargo and that we need to verify the applicability of the association agreement; most importantly, we have decided on a high-level delegation (I have nearly finished) from Parliament.
I believe we should do this; we should keep following the Roadmap, and there is a hope âŠ I am sorry, Mr Cox; I am sorry, everyone; I have not written out my speech and so I have lost track of time, but I should like to say one more thing.
There is a great hope in Palestine and in Israel: it is those thousands of Palestinians who endure every day and who do not agree with the bombs and the attacks, and those hundreds and thousands of Israelis who are fantastic, like the two pilots last week who were ordered to bomb Nablus and refused.
They were over Nablus; the young men felt for the people and turned back; obviously they were suspended from duty.
This is extremely important: it shows that a sense of humanity is growing, and we must make it grow within ourselves, in others and among Palestinians and Israelis.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe all of us are united on this issue, as demonstrated by the speeches of MrÂ Poettering, MrÂ BarÃ³nÂ Crespo, and all of those who have spoken, up to and including MrsÂ Morgantini.
That would be my first point.
Secondly, listening to MrÂ Solanaâs speech brought on feelings of despair, weariness, anger and a sense of powerlessness.
If I may continue in the same vein as MrÂ Poettering, I believe that we in this Parliament should have the moral strength to question the assumption underlying the route map, which, as MrÂ Solana said, reflects the idea of gradual progress towards peace.
That was the idea at Oslo and the idea that has been nurtured up to now. I do not believe, however, that this gradual approach is working any more.
Is there any political alternative we can propose to this gradual approach?
Ami Ayalon and Sari Nusseibeh, respectively the former head of Israelâs security services and president of a Palestinian university, argued that we must state where we want to go, and create a political shock on that basis. If we were to take up their idea, what could the European Union propose by way of a political shock?
Here is my suggestion.
The European Union, by which I mean all the European states with a voice on the Security Council, shall propose a solemn vote in the UNÂ General Assembly on the Palestinian state, modelled on the idea of creating the Israeli state.
The motion shall be that the Palestinian state shall receive the same rights and responsibilities as the Israeli state.
After this motion has been approved, the European Union shall propose, through its representatives on the Security Council, that a UNÂ military force be sent to keep the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian states.
Firstly, the Security Council shall accept the European proposal for the immediate disarmament of all military forces in Palestine other than those of the Palestinian state.
Secondly, the map of that state shall be redrawn along its 1967Â borders. The Security Council shall then give both the Israeli state and the Palestinian state two, three or four months to disarm and to withdraw from Palestinian territory all colonists living outside Israelâs 1967Â borders.
Thirdly, the Security Council shall decide that any alterations to those borders should be negotiated and accepted by both sides. After a given deadline, the international community shall take responsibility for compelling any colonists who are not on the right side of the border to leave and for disarming any Palestinian terrorist groups who have not been disarmed by the Palestinian National Authority.
Finally, the UN shall decide that Palestinian refugees shall be permitted to return only to Palestine, and Israeli â by which I mean Jewish â refugees only to Israel.
What I am proposing, then, is that we administer a real political shock. If we do not do so, we will always remain in the same impasse, endowed with extraordinary moral strength, but powerless.
Once and for all, we must seize an initiative which will have very harsh political and military consequences for us, but which is our only chance of helping the Palestinians and Israelis.
Â Â  â Mr President, who will take the risk of defying, let alone attempting to dismantle, the Palestinian terrorist organisations Hamas and Islamic Jihad?
Ahmed Quraya, the new prime minister in the Palestinian emergency cabinet that was sworn in on Tuesday, has himself said that he will not in any case.
How, Mr Solana, do you respond to that, or is the Council remaining silent about its explicit demand that the Palestinian Authority should dismantle terrorist organisations within the areas under its control?
Who, too, will dare to give a real warning to the other countries that are stirring up conflict between Palestine and Israel, headed by Syria and Iran?
Instead of supporting Israel in this, prominent EU Member States are falling headlong upon the Jewish state.
Not to mention European expressions of support to Syria, which, let it be noted, whilst being a member of the UN Security Council, has for years functioned as a training camp and base for Lebanese and Palestinian terrorist networks!
Is the European Union really going to enter into an association agreement with Syria, as Commissioner Patten very recently proposed in this House?
Do you share my view that Brussels is thereby sending a completely wrong political signal to such a violent region as this one?
Think of Haifa!
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cohn-Benditâs Roadmap could be quite attractive if people in this Parliament did not take such one-sided views.
Very often, especially on the Israeli-Palestinian question, people see the problems on one side but often forget about those on the other.
They forget, for instance, that the Palestinian constitution denies the existence of Israel; they forget that Palestinian school books teach that Israel does not exist and that its people do not exist and never have existed; they forget that, in 1999 or 2000, the Camp David initiative failed because of Yasser Arafatâs clumsiness at negotiating and accepting a compromise that might, perhaps, have resulted in a very different situation from the one we have today; they also forget everything about which we are quite rightly indignant, because we demand a lot from Israel, a democratic people, and we are also entitled to demand a lot from peoples that are not democratic but, we hope, will become so.
Clearly, however, we can only conclude that what is happening is a response to attacks that society would normally be unable to tolerate but which have, however, become the daily bread of Israeli society.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is failing in its duty; it is unable to do its job despite the efforts of our High Representative, despite the efforts made in the Quartet.
There is no doubt that Europe is stepping back, and, very often, this can be positive in hindsight, as has been the case over the last six months, when the Roadmap has not, I think, been altogether unanimously accepted by many European governments, which may have wanted to split the front so as not to accept the US line.
Therefore, I believe that, if all this is true, we Europeans should also examine our consciences.
If our outlook were more balanced, more pragmatic and more objective, we would not be seen by one of the sides involved as being of little consequence in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I should like to endorse the request made to the President by a previous speaker.
It would be appropriate for condolences to be sent to the victims in Haifa.
I would also ask for our condolences to be sent to the family of JoseÂ ManuelÂ BernalÂ Gomez, the Spanish official accredited in Baghdad.
All terrorism is reprehensible, regardless of its origin.
This week the Committee on ForeignÂ Affairs, HumanÂ Rights, CommonÂ Security and DefenceÂ Policy adopted the report on the MiddleÂ East drawn up by MrÂ MenendezÂ delÂ Valle.
I should like to say here and now, in advance of the vote at the next part-session, how much I welcome the effort made by all the political groups to agree on compromise amendments.
If these are not changed in plenary, they will enable the text to be adopted with a substantial majority.
I am not sure how much bearing the document will have on the situation, though I am sure it will be less than we hope for.
Nonetheless, I am quite sure European Parliament resolutions that do not enjoy the support of a substantial majority are meaningless.
Be that as it may, I would like to point out that the willingness of all the parliamentary groups to reach an agreement underlines the critical nature of the situation.
Everyone has lost out during the three years of the Intifada.
The only winners have been the extremists and they have taken the debate onto their own violent ground.
We certainly all agree that the quality of life of both Palestinians and Israelis is now worse than it was three years ago.
Regardless of the method of comparison used, it is clear that both groups have lost out as regards social welfare, freedom and security.
As I see it, it is simplistic and therefore useless to attempt to apportion blame to individuals on one or other side.
I believe all those involved share the blame for the present situation.
I agree with MrsÂ Morgantini on this.
Obviously, we each have different views and sensitivities regarding the conflict.
I am sure, however, that we all agree on our dislike of walls such as the so-called security wall.
Undoubtedly, the IsraeliÂ Government does have a duty to defend its citizens against terrorism, but this is not the best way to do so.
I believe we are all of one mind as regards condemnation of targeted killings.
We are all alarmed too at the danger of the conflict spreading to neighbouring countries.
Further, I believe we all agree that we would like to see in place a PrimeÂ Minister of the PalestinianÂ Authority who would be willing and able to act against terrorist organisations and put an end to them.
Control of the security forces is required, obviously.
MrÂ AbuÂ Mazen was unsuccessful in this regard.
We are as yet unsure how the government being formed by MrÂ AbuÂ Ala will fare.
His track record has earned him the support of the House.
I would ask honourableÂ Members to take a moment to reflect on how they might be feeling if during the last three years terrorist attacks had become almost weekly events in their countries, and if these attacks had caused nearly 500 civilian victims.
I therefore believe we must continue to back the Quartet.
There is currently no alternative to the RoadÂ Map, and the EuropeanÂ Unionâs foreign policy needs to be supported.
We must believe in ourselves.
We would all prefer the Unionâs foreign policy to have more resources at its disposal and enjoy greater visibility.
We would also like it to be able to call on a joint diplomatic service.
Nonetheless, the Unionâs foreign policy does sometimes have more influence than we might think. This is particularly so in the case of the MiddleÂ East.
Â Â  â Â Mr President, MrÂ Solana was kind enough to say he had devoted a good deal of time to my report.
I should first like to thank him for doing so.
I should also like to thank CommissionerÂ Monti for his kind words.
I broadly endorse MrÂ Poetteringâs remarks also.
They provide an indication of the degree of consensus reached.
The title of the report I have been privileged to draft refers to peace and dignity in the MiddleÂ East.
I chose these two words deliberately, because I think they provide a clear indication of how things stand and what we need to aim at.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights Common Security and Defence Policy adopted this report by a broad majority.
I am therefore now in a position to have the pleasure of speaking on this text on behalf of the committee, not just as a socialist.
It is worth mentioning that the report does enshrine a broad consensus on a number of key issues. This consensus was referred to earlier in the House.
Given the short time at my disposal, I shall only refer to a few of the relevant issues.
For instance, we all hope the RoadÂ Map will remain in force.
We are all united in calling on both parties to keep it alive.
We are of course united too in our condemnation of terrorism.
Nonetheless, we are adamant that the peace process must not be blocked or put in abeyance because of terrorism.
The terrorists would actually see this as a success.
We call on the Quartet and on the parties concerned to declare the city of Jerusalem a cultural and religious heritage of mankind.
We also call for Jerusalem to become a dual capital, at once the capital of the StateÂ ofÂ Israel and of the future PalestinianÂ State.
We hope this will come about at the earliest opportunity.
Further, we call for an international presence in the area.
We believe that an international force should be dispatched there when the time is right and subject to the consent of both parties.
We do of course believe that the StateÂ ofÂ Israel has the right to defend its citizens and its security.
This right must, however, be tempered by the rule of law.
The rights of Palestinian citizens must also be taken into account.
On the one hand, we invite the Palestinian side to reorganise its security forces and make tangible visible efforts to dismantle terrorist organisations.
On the other, we call on the Israeli side to withdraw its army from the autonomous territories.
We also call on Israel to put an end to targeted killings, and freeze all settlement activity and the building of the security wall. Many pertinent comments on the latter have been made in the House already.
Lastly, I should like to refer to an amendment supported by the rapporteur.
This is an amendment designed to deal with a hypothetical situation in which the RoadÂ Map was blocked.
Of course, we hope this will not happen, as it would have drastic consequences and lead to still greater suffering for Israelis and Palestinians.
Nonetheless, alternatives need to be in place, notably the establishment of an international mandate in Palestine under the authority of the Quartet. This would include an international force on the ground.
MrÂ President, I should like to conclude on a strictly personal note.
The acts of war perpetrated by Israel against Syria last Sunday are a violation of international law and fly in the face of political reason.
It is my earnest desire that they do not lead to something even worse.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too should like to thank the High Representative for his statement.
It is with much regret that we have to observe that the large amount of sympathy always enjoyed by Israel in Europe has sustained significant damage over the last year.
That is something that can be inferred from todayâs debate in this House, and it can be observed by keeping an eye on the European media and by listening to the announcements by the European governments, parliaments and political parties, including too the very clear European rejection of the decision by Israelâs Security Cabinet to remove Yasser Arafat from the Palestinian territories.
In the same way, we must condemn the Israeli attack on Syria, an action that contravenes international law.
Nor does the fact that the United States is now considering sanctions against Syria contribute to a solution to the Middle East conflict.
The latest trend is, naturally enough, reflected here in the European Parliament and thus in the report that we have just heard discussed and that has been adopted by a large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
This contains probably the toughest criticism of Israel we have seen here in Parliament.
The Israeli Government must withdraw its military forces from the occupied territories and bring them home.
It must put a stop to the executions, and it must suspend all activities surrounding the settlements and the construction of the shameful so-called Security Wall.
I should like to thank Mr Poettering for his very clear remarks about that wall.
The Palestinian authorities must secure clear and firm support for the new governmentâs efforts to reorganise the security forces.
They must restore public order.
They must clearly demonstrate that they are taking practical and visible steps to combat the terrorist movements, they must implement the reforms already proposed and they must organise, where possible, free, fair and open elections.
We no doubt all share the High Representativeâs frustrations, but we must keep to the Quartetâs road map for peace in the Middle East.
We must reach a definitive peace agreement between two equal, democratic and sovereign states that live peacefully together behind secure and recognised borders on the basis of UN Resolution 242 of 22 November 1967.
Israel and Palestine cannot resolve the conflict without help from outside, and the international community must continue to put pressure on both parties.
It may also be necessary to send an international intervention and observation force to the region, a force that the Quartet must assemble, that, under the auspices of the UN, would monitor developments and that, subsequently, could guarantee that the final peace agreement was being observed by the parties.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the wall being built by the Israeli Government will reduce the already tiny West Bank territories by 58%.
This is indeed an abomination in economic and human terms, but it is also a real provocation in political terms.
It brands all the inhabitants of Palestine as terrorists, which is scandalous.
The wall will not protect Israeli society from the violence and barbarism of suicide bombings against civilians.
The building of this wall makes the destruction of the Palestinian state possible, security for either of the two peoples unlikely, and also dashes any hope of peace in the Middle East.
By attempting to use the attack on Syria to exact revenge for the Haifa bombing, in contravention of all international law, Sharon has assumed responsibility for putting the whole region to fire and the sword.
This killing frenzy will abate only if force is used.
The European Union has the means to intervene, if it chooses to do so.
The Council must, therefore, suspend the association agreement while the occupation lasts.
The European Union can also demand that this illegal wall be destroyed, in accordance with the famous Roadmap.
The European Union must prevent the threats against PresidentÂ Arafat from being carried out.
Unfortunately, however, it will not do so without a mass demonstration of solidarity on the part of the people of Europe, appalled by the humiliation, destitution and despair of the Palestinians.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we are still seeing positions being taken on the conflict in the Middle East which either favour Israel against Palestine or censure the Israelis to the benefit of the Palestinians.
There are probably arguments in favour of both sides.
The inalienable right of innocent Israeli communities to defend themselves and the natural desire of Palestinians freely to determine their own future are, of course, among those arguments.
What is beyond all doubt is that there is no argument to justify the terrorist tactics embraced by both peoples in the region.
Our group believes that any remaining hope of peace between Israelis and Palestinians still lies in the road map.
This initiative, which involves not only the belligerents but also the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, must be improved, but cannot be abandoned.
Its objectives remain valid, aiming as they do to resolve the conflict by 2005, putting an end to the violence and terrorism and allowing a future Palestinian state to exist peacefully alongside Israel.
That coexistence requires effective democracy based on tolerance and freedom; we must recognise that such democracy is not yet in place.
It is absolutely crucial to begin moving forward again following the logic of give-and-take, expecting each party to honour its commitments at every stage.
We cannot accept matters as they stand at present.
There have been few, precious few positive steps, and those that have been taken have been answered with violence.
If the conditions for producing solid ties of mutual trust cannot be created, we will not only witness the deaths of more innocent civilians but also, some day soon, the day when hope itself dies.
The , therefore, is unacceptable.
In consequence, the European Union must, in partnership with other interested parties, increase the pressure to make the resumption of the peace process possible and enduring.
Unlike some of the honourable Members who have spoken here, our group doubts very much indeed that the solution is to send a military force made up of armed units from a coalition of countries to intervene in the area.
Of course, we do not accept the construction of a wall separating the two countries.
What seems unacceptable is attempting to replace that wall with a human barricade, even if it is well armed, organised and authorised by the international community.
Besides, this would be a traditional military response which would not resolve the current situation, typical of urban guerrilla warfare.
We feel that the full force of European diplomatic pressure should be thrown behind the drive to make it clear to the Palestinian authorities that the despicable suicide attacks against the Israeli civilian population must cease forthwith and for good.
On the other hand, it is also crucial to ensure that the response of the democratic Israeli Government is restrained, and also to warn neighbouring countries in the region to refrain from harbouring terrorist groups in whose bases criminal activities are sustained and undertaken.
As we have reiterated on many occasions, there is no such thing as good terrorism, just as there is no such thing as bad terrorism.
Furthermore, no type of terrorism is ever justified.
Or justifiable.
We cannot tolerate any argument for resorting to it, otherwise we recognise its ends as legitimate.
Wherever terrorism lurks, wherever it rears its head, whatever form it takes, the European Union must not shrink from fighting it.
That is because we are fully convinced that the resolution of the conflict in the Middle East would deprive international terrorism of a powerful ideological prop.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too, of course, condemn most vigorously the attack in Haifa, but I am very pleased that Mr Solana expressed the view that Israel too must assume its share of responsibility for the fact that such attacks occur.
The responsibility that Israel must assume was expressed in the demands made of Israel that we find in MrÂ MenÃ©ndezÂ delÂ Valleâs report, and I am able fully to endorse these.
I could, however, do with learning, in this House today, what the EU quite specifically intends to do to force Israel to comply with all these requirements and to force it, for example, also to put a stop to its state terrorism that has, of course, led to the deaths of very many more Palestinians than of Israelis.
That is because, as long as we, here in the EU, do not force Israel to comply with these conditions, Abu Allah does not have an earthly chance of stopping the Palestinian suicide bombers.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, horrifying though they may be, the terrorist attacks in the Middle East â whether Palestinian suicide bombings against Jews or targeted Israeli strikes against Palestinians â cannot hide the fundamentals of the problem.
For, while it is true that there can be no peace without security, there can be no peace without justice either.
In the light of this thought, then, what is the fundamental problem?
It is knowing whether or not Israel, which has, in the course of the conflicts, come to occupy 72%Â of the former British Mandate over Palestine, is prepared to hand over the remaining 28%Â to the Palestinian people, in order for a free and sovereign state to be founded there.
Is Israel prepared, after thirty-five years of military occupation, to evacuate these territories and cede power back to the Palestinian Authority?
If the answer is in the negative â and one is reluctantly forced to admit that nothing hitherto could induce one to think that it might be anything else â then the violence will continue: violence in retaliation, retaliation through violence, colonisation through wall-building. New wars will be waged in defence of the principle of retaliation.
We believe that both Israel and Palestine have a right to security within recognised, respected borders, but it is no good weeping over the number of victims if we cannot propose a political solution.
One might disagree with MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs suggestions â I certainly do â but his plan at least has the virtue of existing.
Let us clearly state where we want to go.
That is the prerequisite for the resolution of this conflict.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the High Representative has just talked about the dreadful and ongoing death toll in this territory between Israel and the Palestinians.
We in the European Community must consider what contribution we can make to ensuring that, in the long term, peace is restored to this tormented territory.
The question is this: What contribution can the European Community make?
Indeed, is the European Community powerful enough to make an effective contribution here?
The European Community is certainly powerful in the economic field, and its economic contribution to stabilising this territory in the past undoubtedly outstrips the contribution made by others in the same way.
Yet on the other hand, when it comes to taking final decisions and to providing final guarantees to one side or the other that its people can live in peace and security in this territory in the long term, the European Community in its present state is obviously still too weak to make this vital contribution.
That is why I too have a question for the High Representative, who is working with great commitment in this region: What role does this territory play in the European Unionâs security strategy, which is currently being drafted?
I am aware, Mr Solana, that your staff are working very intensively on this security strategy.
This security strategy also involves the circle of friends with which the European Community is surrounding itself, and so my question is this: how much priority will be given to this particular conflict within that framework, and in developing this circle of friends, will the dreadful conflict which we are discussing here today be given adequate priority?
Â Â  Mr President, let me join in with Members across the House in expressing deep regret for the deaths on all sides in recent attacks in the Middle East.
It is now more than 1000 days into the Intifada and 3000 people have lost their lives.
It is time for the killing to stop.
Terrorism is inexcusable and the Palestinians' legitimate national aspirations cannot be achieved through violence.
European and worldwide support for their cause is weakened with every suicide bombing.
Equally, Israel must meet her obligations by freezing settlement activity, restoring Palestinian freedom of movement, ending targeted assassinations and ensuring that the security fence does not encroach on Palestinian land.
In this European Parliament, more than anywhere else, we understand the prospect for generation after generation of division and fear which this new Berlin wall represents.
I strongly support Mr Solana's reiteration this morning that the fight against terrorism must take place within international law.
I call on him to press the undoubted case that Israel's treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories is illegal under the fourth Geneva Convention.
I welcome the agreement reached by EU foreign ministers to freeze the assets of Hamas, but regret their delay in coming to this decision.
Commissioner, I am proud that the EU's single biggest external aid programme is its contribution to the Palestinian authority.
Yesterday, however, I spoke to friends and colleagues in the NGO UNA International Service, which is active in the region.
They tell me that all EU-funded development projects have had to be halted because of the emergency in the Middle East.
The UK's department for international development is on record as saying that development there is dependent on the relaxation of Israeli curfews, closures and checkpoints, and eventual withdrawal.
We should roundly condemn the fact that Israeli defence force attacks since 2001 have effectively destroyed EUR 25 million of EU development projects.
I do not believe those who accuse the EU of unconsciously subsidising the occupation, but Israel should be forced to pay more than one piece of compensation to the European Union for this unjustified destruction.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a number of questions for Mr Solana, who was also the Secretary General of ÎÎÎ€Î when the intervention was made in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr High Representative,
- Why is Milosevic one thing and Sharon another?
- Why is the autocratic government which existed in the former Yugoslavia one thing and the government of Israel, whose members talk officially about the murder of Arafat, another?
- Why is the KLA one thing and the jihad another?
- Why are Kosovars, who have other rights, one thing and the Palestinians another?
- How much longer are we going to have two sets of standards and such hypocrisy?
- Why are we searching power stations in Iran with a magnifying glass and no one is telling us what nuclear weapons Israel has?
- Why is there an international alliance and âdesert stormâ when Saddam Hussein attacks Kuwait and just a few paltry announcements when Israel attacks Syria?
- Why with the Berlin wall do we say âgood-bye Leninâ and with the Palestinian wall do we say âgood morning Sharonâ?
- How far will we go?
- Where is Europe?
- Why is Europe paralysed?
- Why does Europe have no voice when the United States does have a voice?
- Why does Europe not take a specific initiative at the United Nations for there to be international forces in the area of tension between Israel and Palestine?
Â Â  â Mr President, the neoconservatives warned us that Baghdad was the start of their journey.
When we were unable to prevent the United Statesâ war in Iraq, or, worse, when we supported it, as most European governments did, we knew of the heightened security risks we were causing in that region, just as we also knew that the next stop after Baghdad might be Damascus.
One has only to listen to the language of US and Israeli leaders, the criticisms they have directed at the Syrian regime over the last few months: support for Iraqâs Baâathist leaders, possession of weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons programmes, harbouring terrorists. These are the same fallacious arguments which had already served as a pretext for the USÂ occupation of Iraq.
They are now being mobilised again against the leaders of Syria. The USÂ Congress draws up a pre-emptive embargo against Syria, and then, hey presto!
Israel begins pre-emptive strikes on Syrian territory.
All the speakers here have condemned the Haifa bombings, and I, of course join them in so doing.
I would rather not have waited until MrÂ BarÃ³nÂ Crespoâs speech, however, to hear express condemnation of Israelâs violation of Syriaâs territorial sovereignty.
In the same way, I would also like to have heard some reminder of how difficult it is to speak of European foreign policy at a time when certain European countries are involved in the military occupation of Iraq.
Â Â  MrÂ President, after the Israeli raid into Syria, the first of its size since the Yom Kippur war, in retaliation for the dreadful attack in Haifa perpetrated by a young female suicide bomber, the first question is whether we are at risk of entering a dangerous phase for peace throughout the Middle East.
It is undeniable that between PresidentÂ Assad, who is sticking to a rigid political stance and whose duty it is, therefore, to react strongly to the serious provocation represented by an attack on Syrian soil, and PrimeÂ MinisterÂ Sharon who, 13 months away from the US elections, can feel that he has a particularly free rein, there are elements that could further inflame tensions and result in the entire region becoming engulfed.
What we are seeing at the moment, however, is the modest and slow nature of the initial reaction from Damascus, which has undeniably brought the global weakness of Syriaâs current position to the fore.
The little success it has had in submitting its case to the Security Council has shown its isolation at international level, which adds to its relative regional isolation since the war in Iraq and its military weakness since Damascus has stopped receiving supplies of sophisticated weapons sold on credit.
With military decoupling from Israel increasing greatly, it is difficult to imagine Syria taking the risk of military escalation in the Golan Heights.
The Republic of Syria will, therefore, no doubt do so on the Blue Line with the intervention of the Shiite Hezbollah.
This indirect response is not without risk.
In this sensitive phase European diplomacy could, therefore, play a useful mediating role alongside the two players to help prevent the spiral of another regional escalation from being set in motion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Secretary-GeneralÂ Solana, the Palestinian Prime Minister, AhmadÂ Quray categorically excludes Palestinian moves and efforts to combat the terrorist groups that systematically sabotage the fragile and extremely relative peace in the Middle East.
In this way, the Palestinian Prime Minister has provided absolutely the best grounds for pessimism to all those who do not think there is a future for the Middle East and all those who do not believe there can be peace there.
MrÂ Solana, I want you to broach this subject with the Palestinian Prime Minister.
Among the necessary preconditions for peace in the Middle East are that the Palestinian terrorist groups should be disarmed and that their terrorist activities should not continue.
If the Palestinian Government neither wishes, nor is effectively able, to do anything about terrorist groups in the Middle East, Israel will do something about them.
Approximately a week ago, 19 people died in a suicide attack in Haifa.
In a democratic country such as Israel, which is a sign to the rest of the world that democracy exists in the Middle East, every such suicide attack carried out by a terrorist group will make Israeli opinion less willing to compromise with the Palestinian Authority and less well disposed towards handing land over to the Palestinians.
No country, including Israel, is obliged in the long term to accept as neighbours either countries that make land available to terrorists who carry out attacks or countries that fail to intervene against such movements in their territories.
The Palestinian Prime Ministerâs, Ahmad Qurayâs, impotence in the face of terrorism is perhaps in itself entirely understandable.
It is difficult to get at armed groups of that size.
He must nonetheless indicate, politically and in terms of the action he takes, that that is his ambition.
Nor has the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, dared to intervene vigorously against the terrorist groups, in spite of the fact that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups are indirectly and deliberately sabotaging the peace process with its associated two-state solution, of which the Palestinian Government officially professes itself an adherent.
Allow me to sum up before I move on to another area.
The Palestinian Prime Minister must clearly let it be known, in words and action, that there can be no room for terrorist activity in a future two-state solution, least of all in the territory of the Palestinian Authority.
The second matter I intended to address concerns the way in which religion is misused.
This has to do with relations between the West and the Islam-dominated world.
I find it depressing that Muslim religious leaders do not explain much more clearly that suicide attacks cannot be compatible with a religion of love, reconciliation and goodness.
Religion must stand for love and shared humanity.
It must stand for reconciliation and for the good, and not for the deaths of innocent people, as in the case of the suicide bombing in Haifa.
Â Â  Mr President, every time we debate the problem of the Middle East following a statement by the High Representative, Mr Solana, I get the feeling that he is switching between the ordeals of Tantalus and Sisyphus, or even that his efforts are throwing water into the Danaids' jar on the one hand and on optimism on the other, an optimism that moves either in the realm of Utopia or in the realm of realism.
What is for sure, in all events, is that a lot of work is needed in order for the sun to revolve.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Middle East crisis is escalating.
Crises which we thought were over are returning to both Lebanon and Syria, unfortunately on the responsibility of the very person who today is the prime minister of Israel.
In all events, terrorism of any form is unacceptable and condemnable.
However, it cannot be used as a pretext for new escalations.
I should underline here the clear positions taken by Commissioner Monti and the very rare unanimity among the speakers.
The picture is clear.
The European Union must take decisive initiatives in order to prevent any danger of expansion and must propose specific solutions and ways of applying them.
It must intervene decisively and with the force of a third agent.
The role of umpire between the Israelis and the Palestinians is not enough.
The role of umpire leads to neutrality and neutrality in crises is not the best option.
We are not historical journalists.
We are politicians.
Now we must decide.
Now the road map, the Rabin/Arafat agreements must acquire substance through application, even with the presence of UN forces.
Let me remind you of the popular proverb, âyou cannot make an omelette without breaking eggsâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, our history is one of boundaries that we cross, a history of walls that we pull down after having built them.
This is because a wall, MrÂ President, can be rebuilt, but a life cannot, and I agree with MrsÂ Morgantini when she says that it is not enough to call for international law to be respected.
Does international law allow a State to protect terrorist cells that are going to attack the civil population of another State?
I ask you that.
I agree with her when she says that it is our duty to intervene and I share her indignation that we cannot be happy with moral stances, as we so often are, stances that ease our consciences, but, ladies and gentlemen, a clear conscience is the opposite of real conscience.
Yes, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, we need a political shock!
Nor can I let it be said that this wall is the same as the Berlin wall, as I heard mentioned just now.
I personally am against this wall, because I am against the line that it follows.
A wall dividing one nation in two and a wall that aims to create a border, even if the border is completely open to argument, cannot, however, be considered to be the same thing.
I would like to add that I was one of those that signed a petition against the line the wall follows, in particular at Abu Dis.
Everyone is calling for a return to the 1967 borders and I am surprised to note that today there are passionate calls for what, yesterday, was rejected just as passionately.
This is because, in the end, what the more moderate amongst us are asking for today, is nothing more than a return to the Clinton parameters, the parameters that were recently rejected altogether.
MrÂ Monti quite rightly said that Hamas and Islamic Jihad do not recognise Israelâs right to exist, as the suicide attacks have shown.
We are deeply embroiled in the matter and there is in actual fact not just one conflict; there are four.
There is a war being waged by the Palestinian authority for the legitimate liberation of the Palestinian state and we are supporting it.
There is war being waged by the Israeli State for its safety.
We are supporting this too.
There is also, and this has to be said, a type of colonial war being waged by some Israelis and there is, and we really cannot overlook this one, a war to destroy the Israeli State being waged by some Palestinian factions.
If we are not aware of these four conflicts then we cannot understand what is happening.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is easy to condemn suicide attacks, but what should we do if we were in the same situation?
What did those of our parents who lived in occupied countries 60 years ago do?
They put up resistance.
When I saw the Berlin Wall in 1961, it was the first such wall I had ever seen.
Now, Israel is building a wall of shame.
Saddam Hussein was toppled because he was suspected of having weapons of mass destruction.
We know that Israel has weapons of mass destruction.
The South Africa of apartheid fell because racist oppression was being practised in the country.
We know that Israel is built entirely upon racist oppression.
The military junta in Chile fell partly because politicians were being murdered.
We know that Israel has politicians murdered the whole time.
East Germany, Saddam Hussein, apartheid and the Chilean junta are gone, but Sharonâs regime of oppression remains.
What are we doing?
What is the EU doing?
We are not doing a lot.
We are not even applying the Association Agreement.
We are not even breaking off trade relations.
Why cannot we send our fantastic peace troops to Palestine in order to protect the Palestinian people?
Israel will not continue to exist if the present development continues.
The Middle East is often compared with the Crusader empires that lasted for 200 years.
A quarter of that period has elapsed.
It is possible that Israel will continue to exist for 100 years with the help of US money and weapons and the EUâs passivity; but, if no one intervenes, our grandchildren will perhaps witness the destruction of Israel.
That is not something I wish to see.
I can assure you that it would be no tea party.
Let us try to prevent such an occurrence.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am only allowed five minutes under the RulesÂ ofÂ Procedure.
In that short time, I shall do my best to respond to some of the main issues raised during this morningâs sitting.
I shall also endeavour to restate once again the position we are endeavouring to defend on behalf of the EuropeanÂ Union regarding this dramatic conflict.
I should like to make some things quite clear from the start.
Having listened to those Members of the House who took the floor, it seems that essentially we all agree that the present situation is extremely serious. The gravity of the situation cannot be underestimated.
It is becoming increasingly difficult.
Consequently, it is incumbent on us to pull together and redouble our efforts on behalf of the EuropeanÂ Union.
The high degree of consensus between the various honourableÂ Members who spoke this morning is worthy of mention.
It should be noted that almost without exception they all endorsed the RoadÂ Map as the best instrument for attaining the desired objective.
That objective involves making it possible for a StateÂ ofÂ Israel and a PalestinianÂ State to coexist in peace and prosperity within a reasonable period of time.
The RoadÂ Map stipulates a short time period.
I believe the aforementioned objective is our shared objective.
