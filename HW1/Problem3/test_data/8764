We also see a need to modernise the system for collecting statistical information, including the Satellite Accounts, as it is only with up-to-date and trustworthy data that the public authorities and industry can take the key strategic decisions which will allow Europe to maintain its current leading position.
I also have a point to make on the rather more contentious issue of a possible harmonisation of quality standards for tourist accommodation in Europe.
The multiplicity of classification schemes for hotels must be combined with the issue of protecting the rights and expectations of tourists when making their choices.
Will it be possible to establish, in the European Union, minimum standards for safety and quality which guarantee the reliability and transparency of information provided to these consumers?
This is certainly desirable but we feel that it will only be possible on a voluntary basis and by inviting all the stakeholders to take part in this work.
The Commission may, if it so wishes, assume a fundamental driving role in this.
There is not enough time to mention other equally important aspects of this report, including accessible tourism for tourists with reduced mobility, passenger rights or the external promotion of European destinations and the development of sustainable policies.
However, it has been adequately demonstrated, and I will end on this point, that the European Parliament has done its work and we hope that the other public bodies, in partnership with the private sector, will reinforce their spirit of cooperation and respond effectively to the challenges of developing a renewed and sustainable EU tourism policy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the new EU tourism policy proposed by the European Commission and discussed in the Costa report deserves my full support. This is due both to the main objectives set out following the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy - improvement of competitiveness, creation of more and better jobs, sustainable development - and also due to the instruments through which the Commission proposes to achieve these objectives: coordination within the Commission and within national authorities, cooperation between the different stakeholders and establishment of specific supporting actions.
The rapporteur, Paolo Costa, who I congratulate on the quality of his report and also on his readiness to accept the proposed amendments, has drawn attention to certain aspects and concerns omitted from the Commission communication.
He has put forward possible opportunities and solutions for a future renewed EU tourism policy, particularly on the visa granting policy, harmonisation of quality standards, improvement of visibility and understanding of labels by tourists, consumer protection, accessibility of tourism for tourists with reduced mobility, guarantee of passenger rights, and promotion of destinations within the European Union.
We feel it is absolutely right that account should be taken of these aspects and the solutions proposed.
Mr Costa's draft report has in turn been enriched and improved by a number of amendments, many tabled by colleagues from my Group.
I myself, in order to reinforce the terms of the Commission's proposals and take account of the rapporteur's proposals, tabled various amendments further to the positions that I defended in the QueirÃ³ report.
These included: the need to duly consider the accessibility handicap affecting regions with specific natural or geographical characteristics, such as the outermost regions; the need for the renewed EU tourism policy to make European tourism sustainable in economic, social, territorial, environmental and cultural terms; the promotion of Europe as a tourist destination or a collection of attractive tourist destinations; the need to coordinate the policies with a direct or indirect impact on tourism; closer cooperation among the stakeholders in the sector - the European Commission and the Member States, the regions, local authorities and tourism services - and better use of existing European financial instruments.
I therefore particularly call on my Group to support this report and I urge the Commission and the Council to take due account of the suggestions and recommendations of the European Parliament.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tourism certainly accounts for a very large slice of our economies but, to a certain extent, it also represents the continued construction of the European identity and our cohesion policy.
It often contributes, of course, to maintaining activity in the most isolated areas, and is often the main resource in our outermost regions.
This comprehensive report sets out the main points on which the EU can now provide genuine added value in order to optimise this resource intelligently so that it is beneficial to all, to those working in the tourist industry, to the tourists themselves, and in short to Europeans, with long-term conservation of our landscapes and ecosystems.
Personally, since I come from a region lucky enough to have three European neighbours, I am particularly sensitive to border tourism and I hope that, through the partnerships, this type of tourism will help build a genuine living space both for European citizens and beyond the EU's internal borders.
However, to open up to a larger extent to non-EU tourism, we must implement a coordinated policy to grant tourist visas.
I would also like the EU to adopt statistical tools and a cross-sector approach in terms of Community financing in order to bring about the well-known leverage effects on innovation, jobs, an improved offer and quality of service.
I hope we can create European quality labels in accordance with ecological and social criteria, and quite simply enhance information and protection for European consumers.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, when Thomas Cook opened his first travel agency in 1841, I am sure he did not anticipate that 166 years later, tourism would account directly for approximately 5% of the income of European countries.
I should add that, if the links with other sectors are taken into account, tourism currently generates over 11% of GDP and approximately 25 million jobs.
I should therefore like to thank Mr Costa for his report on such a dynamic sector of the economy.
We are all aware that tourism is not directly covered by Union regulations.
Nonetheless, the Union's role as a coordinator and promoter makes a significant contribution to presenting Europe as a very attractive and diverse tourist destination.
It has a bearing on tourism within the Union, on incoming tourism from countries outside the Union and on outward journeys to the latter.
These issues are of great importance to the new Member States, including Poland.
Only now are many people starting to discover how attractive places that were previously behind the Iron Curtain can be as tourist destinations.
In this context, national, regional and local authorities have an important role to play in encouraging tourism. Tourism also encompasses so-called Green Tourism, tourism in search of Europe's cultural heritage, health tourism, pilgrimages, and eco-tourism seeking natural beauty.
I am glad the problems for disabled and older tourists have been taken into account, though perhaps more attention could have been devoted to them.
The Cohesion Fund should be used wisely to support the development of infrastructure, in particular transport infrastructure.
The European Regional Development Fund may also be used to support the development of ICT, including the Internet, and to promote cross-border cooperation to benefit tourism in its broadest sense.
In addition, the European Social Fund should be used to finance training programmes in this sector.
In conclusion, I should like to say that standards are the key to success in this sector.
Nobody is satisfied with mediocre quality.
A tourist who is disappointed with the standard of transport or of a hotel or a tourist who has a poor experience in a restaurant will never return to the destination concerned again. He or she will only be taken in once.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to Paolo Costa.
I especially welcome those aspects of the report which underline the importance of social and ecological sustainability.
A carefully preserved natural and cultural landscape is the best magnet to attract tourists to a destination country.
The acceptance of tourism by the citizens of the host country - in other words, the people who live and work there - is a key prerequisite in ensuring that tourists feel that they are genuinely welcome guests.
A high level of training and overall satisfaction among employees in the tourism industry is what is needed to guarantee satisfied guests.
Mobility is a prerequisite for tourism, and 'soft' forms - public transport, cycling or walking - will promote growth without destroying the essential bases of a healthy and, of course, sustainable tourism industry.
This comprehensive report contains a number of ideas which should be more than pious wishes.
I trust that these ecological and social principles will be embedded in the 'European Agenda 21 for Tourism' that has been announced.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, the tourism industry, especially in countries such as Cyprus, Spain, Greece and others, is a sector of major economic importance, and yet the European Commission does not have a word to say about those who work in it.
This is an industry which is perhaps the first to apply flexible hours for employees, and where seasonal layoffs are the order of the day.
It is also a sector where the employment of foreign nationals raises two key issues: firstly, their exploitation, and secondly, their use as blackmail by large hotel chains to drive down the wages or benefits paid to local workers.
Apart from this, the European Commission simply confirms the fact, without making any substantial comment, that the cause of job creation in this sector is the high level of part-time employment and the flexible employment terms.
The concept of long-term employment seems, then, to be nothing but pie in the sky.
(HU) Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the opportunities implied by healthcare tourism.
It is important that we make use of all the available programmes to support such healthcare tourism, including the second Community healthcare action programme.
I would like to stress that we must involve the insurance sector more in supporting healthcare tourism, and together we must find a way for cross-border cooperation with this funding.
The question is whether we will be able to make such services part of the common market.
We are talking about services that not only account for a proportion of economic growth but also help European citizens so that everyone can benefit from the opportunities offered by healthcare tourism and, within this, the opportunities offered by the common market.
Indeed, it is true that, to do this, we will need, or would need, a slightly better-defined quality system, so I very much support Mr Costa's initiative, which has undeniably formulated a way to make progress in this direction.
It would be good for our European tourism if those arriving from outside, from third countries, knew what they were getting from the services and what they were paying for.
Briefly, in summary, I therefore think that when we talk about this sector, we need to look at tourism in a much more multi-faceted way, and we must also investigate what these services can bring us from the perspective of the common market.
Thank you very much.
Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, who is chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and who began by pointing out that the Treaties allow policies that impact on tourism.
It is therefore very appropriate that we are considering this issue.
Equally, as Mr Arnaoutakis reminded us a few moments ago, at least 12% of jobs in the EU depend on tourism.
The EU is much more, nowadays, than just a common market for goods and capital.
It is a common market for people. EU citizens, as we know, are travelling more than ever, not least as tourists.
Many, perhaps most, have very good experiences, but it is the minority - the few who have less happy experiences - that give some aspects of the tourism industry a poor name.
I draw colleagues' attention in particular to paragraphs 24 and 25, which call for a set of comprehensive guidelines for hotels that are sensitive to the needs of consumers.
Those guidelines should take into account the demands of families with children.
Not all hotels may be able to respond to these, but the industry really needs to make itself as family-friendly as possible.
Equally, a system of classification must take into account the needs of the elderly and the disabled.
The Transport Committee has argued for this in the case of airlines, and it is right to require that hotels, too, should not discriminate against this social group.
Nor should they be able to make moral judgments on who qualifies as a couple, and who does not.
The report is also right to point out, as it does in paragraph 48, which suggests a charter of rights and obligations for tourists, that tourists should themselves behave properly and respect hotels and the tourism business.
This is a good report, it is a 'good news' story and it sends a message that Parliament is acting sensibly in the interests of the consumers.
I hope that message reaches the people of Europe.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some extremely interesting ideas emerge from Paolo Costa's truly excellent report.
I should just like to make a few brief remarks, based on the profound changes in demand caused mainly by globalisation, by the increasingly large presence of tourists from third countries on our soil and by increased life expectancy.
All of this means that we need to draw up a European Union tourism policy which is appropriate for this day and age; we must also review its strategic objectives.
Mr QueirÃ³ highlighted the need for a classification of hotel facilities.
I fully agree with him, and I would add that European quality and safety standards should also be established for tourist products.
We must respond to our citizens' new requirements as beneficiaries and consumers of tourism services.
From this point of view, I would just cite two examples from among the many novel ideas contained in the Costa report: an 'Access for all' label that would guarantee accessible facilities for tourists with reduced mobility, and the European tourist programme for retired people.
Allow me to make one concluding remark about training: we should also think about specific individual qualifications for workers involved in tourism for retired people and for the disabled.
(PT) While we accept and value many of the aspects covered by this report, we must intervene in this debate to stress, firstly, that tourist activity and high-quality tourism require the professions involved in this sector to be governed by legal regimes which protect labour rights and promote quality jobs and worker qualification.
In our opinion this implies, among other aspects, appropriate vocational training, improvement of working conditions, promotion of stable contractual arrangements and fair and dignified levels of pay.
Secondly, we would stress that tourism can contribute to territorial cohesion, economic development and regional employment which is why a cross-sector approach must be adopted in the Community policies and funds for this area, in particular by setting up a specific Community programme to complement the actions of the Member States.
These points form the content of some of the proposals that we have tabled and which we hope will be supported by this Parliament.
(PL) Madam President, we do not often deal with tourism in this House and I am therefore particularly grateful to Mr Costa, the rapporteur.
I should like to congratulate him on a job well done.
In my view, the most positive features of this report are the sustainable approach to tourism along with the need to increase European cohesion and quality of life.
I also welcome the emphasis on the importance of access to tourist services.
Visa policy is mentioned in the report too.
I consider this to be a crucial matter, and we should pay great attention to monitoring the issue of visas and the operation of border crossings on the territory of the new Schengen countries.
Russia and Ukraine have expressed concerns regarding the issue of visas to drivers, including coach drivers, and to couriers.
Indeed, only yesterday Mr Barroso received the head of the Association of International Road Carriers of Ukraine, who voiced their concerns.
I am familiar with the situation and referred the matter to Mr Frattini a month ago.
So far no reply has been forthcoming.
I consider this to be an important matter.
It is essential for Parliament and the Commission to focus on monitoring implementation of visa policy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 November 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) The deadlock surrounding the Constitutional Treaty has had a knock-on effect in the tourism sector which, according to the approach under discussion, should become a Community policy.
The individual Member States have in recent years pursued tourism strategies that have, in general, led to overall growth in this sector within the 27 countries' individual socio-economic settings.
The number of tourists has risen, investment has been injected and staffing requirements have grown, with manifestly positive effects on employment.
What has been lacking until now is a clear, comprehensive plan on the part of the Community institutions.
Competition between countries is increasing and substantial new offers are clearly becoming available in various parts of the world.
Under these circumstances Europe must show that it is up to scratch: in other words, it must rise to the serious challenges looming on the horizon and overcome them.
in writing. - (HU) Globalisation, demographic changes and increased transport are contributing significantly to the rapid growth in tourism, which has great potential for growth and employment.
Tourism currently contributes approximately 4% to the EU's GDP, and indirectly more than 10%, and accounts for about 12% of all jobs.
Tourism encourages people to understand each other better, it promotes the formation of European identity and, through relationships among social, economic and cultural groups, it encourages dialogue between cultures.
Establishing a model for European tourism is of primary importance for the Union, since it must be built on values linked to the quality and sustainability of tourism objectives and to equal access for all.
Simplification of the rules, harmonisation of policies that concern tourism, and extending the use of the European financial instruments available must be actively promoted.
The development of tourism must be sustainable; in other words, it must respect local communities and environmental protection.
In order to do this, we need a support framework and an effective structure involving all the interested regional and local parties, within which partnership and effective leadership will become easier.
For the measures implemented in order to achieve the goals, we must bear in mind the fundamental principles of subsidiarity, which define the division of responsibility among the individual parties concerned.
in writing. - (SK) From the point of view of sustainable, integrated regional and local development, tourism has considerable impact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU-27.
It also plays an important role in increasing employment in less-developed European regions, thus helping to iron out regional disparities.
Also, even though it has not yet been possible to develop a consistent cross-policy approach to tourism at EU level, we cannot allow Europe to lose its market share in this sector.
The Commission, together with the Member States and regional councils, should encourage and financially support new forms of tourism, such as eco-tourism, agricultural tourism, social and health tourism.
I view this as one of the tools for ensuring sustainable development of the regions, with emphasis on protection of natural and cultural heritage and its preservation for future generations.
Tourism must be better supported by information campaigns.
SMEs, primarily tourism business start-ups and those offering new tourism products or developing economic activity in new localities or tourist regions, must have better access to information and be able to make use of available European funding programmes through the Structural Funds.
I also want to emphasise the need to exchange experience gained through tourism projects already put into practice, which offer an opportunity to learn from incorrect approaches used in unsuccessful projects and to avoid similar errors in other European regions.
in writing. - (DE) Developments in recent years have shown that European tourism, like any other economic sector, is strongly influenced by wider global conditions.
In order to respond to these challenges successfully, more intensive coordination of national policies is essential.
Entirely in line with the subsidiarity principle, Member States must utilise the opportunities available at EU level in order to augment their existing national policies.
In this way, the EU can make an effective contribution to curbing burgeoning bureaucracy and dismantling obstacles within the tourism sector by means of harmonisation.
Our aim must be to make efficient use of available resources and utilise all the opportunities to create synergies in order to boost the EU's global competitiveness and create more jobs.
An important step, in this context, would be to simplify visa procedures and reduce the costs for tourist visas in all the EU countries.
I also urge the EU to adopt uniform quality standards for hotel accommodation in Europe in order to enhance transparency and, at the same time, to strengthen the rights of consumers.
This must not lead to any lowering of national quality standards, however, but should send out an important signal to consumers.
The EU must utilise its existing opportunities to provide active support to Member States in this context without, however, calling existing national competences into question.
Macro-financial assistance for Lebanon (debate)
The next item is the report by Kader Arif, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a Council decision providing Community macro-financial assistance to Lebanon - C6-0290/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for giving its support to the Commission proposal from last August.
As the rapporteur, Mr Arif, emphasises in his report, Lebanon is in a very difficult situation both politically and economically.
Its need for funding is acute.
With this macro-financial assistance, the European Union is acting on the pledge it made at the international donor conference last January in Paris, when we agreed to give financial support to Lebanon.
As you know, the operationalisation of the financial assistance is beset by considerable uncertainties due to the political and constitutional crisis which has not yet been overcome.
Nonetheless, the Commission is keeping to its pledge to complete all the necessary internal procedures so that the assistance can come on-stream as soon as circumstances permit.
Our talks with the Lebanese authorities on the political conditions to be linked with the programme are nearing a conclusion and I can assure you that these conditions will be in full conformity with the EU-Lebanon Action Plan established within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and with the Lebanese authorities' medium-term economic reform programme.
We will of course be utilising all available means in order to minimise, as far as possible, the risk of fraud, corruption and financial abuse, as called for in the draft report.
I note that the rapporteur is proposing various amendments to the Commission proposal.
We will look at these amendments very carefully and give our opinion to the Council.
However, I can already tell you that we will not be raising any objections to most of the amendments on the legal provisions themselves.
The Commission is aware that, at the hearings about new financial assistance, Parliament had to react to very short deadlines.
The timetable for all the institutions involved has been tight, due to the specific nature of this financial assistance as a crisis instrument.
However, in order to ease the situation and improve cooperation with the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the Commission pledges in future to inform the INTA Secretariat systematically, and in advance, of any new financial assistance transactions; this will be done by means of an information memorandum as soon as new financial assistance is in prospect.
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present this report to you today on the allocation of macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Lebanon.
This is testimony to the EU pledge to help the country recover from successive crises.
Lebanon is currently one of the world's most debt-ridden countries, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 180%.
The impact of the civil war between 1975 and 1990, the 2006 summer crisis with Israel, chronic political instability and an economic policy set adrift have caused a serious economic, financial and social crisis.
The reality of this situation calls for urgent action to be taken.
It transpires that funds in connection with the adoption in January 2007 of the EU-Lebanon Action Plan as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy will not be available until 2009.
The exceptional MFA we are set to adopt will bridge that gap and will have an immediate impact on public finances and the balance of payments in Lebanon, provided it is implemented immediately.
The MFA will consist of a donation of 30 million euros and a loan of 50 million euros to help the Lebanese Government take on post-war reconstruction and continue its economic revival.
My report fully approves the need to secure this financial assistance for Lebanon.
It does, however, introduce a number of amendments to the Council's proposal for the sake of clarity and transparency.
First and foremost, we ought to bear in mind that the assistance must be strictly complementary to the finance agreed by the Bretton Woods institutions, the Paris Club, bilateral donors and the EU under other programmes.
It must be coherent with EU external action or policies and guarantee the added value of the Community undertaking.
The Council will also need to explicitly and publicly take up Parliament's recommendations as to the conditions and criteria attached to the assistance, in other words improved transparency and increased sustainability of public finances, application of the budgetary and macro-economic priorities defined, implementation of specific measures to prevent any risk of fraud, corruption and misuse of funds, distribution of assistance with a fair balance among post-conflict expenditure, reconstruction, excessive debt and the social needs of the population, and full compliance with international democratic and human rights standards and the fundamental principles of the rule of law.
Provision of aid for Lebanon must be accompanied by real progress on the objectives mentioned, and this must be set out in a grant agreement drawn up jointly with the Lebanese authorities.
In addition to our basic work on this text, I also wish to mention some of the difficulties encountered while the report was being drawn up, given its urgent nature.
It is for this reason that, for any future decision relating to the granting of MFA, the Commission and the Council must provide us with much more notice.
For Parliament to carry out its work satisfactorily, it must have better-quality information in good time.
In this regard, implementation of an early warning system by the Commission would ensure faster handling of the dossier by the competent committee in Parliament and avoid unnecessary delays which might have a serious negative impact on the final beneficiary of the financial aid.
The quality and coherence of our work and the quality of our cooperation with the other institutions rely heavily on this factor.
In line with previous Parliament resolutions, I wish to stress that such a substantial instrument cannot be simply regarded as exceptional.
It must have a regular legal basis and cannot be based on ad hoc Council decisions for each operation.
A framework regulation on MFA, laid down under the codecision procedure, is necessary in order to enhance transparency, accountability, monitoring and reporting systems.
We must also make rapid arrangements for interinstitutional discussions as to the most suitable legal basis for this kind of instrument.
In the case of MFA for Lebanon, one of the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and also classified as a developing country, we feel that the legal basis for this action should have been Article 179 of the EC Treaty instead of Article 308 of the EC Treaty.
It is precisely because Lebanon is a developing country that Parliament insists on not neglecting the social aspect of the reforms that the Lebanese Government might undertake.
According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), nearly 24% of Lebanese live in complete destitution, and 52% of Lebanese are considered underprivileged.
Moreover, nearly 9% of the population are illiterate, less than one-third of the population reach primary school level, and only 13% of Lebanese reach university.
Despite this reality, it must be said that the social question is not currently at the centre of Lebanese political debate, and the social content of envisaged reform is extremely limited with respect to economic and financial concerns.
It is, however, in the interests of Lebanon and its partners, as I have already said, to find a fair balance between the various items of expenditure, particularly funds for education and training.
It must be borne in mind that persistent social inequalities may have serious economic and political consequences which could prolong the country's instability.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (ES) Madam President, Lebanon is in an extremely serious and tense situation and it is clear that a way out from the institutional crisis in that country must be found.
With this in mind, a working group from the Committee on Foreign Affairs will next week visit the country to do what this Parliament has always done: bear witness to the solidarity of our institution with the cause of peace, understanding, harmony, reconciliation and democratic consolidation in that country.
It was precisely with this aim in mind that Mr Arif produced his report on macro-financial assistance for Lebanon.
I must say to him that, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we did not want to get too bogged down in technicalities given the extremely serious and tense situation in Lebanon, as I have said, following the succession of President Lahoud.
However, we obviously did want to ensure full respect for the competence of Parliament as an arm of the budgetary authority, maximum clarity and transparency as the rapporteur was proposing, and therefore correct and effective use of the funding, thus avoiding any kind of corruption, as indicated by Commissioner Verheugen in his speech.
In this context, we believe that this macro-financial assistance falls within the spirit of the association agreement, or the association between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries, within the future framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and, of course, within the obligations made in the agreements of the Paris III Conference on the reconstruction and recovery of Lebanon. It also falls within the spirit of the agreements made with the international institutions.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (FI) Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I note with satisfaction that the responsible committee has adopted the proposals we tabled.
It was very courageous of the Committee to propose the new concept of 'the availability period of financial assistance' and interpret it in such a way that the validity of the legal act could be prolonged simply through comitology committee procedure.
The Commission is just an executive body and cannot have the role of legislator. Such it would become if it should decide on how long financial assistance should last.
On the Committee on Budgets I note with satisfaction that the responsible committee has adopted a positive position regarding our proposal for an amendment to the legal basis, although that would only be done in respect of future proposals on macro-financial assistance.
A more proper legal basis we feel is Article 179 of the EC Treaty and not the general Article 308 which has now been used.
We hope that the Commission and the Council will in future take account of this message from Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, the current institutional vacuum in Lebanon constitutes a major threat to the country and the region in general.
With a non-functional parliament, its members in fear of their lives, a destabilised government and a paralysed economy, Lebanon must now find a way out of this crisis.
More than ever, the EU must also remain alert in support of its neighbour and ally.
The macro-financial assistance proposed today by the EU is more welcome than ever before.
This exceptional assistance with a time limitation, aiming to rectify the budgetary situation of a country where agreed efforts to reduce the burden of debt were destroyed by the murderous conflict of the summer of 2006, falls fully within the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
It is not, therefore, a traditional form of assistance as this budgetary support will help enhance Lebanon's political and economic sovereignty and independence.
Assistance must, of course, be subject to an anti-fraud mechanism for greater transparency in the administration and disbursement of funds.
We must also ensure better coordination of the financial institutions working to rebuild the country.
We must, in fact, implement the neighbourhood instrument, IMF measures and FEMIP actions in a coherent fashion to guarantee effective and sustainable assistance.
As the Annapolis Conference opens up a window of hope, Lebanon remains a key factor for peace and stability in the region.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I welcome Mr Arif's report.
It is, as you would expect from Mr Arif, a well-argued and well-balanced report.
However, I regret that, once again, the EU has to pick up the bill for Israel's propensity, in the Middle East, to drop bombs first and worry about the consequences later.
It is true that Lebanon had financial difficulties before the conflict with Israel in the summer of 2006, but that war was, perhaps, the straw that broke the camel's back.
Lebanon, as Mr Arif has said, is now one of the most indebted countries in the world and, according to the UNDP, almost one in four Lebanese lives in complete destitution.
We have in Lebanon, despite the problems that it faces, a government determined to bring about economic stability.
In such a situation, it is right that we should be prepared to provide macro-financial assistance to assist in that recovery.
Mr Arif is right to argue for safeguards to ensure that we have appropriate policies for tackling corruption and to make sure that funding is not abused.
The right mechanism for doing that is through absolute transparency in the granting and spending of the money, proper monitoring of expenditure and ex-post evaluation of the measures taken.
Lebanon, as the Commissioner has indicated, has become one of the EU's partner countries in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
The money from that policy will not be available until 2009 or 2010, but when that funding does become available I look forward to the EU assisting in the social and economic reforms in Lebanon.
In the interim, macro-financial assistance can make a big difference in helping Lebanon tackle its indebtedness and help bring stability to its government.
I therefore welcome it.
(PL) Madam President, we are today debating macro-financial assistance for Lebanon.
The latter is in the midst of the most serious economic and political crisis to befall it since the end of the war in 1990.
The House has heard, from many independent experts on the problems of the Middle East, that the European Union should actively support the democratic authorities in Lebanon.
Lebanon is now at a particularly important juncture.
It is at a stage when the last ghosts of war may finally be laid to rest.
There is also a danger, however, that all the old conflicts will break out again.
We should therefore use the instruments available to us and play an active mediating role helping to resolve Lebanon's internal conflicts.
The conflict between Israel and Lebanon caused enormous damage in a country that had just managed, with great difficulty, to rebuild its infrastructure after 20 years of war.
The conflict also had a negative impact on social relations in Lebanon. It led to a strengthening of radical forces, thus plunging Lebanon anew into internal cross-community conflict.
Lebanon needs time to stabilise again.
It needs mediation between all parties.
The financial assistance provided by the European Union and by other countries and institutions will provide an opportunity for the Lebanon to get back on course towards reform.
Reform is bound to take time, but will result in the emergence of a country that is politically, socially and economically stable.
I welcome the Commission's initiative and the fact that Members of the House have taken the issue of macro-financial assistance on board.
This allows us to send out a signal to the people of Lebanon assuring them that the European Union considers itself to be their partner.
I should therefore also like to thank the rapporteur for so skilfully endeavouring to involve Parliament in the decision-making process regarding assistance to Lebanon.
Finally, we must remember that rebuilding Lebanon is just as much in our interest as Europeans as it is in the interests of the people of Lebanon.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 November 2007.
Trade and Climate Change (debate)
The next item is the report by Alain Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade and climate change.
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is quite an important report just before the Bali Conference.
We are aware that international trade is developing at twice the speed of gross world product.
This means it is causing growth in the transport industry, one of the most prolific producers of greenhouse gases.
It is also enabling the relocation of production, which can be good in terms of using workforces and applying wage regulations, but, given that it takes no account whatsoever of the cost of greenhouse gases produced by this division of labour, it may accelerate the production of greenhouse gases and climate change.
To give you just one set of figures: ships, which carry 40 times more freight than planes, produce only twice as much greenhouse gas, but we still use planes to transport our goods to optimise the production cycle.
I therefore feel that, further to the Stern Report and the four reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we should be aware that it is worth waiting half a day or even three more days for a product to arrive at its destination, rather than destroying our climate at a price the Stern Report estimates as 5 000 billion dollars.
Beyond this comment, the report makes an attempt to open up certain avenues.
Obviously there are certain avenues relating to transport.
We are pleased with the recent vote on the addition of the aviation industry to the European quota system.
The report encourages reflection on industrial organisation to reduce the geographic scale of production chains - producing in closer proximity to the end user - and makes a number of proposals in relation to trade in environmental commodities.
What we are proposing, within the context of the WTO and the bilateral or bi-regional agreements - in other words, all the agreements we are currently negotiating - is to prioritise the assessment of the effects on climate change within the assessment made by these agreements of the environmental effects. We also suggest prioritising a considerable reduction in all tariff and non-tariff barriers - and here we are thinking about royalties in particular - that hinder trade in own goods and services which are the ones that can reduce the production of greenhouse gases.
All this must evidently be carried out within the most multilateral context, with the WTO if possible, in the absence of any bi-regional agreements currently being negotiated by Europe.
We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that, after 2012, in the initial post-Kyoto phase, mankind will not have reached a unanimous agreement on the fight against climate change.
In this case, Europe's decision to lead the fight against climate change will definitely hit some of its sectors.
It will not hit all of them.
In many cases, being the leader of the fight against climate change provides a competitive edge.
In some cases, and here I am thinking specifically of the cement industry, this could pose enormous problems and could even lead to cement tourism.
In that case, when all the possibilities of multilateral agreements have been exhausted, we suggest adopting the GATT's Article 20, in other words, border adjustment taxes to restore fair competition.
This, ladies and gentlemen, forms the basis of my proposals.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful for the initiative of the Committee on International Trade in addressing issues relating to trade and climate change.
The report by Alain Lipietz is a useful source of policy ideas and proposals.
We are pleased with this report, because it recognises the interconnectedness of the various aspects of the negotiations.
Climate change is a very serious issue which, essentially, affects all sectors, including trade.
We must endeavour to define a mutually supportive and coherent policy.
The European Union aims to facilitate trade, ensuring that it is viable and also that it contributes to other policies, such as the policy on climate change.
We welcome the fact that the report recognises the prospects for negotiation on environmental goods and services.
We believe that this represents an important contribution by trade to the climate change targets.
We hope to see progress on this issue during the current round of multilateral trade negotiations for the Doha Development Agenda.
We are pleased about the recognition of the need for the environment agreement secretariats to acquire observer status at the World Trade Organisation, which is something we tried to achieve for the current round of trade negotiations.
We are also pleased about the recognition of the contribution that can be made by our new free trade agreements to questions of climate change, through special provisions.
The links between opportunities for access to new markets, i.e. for increased trade flows, and policies on climate change, are obvious.
Environmental policies provide a strong incentive for technological innovation and promote economic performance.
Scientific and economic data show very clearly that the benefits of containing climate change outweigh the cost of reduction policies.
The adoption of further measures to combat climate change may result in significant competitive advantages for producers in countries with restrictions on carbon emissions, because - in combination with other policies - it will lead to lower consumption of valuable resources, and to environmentally friendly technological innovation, for which the market access opportunities are increasing.
In this way we shall arrive at a situation which benefits everyone, in terms both of competition and of the environment.
We must continue to seek out further opportunities to strengthen the positive contribution made by trade policy towards combating climate change.
I note that the report includes in this context the issues of export credit, progressive elimination of trade subsidies with a negative impact on the climate, and the strengthening and broadening of market access for direct foreign investments.
All these are interesting issues which we can discuss in greater detail.
We must also continue our efforts on sustainability criteria in relation to forestry products, deforestation and illegal tree felling.
To conclude, let me thank you once again for this valuable contribution to the discussion on climate change at a very important time, when we are only days away from the start of the Bali Conference on climate change, which we hope will provide the motivation for negotiations on an international post-2012 agreement.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SV) Madam President, it is high time that world trade faced up to its climate responsibility.
Since 1990, world trade has grown exponentially.
What is the result of this from a climate point of view?
Obviously, increases in transport and emissions.
Is it reasonable, for example, that the EU's livestock farmers should import millions of tonnes of soya from Brazil for the European meat industry, or that fish should be caught in Norway, shipped out to China for filleting and cleaning and then back to Europe for preservation?
No, of course not!
Our excellent opinion gives us an opportunity to take concrete measures to deal with this.
We demand that transport should bear its environmental cost.
We want to disseminate green technology to the developing countries, for example, by making fundamental changes to patent and intellectual property rights.
We want to abolish subsidies to dirty energy production.
We want to have compulsory environmental certification of biofuels and we want all trade agreements to be assessed from a climate perspective.
These are just a few examples from this excellent report.
By achieving these things, we can ensure that world trade becomes part of the solution and not part of the problem.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (HU) Thank you for the floor, Madam President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the connection between two of the themes discussed by the report before us are extremely topical.
The connection between certain forms of trade and climate change is ever more obvious.
It is indisputable that intensive international trade gives rise to numerous harmful consequences, including an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, while reducing plant habitats which absorb greenhouse gases.
Despite all this, I am convinced that free trade is not in itself identical to environmental damage.
The spread of trade and the international division of labour does increase production efficiency, over and above the negative effects. This can result in us consuming fewer energy sources in total.
Allow me, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, to highlight three thoughts in this vein from the opinion prepared by our Committee.
Firstly, it is essential that the commercial barriers to environmentally friendly technologies are removed as quickly as possible.
Such action will require the European Union to take an active role in the international climate change negotiations.
Secondly, we must strive for the price of products in future to reflect harmful consequences that are not immediately noticeable, including impact on climate change.
Thirdly and finally, we feel that discussions of suitable depth on the relationship between trade and climate change are of primary interest to the Community. Rather more so since Europe can play a leading role in the export of green products and services to the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, as is also apparent from the above points, the members of the Committee on Industry are unanimous in their opinion that both removing barriers to trade and action against climate change can only be brought about with the broadest possible international collaboration.
The discussions within the Committee have confirmed for us that, with regard to climate change, trade is not only the problem but also part of the solution.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union must take a leading position - as to a large extent it has succeeded in doing - in the adoption of environmentally friendly policies.
In this respect, your own contribution, Mr Dimas, has been substantial.
The adaptation of all sectoral strategies to sustainable development models is, in any case, a primary regulatory target.
The strengthening of international trade is considered to contribute to world economic development and indeed to benefit not only the developed but also the developing countries.
The rapidly increasing volume of cross-border trade flows, however, is a challenge to climate policy.
The limits of the mutually supportive or antagonistic relationship between the world trading system and policies on climate change are the subject of the report we are discussing.
Unfortunately, an imbalance can be seen in the report between the commercial and the environmental component.
The rapid development of international trade ought to be treated exclusively as a factor causing environmental stress.
Furthermore, the adoption of climate policies is not, in itself, enough; there is a need for a coherent overall plan reflecting environmentally friendly preferences in the policies on transport, trade, industry, energy and agriculture.
In any case, the Union's effort alone is not enough to combat climate change.
The Union's world lead in establishing models of environmental and social protection must be continued and promoted in its trade relations with countries outside the EU.
Ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution contains some key points.
The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats has decided that a final vote in favour of the motion should be dependent on the outcome of the votes on these points.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, when it comes to climate change, trade is often seen as part of the problem, and it is true that some trade simply cannot be justified.
Sending Scottish prawns to Thailand to be peeled and returned to Scotland is just nonsense, and a waste of energy.
However, as Mr Lipietz's well-argued report demonstrates, trade can also be part of the solution.
I will take just three brief examples.
Firstly, the setting of high energy-efficiency standards in Europe for household goods such as fridges, dishwashers, microwave ovens and so on can not only lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions here, but also create the conditions for higher standards elsewhere.
For example, a single factory in China produces 80% of the world's microwave ovens.
It is unlikely to want to produce to one standard for Europe and another for elsewhere in the world, or even, for that matter, for its domestic market.
A second example mentioned by the Committee on Industry is green goods or, to use their proper name, environmental goods and services.
If we eliminate the tariffs on environmental goods and services, we can encourage trade in products that help third countries reduce their carbon footprint, such as the export of energy-efficient generators, wave technology and solar panels.
Let us again take the example of China.
China is currently increasing its electricity-generating capacity every year by the equivalent of the UK's total capacity.
Clearly, encouraging China to use the latest and most efficient technology could play an important part in allowing it to continue its growth without experiencing a proportionate increase in its carbon footprint.
A third and final area would be to empower consumers to make informed choices on what products they buy, through the provision of clear information on the carbon footprint of each product.
However, we must be careful to ensure that the information is properly calculated and presented.
The 'food miles' labels currently used by some UK supermarkets are unsatisfactory and can give misleading information.
Flowers from Kenya, for example, have a much smaller carbon footprint than flowers grown in hothouses in Holland, but a glance at the label would lead one to a different conclusion.
Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in this debate on the impact of world trade on climate change, I should like to draw attention to the following matters.
Firstly, as a world leader in efforts to combat climate change, the European Union is calling for a reduction of between 25% and 40% in global greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020.
It should be borne in mind, however, that if the European Union achieves these emission reductions mainly as a result of its own action, with little contribution by other countries, the European Union's economic development might be threatened.
Secondly, economic entities that are subject to various restrictions in Europe as part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can no longer compete with entities operating in countries where no such restrictions apply.
Many sectors and types of production have ceased to exist in Europe due to unfair competition from producers in South-West Asia and South America.
Thirdly, following the introduction of restrictions relating to excessive greenhouse gas emissions on the territory of the European Union, we have witnessed the relocation of manufacturing outside Europe, where no such restrictions exist.
As a result, many jobs in Europe will be lost forever.
Fourthly, if no agreement on limiting greenhouse gas emissions is reached at global level, and the European Union is determined to move forward on its own, compensatory taxes should be imposed at the Union's border. This should apply in particular in those sectors in which competition is already seriously affected as manufacturing costs have not taken account of environmental costs.
Whenever possible, the so-called climatic dimension of trade exchange must also be taken into account in bilateral trade exchange agreements between the European Union and third countries.
The same arrangements should apply to ventures supported by the European Investment Bank.
In the case of support by different types of undertakings, these arrangements should also be implemented by national agencies charged with guaranteeing export credits and direct investment.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, Al Gore claims that the debate on global warming is over and that it has been proved beyond doubt that human activity is responsible for this.
I suggested recently in committee that the sun's enormous influence on the earth's climate over millions of years could not be ignored in this debate, and that the sequence of long ice ages, interspersed with short interglacial periods, was the most likely explanation.
I received a very hostile reception.
However, the chairman, Mr Markov, insisted that it was not appropriate to urge excision of a view that happened to conflict with current orthodoxy.
Let us remember that, when Galileo declared in the 17th century that the earth revolved around the sun, he was threatened with torture by the Catholic Church for daring to contradict the accepted fact that the earth was at the centre of the universe.
It took the church until 1992 to agree that Galileo had been right.
The only CO2 at issue in the global warming debate is the trivial amount produced by burning fossil fuels.
That comparatively small amount is the only modern and unusual addition to the vast quantities constantly being produced by all living things and all decaying organic matter, and through volcanic activity.
Before we risk ruining the world's economies with carbon emission taxes and the like, please let us reopen the debate and make absolutely sure who is right.
(DE) Madam President, honourable colleagues, as we deal with this draft report, we should concentrate on the real issue, namely trade and climate change.
Unfortunately, in his first draft, the rapporteur did not manage to produce positive economic and socially compatible proposals as to how we can tackle this problem.
In my view, there is far too much confusion, both by the rapporteur and in the report itself, between the issue of trade and the issue of transport.
It is not world trade that is the problem, nor the worldwide division of labour; and nor is the problem the fact that thanks to trade, regions that have been or are still poor are now experiencing economic growth.
No, our problem, surely, is that transport is not efficient and ecologically friendly enough.
Our problem, surely, is that due to poverty or low levels of prosperity in some regions of the world, many people and countries cannot afford the climate protection that is necessary and makes ecological and economic sense.
It is only by integrating these regions into world trade that we will achieve a situation in which these people can afford environmental and climate protection.
If you face a daily struggle for survival, you are not going to be thinking about environmental or climate protection.
It is only through well-functioning world trade that we will be able to sell our modern technologies around the world and thus make a contribution to protecting the climate.
That is why, in my view, it is more trade, not less trade, that is the proper response to the problems of trade and climate change.
I am therefore most grateful to my colleague Georgios Papastamkos for being able to introduce numerous important themes into the committee debate, and I am most grateful that the ALDE Group has tabled various amendments for tomorrow's plenary that move in this direction.
I would like to conclude with a request.
In this report, we unfortunately have several points where we have discredited our social market economy.
We should find a way to remove these outbursts against our economic system, which has brought prosperity and social security to so many people.
I would be grateful if the groups could show some creativity here so that our Group can also vote for this report.
(PT) I must start by congratulating the rapporteur on his detailed work on such a complex issue as the relationship between trade and climate change.
Europe has been a global leader in the fight against the worsening of climate change.
However, in order to be credible and achieve the proposed objectives, it must reinforce the coherence of its various policies on this issue.
In particular, a European trade policy, one of the oldest common policies of the Union, must not and cannot be forgotten.
This balance between environment and trade is not easy to achieve and is not being sufficiently achieved, particularly within the World Trade Organization.
In the European Union, meeting the climate change objectives requires an effective effort to reduce carbon emissions which will in turn impact on the conditions of production and the respective costs of an increasing number of productive sectors.
It is time to ask ourselves whether, in a world of global competition and faced with the problem of the planet's survival, it makes sense for this effort to combat climate change to be, more than anything, a European effort?
Is it acceptable for the emissions of so many sectors to be moved away from European soil to areas of the globe which are environmentally less protected?
Can environmental violation be a legitimate source of competitiveness?
Is it acceptable for different environmental compliance rules to exist for the main tradable goods at world level depending on the area of the globe where they are produced?
I think not with regard to all these questions.
We need to find a balance between the environment, including climate change, and trade which will guarantee a collective, proportional and equitable effort, without excluding anyone, particularly not the main global trade partners.
A new balance between the development of the vast impoverished areas of the globe and the planet's survival must be quickly found through dialogue, mutual respect and determination faced with converging objectives.
The effort must be global and we can only hope that, in December in Bali, this process will begin in a serious and committed manner.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that commercial transactions at European and global level have increased significantly in recent years.
While this development encourages the economic development of nations, it has a significant impact on climate change.
I am therefore expressing, on my own account, my concern about this particular problem.
We need to decide how trade policy can contribute positively towards solving the problem of climate change.
The target we have set for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 is quite ambitious.
I hope we will win this bet, because the cost of losing will be enormous.
Here I would like to underline the Commissioner's contribution and congratulate him on all his initiatives and efforts in this direction.
Greater support and a greater effort are needed in the transition to means of transport which are more environmentally-friendly; the promotion of industry which is more climate-friendly; the development of new technologies and the creation of financial disincentives for activities with a negative impact on the climate; effective cooperation between the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and the European Union; and ongoing consultation and the participation of civil society and non-governmental organisations operating in the environmental sector.
The European Parliament has an important role to play.
I hope the results of the Bali Conference, in December, will send the optimistic messages which we are all hoping for.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 November 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FI) It is vital to mainstream climate policy for the fight against climate change to be productive.
The report being considered is a valuable one indeed and inspires a very necessary discussion: trade policy must form a part of climate policy because growing trade is resulting in more greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, trade policy is very specifically effective as a form of climate policy and may, therefore, be part of the solution.
First of all, trade policy has great value in the promotion of environmental technologies. International trade is one of the most effective tools for the transfer of technology transfer.
The role of the World Trade Organization is an important one, because it is essential to remove tariffs on green goods and improve the rules on intellectual property.
On the other hand, it is intolerable that the WTO still endorses distorting subsidies on fossil fuels, for example, thus obstructing the path to green technology.
For no very good reason the report makes much of the success of Kyoto.
Kyoto is full of loopholes, which are in fact aggravating the situation.
Unilateral actions distort competition and lead to carbon leakage.
Moving emissions from one place to another is not cutting them.
Besides, solidarity towards people in developing countries is not to cause their environment to be contaminated.
Kyoto leads to environmental exploitation.
Climate change is a global phenomenon through and through and calls for global solutions.
A global emissions trading scheme with the compulsory commitment of all the industrialised countries and rising economies is therefore absolutely essential.
I completely sympathise with the concern expressed in the report about the fate of forests with the increase in trade.
The EU needs to pay special attention to the risk posed by biofuels to forest sinks.
The targets for renewable energy sources set by the Commission must not be allowed to accelerate climate change either.
Referendum in Venezuela (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the referendum in Venezuela.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the National Electoral Council has announced that a popular referendum on the proposal for constitutional reform made by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the National Assembly will be held on 2 December 2007.
On that day, the people of Venezuela will have the opportunity to exercise their democratic right of decision on the proposed changes that would shape important aspects of the political, institutional, economic and social life of that country.
The Commission is closely following the ongoing constitutional reform process in Venezuela, as well as in other countries in the region.
It stresses the importance it attaches to the fact that each new constitution or constitutional reform should reinforce democracy and the rule of law.
It also believes that each constitution should be based on a broad popular consensus and adequately reflect the plurality and diversity of each nation.
Constitutions should unite people and not divide them.
The Commission is following with interest the intensive debate on constitutional reform in Venezuela.
It has observed that some sectors of Venezuelan society are in favour of the proposed changes, but also takes note of the strong opposition to the reform expressed by other sectors.
Those sectors are voicing concerns, notably on aspects of the reform which they consider would - if the reform were approved - entail an increased concentration of powers in the hands of the President, a weakening of democratic control mechanisms and of the existing institutions and a threat to democratic pluralism.
Others consider that what is proposed goes beyond a mere reform and implies modification of the fundamental structure of the state.
The Commission is aware of the situation and is paying due attention to it.
While it considers that it is the people of Venezuela who should themselves pronounce on the reform proposal, it also stresses the importance it attaches to the campaign on the reform being conducted in an open manner and in a spirit of mutual respect.
It also expresses the hope that the referendum will take place in a peaceful atmosphere and in a transparent manner.
In that context, it is worth noting that the recent electoral observation mission sent by the European Union to the last presidential election in Venezuela considered that the electoral process in general complied with international standards and national legislation and underlined the peaceful environment in which the elections were held.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, the American continent as a whole is the closest to Europe in terms of values, ideals, vision of the world and individuals, their dignity and their rights.
What we call the West to my mind clearly includes Latin America.
In recent years there have been some positive trends in Latin America as a whole, bringing it ever closer to Europe: pluralist elections and democratic consolidation, growth with more balanced and open economic policies, regional integration processes and very important agreements with the European Union.
However, there are exceptions in this positive panorama: in addition to the traditional one of Cuba, that of Venezuela is now emerging.
This country is going through a process of increasing authoritarianism in which freedoms are being restricted, the opposition is being harassed and fear is being created among the people who even suspect that their vote is no longer secret.
In this House we regret the closure last May of Radio Caracas TelevisiÃ³n.
On Sunday a constitutional referendum will hurriedly be held which aims to introduce an authoritarian and exclusive regime and which proposes to establish what is being termed 'Socialism for the 21st century'.
An until recently very close associate of President ChÃ¡vez has even termed the process a 'coup'.
I regret that an election observation mission from the European Union has not been officially invited.
What is more, this referendum is being held in a climate of violence and tension which has even cost the lives of students who also reject the plan.
In recent years, physical and legal insecurity, kidnaps and land occupations have also increased.
As a result, for example, many of my Galician compatriots have left the country at the average rate of one thousand people per year since President ChÃ¡vez came to power.
Emboldened by high oil prices, President ChÃ¡vez is looking for followers and allies in other countries, he is making a lot of noise in international forums and he is intervening in the sovereign affairs of his neighbours.
As President Uribe has said, President ChÃ¡vez wants to set the continent alight.
His attitude is a problem for the democratic stability of Venezuela and for harmony and integration processes in Latin America as a whole.
He is also disrupting the relations which have been expanding in the last decade between countries on that continent and the European Union.
Bearing in mind the next Lima Summit, the attitude of President ChÃ¡vez represents a serious challenge which must be carefully considered by the European Union and its Member States.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, the first thing we have to do in this Parliament, in line with its own tradition of respect and non-interference, is not inflame the situation further, either in continents or third countries, as a result of our own words.
Mr MillÃ¡n Mon is right to say that Latin America has developed very positively in recent years, both politically - as the vast majority of its countries are democratic - and economically, and also, albeit more modestly, in social terms.
Europe has contributed extensively to this development, through its companies, its investments and particularly its development aid which is the highest in that continent.
In this general context, I would not say that there is an exception, but rather that there is a particular situation in Venezuela due to the personality, which is also very particular and very much his own, of President ChÃ¡vez. However, it must not be forgotten - especially not in a democratic institution such as this one - that President ChÃ¡vez has been re-elected three times with large majorities and without any justified suspicions of electoral fraud.
Under these circumstances - that is to say, we are not talking about a dictatorship - we must tread carefully, try to increase dialogue by extending the hand of friendship and also encourage this country, which admittedly is fractured and divided, to engage in internal dialogue, consensus and reconciliation. We must do this in the belief that a country cannot be transformed with a majority of just 60% or 40% and that the rules of the game cannot be changed without a broad consensus involving at least 70% or 80%, as has occurred in other countries around us and in our old continent, in the European Union.
Admittedly, the internal situation is very worrying for the reasons that I have set out: the drift or the suspicion of a drift towards authoritarianism; the concentration of power; the successive loss of the division of powers, and also the reduction in freedom of expression using an instrument barely known in Europe which is termed 'en cadena'. This allows the President or one of his ministers to commandeer, at any time, all the television channels and all the radio transmitters so that the President's messages can be broadcast.
These do not just last a minute or two. In fact, in exceptional cases, they can go on for several hours a day.
In a country where few newspapers are read and where television and radio are the main media, this is a problematic situation.
However, I insist - and I will end on this point - that, faced with this referendum, we must be cautious, offer dialogue, hold out the hand of friendship and try to mediate between the two opposing sides in Venezuela.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Venezuela is a country of exceptional natural beauty and is very rich in natural resources.
It has some of the world's largest deposits of oil, coal, iron and gold.
Despite its natural riches, the majority of Venezuelans have remained very poor, with far too many living in conditions of appalling poverty.
Only a small minority belonging to a rich elite have benefited from the country's riches.
Under those conditions of gross social inequality, it is no wonder that populist politicians like Hugo ChÃ¡vez have emerged as saviours of the poor.
It is also no wonder that Mr ChÃ¡vez's nationalisation programme was welcomed by most Venezuelans.
They saw Hugo ChÃ¡vez as someone who was going to lift them out of the misery of poverty and deprivation.
The same thinking applies to the forthcoming constitutional reform referendum.
I am sure that referendum will secure the necessary popular approval, and it is too late now for public opinion to be changed.
Therefore, what we will in essence have after 2 December is the emergence of another Fidel Castro.
It seems that, just as one totalitarian leader is fading away in Cuba, another is being born in Venezuela.
However, in diagnosing that sad reality, we should, perhaps, also ask whether we in the West are in any way to blame for how things are turning out in Venezuela.
We must do this not just so that we can be morally and politically correct academically, but also so that we can, in practice, prevent similar occurrences in the future.
Sadly, it is apparent that, in our dealings, with Venezuela over the last few years, we have made numerous grave mistakes.
Hugo ChÃ¡vez got to where he is today partly because we have helped him through our foreign policy omissions and commissions.
Therefore, in contemplating our strategy on how to deal with him in the future, let us start by saying 'sorry' to the Venezuelan people.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) I am speaking as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Andean Community. As such, I have been visiting Venezuela one or more times a year.
Since I started going to this country, in other words since the military coup against President ChÃ¡vez, I have been hearing the Venezuelan media screaming against the President, against the dictatorship.
In the hotels I used, even though they had three, four or even five stars, you were not allowed to watch public television, and anyway it is not always possible to do so as it is normally broadcast in a snowy format.
The generals behind the coup still stroll around the largest square in Caracas and President ChÃ¡vez, legally elected, re-elected and re-elected again, has never lifted a finger against them.
Venezuela is one of the countries trying to deal, as peacefully as possible, with the conflicts which are commonplace all over Latin America.
I am not wholly enamoured with all the changes that President ChÃ¡vez has tried to make to the Bolivarian Constitution.
Having said that, as Mr Matsakis stated, it is the people of Venezuela who will decide.
We can certainly make excuses for the way in which we gave the impression that we supported the military coup.
It is true that this has helped radicalise the regime in Venezuela.
I feel, however, that, first and foremost and above all, we ought to respect the decision of the Venezuelan people.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would ask the European right to stop meddling in Venezuela.
The European right does not like Cuba because it says that there are no elections, and yet it does not like Venezuela because there are. In fact, Venezuela is one of the countries in Latin America that has held the most elections, all supervised by the Organization of American States, by the European Union and by foundations as prestigious as the Carter Center.
Ladies and gentlemen of the right, what you do not like is the system.
Stop meddling and respect a sovereign people who are freely exercising their will and who will keep doing so. We should not anticipate events.
Have we not agreed in the European Union, as Commissioner Dimas has said, that the recent presidential elections were held totally fairly?
We must wait and see and respect what the people of Venezuela say without any kind of interference, ladies and gentlemen of the right.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1848 Karl Marx proclaimed Socialism for the 19th century, and it was a disaster.
In 1917 Lenin, with the Russian Revolution, proclaimed Socialism for the 20th century, and it was a disaster.
Various Members of this House emerged from that disaster to join us in freedom.
The problem with Socialism for the 21st century, as proclaimed by President ChÃ¡vez in Venezuela, is that this century is only just beginning and we do not know what will happen.
However, we can imagine that, as in the 19th and 20th centuries, it will also be a disaster.
As a matter of fact, we see it resulting in violence.
It is not the elections that concern us; it is the brutal violence perpetrated by the authorities against the students protesting in Venezuela because they are not recognised as having the right to demonstrate.
Some of these students have died in recent days on the streets of Caracas and other cities.
It is the threats to freedom of expression that concern independent and free journalists throughout Latin America and in particular in Venezuela and which led to the closure of Radio Caracas TelevisiÃ³n.
This is the line that concerns us, and we are right to be concerned as, in the constitutional reform proposed by President ChÃ¡vez, words such as 'decentralisation', 'private initiative', 'freedom of competition' and 'social justice' have given way to words such as 'Socialism', 'Socialist', 'imposition of the Socialist State', 'elimination of the independence of the Central Bank' and 'people's power'.
It is well-known throughout the world that, when someone uses the expression 'people's power', power will be taken away from the people and democracy will be destroyed.
This has happened everywhere that the expression 'people's power' has been used.
'Bolivarian Armed Forces', 'communes', this is the kind of line that should concern us, that has sown instability and violence in recent months and years on the streets of Caracas and that also represents a threat to regional stability if what has recently happened in relations between Venezuela and Colombia should continue.
That is why it is essential that we closely monitor events in Venezuela in solidarity with the democratic parties and civil society fighting for regional stability and firmly defending democracy, but also with great cohesion in the European Union's diplomacy.
(SL) Today we signed the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, thereby expressing our commitment to respect for human dignity, democratic values and the rule of law.
What has been the basis for the successful growth of the European Union internally is also our starting point for developing relations with our partners throughout the world.
The European Union as a whole wants closer and stable cooperation with the countries of Latin America and its regional interconnections.
In view of the specific nature and genuine interests of the countries of Latin America we believe that it is possible to build strategic and long-term relations only in this manner and with those countries with which we can share the same fundamental values and principles.
Political development in Venezuela has recently deviated from the abovementioned course.
It is thereby undermining the dynamics and scope of future cooperation between Latin America and the European Union and the dynamics of integration within Latin America itself.
The referendum on the constitution is polarising Venezuela because the new proposals concentrate political power and will not lead to an open, ideological and democratic society.
We believe in social society, not socialist society, because that dismisses those who think differently.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PT) Unbelievable!
The European Parliament has put on the agenda a Commission statement on the constitutional reform planned for 2 December in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela when what should be on the agenda is a debate on the current attempt to deny all the people of the EU Member States the right to be consulted, by way of a referendum, on the so-called 'constitutional', 'mini', 'simplified', 'reform' or now 'Lisbon' Treaty.
In essence, putting this debate on the agenda is an attempt to respond to those who support and promote an unacceptable and extremely serious policy of interference in and attempted destabilisation of a sovereign state, particularly when this is a process that only the Venezuelan people can decide, by giving their opinion through a referendum (!) on the amendment of their country's Constitution.
Without doubt the Venezuelan Government and people are an example which worries the major financial and economic interests established in the European Union: an example of the assertion of national sovereignty and independence; an example of the realisation of a plan for patriotic emancipation and development; an example of international and anti-imperialist solidarity; an example of what it is worth fighting for and that it is possible to have a fairer, more democratic and peaceful country and world.

Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2006 (debate)
The first item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report for 2006.
President of the Court of Auditors. - (DE) Mr President, Vice-President Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to take part today in your debate on the annual reports of the Court of Auditors for the 2006 financial year.
On 12 November I presented the annual reports to the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, and the following day I presented them to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council.
Let me begin with a brief review of the key messages contained in the annual reports for 2006.
My first point concerns the reliability of the final annual accounts for 2006.
The consolidated financial statements for the 2006 financial year provide a true picture of the assets and liabilities and the financial position of the Communities and the results of their operations in that year with the exception of an overstating, in the statement of assets and liabilities, of accounts payable and of the amount of pre-financing.
The Commission has made further progress in the implementation of accrual accounting, although some weaknesses are still observable.
The Court noted that the Commission has made considerable efforts to eliminate defects in the system of risk management for EU finances.
Some changes are already yielding visible benefits in areas such as the agricultural budget.
I shall move on now to legality and regularity. The Court has once more delivered an unconditional favourable opinion on transactions underlying revenue and commitments as well as payments for administrative expenditure and expenditure under the pre-accession strategy, with the exception of expenditure under the Sapard programme.
In addition, there was a minimal error rate for payments managed and controlled directly by Commission delegations in respect of external actions.
The Court, however, has once again delivered an unfavourable opinion on the legality and regularity of the bulk of EU expenditure transactions. This applies primarily to expenditure under the common agricultural policy that is not subject to the integrated administration and control system - IACS for short - and to expenditure on structural measures and internal policies and to a considerable proportion of expenditure on external actions.
In these areas payments to final beneficiaries are still affected by material error rates, albeit at varying levels.
The Court's observations on the areas of the budget that are subject to shared management are as follows: in the realm of agriculture, to which a budget of EUR 49.8 billion was allocated in 2006, the Court noted a sharp decline in the estimated overall error rate, although the rate is still slightly above the materiality threshold.
If properly applied, IACS, which covers some 70% of agricultural expenditure, can effectively reduce the risk of illegal and irregular expenditure payments.
Financial corrections to agricultural payments, such as those deriving from the Commission's annual clearance decisions in the framework of the balancing procedure, relate to large sums, which the Member States have to repay to the Community budget as corrections or financial penalties because of their failure to establish adequate control systems.
These recoveries to the Community budget continue to be funded by national taxpayers and not by the beneficiaries who have obtained Community resources by irregular means.
Besides highlighting problem areas by citing illustrative cases, the Court also considers it has a duty to flag up developments which may be important for political decision-makers to know about.
For example, the Court pointed out that, while the single-payment system facilitates application and payment procedures, it also has side-effects, such as entitlements being allocated to landlords who have never farmed. While this may be legally permissible, it has perceptibly shifted the focus of EU aid from farm proprietors to landowners.
The new recipients of agricultural subsidies include railway companies, riding stables, stud farms, golf and leisure clubs and local authorities.
Moreover, the legal provisions governing the single-payment system have given Member States wide scope in the allocation of entitlements, which has resulted in unequal treatment of beneficiaries.
With regard to structural measures, to which a total of EUR 32.4 billion was allocated in 2006, the situation prevailing in previous years has not changed.
The Court observed a material rate of error, which it estimated to be at least 12% of the aggregate amount of reimbursements to beneficiaries.
The most common errors involved applications for the reimbursement of ineligible expenditure and failure to carry out a tendering procedure. In addition, documentation substantiating overheads and personnel costs was often missing.
In the view of the Court, the Commission should set a good example in its handling of the expenditure it administers directly, that is to say expenditure on the Union's internal policies and external actions.
Although improvements are discernible, the internal policies administered by the Commission, on which nine billion euros was spent in 2006, were once again subject to a material rate of error. The main reason for this was the payment of reimbursements to beneficiaries who had submitted declarations overstating project costs.
The causes of the errors in the underlying transactions include negligence, insufficient knowledge of rules that are often complex, and applicants' wilful attempts to defraud the EU budget.
In addition, for agricultural expenditure not covered by the IACS and expenditure on structural measures and on internal policies, checks on requests for payment, which are largely based on the information provided by beneficiaries, are in many cases inadequate in terms of frequency and coverage and are often short on quality too.
In past years the Commission has taken action to enhance the recovery system and to improve the protection of the Union's financial interests.
Because of the complexity of its procedures, however, the Commission is still not being reliably informed of the various amounts and recipients of unduly paid funds and of their financial impact on the EU budget.
In fact, only six Member States responded to last November's request from the Commission for a report on the recovery of irregular payments.
In its single-audit model, the Court recommended the establishment of an efficient framework for all internal control systems relating to EU funds.
All such systems should be based on common principles and standards; they should take account of inherent risks as well as striking the right balance between the cost of controls and the benefits they bring.
One of the main innovations of recent times is the obligation imposed on Member States to present annual surveys of their audit and control findings. There are also the voluntary initiatives launched by some national audit bodies to issue national declarations and produce audit reports on the management of EU funds in their respective countries.
The Court takes the view that the national declarations and the national auditing efforts could help to raise awareness in the Member States of the importance of internal control of EU funds.
In its opinion No 6/2007, the Court stated that such national procedures were a means of focusing and demonstrating national accountability for the use of EU funds. Moreover, they can serve to identify rectifiable defects and examples of good practice as well as enhancing transparency and accountability in the realm of financial management.
The Court is also continuing to play an active part in fostering cooperation with the Supreme Audit Institutions in the Member States and is the lead body in a new working group dealing with common auditing standards and comparable auditing criteria designed for the EU context.
This brings me to the conclusions.
In spite of considerable efforts on the part of the Commission to eliminate the weaknesses in the system of risk management for EU funds, the Court has once again delivered an unfavourable opinion on the legality and regularity of transactions in most areas of the budget.
The greatest improvements were observed in relation to the common agricultural policy.
The high error rate in the underlying transactions is due in part to the fact that complicated legal requirements and provisions and unclear eligibility criteria sometimes cause beneficiaries to overstate their costs when claiming reimbursement, but it is also partly due to persistent defects in the realm of internal control.
The basic prerequisite for effective management of budgetary funds is the existence of reliable internal control systems at every administrative level in all Member States and recipient countries.
In my opinion, the people of Europe have a right to proper administration and control of EU funds throughout the Union.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Court's report and the comments from President Weber.
Overall, the Court's Annual Report for 2006 gives a more positive assessment than its 2005 edition.
Thanks to the Court's system of traffic lights, it is now possible to measure progress in detail.
The Court's report sets out, from one spending area to another, where our systems are considered satisfactory and where the errors found are below the Court's materiality threshold of 2%.
Comparing this with previous years, the Commission is pleased that in total the Court has now given its green light to over 40% of total payments, compared to roughly a third last year and only 6% two years ago.
That is real progress towards our common goal of getting a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS).
The Court also reports improvements in internal policies, such as research programmes, and external actions.
The Court said that our 2006 accounts are true and fair in all material respects, except for certain small overstatements, comprising 0.13% of operating expenditure.
The Court recognises that the Commission has made considerable efforts to address the weaknesses in the management of the risks to EU funds.
Overall, though, there is, again, a negative DAS concerning the legality and regularity of transactions.
While we are moving in the right direction, I would therefore like to focus on the major stumbling block on our road to a positive DAS.
The big remaining challenge is to ensure that structural policies are properly implemented.
For spending on structural policies - EUR 32.4 billion in 2006 - the situation remains similar to previous years, and the Court has again identified the material level of error.
The most frequent errors were claims for ineligible expenditure and failure to carry out tender procedures, as well as a lack of evidence to support the calculation of the overheads or the staff costs involved.
The Court goes on to say that it is reasonably confident that at least 12% of structural and cohesion fund payments in 2006 should not have been reimbursed.
We agree that there are real problems in this area.
The Commission's own synthesis report for 2006 stated that it did not have confidence in the systems for managing Structural Funds in parts of Italy, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Reserves were expressed by the directors-general in their annual activity reports.
The Court looked at a sample of 19 regions in 2006, and found none to be fully effective.
The Court found various control systems to be ineffective in England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovenia and Spain, and for the Interreg project between Austria and Hungary.
We believe things will improve under the new legislation, but this will not reduce the continuing high risk for payments made to the 2000-2006 programmes, where the situation remains critical up to their closure in 2009-2010.
We need to act together on this state of affairs.
I have written to the Council President, the Member States and the European Parliament, setting out the additional efforts the Commission will make.
At the Ecofin meeting earlier this month, I also called on Member States to fulfil their responsibility to provide annual summaries of audit and declarations by 15 February 2008.
That was the deal we reached with Parliament and the Council when adopting the revised Financial Regulation.
The annual summary has to be more than just another reporting exercise without added value.
It must provide real analytical information for the Commission to use in giving assurance to the Court and Parliament about the state of controls in each Member State.
The 2006 discharge hearing that the Committee on Budgetary Control has organised for 18 December 2007 for the main Structural Fund Commissioners will be attended by representatives of the national budgetary control committees.
The Commission welcomes that innovation and hopes it will help mobilise commitment at national level to improve the management of EU funds.
We need to follow a policy of warn, solve or suspend.
The Commission has stated its intention to suspend Structural Fund payments where the Commission cannot obtain the necessary assurance that Member State systems are working well.
That may lead the Commission to take a few unpopular decisions, but it has reached the conclusion that progress will be too slow if we do not display a sense of urgency.
Before concluding, let me say a few words about how the media covered this year's report.
Over the last two weeks, the Commission has been asked by journalists to comment on two main points.
First, it has been asked to comment on the Court's findings that golf clubs and other bodies not formally associated with farming received EU subsidies last year.
An otherwise serious newspaper ran the headline 'EU aid for poor misspent on golf clubs'.
It managed to get three facts wrong in only eight words.
Let me clarify.
Firstly, farm subsidies are not aid for the poor; secondly, the aid in question was not spent on golf clubs, but as subsidies for eligible agricultural activities - in these cases on adjoining land owned by different owners.
It follows that, thirdly, the money was not misspent, but was in fact both legal and regular expenditure, which the Court is not questioning.
Rather, the Court has drawn attention to a policy issue and to the end result of an agreed policy: the introduction of the single-payment scheme.
We welcome such discussions and, as honourable Members will be aware, this Commission has worked hard to achieve full transparency on the beneficiaries of EU funds, which it believes is leading to better-informed policy discussions, such as the common agricultural policy health checks launched by my colleague, Marian Fischer Boel, earlier this month.
The same approach lies behind the Commission's initiative of sending the supreme audit institutions in all Member States a complete list of all the payments made to recipients in that Member State.
Regrettably, in some media reports, this golf club issue has entirely overshadowed the Court's statement that agriculture is an area in which the Commission and the Member States have made most progress, and for which the Court came very close to giving an overall green light.
That is why I felt a need to clarify this today.
The second issue is that 12% of Structural Funds, according to the Court, should not have been reimbursed.
Most journalists have picked up on the Court seeing this as a problem when almost EUR 4 billion was paid out last year.
This point also needs explaining.
There is no clear picture as to whether the funds were lost or stolen, and whether the errors are systemic or one-off errors.
It therefore falls to the Commission to explain the 12%.
In this speech I have given some explanations, and pointed to some of the problems we face and the action we intend to take.
My colleagues, Commissioners HÃŒbner and Å pidla, will elaborate further in their Committee on Budgetary Control hearings next month.
As a final remark, I wish to stress that, despite some of the media coverage, we believe the Court report does in fact help us to focus on the real issues.
The Commission is working hard to ensure that improvements are made on these key points.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, I am pleased that you are attending this debate, underlining the importance which the Parliament attaches to the auditing of its accounts, and that Vice-President Kallas and President Weber are also here, but where is the Council?
Where is the speaker who can tell us what the Council is doing with all the suggestions and comments that the President of the Court of Auditors, Vice-President Kallas and I myself have been putting to the Council?
Thank you, Mr President, for attending this debate.
(Applause from certain quarters)
I would like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for its excellent work, especially chapter 2 of its report, which is very well presented.
You are getting better at this job all the time and are helping not only the Parliament, but also the man in the street, to realise what it costs to run the European Union.
Farmers should be congratulated because now that we are reducing direct payments to them they have managed to improve their management of the money they receive significantly.
However, such praise cannot be heaped on structural funds.
It is now three years since this Parliament said that the Council, the great absentee, should be involved in order to account for how it spends the greater part of the budget which it controls.
One thing is clear: it is now obligatory, under the new Financial Regulation, for Member States to submit their summary national management declarations.
It is not an option, it is mandatory.
They have to do this before mid-February next year; and as we know - and here we agree with Mr Kallas - the Member States are unwilling to do so: it seems as though they are not required to present accounts.
If they have an obligation, they should be the first ones to set an example.
You said that only six Member States are accounting for how they recover funds.
That is scandalous, it deserves a headline: only six Member States are telling us what they are doing about recovering funds which they have misused.
That really is a scandal.
To sum up, I would like to tell you that this Parliament will continue its work; may you continue with yours.
You and Mr Kallas have our full support in continuing to strive towards the goal of a positive DAS, and we take our share of the blame for all those particularly burdensome procedures; we are to blame there because sometimes we ask for the impossible.
We offer our collaboration in order to simplify procedures as far as possible.
Thank you, Mr Weber, for your magnificent report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the situation as regards the Union's financial management is mixed.
I welcome the efforts made by the Commission as regards agriculture.
The Court reports a marked overall reduction in errors in agricultural expenditure.
That should be welcomed as a major success.
On the other hand, there is little positive said about the Structural Funds.
The Court is of the opinion that control systems in the Member States are generally ineffective or moderately effective.
That is why Parliament's call for national management declarations as an instrument to improve national accountability is more relevant than ever.
I am also very disappointed that the internal control system within the Commission is still not all it should be, seven years after the reform.
There are significant weaknesses, and I welcome the Court's solid analysis in chapter two of its annual report.
Let us look to the future.
The Court has proposed interinstitutional discussions on the concept of 'tolerable risk of error'.
I welcome that initiative.
Parliament and the Commission have already, in different ways, given some follow-up to this proposal.
When will the Council - which is not present today - give its view on this?
The Reform Treaty states that: 'The regulations shall lay down the control and audit obligations of the Member States in the implementation of the budget and the resulting responsibilities.'
Parliament will carefully follow the implementation of that new rule.
As regards the Union's audit arrangements, I am not going to repeat what I said in Luxembourg on 18 October 2007.
I just want to stress that Parliament is very interested in the outcome of the ongoing peer review at the Court.
I congratulate Mr Weber, and in particular Mr Engwirda, for having been able to start that exercise.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Court of Auditors for its new system of reporting to the European Parliament.
For years we have been asking whether the errors in the various chapters might not be quantified rather precisely.
For years the Court said that it was not possible and now, happily, we see for the first time that the Court of Auditors too can change its mind; it now uses a 'traffic light' system of reporting - red, yellow and green.
We welcome that very much and hope that in years to come the system will be refined further so that we can see where things have been improved.
On the matter of improvements - Mr Kallas has made the point already - the Commission can of course be proud, because three years ago only 6% of expenditure was deemed to have been legal.
Now the figure is 40% and the Commission came close to giving agriculture the green light.
That is progress.
The big question is, does the man in the street think enough progress has been made?
Well, I can tell you, the answer is no.
It beggars belief that the Statement of Assurance still is not positive after so many years, and it is a reason for great concern.
An even greater problem is the Structural Funds; 12% is of course far too high.
It would be good if in future reports the Court of Auditors could explain exactly where this 12% comes from.
From incorrect form-filling?
Are these real errors?
When I hear, out in the field, how hard it is to obtain money from the Structural Funds, I find it scarcely credible that the controls are not adequate, because more and more I am hearing people say 'someone else can have my share - it is far too complicated being involved with the Funds'.
At least that is what I am hearing in some of the Dutch provinces.
Now as we start the discharge procedure for the Commission, I think what matters most is this: what has the Commission done in response to Parliament's earlier recommendations in its resolutions on discharge?
Because does the Treaty not say that the Commission must take all appropriate steps to act on these discharge resolutions as far as possible?
To my mind there are two things in them that need to be spelled out more clearly - not just in a resolution but in the Treaty too in the section on the multiannual budget, regarding the declarations by Member States. Other people have also made reference to this; two Parliament resolutions state that the commissioners must sign off the declarations submitted annually in whatever form by the directors-general.
To Parliament this means that the responsibility lies not with the Commission as a collegiate body, but that commissioners are individually responsible for their budgets.
I would be glad to hear more about this.
Lastly, the new Treaty says that the Commission and Member States are jointly responsible.
In the light of these Member States' declarations it would be interesting to know how the Commission is preparing to implement the new Treaty now and in the future.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Members of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2006 the European budget was about EUR 106 billion.
Admittedly, that is only 1% of the gross national product of the 27 Member States, but it is still a tidy sum.
It is money coughed up by you and me and all taxpayers and so it has to be subjected to proper scrutiny.
That is one of the European Parliament's core responsibilities.
Now for the thirteenth time in a row we see that the Court of Auditors refuses to guarantee the total legality and regularity of this expenditure.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is no minor occurrence.
It is cause for some indignation.
It is a serious warning to the Commission but also to the Member State governments that they need to do something.
Karel Pinxten, the Belgian Member of the Court of Auditors, wrote about it in De Tijd and Echo de la Bourse, saying that if an internal or external auditor of a listed company with assets the size of the EU budget refused to sign off the accounts in this way it would send shockwaves through the financial markets.
He is only too right, and we cannot just let this rest.
What are the sticking points?
Agriculture, still the most important budget heading, at about EUR 50 billion.
The improvement on that is unquestionable, thanks chiefly to operation of the Integrated Administration and Control System.
But let us be clear on this, ladies and gentlemen, some Member States, notably Greece, are refusing to be part of the system.
So this money is being managed by the Member State administrations and I think we should definitely show Greece the red card here.
We should repeat our call for the payment of agricultural monies to Greece to be suspended until such time as Greece comes into line.
The second problem concerning agriculture is the payment - Mr Weber alluded to it and Mr Kallas picked up on it - of agriculture monies to golf clubs, railway companies, stud farms and landowners who are manifestly not real farmers and are pocketing money from the agriculture budget.
And these are usually members of the aristocracy or royalty.
There is a little game of 'oh yes it is, oh no it isn't' going on here: Mr Weber says it is true, Mr Kallas says it is not.
The European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control held a hearing at which Mrs Fischer Boel, the Agriculture Commissioner, said that all this was an exaggeration and played down the whole thing.
I would now like to hear Mr Kallas and Mr Weber giving us answers as to the truth of the matter.
Can the Court of Auditors substantiate its claims?
Does it stand by them?
The second large budget heading is still the Structural Funds.
Twelve per cent of these monies ought not really to have been paid, according to the Court of Auditors' report.
That is not good enough.
We have to do something about that.
Hence our call to Member States, to the Member State governments, Mr President, because part of the responsibility is theirs.
80% of the European funds is managed by them.
So I repeat here the insistence of Parliament, of the plenary, that they must sign a declaration to the effect that European monies have been properly spent, and so fulfil their political responsibilities.
Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have done so.
Where are the other Member State governments?
Where is Belgium, France, Germany?
Should they not also discharge their political responsibilities?
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, once again it is that time of the year when the Court of Auditors gives a negative opinion on the legality and relevance of the previous year's expenditure.
In the spring it will be time for Parliament to grant discharge in respect of the parties concerned, despite the negative report.
At least that has been the practice in recent years, except for one year when there was an election.
I would like to draw your attention to Diagrams V and VI in the Annex to the Court of Auditors' report, which are for calculating Member States' net contributions.
Member States' tariffs, including those charged on goods shipped to other Member States, have been included under traditional own resources. This gives a misleading picture of the actual net contribution made by some Member States, particularly the Netherlands and Belgium, especially when the unreasonably large 25% tariff commission is taken into account.
It is also hard to accept a method of calculation, which apparently originates with the Commission, which does not include administrative expenditure in the Union's expenditure in this context.
The audit numbers purely and simply do not tell the whole truth on the use of resources, therefore: they also comprise political elements.
It is a positive sign that the country which has not applied the monitoring and administration system for agricultural expenditure properly is mentioned by name, i.e. Greece.
The examples of the misuse of agricultural payments the President of the Court of Auditors cited in his presentation speech need to be corrected.
The problems were not just about golf clubs, Commissioner Kallas.
A good example of the positive influence the auditors' recommendations has had is the attention given to the remuneration paid to Members' assistants.
The revised rules are plainly far too strict, but better that than permitting neglect.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, so for the thirteenth year running the Court of Auditors has rejected the implementation of the EU budget.
Why has that happened?
Are the politicians, bureaucrats and citizens of the EU notorious fraudsters?
Of course not!
The problem is that the EU wants to regulate in detail what happens in a region with 23 countries and half a billion inhabitants.
It is this that opens the door to fraud, abuse and error.
The entire organisation needs to be reformed from the bottom up.
There are two ways to go.
Firstly, we must move from perverse detailed regulation to systems in which poor Member States get aid without detailed stipulations on how it is to be used.
Secondly, we must ensure that the guilty are identified.
This in turn requires maximum transparency, that whistleblowers should be treated as heroes, not traitors, and that journalists should be welcome to scrutinise the EU's stewardship.
None of these three requirements are in fact met.
A relevant example is the fate of journalist Hans-Martin Tillack.
He detected fraud in Eurostat but was himself charged with offences by OLAF.
He lost his case in the Belgian court system and in the European Court of Justice, but now he has been cleared by the European Court of Human Rights.
The EU's role in this sad story shows how far we have to go if we want to change its nature as a bureaucratic establishment.
Is there the will to do that?
I doubt it.
(DE) Mr despotic President, the rule of law, democracy and control based on the principle of equality would be a bulwark against despotism, yet these are the very things that are lacking here.
This annual report from the European Court of Auditors may, however, be of some help and may yet put some things right.
Once again I refer specifically to the facts which, under your responsibility, Mr Weber, have thankfully been placed on record at long last in points 10.9 to 10.12 inclusive.
They are a slap on the wrist for the European Parliament.
In that part of its report the Court observes that Parliament's control of Members' expenditure is extremely inadequate and sets out a catalogue of omissions.
What are the practical implications?
It means, Mr President, Mr Secretary-General of this House, that undesirable individuals are singled out, Mr Herbert BÃ¶sch, that a cowardly report is made to OLAF and then, after years of investigation, it emerges that there was nothing at all - no fraud, absolutely nothing.
But here, where there really was something to be found - and you said yourself, Mr Weber, that only 22% of all expenditure was properly processed - nobody looked.
And that is despotic behaviour.
People in this House, including the President and the Secretary-General, Mr RÃžmer, know that at least EUR 80 million in Members' expenditure is not covered by the proper supporting documentation.
Why is that not investigated?
Why are appropriate steps not taken?
Why are various deadlines continually extended?
The things that are happening here - and let me reiterate my thanks to the Court of Auditors for putting their finger on them - lead to a despotic system and to this body here that cannot seriously be described as a parliament.
And then those who are responsible take to their heels.
This cannot go on.
I make the following appeal to Parliament and to you in the Court of Auditors: please investigate these cases in detail and find a solution.
It is a fact that a great deal of real fraud lies below the surface.
(DE) Mr President, I have learned to put up with a lot from Mr Martin in this House, but I must protest against the description 'cowardly report'.
I would be very grateful if the record could be put straight on this point, for I believe Mr Martin is the last one who has the right to make such accusations.
Mr President, I was going to end my speech by saying that the discharge report provides a wonderful source for anti-European propaganda, but since that is what Mr Hans-Peter Martin has just said I will instead start by saying it, and that I am glad Mr BÃ¶sch intervened.
I would like to make three points.
The first is a general point, which is to congratulate the Court of Auditors on its report.
Since it is a better report than last year's report we should also congratulate the Commission.
I like the system of traffic lights.
For simple MEPs like myself it gives quite a good picture of what is going well and what is not going well.
Nevertheless, we in the European Parliament, as always, have three possibilities.
The first is to approve and give discharge to the Commission, the second is to delay, and the third is to reject.
We must bear that in mind at the start of every debate.
My second point concerns the policies, and firstly the common agricultural policy (CAP).
My congratulations on that. The only problem there seems to be with Greece, as many have noted.
The golf course problem, as has already been said, is not really a problem.
It has been over-exaggerated by the media.
I am not saying this solely because I used to play for the Finnish national golf team, and have no direct vested interest!
The other area is structural policies, where there is an estimated 12% error.
That can be improved upon.
There are also the so-called 'RALs' or restes Ã  liquider, which amount to EUR 130 billion.
The Commission must work hard on that area.
My third and final point is that the discharge procedure provides an easy target for anti-EU propaganda, as we have just witnessed, and also that there is indeed some bad news in this report, which is that not everything is in order and that there is room for improvement.
However, the good news is that there has already been improvement.
We have reliable accounts and we have achieved improvements on the CAP.
Also, the Commission should be congratulated for getting a green light on its administration.
I would therefore call for a critical, but constructive, debate on the discharge procedure with the distant hope of there being a positive DAS in 2009.
(DA) Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for an excellent report and a good presentation here today.
It is clear that it is an incredibly useful instrument in our work to ensure that EU citizens' money is managed well and in a legitimate and appropriate manner.
Unfortunately, the report's general conclusion is unsatisfactory.
It is clear that when it has not been possible to provide a positive audit statement for 13 years in a row, there is cause for deep, deep criticism.
Unfortunately, it indicates that there is no control over taxpayers' money, and unfortunately it indicates that here in Parliament, together with the Commission and the Member States, we have a major task ahead of us.
We need to do things better.
Things must be done better.
In the Committee on Budgetary Control the annual procedure is now underway - that is, we are consulting the relevant commissioners and thoroughly reviewing the documents that are now available to us.
Only when we have completed this process will we be able to say to what extent we can give what is technically known as a 'discharge' - in other words, the extent to which we approve the accounts and the implementation of the budgets for 2006.
There are some arguments in favour of doing this: there has been progress in some areas.
However, unfortunately there are also some very, very serious criticisms, and consequently some very serious arguments against approving the accounts for 2006.
Allow me to begin with the positive aspects.
Fortunately, it has been the case that in the agricultural sector things are going very well, as has been mentioned by other Members, and as both the Court of Auditors and Mr Kallas mentioned in their contributions.
The system referred to as an 'integrated financial control system' has proved to be effective.
It must be said that in the areas where it has been implemented there has been good financial control.
We can look citizens in the eye and say that the money they have paid in taxes has been managed well and appropriately.
In the case of Greece, where this system has not been implemented properly, I believe that the Commission has acted responsibly by saying that it will suspend payments.
This is both good and positive.
In the research sector too there is good reason to be positive.
It is almost a textbook example.
Over the last year, we have certainly highlighted some criticisms, which Commissioner PotoÄnik has subsequently taken into account, and naturally this is the way in which we will work.
It is certainly a very good thing we are not here to be populist, as some members would like to be.
We are not here to run errands for the EU's opponents; we are here to highlight the points that are worthy of criticism and come up with good and constructive proposals for solutions.
That said, there are huge problems relating to the Structural Funds.
We have not been given an explanation of the 12% that you mentioned, Mr Kallas.
It is possible that there is an explanation.
We hope that there is.
However, we have not received such an explanation.
Unfortunately, we can also see that it is of course unsatisfactory that the control systems are being labelled as ineffective in all cases investigated by the Court of Auditors.
In addition, we must say that there is also a lack of control in connection with foreign policy concerning the EUR 1 billion that is being used jointly with other institutions in international trust funds.
In conclusion, I will say that there has to be some very clear answers.
If we are to recommend discharge, there must be some very good explanations.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, we Greens commend the work of the Court of Auditors.
We need the information it provides, but we regret that many areas of activity have seen no improvement for years, because these findings bring the European Union into disrepute.
We have no wish to be fobbed off any longer; what we want is efficiency at long last.
Mr Kallas cut a fairly conciliatory figure today, but when the content of the Court of Auditors' report became public, he called it too harsh and also attacked the Member States.
That was not a wise move on the part of the Commission, for it bears political responsibility, and we expect the Commission to exercise that responsibility and to ensure that improvements finally materialise.
We Greens have serious doubts as to whether we can grant discharge for the 2006 budget, and what we have just heard may well have political consequences for certain Commissioners too.
That is why we urge the Commission to change its budgetary practices and start making significant improvements.
Mr President, we have a baker's dozen! We have now reached 13 years of unapproved accounts.
It is not new auditors that are required, but a new payments system.
It never ceases to amaze me how many politicians in this House, and the one in Westminster, are prepared in good conscience not only to continue to tolerate the parlous state of the EU accounts, but to continue to increase the amount of taxpayers' money given to the EU.
As usual, we get the same round of excuses for incompetence and turning a blind eye, the principal one being to put the blame on the Member States, but that just will not wash.
How can the European Commission hand over money to the Member States without seeing paperwork confirming how and where it is spent?
I cannot imagine any other professional organisation allowing this to happen, and for so long.
If Member States are not prepared to provide the necessary paperwork - i.e. receipts and cheques - then the financial tap should be turned off.
In fact, the tap should be turned off at both ends.
If the EU is not prepared to put its house in order, then the politicians at Westminster should stop pouring taxpayers' money into the EU bucket, which still seems to have more holes than a colander!
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, we have already tolerated a highly alarming and unacceptable situation for 13 years.
The Commission and the Member States manage taxpayers' money badly and illegally.
The European Court of Auditors' Report clearly shows that the Commission and the Member States proceed negligently and are not thoroughly familiar with the rules of budgetary expenditure.
Now there are also suspicions of attempts to misuse money from the Union's budget.
Completely contrary to Commission regulations and the laws of individual states, public tender procedures are not carried out, claims are made for payment of ineligible expenditure, recipients are unable to support the legitimacy of overheads or staff costs, while controls are also faltering.
Ladies and gentlemen, if the citizens whose money we are so shamelessly squandering managed their own firms and households like this, the European Union would be full of socially excluded, homeless people.
Now I am asking the Commission and the Council to pull themselves together and start to regard taxpayers' money as if it were their own.
This is the only way we can strengthen trust in the European integration process.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Weber, ladies and gentlemen, reports from audit offices are always interesting and important.
That applies especially to Europe, for the prudent and efficient use of European funds is always the subject of particularly close public attention.
The report rightly focuses most sharply on the use of funds in the Member States.
A great deal certainly remains to be done there with regard to the structural funds in particular.
This, however, should not take our eyes off the expenditure practice of our own institutions, especially the Commission and the Council.
It is in the realm of directly managed expenditure that there is most room for improvement on the part of the Commission.
The Commission, in short, is not only the guardian of the treaties; it must also be a paragon of sound financial management.
When I look at the shift in agricultural policy, beginning with subsidies and extending to the promotion of landscape conservation, I do wonder whether the aim here is perhaps to subsidise equestrian-sports clubs and golf clubs.
Such an aim is out of tune with the real purpose of agricultural support.
Buildings policy continues to give the Court of Auditors plenty to think about, whether it be the extension to the seat of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg or the Council and Parliament buildings in Brussels.
The Court of Justice rightly pursues a consistent approach of exposing uncomfortable truths, particularly in cases where tendering procedures have been flawed or non-existent.
It surely cannot be right that the Court of Justice has to foot the bill but is not involved in formulating the contract and putting it out to tender.
Let me take this opportunity in passing to remind the Commission of its answer to my written question of 2 August on this matter.
It simply creates a bad general impression if the local authority of every little municipality in the EU has to issue an EU-wide call for tenders before it can award any contract worth more than EUR 200 000, whereas the European institutions themselves can casually dispense with tendering procedures for contracts worth millions.
Our citizens cannot understand that.
I would also like to address the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, for each of them must also present the report we have requested.
May I also ask the Council to ensure that increases in operational expenditure on the common foreign and security policy are not slipped in under the heading of administrative expenditure.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Court of Auditors, especially its president, Hubert Weber, who is coming to the end of his term of office and with whom we, the Socialists in the Committee on Budgetary Control, have enjoyed excellent cooperation.
I want to thank him very much for his work and I especially want to highlight the work the Court has done on many specific issues, such as in helping to clarify European Union policy on export refunds.
I would like to say I am very concerned about the European Union external aid budget.
A large proportion of the EUR 5 billion we spent in 2006, around EUR 1 billion, was spent by multilateral funds.
In addition to this a lot of other funding was spent by certain international organisations funded by the European Commission - I would like to know on what basis and whether this was authorised, legitimate and transparent.
Although we already asked for detailed figures and clarifications last year, the Commission continues to flout the Financial Regulation and has still not provided us with a report on how European money is being spent in many Middle Eastern countries.
At the same time, the European Commission refuses to listen to us when we say that the European Agency for Reconstruction has been an essential mechanism for ensuring the visibility of the European presence in the Western Balkans, ensuring European political leadership and ensuring sound and effective financial management.
It now wants to close it down even though it is currently the only available instrument for carrying out work that we believe to be effective in situations that are anything but transparent.
This is unacceptable and I would like to say, particularly to Vice-President Kallas, that he cannot simply turn his back on this, and that in the discharge procedure we are going to closely scrutinise everything in this budget, including all the organisations which are not using funds in a transparent way.
(PL) Mr President, the auditing and control of EU funds in the Member States is a basic requisite for efficient and transparent management of Community budget resources.
The Commission's latest proposals are worrying, however, since they may seriously affect beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Commission wishes to make the procedures stricter and impose penalties for tender irregularities, often without objective reasons.
I am referring to the document entitled 'Structural Funds: Guidelines on the principles, criteria and indicative scales to be applied by Commission departments in determining financial corrections'.
The EU proposal for penalties is particularly threatening to local and regional authorities.
We cannot have a situation in which, as Members have already pointed out, the EU funds golf courses in the 15 old Member States while elaborating a system of sanctions and penalties that hit the less developed European countries, including Poland.
(DE) Mr President, President and members of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we wish to convey our sincere appreciation to the Court of Auditors for a better-compiled report, and we ask you to keep pursuing this path.
We have not yet reached the bounds of the possible, for the more comprehensible your reports are, the more they help us and the more they help the Commission to act on all your findings.
So please continue along these lines.
We are very satisfied with what we have received so far.
We also congratulate the Commission.
What has been achieved in the realm of agriculture is truly a milestone, and it shows that years of hard work do actually yield improvements.
Now we come to the structural funds.
The fact is that we have to get things right in this area too and at least come close to the standard achieved in agriculture.
We are prepared to engage in the necessary discussions.
We are not seeking the impossible.
That is why we speak of a tolerable risk.
We are aware of the Commission's problems, but we are also aware that the only way for us to progress is by supporting the Commission.
You therefore have the support of this Parliament and its Committee on Budgetary Control, Commissioner Kallas, for the structural-fund guidelines.
We warmly encourage you to make tangible progress in this matter.
We must move forward.
Sadly, we have no one from the Council to address.
We shall, however, take the Council to task on the next best occasion.
We cannot go on like this.
We cannot meet here next year and draw the same conclusions.
We have been making ourselves a laughing stock for long enough.
Lastly, a few words on the parliamentary budget: what the Members of Parliament expect of others, they naturally demand of themselves too.
I wish to thank the Court of Auditors for enabling us to carry forward the parliamentary budget for 2006 as far as the Members' assistance allowance is concerned.
In the meantime, the problem of supporting documents for the assistance allowance that was noted in 2006 has been regulated and resolved for all but six Members.
That is a message, President PÃ¶ttering, that we must also convey to European taxpayers.
We have an interest in resolving the old cases and shall do so together with the parliamentary administration.
We shall find a solution, and the solution will be no different from what we expect of others.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to highlight the very positive attitude and valuable work of the Court of Auditors and in particular to draw attention to the figures which we have received as regards the 2006 annual report.
There is an improvement in the use of Community funds.
This year, the Court has positively assessed the way in which 40% of funds have been spent, in comparison with 30% last year.
The positive development of which we can be sure, even though funds are far from being fully used, is that progress is being made every year.
Years ago the Court gave the green light to only 6% of total expenditure.
It is therefore interesting to note that most of the problems encountered are largely to do with irregularities rather than fraud.
The most frequent types of errors are missing documents, failure to respect eligibility criteria, inaccurate declarations and failure to comply with procedures.
Complying with the formalities is obviously a problem.
The new Financial Regulation is a step forward towards simpler and more transparent governance.
Mandatory disclosure in respect of funds administered directly by national and regional authorities, which account for some 80% of the Community budget, is of particular importance.
Much remains to be done to streamline the formalities with a view to simplifying the provisions governing the release of funds.
That would make it possible substantially to reduce irregularities, especially on the part of small beneficiaries, many of whom lack the facilities required to carry out the necessary procedures.
Lastly, a key point of the European financial control system continues to be the issue of recoveries.
If recovery work is to be made easier, more detailed information and data need to be made available to the Court of Auditors, Parliament and the Commission and more binding legislative instruments, such as guarantee and performance bond systems, need to be introduced.
Although the results set out in the annual report of the Court of Auditors show some improvement, I would conclude by saying that simplifying procedures and improving cooperation by states during the control stage continue to be major challenges.
Mr President, firstly I want to thank Mr Weber and the Court of Auditors for the report they have produced this year, which I have read with great interest.
I have often made the point that it is regrettable that the auditors do not adequately name and shame in the areas where improvement is urgently needed.
If they were to do that, it would give the Members of this House the information they need to more accurately direct their efforts towards achieving a positive dÃ©claration d'assurance, or 'DAS'.
Despite this, it is perfectly clear that by far the largest single issue to be tackled is the fact that 80% or more of the transactions of the European Union are carried out under joint management agreements within the Member States, and usually by agencies.
By this I do not mean the fact that 80% are carried out by agencies, but the fact that those agencies have a distinct lack of accountability for the monies which they handle on behalf of the European Union.
It is to the great credit of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control that they recognised this weakness and forced the inclusion of Article 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement in 2006.
That article, I would remind you, made it a requirement for the Member States to submit self-certification for the monies and transactions they have handled.
That was a positive step, but, to date, little, if any, real progress has been made towards meeting that goal.
It is therefore reasonable to assume that, even if progress is made right now, it will be something like 2012 before we have any chance of achieving a positive DAS, making it 18 years that we have failed to get a positive DAS.
The Council and the Commission have to understand that this is not acceptable.
They have to understand that this annual failure to achieve a positive DAS is extremely damaging to this House.
The time is coming for the elected Members of this House to exert more pressure on both the Council and the Commission to attach greater urgency to this essential task.
I, for one, have never voted for discharge of the accounts.
I will continue to refuse to do so until I see more urgency being attached by both the Council and the Commission.
President of the Court of Auditors. - (DE) Mr President, allow me first of all to offer my sincere thanks for the many kind words that have been spoken about the Court of Auditors, its report and its presentation.
I attach great importance to these comments, and I shall gladly pass them on in Luxembourg.
I believe they will also be a very strong motivating factor for our staff.
I was also pleased by the very frequent references to the new beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy.
Nevertheless, I think I have the opportunity to put some things straight, as indeed Mr Staes directly asked me to do.
I must begin with a little background information.
The single-payment system is essentially something that was welcomed from the outset by the Court of Auditors.
It simplifies matters considerably, and we are seeing the effects of that.
In conjunction with IACS, it has resulted in a sharp reduction in the frequency of errors.
But whenever new rules are created, of course, there is always the possibility that they will not be observed.
We should also look at this whole area and not focus exclusively on a single phenomenon, such as non-compliance with the ten-months rule and the resulting heavy financial losses.
We must also bear in mind, of course, that the rules have been formulated very broadly and that a great deal is left to the Member States' discretion.
That has given rise to certain phenomena.
To be sure, there are what have been termed the side-effects, which may have less serious financial implications but which have perhaps attracted more public attention.
It must also be noted that the general concept of agricultural activity has been very broadly defined.
It is sufficient today to manage an area of land in accordance with good agricultural and environmental practice.
It is enough simply to mow the lawn and claim a subsidy.
We seek to highlight that point in order to query it.
We have a total of 700 cases, and so I cannot say at the present time whether all of these cases are legally relevant, for each of them will have to be examined on its merits.
It goes without saying that, if the support received by a golf club also covered the area of the golf course itself, such a situation would certainly not be lawful.
As I said, however, we must deal with these things on a case-by-case basis, and the Commission is invited to do likewise.
I also pointed out, however, that there were other effects to consider.
The introduction of a dynamic model means that a redistribution will take place from land managers - farmers - to landlords.
I am very pleased that we have also been called upon to comment on the implications of policies.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their comments.
The main issue, which is that of better governance of the Structural Funds, will be discussed in detail during the hearings in the Committee on Budgetary Control on 18 December.
These will be followed by extensive hearings concerning overall governance and internal control systems in January.
Thank you again for your comments.
The Commission will be ready to answer all your questions in more detail during the hearings.
That concludes this item.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - I welcome the European Court of Auditors' 2006 Annual Report as it identifies welcome improvements, particularly in relation to agricultural spending.
Where errors are identified these mainly relate to weaknesses in internal control systems both in the Member States and in the Commission.
Positive developments in agriculture spending underlines the effectiveness of the integrated administrative and control system IACS and the simplification of claim and payment procedures in the newly introduced Single Payment Scheme.
For agriculture as a whole - â¬49.8 billion in 2006 - the Court found a marked reduction in the estimated overall level of error.
The Court notes that the Single Payment Scheme has side effects, such as the allocation of entitlements to landowners who never exercised previous agricultural activity, leading to a substantial redistribution of EU aid away from farmers to landlords.
I do not accept this broad statement - as in the single farm payment is paid to active producers NOT landowners.
For the court to say that golf clubs are getting the single farm payment is erroneous.
If they are, they should not be, as the payments can only be made to active producers, who farm and keep land in good agricultural condition.
Golf courses do not qualify
Appointment of 7 members of the Court of Auditors (debate)
The next item is the joint debate of seven reports from Mrs Ayala Sender, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposed nomination of David Bostock, Michel Cretin, Maarten B. Engwirda, Henri Grethen, Harald Noack, Ioannis Sarmas and Hubert Weber as Members of the Court of Auditors.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, as you all know, the members of the Court of Auditors are nominated by the Council, for a six-year mandate, following consultation with Parliament.
It is the Committee on Budgetary Control which is responsible for preparing the opinion of the Parliament.
The Court is currently composed of 27 members, from the Member States of the Union, and we are now preparing to renew the mandate of four candidates: David Bostock, for the United Kingdom; Maarten B. Engwirda, for the Netherlands; Ioannis Sarmas, for Greece; and Hubert Weber, for Austria; and to propose three new members, Michel Cretin, for France; Henri Grethen, for Luxembourg; and Harald Noack, for Germany.
During the procedure in the Committee on Budgetary Control, all candidates were approved but not all of them unanimously.
However, we shall see that, subject to a few clarifications, in principle my final proposal is that, if there are no further comments, all these nominations should be approved.
Following the personal interviews of the three new candidates, I would like to emphasise the good showing made by Mr Cretin, the French candidate, who will bring to the Court his considerable experience in international auditing, both in connection with the UN and NATO.
The Committee on Budgetary Control considered this experience to be a huge plus.
During the personal interviews of the four Members whose mandate is up for renewal, the most important topic was their opinion on the self-assessment process embarked upon by the Court of Auditors, which is due to terminate at the end of 2008, as well as the contribution of each candidate to the current debate about the need to reform the way in which the Court is organised, especially since enlargement, given that it currently has a Board of 27 members, and also with a view to enhancing its effectiveness and modernisation.
In this context, I would like to say that Mr Sarmas was particularly impressive and he was supported unanimously by the Committee, I imagine because he was particularly cooperative during the approval process.
On the other hand, the understanding reached between Mr Engwirda and the Government of the Netherlands was not entirely transparent and this aroused some suspicions in the Committee.
As for Mr Weber, currently President of the Court of Auditors, I would like to clear up one point, before the vote, which is of particular concern to me and which arose after the confirmation hearing in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and so I think that this forum offers an excellent opportunity to clarify it.
Mr President, with this in mind, I would like to ask you to allow Mr Weber to speak when I have finished in order to clarify the following matter.
On 13 November 2007, following the presentation of the Annual Report of the Court of which Mr Weber is President, various statements were made on BBC News by a former Commission chief accountant claiming that 80% of the Community budget was still suspect.
Immediately following this was a quote from Mr Weber, saying that that analysis constituted the more orthodox approach but that the quite different statement by Mr Kallas was also valid.
I would like to hear the truth and for Mr Weber to confirm whether these statements are his and, if not, I would like him to publish a denial and to send a copy to this House, so as to prevent the damage caused to public opinion by this type of contradiction, amongst the general public.
Returning to the content of my report, I would like to register my frustration at the fact that the Council - whose absence at this sitting, I repeat, is regrettable - has once again ignored the criteria laid down by Parliament in its resolution of 1992, with a view to achieving greater transparency.
Basically, the Council has ignored, in two cases, the recommendation not to exceed two mandates, in other words 12 years' service, at the Court of Auditors.
Worse, however, is its disregard of the recommendation of this Parliament about the need to strike a better balance at the Court between men and women.
Whereas to date there are 5 women out of a total of 27 Members, it is now proposed that they be reduced to four.
In this connection I feel once and for all that the Council should adopt special measures.
In this connection too we demand that the Council recognise that good relations between Parliament and the Court of Auditors are essential if the control system is to function properly.
We should therefore receive the Council proposal, with its proposed nominations, in due time and be able to cooperate more closely with Members in the period prior to the decision.
Even more importantly, we would remind the Council of the need to respect the opinion of the European Parliament in order to avoid a repetition of what happened in 2004, following a negative opinion in respect of one of its proposed Members which was totally ignored by the Council.
With the future of the Court in mind, I would like to mention the concern, widely felt among Members of the European Parliament, about the efficacy of such an important body when it is governed by a Board of up to 27 members.
