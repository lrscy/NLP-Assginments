I feel that it would be neither in our interest nor in the interest of Latin Americans if the world were divided into two in this way.
When all is said and done, I believe that there should be a regulation which promotes the integration of the South American continent and also takes account of the historic links between Europe and Latin America.
I would also like to say, as regards our policy on Latin America in general, that I urge the Commission, the Council and also us here in Parliament, to give Latin America a higher profile in our external relations and in our debates.
Unfortunately, and I must once again mention this here, we no longer have at our disposal as important an instrument as Irela, the Institute for European and Latin American relations, which provided great assistance in the past, even occasionally when dealing with more delicate matters.
This is now regrettably as dead as a doornail.
I would incidentally like to give an example of just how important this institute was in Latin America.
Only recently, a member of the Irela supervisory board, Celso Lafer, was appointed Brazil' s foreign minister.
This then shows what a high profile we gave previously to our relations with Latin America.
In this respect, I would ask the Commission, together with Parliament, to look for a solution to enable a sensible replacement regulation to be found and to enable us to have at our disposal an instrument that can give these historic and important relations with Latin America the profile they deserve.
Mr President, I should first like to point out a minor error in the text on the opinion of the Industry Committee, for which I was rapporteur.
Point 2 should end with the initials GATT.
The subsequent phrase appeared in the draft statement but was deleted in the rush to prepare the final version, which I had to complete in just 24 hours.
Moving on to the text before us, I would like to refer to the commercial aspects of the association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur. It will bring together almost 600 million consumers, that is, about 10% of the global population.
In 1998, the only year for which statistics are available, the volume of trade between us amounted to EUR 42 000. A 125% increase has been recorded over the last eight years, with a European Union surplus of EUR 6 400 million.
It is worth pointing out in this connection that the European Union is Mercosur' s main trading partner, five points ahead of the United States. It is also the main supplier to the area.
Furthermore, if we look back in time we find that European countries have always made their presence felt most strongly in this part of Latin America, doubtless as a result of the special historical and cultural ties between us.
This agreement is therefore extremely important. It is unprecedented at global level, enabling the only two subregions in the world who have created common markets to form an association for commercial purposes.
In conclusion, I should like to express my support for this interregional association agreement, which could be a milestone in the history of world trade.
Mr President, in the European Parliament' s resolution dated 14 December 2000 concerning the indictment of General Pinochet and the consolidation of democracy in Chile we stated clearly that the best way for the European Union to support the process of consolidating democracy in Chile was through an ambitious agreement on political reconciliation and economic association and cooperation. Particular emphasis was to be laid on the human rights clause.
I believe we should congratulate ourselves on the speed, consistency and high degree of consensus with which Parliament, through the Committee on Foreign Affairs, has risen to this challenge. The proposals have already been outlined by both rapporteurs.
I therefore only wish to highlight two points.
Firstly, as previously mentioned, the crucial importance of the legal basis of the new association agreement for the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
This basis must be Article 310 of the Treaty. A number of reasons for this have already been given, notably that this legal basis guarantees Parliament' s assent.
Secondly, I must stress that the Committee on Foreign Affairs feels it is crucially important that the conclusion of these agreements should not be conditional on the outcome of the World Trade Organisation round.
On this point, perhaps Commissioner Patten could let us know his views as to how the differences over agriculture might be overcome, particularly as regards Mercosur.
On the subject of these two recommendations, I should also like to highlight how the Committee on Foreign Affairs has contrived to imbue both proposals with a markedly political spirit. This is doubtless the result of the committee' s composition and outlook.
Issues relating to foreign affairs and cooperation have been emphasised over and above the tendency to stress the importance of economic and trade relations.
The latter are no less important but must not dominate.
We are fully aware that whatever the pace of negotiations, strengthening the political nature of our relations with Mercosur and also the process of integration could impact on Chile. This might serve to counter the influence of the United States in political, economic and commercial relations with Chile, and also the plan to relaunch the American Free Trade Agreement.
We would therefore be well advised to carefully monitor any action the new United States administration might take in this regard.
I should also like to congratulate the Commission and Mr Patten for keeping faith with his predecessor, Mr MarÃ­n. They have shown great loyalty and responsibility - I would term it political responsibility - in being true to the outline of the initiative launched by him.
Lastly, I would like to put a question to Mr Patten, though he has just left.
He is well aware of the importance of the nature of the parliamentary cooperation to be set up between Chile, Mercosur and the European Parliament for the institutional development of the agreements.
I should like to let him know in advance that like many other members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs I favour a model along the lines of that set up under the Europe Agreements. That model is based on joint parliamentary committees with a view to improving the current system of delegations.
I would like to know what the Commission and Mr Patten' s views on the matter are.
I would ask Mr Patten' s aides to pass the questions posed by Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez on to him.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the full support of the ELDR Group for the reports by Mr Marset and Mr Salafranca of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, regarding the EU/Chile Association Agreement and the interregional agreement with Mercosur.
In both cases, as the two rapporteurs point out in their respective explanatory statements, these new Association Agreements with Chile and Mercosur currently represent the highest priority of the Union' s external policy towards Latin America.
The extent of the economic relations between the European Union and these countries, the need to strengthen the political role of the European Union as an autonomous and influential actor on the world stage to counter the preponderant influence of the United States, the concrete support given by the Union to all initiatives aiming at strengthening democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in South America means that we cannot go back on this move towards a new phase with regard to the transitional framework agreement that came into force in 1995 for Mercosur and 1999 for Chile.
The European Parliament, as the only democratically elected institution, cannot confine itself to supplying a mere opinion; in the context of the forthcoming institutional reform, this House must gain a more incisive role by obtaining an explicit assent.
So this is a significant moment, Mr President, a moment not to be wasted.
As chair of the delegation for relations with South America and Mercosur, I must draw your attention to this, so that Europe and South America may continue their efforts to reach a solution, irrespective of the conclusions of the multilateral negotiations of the World Trade Organisation.
Today, Europe still has within its reach the chance to build a privileged relationship with the Mercosur countries and Chile, a relationship ratifying a fresh start in our dealings with this land which, for so many reasons, is close to our own continent, a land in which we can still play a leading part.
So we must give a new boost to these global Association Agreements, which must be concluded without wasting any more precious time, and which - it is extremely important to emphasise this - must not have just economic and commercial connotations, even though these are extremely important, but must include political and development cooperation aspects.
These are the features which mark out what is different about Europe, our heritage, of which we are duly proud and which we cannot and must not abandon.
Mr President, in view of the fact that Mr Patten has returned to the Chamber we cannot actually say that his infrequent presence amongst us is a measure of the Commission' s commitment to these issues.
Nonetheless, those of us who have recently visited the area in question - I myself have just returned from Argentina and Chile - certainly wish to convey how very sceptically the European Union' s involvement in relations with Latin America is perceived.
These relations are quite inadequate, and scepticism is particularly marked in the field of the social economy of small businesses and trade unions. I had the opportunity to discuss the situation with them just this week in Argentina and Chile.
I cannot but agree in principle with the report being debated today.
In general I also support everything aimed at increasing economic and trade relations with the countries in the area. In addition, I am in favour of the involvement of civil society in this and other aspects of the association agreements.
Nonetheless, this support is tinged with criticism.
Although reference has been made - for instance by Mr Marset - to international agreements on ethnic minorities, we believe that the fact that our group' s amendments have not been acted on in this and other areas is a serious shortcoming. True, progress has been made in the field of workers' rights, incorporating ILO conventions.
However, there has been no reference to the code of conduct for multinational companies adopted in the OECD. It has been argued that that is not Europe whereas in fact European companies are setting up in the countries concerned.
No environmental measures have been adopted either. Furthermore, the new negotiating mandate does not include the specific references we had requested to structured and institutionalised involvement of civil society in this political dialogue.
We therefore endorse in principle what has been said in today' s debate on the association agreements. However, we wish to reiterate our criticism of other aspects we consider essential.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Salafranca and Mr Marset Campos on their excellent reports, which have enabled us today to discuss the mandate for negotiations on two agreements, as has already been stated. These are, firstly, the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, and secondly, the agreement with Chile.
I wish to point out that the agreement with Mercosur may constitute the first agreement in the world between two customs unions.
Parliament must therefore give due recognition to the importance of these agreements, not only because they will contribute towards improving relations between the European Union, its Member States and the countries of the southern cone of the American continent, but also because they will foster greater balance in the development of partnerships for cooperation in Latin America. This will act as a counterbalance to the growing influence in the region of the North American Free Trade Area movement (NAFTA).
From this point of view, these agreements are strategically important and deserve our protection at a political level.
I should like to make two additional observations, Mr President. The first is that I, like the rapporteurs, feel that the Council' s decision to make the signing of the agreements dependent on the conclusion of the WTO negotiations is a negative one.
I am pleased, however, to note that Portugal and Spain agreed, at the recent Luso-Hispanic Summit in Sintra, to unite their efforts to separate the agreements from the conclusion of the WTO round of negotiations.
The purpose of my second comment is to state that the mandate for negotiations considers both the political and cooperation approaches in addition to the trade aspect, which is to be expected.
I would not be surprised - and incidentally I am not opposed to this - if the agreements consequently took on the form of association agreements, or even if the Council clearly defined the legal basis of this mandate, which would determine the nature of these agreements.
This is not an insignificant question, particularly insofar as it determines the European Parliament having more or less power to act with regard to the final content of the agreements, as the rapporteurs have made quite clear.
In any event, we should remember that the national parliaments in the Member States will still have to ratify these agreements, thereby giving them the necessary democratic legitimacy.
Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge, no agreement between the European Union and third countries has to date failed to be signed because the legal framework implemented in a given case has been inadequate.
We should not, therefore, create legal obstacles where they do not exist.
Our greatest concern should be that we sign agreements that are effective and mutually advantageous to the Union, to the Member States and to the communities for which they are designed.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on these interesting and important reports and to pledge our support, particularly as regards the demand that the European Parliament become more directly involved in the negotiations.
Since the US administration has made it known several times that relations with South America will be one of the key points of their foreign policy, improved cooperation between the EU and the Latin American countries has become a necessity for the European Union, not only economically but also in terms of world politics.
Hence, the recommendations specified here quite rightly not only contain conditions for improved economic cooperation but attempt to define the problem in terms of a global programme for the EU.
Therefore, the recommendations listed in point 2, i.e. the encouragement of the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law as well as respect for human rights and the reduction of inequalities between sectors of society and within regions, are just as important as the expansion of trade.
The sphere of 'political dialogue' needs perhaps to be defined more accurately or, due to the heavily hierarchically structured society which still exists in South America, large sections of the populations will remain excluded from this dialogue.
In short, the EU has good prospects with South America, perhaps in direct competition with the United States, though without repeating the mistakes made by the Americans who have justifiably in past decades repeatedly been accused in their relations with South American countries of too often purely defending the interests of power politics regardless of current democratic developments.
Mr President, the agreements we are debating will in future underpin cooperation relations between the European Union, Mercosur and Chile. They constitute a particularly important set of documents.
Together with the agreement signed with Mexico, they are enabling us to update, relaunch and move forward relations between the European Union and a group of states. The latter represent a very significant part of Latin America from the demographic, economic and political point of view.
This has a particular bearing on economics and trade.
We should take into account that the other party we are dealing with ranks fourth in the world in these fields. It also has great potential for growth.
I do, however, believe that the cooperation and political coordination which ought to be set up on the basis of these agreements are no less important.
Close political links with Latin America have always been a priority for Spaniards. Nevertheless, I feel that it should be obvious to any European that the continent in question constitutes an entity which, given its history, culture and current state of development, is far closer to what is understood by Europe.
In particular, it is close to the European Union venture. The Latin Americans are the closest to us as regards values and democratic aspirations.
No other group shares our commitment to strive for social justice and national dignity to the same extent. The latter is, however, tempered by many decades of work towards supranational integration and responsible and coordinated involvement at international level.
These agreements pave the way for ever closer political cooperation between Europe and Latin America. Perhaps we shall then be in a better position to set our own course.
In recent decades both Europe and Latin America have been heavily influenced by our common uncle. For them, he lives just north of the Rio Grande.
For us, he is just across the Atlantic.
Cooperation between Europe and Latin America should allow us to make sound progress towards a world order based on democracy and solidarity.
This is necessary to ensure world peace. In the light of globalisation, it is also essential for the survival and consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and the social progress we desire for all our people.
This vision of our relations with Latin America is complementary to and coherent with the provisions of the Cotonou Convention affecting the African, Caribbean and Pacific community signed recently.
Mr President, I think we are on the way to fleshing out a key chapter of what the European Union' s common foreign and cooperation policy ought to be.
Mr President, Commissioner, Representative of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the situation that is being negotiated with Mercosur and Chile lends itself to some dangerous suggestions that we should avoid, but it also offers some opportunities that this Union take and some responsibilities that it can assume.
We must avoid thinking of this agreement simply as a free trade agreement, which is an almost natural tendency for something that was once just an economic union; today, however, it would be an oversimplification, dangerously favouring just a small elite and not the peoples involved, to whom we wish to propose a global association agreement which in fact has its own political dimension and its own momentum in the processes of cooperation.
Latin America, the Mercosur countries and Chile are not just the fourth-largest trading bloc: they are also a continent in which the highest priorities of the European Union' s foreign policy can be fulfilled, and here I am thinking of the fight against poverty, the consolidation of democracy, the fight for human rights and workers' rights.
In its global and political dimensions, this Association Agreement can make a valuable contribution.
In this context, it seems deplorable that in the Council' s mandate to the Commission there is no indication of the legal basis of our Association Agreement.
We believe it is a fundamental agreement not only for attributing competence, autonomy and responsibility to the European Union' s foreign policy, but especially for managing, at last, to make up our great disadvantage in initiative towards Latin America compared with the United States, for asserting our capacity for political initiative and our competence in our foreign policy towards Latin America.
A last point: we must enhance and provide for the participation of civil society.
I see civil society not as a trinket, something mundane, a purely aesthetic necessity; I see it as a real, genuine resource in democratic terms, to which Parliament wants to give a say.
Let me first start by congratulating the rapporteurs for their excellent and very helpful reports.
We are clearly entering a crucial moment in the negotiations for association agreements with Chile and Mercosur.
The negotiations are well on track.
We have had three negotiating rounds, part of the last of which I attended myself.
It was a considerable success.
Preparations for the fourth round of negotiations to be held in the second fortnight of March are in full swing.
It is fair to say that after one and a half years of negotiations, we are approaching the most intensive phase.
Political dialogue, cooperation and trade issues figure very high on the agenda of the next session.
Negotiating texts have been exchanged.
Work has even started on the preparation of the tariff and services negotiations, including agriculture, which are going to begin in July.
This has all been possible thanks to our serious commitment to these negotiations.
No-one doubts that the Commission wishes to do all we can to strengthen ties with Mercosur and Chile.
During the course of this year I want to accelerate these negotiations.
Much progress has already been made in the political and cooperation fields but major progress is still needed on the trade side.
I hope we will see a leap forward on non-tariff barriers and business facilitation in March.
In July, we expect progress with negotiating offers on both tariffs and services.
As my honourable friend pointed out earlier, the second European Union - Latin-America Summit will take place in Madrid in Spring next year.
It is still too early to speculate on what concrete progress we should expect by then but it is always clear, as the honourable gentleman said earlier, that by the time of the summit, negotiations must have established a critical mass.
This critical mass should be sufficient in some areas to finish discussions.
It should also be possible in other areas to conclude negotiations as soon after that as reasonably possible.
Our objective is to attain a high and ambitious level of political and commercial interaction with Mercosur and Chile.
As Parliament knows, no sector is excluded from the negotiations.
Our main guidelines are achieving a strategic political partnership, strengthened cooperation, and a WTO-plus deal on the trade side.
It is no secret that while Chile fully shares this comprehensive approach, Mercosur has a rather more limited objective, aiming primarily for greater market access in agriculture.
We should continue to insist on a comprehensive global and balanced agreement which aims at a deeper political and cooperation relationship as well as wide and far-reaching trade liberalisation.
The two reports that we are discussing are both comprehensive and extremely useful.
They make a number of sound recommendations - most of these are based on the possibility of modifying the current negotiating mandate provided by the Council.
That may be desirable at some point over the coming year but, at that this point in time, we are naturally focused on achieving successful rounds of negotiations in March and July rather than on stopping the discussions and going back to the drawing board with the Council.
We had a full internal debate on this two or three years ago.
At present, the Commission is keen to get down to work and do the job it was instructed to do.
Let me just make a few concrete comments as regards the specific recommendations.
First the matter of the legal base.
The final agreement will be an association agreement not a mere trade deal.
Our future strategic partnership goes well beyond trade.
However our legal advisers tell me that the exact articles for the legal base could only be determined at the end of the negotiations.
I agree with this opinion.
For the time being we only have the outline of agreement.
We need to wait for the final result, as we have done in other similar negotiations, before we look at our own legal base.
Then there is the question of democracy, the rule of law, respect of human rights and good governance.
These are all basis tenants of our negotiating position and they are the cornerstone of the agreement that we want to reach.
These issues have already been discussed during the third round in Brasilia and Santiago and we have reached consensus with Mercosur and Chile on them.
I am personally committed to ensuring that these essential elements underpin our future association agreements with Mercosur and Chile.
Then labour rights. These are also an integral part of the negotiations.
They are currently being discussed in view of the fourth round in March.
We need to ensure that labour rights and greater prosperity advance hand-in-hand.
Greater prosperity should help lead to a deepening of democracy and that should mean greater respect for basic rights, including of course labour rights.
So we support an approach in the association agreement which assures labour rights through cooperation and promotion of the relevant ILO Conventions.
I come to greater political cooperation including security.
This was already established during the third round in Brasilia and Santiago.
We will work together for the promotion of peace and international security on the basis, of course, of our own internal rules and procedures.
Civil society was mentioned in the reports and by a number of speakers.
Transparency and accountability are essential.
Civil society should be part of the agreement.
We have already agreed on proposals during the third round to include civil society in the institutional framework of the agreement.
In addition, the Commission organised a successful conference with civil society last October to promote discussions on the negotiations.
We have also created a website in August of last year which provides a full breakdown on the negotiations for the general public.
So as the House can see we are making a real effort to enhance the transparency of the process.
Several Members and the reports themselves refer to the possibility of eliminating the link to the proposed new WTO round.
I certainly do not rule out this possibility but this will depend first of all on whether we have a new WTO round at all.
We obviously hope that happens, and the sooner the better, but we have not yet got that proposal off the ground.
It depends as well on the progress we achieve in future negotiating rounds with Mercosur and Chile.
We might consider this option if sufficient and substantial progress is made.
It is suggested that we should eliminate the two-phased negotiating approach.
The House will know as well as I do that this approach was the result of a compromise solution between Ministers during the General Affairs Council of June 1999 in Luxembourg.
This compromise formula broke the deadlock in Council and opened the door to the approval of the negotiating directives.
I very much appreciate Parliament' s support on this important issue but it is presently more a matter of principle than practice.
I am afraid we are now too far into the process to turn back.
We only have four months more to go and only one negotiating round until July when the second negotiating phase is meant to start.
So I think we should get on with the job and prepare meaningful global negotiations from July onwards.
Let me finish by underlining once again that the Commission is absolutely committed to successful negotiations with Mercosur and Chile.
We are determined to get on with the job and make as much progress as possible.
Negotiations are in full swing.
Preparations for the next round are on track.
With or without changes in the mandate, the Commission is working to make these negotiations a success as quickly as possible.
I hope I can count on Parliament' s support to that end.
Lastly, can I refer to two questions which I received during the debate. First of all, Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez asked me a question.
I am afraid I left the Chamber for about 60 seconds of her speech.
I will not go into the details as to why, but if I tell the House that I am present in Parliament the whole of the morning she will perhaps appreciate why I needed 60 seconds outside the chamber, but I can respond very positively to her remark.
She asked whether there would be a joint interparliamentary committee.
The Commission strongly believes that there should be.
We can respond very favourably to the honourable lady' s request and we will be discussing exactly the mechanism that we can use shortly with Mercosur and Chile.
So we can give a very positive response to that important proposal.
Secondly, the honourable gentleman Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s, asked me about the OECD Code.
We cannot oblige countries that are not members of the OECD to follow the OECD Code.
I understand the importance of the point he raised but we cannot make it obligatory for non-OECD members to follow the OECD Code.
I repeat I hope that we can count on Parliament' s support in the weeks and months ahead, and I am sure that the close attention being shown in this debate underlines the fact that we will able to do so.
Mr Patten, there has obviously been some murmuring during your speech, as the vote is almost upon us. Nonetheless, I have observed that your intervention has been followed attentively.
I support you and stand witness that you are always present at meetings.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended until 11 a.m.)
VOTE
Could I raise an issue in advance of Question Time next week.
At the last plenary session I tabled a question to the Council, in time and in full accordance with the Rules, yet the Presidency refused to answer the question because they had not received all language translations.
I do not see why I should be penalised if all language translations are not available, and I would ask you to give a ruling, if not today, subsequently, that when a Member of Parliament tables a question in full accordance with the Rules, they are entitled to an answer at the appropriate time.
Thank you very much.
I was unaware of that matter, but I will draw it to the attention of the President and suggest that she defends the rights of Members to table questions.
Mr President, allow me to address you on a point of order. It is about the refusal of photographs from Kazakhstan, the region where nuclear tests were carried out.
Last night, we found out that Parliament itself turned down a few of those photographs in that exhibition because they are reported to be shocking.
Unfortunately, those photographs mirror reality, and although that reality is shocking, as MEPs we should not be patronised, and we have the right - and even the duty - to learn the truth about that reality.
Consequently, I would like to submit a protest on behalf of my group and on behalf of many people who attended the Kazakhstan exhibition yesterday.
A second reason for dissatisfaction is the fact that yesterday, a visitor, Mr Tsamaraint Nauchap from the Shuar people in Ecuador, was refused entry.
This Ecuadorial Indian came here as an envoy of his people, accompanied by the signs of his dignity, namely a small wooden spear measuring less than two metres.
The man was not allowed entry to the House. We were not allowed to talk to him, apparently because he was armed.
I considered it to be extremely humiliating for this man to be asked to lay down the signs of his dignity, which are sacred to him.
Consequently, he was unable to visit us, and the MEPs who wanted to receive him had to do so outside our Chamber and outside the Parliament building.
This is totally outrageous, particularly since it has been confirmed that this is in accordance with a normal code of conduct.
I am calling for a review of this rule of conduct.
Both incidents are regrettable, but can I suggest you raise the matter with the President of the College of Quaestors, so that the Quaestors can discuss this matter.
On the second incident, though, I would say that I have personal experience in a completely different context.
The Scottish, my own country' s national dress involves wearing a dagger in your sock.
If the services are informed in advance that this is part of national dress, then entry can be facilitated.
I think the problem with the Ecuadorial Indian is that security forces were suddenly faced with this man with a spear and had not be given any warning in advance.
Nevertheless, I think you should raise it with the College of Quaestors.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Lehne report (A5-0056/2001)
In accordance with Article 62(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a Draft Council Regulation, the drawing up of which was a sensitive issue, was presented to the European Parliament for consultation. It lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when they wish to enter the European Union, as well as the countries that are exempt from this requirement for visas for stays of up to three months.
The case of Romania, which is situated somewhere between the above two examples, was a difficult matter.
In theory, Romania should be included in the second list as an applicant country with which accession talks have commenced. Unfortunately, however, it appears that a stricter attitude may be needed, since illegal immigrants living in several European countries originate from Romania.
The Council found quite a neat solution to this problem. It allows Romania to appear in the list of countries whose nationals are exempt from visa requirements, but Article 8 of the draft regulation specifies that this provision will only come into force when Romania has indicated which "undertakings it is prepared to enter into on illegal immigration and illegal residence, including the repatriation of persons from that country who are illegally resident" .
I believe that this condition is crucial.
It has, however, been removed following the amendments that the European Parliament has just approved, not because of any particular affection for Romania, which might have been understandable, but in the spirit of encouraging unchecked freedom of movement which is seen all too often.
Parliament voted in favour of several other amendments of less importance but I cannot accept them either.
Given the circumstances, I refused to vote in favour of the European Parliament report, but I continue to support the Council' s initial position.
The EU' s strict visa policy constitutes a major obstacle for people wishing to make their way to Europe.
The fact that the visa requirements have been tightened up in recent years has unavoidably led to more cases of trafficking in human beings and to an increase in what is known as illegal immigration to the EU Member States.
Those people who have been smuggled in or who have, by some other method, made their way into the European Union have often suffered great tragedies on the way.
Once they have arrived in the EU, they have no rights or social protection at all.
There is a list of more than 130 countries whose citizens require visas to enter the EU.
There are not even as many as 50 states which are exempt from the visa requirement.
That practice, whereby a visa requirement is the rule rather than the exception, is unworthy of a democratic Europe.
The basic rule must be that people are entitled to travel freely into the EU, not the other way around.
Europe must change its attitude to immigration.
Within a few years' time, there will be an acute labour shortage in the EU.
That is why it is important for us to accept and welcome people seeking a better future in the EU' s Member States.
A more generous visa policy is also a prerequisite for its being possible to pursue a common, humane policy on refugees and asylum.
Through a positive policy on immigration, we can put a stop to organised crime and to the human tragedies for which traffickers in human beings are responsible.
Haug report (A5-0064/2001)
Mr President, I requested the floor in order to speak about the amendment to the budget appropriations solely to express my disagreement with the idea that the much-needed supplementary budget for addressing the problems of BSE must be achieved without adjusting the limits set by Agenda 2000.
We are facing an extraordinary situation, which must be addressed today by means of extraordinary funds, which are sufficient for the task, although, in the future, the necessary appropriations for new agriculture can be achieved through the reform of the CAP itself.
In any event, I wish to protest both at the way in which Parliament is being sidelined in the attempt to find solutions to the problem of mad cow disease and at the inability of the Council of Ministers and the Member States to find appropriate ways of resolving this serious issue, having ignored and neglected it for most of the 90s.
I have just voted in favour of the Amending Budget 1/2001 of the European Union for the 2001 financial year, which provides for an extra EUR 971 million to cope with the consequences of the BSE crisis.
I would like to stress, however, that this figure had been calculated by the Commission in January and it already appears to have been completely overtaken by events.
Since last Monday, we have found ourselves faced with a paradox, where the European Union cannot, or does not want to, provide French farmers with extra funding and is leaving France to cope in total isolation by allowing it to provide exceptional national aid.
At a time, then, when the crisis is hitting hard and when European solidarity is needed most, the European Union is falling unceremoniously by the wayside.
I am admittedly the first to say that the overall European budget should not be increased as it already costs us a fair amount of money and that we must adhere to the 2000-2006 Financial Perspective approved by the Berlin Council in 1999. Even so, this does not mean, however, that nothing can be done.
For the time being, the Financial Perspective still leaves us with a margin of EUR 506 million for 2001 under the headings for agriculture. In the short and medium term, there is no reason to leave this sum sitting there, even if the allocated funding for agriculture has all been spent.
Instead of increasing the European Union' s total budget, there is another possibility, which is to transfer the expenditure under the Structural Funds heading to the agricultural section of the budget. In recent years, this expenditure has never been totally exhausted and, in any case, it is not always spent on such urgent needs (excluding funding to the applicant countries, of course).
Moreover, this would not constitute misappropriation as, first and foremost, the aim of the Structural Funds is to support activity throughout the whole Union, and this would be the case if the funds were helping to combat the devastating consequences of BSE.
The problems that we are experiencing would justify this unusual step.
It is becoming obvious to us all that, over the longer term, Europe' s agricultural policy, which may have had the distinction of helping to develop our agricultural industry in the 1960s, is now having adverse effects - handouts, bureaucracy, price inflation and intensification, which poses a health risk - to such an extent that far-reaching reform is inevitable.
We have said for years that we must put in place much stricter rules than we have today to promote respect for nature and health, without increasing the burden on taxpayers. Logically speaking, the consumer should pay the difference by buying products at their actual price, or at a price that is closer to reality.
In the same way, if we want to maintain our independence in the food sector, imports will of course, on the one hand, have to be subject to the same safety rules and, on the other, will, in certain cases, have to be subject to taxes to allow production to be continued in European countries.
I have today chosen to vote in favour of Parliament' s report, the Haug report, on the Council' s Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget 1/2001 in view, for example, of the BSE crisis, despite the fact that other Swedish Social Democrats are voting against it.
This difference of approach does not reflect different attitudes to agricultural policy.
On the contrary, we are in complete agreement about the need for a radical reform including, in the longer term, a greater acceptance of responsibility by the Member States for those costs that arise as a consequence of BSE and other crises.
This view is also expressed in the report.
The background to our voting differently is, rather, the fact that I participated in the handling of this matter in the Committee on Budgets and do not see any possibility of influencing agricultural policy by voting 'no' today.
Nor will the Supplementary Budget lead to the Budget' s being overstepped, but only to those margins which are under the Budget ceiling being reduced.
What is more, this is a decision on which Parliament does not have the right of codecision - which is in itself a matter for discussion that is called into question in the report.
A 'no' vote today would not, therefore, lead to any real change but only to delays.
It would delay making available those resources required for the testing and destruction of cattle in the wake of the BSE crisis, as well as delay extending the mandate of the European Reconstruction Bureau in Kosovo/Serbia to include Montenegro, as referred to in the second part of this Supplementary and Amending Budget.
Parliament' s report makes clear demands for a change in agricultural policy, entirely along the same lines presented by myself and other Social Democratic and Liberal MEPs in an article in Wednesday' s GÃ¶teborgs-Posten.
Those demands will now be pushed hard by Parliament, something which all we Swedish Social Democrats applaud.
We are not therefore concerned here with substantially different views of agricultural policy.
On the contrary, I feel very sympathetic towards the voting intentions of my Swedish Social Democratic colleagues.
We differ only in our view of what can be achieved by voting against this practical report.
This amending budget is inadequate and provides only temporary measures, although it does respond to the urgent need to finance the costs of the BSE crisis. I therefore voted in favour of it.
It must be noted, however, that, in the words of Commissioner Fischler himself, 'the crisis may run deeper than we think' , and that estimates presented by farmers' organisations of total costs, which may reach EUR three thousand million, indicate that the consequences of the BSE crisis have been underestimated, at budgetary level too.
Since the farmers should not be the ones to pay for a crisis for which they are not responsible - it is common agricultural policy which is responsible - budgetary constraints cannot be used as an excuse to prevent all the necessary decisions being adopted to contain the BSE crisis and to protect farmers' interests.
The Financial Perspective must be revised.
The purpose of a reform of the CAP, which I have maintained has been greatly needed for some time, must not be to make savings in the budget. The purpose of such a reform must be to protect agricultural production, in full respect for food safety, to protect food quality, to promote the specific nature of the various regions and to promote economic and social cohesion.
This will guarantee farmers' incomes through fair prices for production and safe, high-quality produce for consumers.
In any event, I voted against the amendment that sought to place the issue of cofinancing, in other words, the renationalisation of CAP costs, onto the agenda, because I disagree with the adoption of such a measure.
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.
The public and technocratic institutions have been faltering in their handling of the BSE crisis - that much is clear.
Yet, Members who meet farmers in their constituencies know the expectations of these groups and the difficulties they face.
That is why the European Parliament must make its voice heard by relaying requests and proposals to the institutions on behalf of the agricultural sector.
I therefore hope that the European Parliament will, in future, be able to have a more powerful role; moving market expenditure under the codecision procedure would be one of the important steps along the way to achieving this.
For many years, I have been fighting to bring about a complete reform of the common agricultural policy.
Not only have we waited too long, but also the crises that we are currently experiencing are, once again, turning the spotlight on the limitations of the policy, which have been evident for years.
The Commission, until now, has been particularly overcautious in its proposals, which is something that I find deeply deplorable.
What we must do now is to help farmers - not to produce more, but to produce better.
Consumers have lost their confidence in farming and it can only be restored by developing sustainable agriculture.
Public health must be the main priority of the CAP, an expectation not only shared by consumers, but supported by the whole of the farming community as well.
The Fianna Fail delegation in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Supplementary Budget to finance the "mad cow" eradication programme, and the associated resolution - but not without serious reserves.
We are delighted that the amendment to limit the European Union' s financial participation to 50% was rejected by a large majority.
This would have been unacceptable to us, unacceptable to the Irish Government and unacceptable to our farming community.
From the outset we have considered that "mad cow disease" is a Community problem and should therefore be fully financed by the Community.
The initial figure of 70% Community participation and 30% national participation in the Haug report, was adopted by a very large majority.
The Fianna Fail MEPs reluctantly voted in favour of this proposal.
Community rules, at the present time, do not allow for a higher Community participation.
Our choice was therefore limited, however regrettable.
Fianna Fail' s Group requested a roll-call vote on the final paragraph of the resolution, which refers to codecision for the CAP.
We voted against this paragraph.
The European Parliament has no power or authority to vote itself codecision powers.
This is a matter for the Heads of State and Government - only.
It is not on their agenda.
Furthermore, according to the Treaties, any revision of the CAP will not take place before 2003 - 2004.
Finally this is a budgetary matter only.
Any discussion on the reform of the CAP will take place at the right time.
That time is not now.
For all the above reasons the Fianna Fail MEPs approved the recommendations from the Budgets Committee (Haug report).
On behalf of the French Members of the National Front, I would like to stress that the Supplementary and Amending Budget 1/2001, which provides for EUR 971 million to manage the BSE crisis, is insufficient even before it has been adopted.
Yet, that is not the most important point.
What is more important is that today we have been handed the death certificate of the CAP, which some Members will welcome.
We do not.
There were many giveaway signs of Europe' s predictable weak points.
At the WTO conference held last year in Seattle, the American delegates and the Cairns delegation had already wanted to dismantle the CAP by withdrawing export refunds and internal funding, whereas they themselves have never before subsidised their agricultural industry so much, providing USD 23 billion for 2001 alone.
The BSE crisis has been caused by a global free trade policy and a lack of border controls and it seems to have put the nail in the coffin of the CAP, all the more so because Germany which, since Nice, has become the most powerful country in Europe, refuses to make an extra effort to help farmers who are in crisis, the innocent victims of the industrialisation of agriculture.
Undeniably, JosÃ© BovÃ© and his friends are the Americans' impartial allies in this matter, in as much as they would like to see the CAP destroyed, some of them so that they can take over our markets again and others in the name of the 'class struggle' and of 'Third Worldism' .
The Americans will take advantage of our divisions to take over from their only serious competitor on world markets and to dominate the food industry again.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reiterate that the original CAP was based on the concept of Community preference and financial solidarity and that Europe has become both self-sufficient and a major exporter of high-quality agricultural food products because of it.
Today, we are again hearing the terms 'cofinancing' , 'renationalisation' and 'codecision' used to refer to the agricultural industry - these are words which seemed to have disappeared from our vocabulary since the Berlin Summit in March 1999.
This is one of the signs that France no longer has the required levels of authority and commitment within Europe to defend its own interests, as Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin demonstrated at Nice.
The report addresses the consequences of the BSE crisis for the Budget.
Tests, market interventions and purchase and destruction orders for non-tested cattle over 30 months are to be cofunded by the EU and the Member States.
The report commendably emphasises the importance of reforms to the common agricultural policy along the lines of 'environmentally, economically and socially sustainable farming according to the spirit of Agenda 21' .
The Member States' responsibility for the problems arising out of BSE is also emphasised, as is the fact that alternative methods of funding ought to be considered for when animal diseases break out.
It is high time that we abandon a form of agricultural production which simply aims for the highest possible yield and does not take sufficient account of quality and the interests of consumers.
Swedish agriculture has not so far been hit by the BSE crisis, something which is clearly to be explained in terms of sound animal husbandry and feeding.
We believe that the Member States must take greater responsibility for a problem which is largely due to deficiencies in national legislation.
We therefore recommend Amendments 4 and 5, tabled by Mr Mulder, whereby compensation paid to farmers in connection with the BSE crisis would be funded on an equal (50-50) basis by the EU and the Member States.
We also support Amendments 1-3, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which make clear the need the need for agricultural reforms and for the individual Member States to take more responsibility for cofunding.
With these reservations, we support the report.
Brunetta report (A5-0061/2001)
Mr President, as I see it, telecommunications networks are merely communication highways just like air corridors, railway tracks or motorways. A study of the latter reveals a model which guarantees equality of opportunity.
It enables transport service providers to make joint use of networks built and maintained mainly with public funds despite competing amongst themselves. Hence the environmental impact of civil engineering projects of this nature is reduced as much as possible.
I therefore venture to suggest that we would be well-advised to opt for a similar arrangement for the development of telecommunications.
There would be no competition over the construction of superimposed infrastructure networks.
Instead, there would be competition to provide the cheapest and most efficient services for the user.
As Mayor of Bilbao in the eighties I witnessed a battle amongst companies eager to improve and increase their networks.
Each company wished to dig its own trenches and install its own aerials so as to have its own channels and exclusive coverage in every street in the city.
I opposed this because I believed it made more sense to have a single public aerial, network, channel and trench along which all the telecommunications services provided by private operators could be channelled. Similarly, buses and lorries belonging to different companies all travel along the same motorway.
There is no need for each company to build its own.
Mr President, if the general feeling is that the final networks should also be privatised, I will not argue against it. However, I do feel that in any case it would be wisest to make legal provision to separate the functions of the owners and managers of the networks from those of their users and providers of telematic services.
Mr President, I am pleased to inform you that, on behalf of the Pensioners' Party, which I represent in this European Parliament, I voted for the Brunetta report on access to telecommunications and electronic communications networks.
Why did I vote for it?
I voted for it - and enthusiastically, Mr President - because I am convinced that electronic communications have no frontiers.
The 15 Member States that make up the European Union used to have frontiers, they still have frontiers, which are becoming less and less clear, less and less divisive, but for electromagnetic waves there are no frontiers.
Europe has been integrated in the past, is being integrated now and will continue to be so in the future through television without frontiers.
I support the entire telecommunications package because it has many strengths.
Due to the constantly increasing demand for frequencies, whether it be from communication networks, radio, traffic, the police, the armed forces and science, a coordinated action in Europe in international competition is simply essential.
Harmonisation at EU-level is generally helping to create a continental market that can totally hold its own against US competitors.
Furthermore, I would like to mention the increased process of administrative simplification - eight acts were created out of a total of twenty - which is a thoroughly positive development.
Rules of competition will be the most important instrument used to regulate the market for electronic communications.
Until genuine competition can take place on the market, clearer criteria with regard to regulatory intervention and more precise limits and conditions for allocating obligations regarding the granting of access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks are necessary.
Therefore, I expressly welcome Mr Brunetta' s report, which proposes reasonable obligations for the operator and stresses that prior regulations should be repealed as soon as the aims pursued have been achieved via market mechanisms.
Such interventions will be necessary so long as the former monopoly holders, who still provide the most connections, exist.
The meagre resources, controlled by one or a few of the operators, for example the local access network in telecommunications, are currently yet another obstruction to competition.
Overall, I support the report on access to electronic communications networks, associated facilities and their interconnection as we are in need of a directive to encourage real competition in the European telecommunications market.
Since I am convinced that we must at all costs avoid a situation where specific technical issues could slow down the creation of a genuine single market that avoids distortion of competition, particularly in the mobile telephone industry, I had tabled an amendment to force operators which receive demands for access and/or for interconnection to take part in talks and to negotiate the access with other operators able to offer the same type of access and/or interconnection to the network.
It is my belief that the demands should only be refused on the basis of objective criteria alone and that, if access is refused, the injured party should be able to submit the case to the National Regulatory Authority.
I welcome the fact that this requirement for negotiation of access has been retained, along with the requirement which specifies that access must be made under 'commercial conditions' which are, therefore, economically viable for new operators.
The only way to guarantee the development of a true, competitive market, able to provide the best option in terms of price and quality, and to defend the interests of the European citizen in the best way possible is to enforce a strict ban on the refusal to negotiate demands.
I voted in favour of Mr Brunetta' s report with these added clarifications.
There are many good aspects to the Brunetta report.
What is particularly important is the strong support given to obliging the Commission to lose no time in ensuring that a common standard for digital TV receivers and set-top boxes is approved.
Parliament also wished, by a large majority, to create uniform rules for those supplementary services which will be added to TV services in the future.
It ought not to be possible to use interfaces and software which tie consumers to one particular service provider.
However, it was not a good idea to oblige the authorities to see to it that prices for roaming and interconnection are cost-based and to require that the price of calls in real time be shown on the telephone' s display.
The latter is an unduly detailed regulation.
Paasilinna report (A5-0053/2001)
Mr President, I also voted for the Paasilinna report on a common regulatory framework for communications networks and services.
So I must say, Mr President, that if it had not been for the liberalisation of television services I should not be here today.
So much the better, you might think, for we would already be at lunch, but allow me to disagree.
Hic manebimus optime, I am very happy here in the European Parliament and I got here thanks to television.
In fact, since they were liberalised, I myself, Fatuzzo, have been able to make myself known and to get my ideas in support of the elderly and pensioners across to enough Italian citizens that they have voted for me and got me into this Chamber.
So how could I not vote for this report?
I would like to congratulate Mr Paasilinna for the work he has done on this issue, the particular difficulty of which is shown by the number of amendments that have been tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I would reiterate that the proposed directive, due to come into force on 1 January 2003, seeks to take account of the development of the former Telecom Package 1998, on the one hand, and of technological evolution in this market, on the other.
I am very pleased to see that the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are to be given greater flexibility, allowing them to conduct their own assessment of market positions and to decide when and how a given market needs to be regulated.
Like Mr Paasilinna, I believe that the new approach will allow the framework directive to play a key role in setting the generally applicable regulations.
These regulations must provide consistency throughout the Community.
The difficulty in this constantly changing sector is to find a fair balance between specific rules and Community legislation in the area of competition.
It is important to ensure that competition is not so anarchic as to harm the interests of the consumer, but that the spirit of innovation is maintained.
The NRAs will therefore have a large part to play in achieving this.
In our debates, the concept of a 'Significant Market Player' emerged as the focus for discussion.
It was even thought worthwhile arranging a public hearing on this topic.
In the end, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy voted in favour of an amendment to clarify the terminology used.
Bearing in mind the stage that we have reached, I believe that it would have been difficult to create a clearer definition.
I therefore welcome the fact that this amendment has been adopted.
The Commission' s position, which this report generally supports, is in line with the framework of liberalising the sector, like others in the field of electronic communications although, in some cases, it establishes regulations designed to safeguard the rights of users and of creators themselves and even fundamental freedoms such as the pluralism of information and cultural and linguistic diversity, which, it is acknowledged, may be endangered by this whole process.
An attempt is being made to bypass the regulatory role of the Member States, thereby strengthening the Commission's position and the independence of National Regulatory Authorities. The idea is to make them more dependent on the Commission, with the aim of creating a regulatory framework at EU level for greater coordination or even the harmonisation of trade rules, which will favour multinational companies in the sector and mergers between them.
It should be pointed out that this process is in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Summit, specifically in speeding up liberalisation in these sectors and with the Spring Summit, which is intended to assess this situation that is broadly characterised by the dismantling of the public sector and by the erosion of services of general interest.
We have chosen to vote against Amendments 23, 25 and 53.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as a possible way of achieving solutions to cross-border issues such as electronic communications networks and services.
However, we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions must be made as close as possible to those they affect.
In our view, it would be going too far to instruct the Member States to merge their various national supervisory authorities and require them to set up advisory offices for the general public.
Moreover, to compel the Member States to see to it that certain companies assign their management rights at the request of other companies seems rather illiberal in our eyes.
Because these issues are, in our view, better dealt with at national level, we have consequently voted against the above-mentioned three amendments.
Niebler report (A5-0062/2001)
Mr President, this is the third report we have voted on concerning the opening-up and regulation of European television.
Allow me to refer to it thus, even if European television does not exist yet, but it is on its way.
I should like to underline my vote in favour with a strong, loud call for the elderly and pensioners in Europe to be granted free access to television channels, both public and private, without having to pay anything if they are not well-off, because television is a form of culture, education and also company for the elderly.
Since this document by Mrs Niebler also regulates concessions and means of access to television broadcasting, this could well be made conditional on the opening-up of free programmes for pensioners.
It was not a good idea for the Directive on the Authorisation of Electronic Communications Networks and Services to introduce further qualifications for when the Member States can levy what are known as usage fees for the use of radio frequencies.
The additional qualifications introduced may mean an increased risk of limiting the Member States' opportunities to draw up sensible broadcasting policies.
I therefore voted against Amendment 21.
Nor was it a good idea to approve Amendment 27 and, in that way, specify that the administrative charges for licences must not be based upon service categories or the territorial coverage of the undertaking providing a service.
This limitation may do smaller undertakings a lot of harm.
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reports (A5-0047 and 0046/2001)
Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on both the report on control measures and the one on management measures applicable to fish stocks in our fishing industry.
The first report is a regulation on controls applicable to fishing.
I am sure that Mrs Jackson, Chairperson of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health, and Consumer Policy, envies Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
Why does she envy him?
Because, for all her enthusiasm, Mrs Jackson has yet to have a directive passed on environmental control, which has remained a mere recommendation.
Mr Varela, on the other hand, has succeeded in obtaining nothing less than a regulation to enforce controls on fishing.
Great credit, therefore, great honour, great respect - but also great envy, I believe, from other committee chairmen - to Mr Varela, as well as my compliments.
As for the other Varela report, this one about controls applicable to fishing too, when I read this document carefully it made me wonder: since the inspectors who oversee the enforcement of regulated fishing in Europe are paid out of European Union budgetary funds, why should they be national inspectors engaged by individual Member States and not inspectors depending on Community bodies?
Control is a very delicate and important matter.
If we pay the inspectors, we should also choose them.
How many of us would pay for a cinema ticket to have someone else see the film?
Maybe some generous soul, but very few.
That is why I say, in hope: the controls are good, but the controls and the controllers should be chosen by the European Union.
PiÃ©trasanta report (A5-0051/2001)
Mr President, the report by Mr PiÃ©trasanta concerns control of the tuna fishery.
Today, therefore, I must speak on behalf of the young tuna.
This is a serious statement because, according to the report, 55% of the tuna caught in European Union regulated fisheries between 1996 and 1999 were very young, baby tuna, weighing less than 3.2 kilograms, whereas they should have been tuna weighing 30-35 kilograms.
I shall have to give up spaghetti with tuna, which I used to like very much, but I call on myself and the pensioners who listen to me not to eat any more tuna for a while, until such time as the technical means is found to avoid catching juvenile baby tuna along with adult tuna, because they too have a right to life.
Gallagher report (A5-0044/2001)
Mr President, this report, which I have also voted for, is a follow-up to the previous report.
It is still about tuna.
On page 9 of Mr Gallagher' s report, we read that, with regard to tuna fishing, the provisions on inspection and control are too brief and weak. Indeed, it would appear that no Equatorial Guinean authority has carried out any inspection or control activities.
So, in practice, this document that regulates access for our fishing boats to Equatorial Guinea recognises that there is no control on how this kind of fishing should be carried out.
I therefore hope that these controls on tuna fishing are genuinely put into practice: young tuna are already being caught in other parts of the Atlantic, but in Equatorial Guinea there is absolutely no control at all.
We have voted against the overall report, because we think that the agreement with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea involves the economic exploitation of that country.
Consider, for example, the big difference between expenses and the trading price per tonne of tuna.
Instead, the EU should help Equatorial Guinea to be in position to exploit its fishing resources itself.
AvilÃ©s Perea report (A5-0058/2001)
Mr President, I too voted against this report and I am pleased that Parliament has voted against it - I would have been very upset if the opposite had happened - because, under the pretext of protective women immigrants, in fact, the report was trying to put through a principle favouring uncontrolled immigration, unregulated immigration.
We are not against immigrants but we believe that, for an honest, responsible coexistence to work, it must be stringently controlled and regulated.
As a temporary migrant to Brussels, then, I should like to take the opportunity to say that I feel deeply offended at the words of Deputy Prime Minister Michel against my Party, against the elected representatives of the Italian people, accusing them of being undemocratic.
Let the Belgians elect all the idiotic Deputy Prime Ministers they like, but he cannot be allowed to offend the Italians, the people of the Po Valley and their elected representatives!
Mr President, I too voted against the AvilÃ©s Perea report for reasons that can also in part be linked to those just expressed by Mr Speroni.
I should, in fact, have preferred more thorough regulation of access into the European Union by women coming from the Mediterranean area, who are welcomed by pensioners.
Elderly pensioners who are not self-sufficient need assistance, even if this assistance comes from outside the Community, and we know that women, by their nature, are particularly given to assisting the sick and the elderly.
It would be good, however, if this activity were regulated and if these extra-Community women who have come to help the elderly and pensioners, were paid wages directly by the Member States, regions, communes or public authorities, which should supervise and check that these activities are, in effect, being performed.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would like to express our position on Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea' s report and explain why we decided to abstain.
We believe that if a Parliamentary Committee decides to adopt an own-initiative report, the report should, on the one hand, be on a subject not tackled by other committees, and, on the other hand, be adopted as a result of a broad consensus within the same Committee.
That was not the case with this report.
Topics such as immigration and trafficking in human beings deserve to be investigated in more depth and should not be treated in such a cursory fashion.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will be investigating these issues in the near future on the basis of a Commission communication on immigration in the European Union.
The subject of globalisation was not tackled, whereas it should have been at the centre of the report.
Politically speaking, we are in favour of closer relations between the EU and countries bordering the Mediterranean. However, a concept such as Euro-Mediterranean citizenship, which has no legal basis, could lead to legal confusion.
Our position does not mean that the problem of female migrants and their standard of living in the EU does not give us cause for concern. We should, however, have liked this problem to be approached in a different manner.
Gemelli report (A5-0059/2001)
Mr President, how could anyone vote against a Commission communication that invites us to develop aid and cooperation with developing countries?
I therefore willingly voted for the motion, but I should like to stress to you, Mr President, and to all those who are listening to my explanation of vote right now, that I know it will be read all over the world, that the elderly and pensioners in Italy, particularly those who have joined the Pensioners' Party, would be only too pleased, once their own working life is over, to be welcomed with open arms, helped, backed and supported by the European Union to travel around the world helping developing countries, without getting paid a penny, just their travelling expenses, of course, and the cost of their stay in those places.
After working for so long and, at last, getting a pension, many would love to be useful throughout the world, especially to developing countries.
The current figures are proof of our resounding failure. Out of a worldwide population of 6 billion people, 1.5 billion have less than one dollar a day to live on.
What is still more serious is that the global population is likely to increase by about 50% by the year 2020, and almost 90% of this increase will take place in developing countries. It is to be feared that the current situation will further deteriorate over the next few years.
Yet, the European Union which, however, continually declares its solidarity with the poorest countries in the world and spends billions on helping them, has a severe lack of long-term vision for these countries.
We must gradually free ourselves from this policy and instead consider development as a multifaceted issue, so that eliminating poverty is a reality rather than just a mythical objective.
Development aid is not just due to a generosity tinged with paternalism.
For several of our European countries that are, in fact, former colonial powers, development aid is a question of strong commitment, which we must certainly possess.
If, however, this commitment is to be useful to the people concerned, we must rationalise our aid, reorganise our services and depend to a greater extent on local players, and I am thinking particularly of NGOs.
It is these ideas which provided inspiration for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and that is why I voted in favour of the report by Mr Gemelli.
Marset Campos report (A5-0049/2001)
Mr President, on 26 March 1991 through the Treaty of AsunciÃ³n, Mercosur was founded, a common market of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
The European Union served as an example and I am delighted at that, as I am sure we all are.
I have therefore voted for the motion, in the hope, however, that, in this cooperation agreement, some attention may be given to trade in the merchandise known as "pensions" .
So I hope that, in these agreements and in their practical implementation, the pensioners of Mercosur will see their pension payments controlled, supervised, prompted, and speeded up and that we will get from them whatever might be useful to European pensioners.
Following the expiry of an earlier so-called third generation agreement, the European Union has kept an interregional framework agreement in place with the Mercosur countries since late 1995. This framework agreement should by now have been replaced by a global agreement on interregional political and economic association, freeing up exchange, and encompassing Chile as well.
This is what the Heads of State and Government of both parties called for at the summit held in Rio at the end of June 1999. This new treaty of association has been delayed due to endless partial negotiations held up in turn by our insistence on prior agreement within the WTO framework.
On the other hand, there are those who wish the new agreement to be merely an instrument allowing free exchange between both groups of states. I agree that the economic and commercial association sought by Mercosur and the European Union is very important.
However, I also feel that the cultural, social and political aspects which must permeate the new association agreement are more valuable.
This agreement should currently have top priority in the Union' s foreign policy. We must not forget the history of Latin America nor the links established over the centuries between the various European countries who discovered what was then known as the 'New World' .
As a result, that part of the globe has inherited the same values concerning culture, religion and identity as the Europe we are currently building. It even shares with us that great collection of values and customs classified as 'Western' .
We must therefore strengthen bipartite dialogue at all levels. We should do so on an institutional, economic, social and civic, parliamentary, intergovernmental and executive plane in the expectation that the new full association agreements with Mercosur and Chile will be finalised at the earliest possible opportunity.
Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra report (A5-0050/2001)
Mr President, this is a cooperation agreement between the European Union and Chile.
I voted for the motion, and in this explanation of vote I cannot help stressing that, insofar as I am competent in the matter of pensions, I am aware of the problems we are having in paying pensions in Italy and throughout the 15 Member States of the European Union. I hope that the method first used in Chile of changing from a pay-back system to a contributory system can be introduced in Europe.
You surely know, Mr President, that in Chile there has been a pension revolution: whereas pensioners could barely live on the miserable pensions there used to be before, now, through investment in pension funds, regulated and controlled by the State, the size of old-age pensions has bloomed again.
So why should we not do here what they have done in Chile?
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting closed at 12.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 1 March 2001.
Tribute
Ladies and gentlemen, last week I learnt, to my great sadness, of the death of two former Members, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and Mr Lambrias.
They both passed away on 3 March 2001.
Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz was one of the great characters of the German Green Party and a fervent supporter of the anti-nuclear campaign.
She was Member of this House from 1989 to 1999, and, in particular, she was Vice-Chairman of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance of the European Parliament.
She was an honest political fighter and even those who did not share her beliefs always respected her for her unwavering commitment.
Mr Lambrias was a Member of this House for 15 years, between 1984 and 1999.
He was Vice-Chairman of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
All Members who knew him appreciated his human qualities and his strong commitment to European integration.
I would like to express my condolences to both families, to the Group of the Greens and to the PPE-DE Group and I would ask you to observe a minute' s silence in memory of our two colleagues who have passed away.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, as you are aware, there has been another terrorist attack in Spain since our last part-session.
During the night of 8 March, IÃ±aki Totorika Vega, a member of the Ertzaintza, the Basque regional police force, was killed in a car bomb explosion in Hernani.
On my own behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament, I have expressed our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victim' s family.
I have also sent a message to the Spanish Government stating our unconditional support in its fight against terrorism and I would ask you to rise and observe a minute' s silence to pay tribute to IÃ±aki Totorika, and to all the members of the security forces who work so courageously, often putting their lives at risk, for peace in the Basque region.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
You will also be aware of the terrible accident that took place in northern Portugal when the bridge at Entre-os-Rios collapsed, claiming the lives of more than 70 people.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I immediately sent our condolences to the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr Guterres, to assure him that our thoughts are with the Portuguese people at a time of such suffering.
I again ask you to observe a minute' s silence to show our respect for the memory of the victims.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting of 1 March have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, I refer to the speech by Mr Manuel Medina Ortega during the last part-session, and would ask you to consider the following request.
Since Mr Medina Ortega's speech concerning the application for the removal of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, a number of reports have appeared in the press, and rumours are rife in this House.
As the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we believe that it would be helpful if you, Madam President, put an end to these rumours by granting the request which I wish to put to you - although I realise that you are under no obligation to do so - namely to permit me to address three brief and very precise questions on this issue to you. The Members of this House trust that your answers will clarify the matter.
Madam President, I believe that this would serve the interests of the House itself and also the performance of your office.
I would therefore be most grateful if you would perhaps grant my request - and, I repeat, you are not obliged to do so - in view of the political sensitivity of this matter.
Mr Schulz, I do apologise but I do not fully understand which part of the Minutes you are referring to.
We are currently discussing the approval of the Minutes.
Is there something that you would like to be corrected?
Madam President, it concerns the speech by Mr Medina Ortega, referring to Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure in connection with the Spanish Supreme Court's application for the removal of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri.
Your point does not refer to the Minutes of 1 March.
I shall gladly reply to any questions that you wish to ask when we deal with points of order.
I think that it would be unwise to surreptitiously start to deal with points of order before the agenda has been approved, as this was something that we changed, to the overall satisfaction of, I think, nearly all Members.
Madam President, may I understand you to mean that you will call me again at the start of the discussion of the agenda?
No, this can be done once the order of business has been established.
That is now the time when we deal with points of order.
Madam President, with regard to the Minutes, my name is not on the attendance register of 1 March 2001.
I probably forgot to sign the register, but I did attend and I took part in all the votes.
This will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 March pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, I wish to raise a matter which is not, but should be, on this week's agenda - the foot-and-mouth disease crisis in Europe.
It seems extraordinary that this Parliament, which represents the people of Europe, is not addressing this question this week, given the deepening of the crisis since the Commission last spoke.
I obviously have a particular concern in that this crisis is threatening a EUR 15bn food industry in the Republic of Ireland because of the steps we have had to take to ensure that foot-and-mouth disease does not get a hold there.
It seems to me that this is a matter of concern not just to people in Ireland but to people everywhere in Europe.
I would ask you, Madam President, to take the initiative and request the Commissioner to come to Parliament this week to make an up-to-date statement on this crisis.
I am quite sure that we can find at least 30 minutes to enable the Commissioner to do that, and to demonstrate that this is a credible political forum for the people of Europe.
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.
The Rules of Procedure do not give me the authority to take this step.
A debate was held at the Conference of Presidents to determine whether this question should be included in the agenda for this part-session.
I would reiterate that this was already discussed, at the previous part-session of 28 February. In the end, the Conference of Presidents decided to let the Commission keep a very close eye on this situation and to hold a debate at an appropriate time.
This question was, therefore, very central to the concerns of the Conference of Presidents.
There has, however, been no request for an amendment.
Madam President, I would urge you to consider the position that now exists in relation to the foot-and-mouth crisis in the United Kingdom.
I respect the point you make, that this was discussed by the Conference of Presidents last week and given the situation at that time it was decided not to place it on the agenda this week.
Could I just point out the number of outbreaks in the UK yesterday was higher than at any time in the three weeks since the crisis started.
The situation is now out of control and even though the British Agriculture Minister is insisting there is no crisis, the whole of the EU views with alarm what is happening in the UK.
Ireland has a particular interest, but so do the French, as do all of us in the 15 Member States and beyond.
The situation has changed so much since the matter was discussed by the Council of Presidents that I would urge you to find time, perhaps during the discussion of the regulation you have just referred to, for us to have a Commission update this week here in Parliament.
Madam President, I would like to add my voice to those who are calling for an emergency debate on the escalating crisis with regard to foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain.
I am not raising this subject with the intention of embarrassing the British Government in any way, but I am extremely concerned for European farmers, for the British farmers who are bearing the brunt of the crisis at the present time, and, in particular, I am concerned for farmers in Ireland.
You will be aware that Ireland depends more than any other Member State of the European Community on the beef industry.
We export 90% of our entire production.
For that reason it is extremely important that the most severe restrictions are put into place in Great Britain.
I believe you should invite the Commissioner to come and give his views on the overwhelming crisis that we are going through at the present time.
I would ask you, as you have always done in the past, to find the time for an emergency debate on this matter.
Thank you, Mr Hyland.
From what you have said and in the light of recent developments that have caused the situation to escalate seriously over the last few hours, I am tempted to suggest that this request for inclusion be put to the vote.
I cannot take this step, however.
The House will judge whether this request is admissible.
This would, of course, be an exceptional occurrence, as it has never been done before.
The Rules of Procedure do not stipulate what to do in these circumstances.
In any event, however, the House must decide.
Madam President, with all due respect to the Conference of Presidents - which I also attend on occasion, as you have quite rightly pointed out - there should be an opportunity for emergency statements by Members of this House, especially when new developments have occurred.
So I think that - as you, yourself, have implied - we should be able to decide in a free vote today whether we wish to include an update on this issue on the agenda, contrary to the Conference's original decision.
There is one problem, however.
In essence, of course, the Council is also called upon to make a statement on this issue, so I would ask that, if possible, it should also be discussed when a representative of the Council is present, as this will hopefully give us the information we need for our decision making.
In this sense, I should like to express support for my fellow MEP.
I entirely agree with Mr Swoboda.
I think it is very important that we have some mechanism in the House to adjust the agenda when an urgent situation such as this arises.
The sad fact is that, although this particular disease affects only animals, it can be transmitted by air over a distance of some 200 kilometres and therefore any Member State within the European Union and beyond is vulnerable.
It is therefore a matter of urgency.
The Commission should make a statement, whether in the presence of the Council or not, and I urge you to put it to the House.
Madam President, naturally, what I have to say is in line with the comments made by the previous speakers.
The Commission has already given a statement at a point when the matter did not appear to be so serious.
There was no vote for a resolution.
In this instance, are we going to have both a statement as well as a resolution?
Personally speaking, I would be in favour of this.
Madam President, clearly the House will want to make its own decision on this very important issue but I should like to stress that at no point has the British Government not accepted that this is a crisis facing not just British farming and rural communities but potentially the whole of the farming industry in the European Union.
However, the outbreak is not out of control, as the remarks by some people here might give the impression.
Indeed, when Commissioner Byrne spoke in front of the House, he congratulated the UK Government on its swift, direct handling of this issue.
Cooperation is continuing to take place between the British Government and the relevant authorities in the Commission and throughout the Union, to ensure that the outbreak is controlled, contained and eradicated as soon as possible.
Madam President, according to the Rules of Procedure, which we must respect, you need not consult the House.
Rule 37 makes it quite clear that the Commission may, at any time, ask for permission to make a statement.
If the Commission is willing to make such a statement you do not need to put it to the House.
You can so decide under your authority as President.
The Commission has not asked to do this as yet, but I am sure that it will agree to do so.
Madam President, I did not really intend to speak.
I was there when, at the Conference of Presidents, we said that there was no need for us to hold a debate at this time, as we had already discussed foot-and-mouth disease last time.
Now that Mr Corbett has, however, albeit not denied Parliament the right to decide, he implied instead, as it were, that it would be inappropriate to take such a decision here, I would just like to say, on behalf of my group that in the light of recent developments, we all agree unanimously that we should have this debate.
We do not want to wait until the Commission kindly grants us a debate; we call upon the Commission to come here to Parliament and discuss the issue with us.
We send out the same appeal to the Council as well, and in this regard I am rather more forceful than Mr Swoboda.
We should not kindly request the Council; we expect the Council to make a statement as well, so that together, in the plenary sitting of the European Parliament, we can represent the interests of our citizens and our consumers!
Who is in favour, in principle, of holding this debate?
(The House gave its assent)
We agree in principle, therefore, to hold this debate and we shall arrange a time with the Council and the Commission for them to attend.
Madam President, I have been indicating for a long time that I wished to speak.
It is rather unfair that if you are at the back of the Chamber or if you are not at least six foot tall, you cannot gain attention.
I just want to make one point in relation to this whole issue of foot-and-mouth.
As one of my colleagues from Ireland mentioned, it cannot be taken in isolation because of the amount that Ireland exports.
European tax-payers are funding the live export of animals, which is just exacerbating the situation.
We have to stop live exports.
In fact, that is what is responsible for bringing it into Northern Ireland.
Luckily, the Irish Government has been able to contain it; the same goes for Britain.
So really we have to bring an end to European tax-payers' money being used for the cruel and inhumane policy of live exports.
Madam President, I have been asking to speak for 15 minutes.
You did not see me - you do not look in this direction very often.
I have nothing to say with regard to the content.
I think that there are many good reasons to hold a debate.
As regards the form, I do not agree with Mr Poettering - our vote would not contravene the Rules of Procedure.
We do not take a decision by majority that goes against our own Rules of Procedure.
There was, however, a perfectly acceptable solution based on consensus, without the need for a vote. If everyone had been in favour, this item could possibly have been included in the agenda.
Having said that, we are definitely not voting in contravention of the Rules of Procedure and I hope that everyone is clear on this.
Madam President, for some months now, European citizens have had reason to wonder whether their telephone, fax and e-mail messages are being treated as confidential.
We now know that the Echelon system does exist and that the US National Security Agency is, in all likelihood, the main user of the system.
For some days now, Members of the European Parliament have had reason to wonder whether the Commission' s internal communications are being treated as confidential.
At a meeting of the Temporary Committee investigating the Echelon affair, a senior official responsible for the encryption of confidential information said that he had always been on very good terms with the NSA in Washington and that they check our systems on a regular basis to ensure that they really are secure and are being used correctly.
He said that he was extremely pleased to see that the American secret service had tried for two weeks but had not been able to break the encryption.
If we take a lighter view of this, it is almost like a bank manager asking some safe-breakers to check that the bank' s safes were secure and, if they said that they were indeed secure, he would take their word for it.
I think that we can draw an analogy between this situation and our own.
The clarifications and denials made by this official' s superiors were hardly convincing.
I do not think that any Member here was swayed by them.
I think that this is, therefore, a political problem, not just an implausible affair and it should be cleared up in Parliament.
That is why we are calling for Mr Patten, the Commissioner responsible, to explain the current situation to us and we shall then decide how to follow this up.
Madam President, if I speak now, I will not speak again on behalf of my group, so I shall kill two birds with one stone.
I will not repeat what my fellow Member, Mr Lannoye quite rightly said - I wholeheartedly agree with him.
I spoke to you, Madam President, on this very same subject at the beginning of the month.
I think that we should respond to three requirements which advocate including this issue on the agenda for this part-session.
First of all, there is a requirement for timely action.
This is actually an issue that directly relates to Community life and which was raised last month, most fortunately, by the Temporary Committee and its rapporteur, Mr Gerhard Schmid.
We cannot, therefore, wait until September and for the Temporary Committee' s report to discuss this, as some Members are proposing.
The next requirement is for the truth. In the answers provided by Commissioner Patten and the Temporary Committee' s rapporteur, Mr Schmid, the explanations contradict the statements made by the official involved.
We therefore need an explanation and we need it now, not in September.
Lastly, I shall mention the requirement for Parliament to maintain its credibility.
Mr Lannoye reiterated the point that the media has already latched onto this affair and if we decided not to discuss it when questions are raised and not to give the facts in response, we would, more or less, be seen to be on the defensive and suspected either of wanting to cover something up or of being inconsistent.
In order to avoid running this risk, I think that the best thing to do is to include this item on the agenda.
Madam President, I have a great deal of sympathy with the substance of the arguments put forward by the two previous speakers.
It was really quite alarming to have to hear what a member of the Commission' s staff said to the Echelon Committee.
Even if only a quarter of what he said is true, the situation is extremely problematical.
I believe, however - and this is my group's view - that the Echelon Committee is there to examine these issues in detail and get to the heart of the matter.
So I would also support the expansion of the Echelon Committee's competencies, if necessary, so that it is able to undertake a detailed examination of these issues, which have, after all, been referred to it - even if some have been withdrawn again - and then present its findings to Parliament.
As a group, we feel that this would be a better way forward.
The issues are serious, we take them very seriously, but after detailed examination by the Committee they should be presented here and dealt with by us.
I do not think that we can open a debate on this issue.
I have received a request from the representatives of the two groups concerned.
Mr Lannoye, did you have a point of order?
Madam President, I shall not try to deceive you - this is not a point of order. I just wanted to speak briefly.
Mr Swoboda quite rightly said that we must carry out an enquiry.
I would like to say, however, that the Echelon affair is being investigated by a temporary committee and not a committee of enquiry.
Mr Lannoye has just clarified this point for us, so that we can all make an objective decision.
(The House rejected the request)
Madam President, I have a point of order relating to the Nassauer report.
Normally this Parliament is consulted on a Commission proposal.
By derogation from that, under Rule 61, we can deal with a proposal from a Member State government as well.
In this particular case, though, Parliament is to deliver an opinion on a position that has been adopted within the Council.
It originated with a Member State but we are not giving an opinion on the actual proposal which was put to the Council.
I am not seeking to hold up the Nassauer report but I would ask for the matter to be referred, in future cases, to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs because this is a very important precedent.
If, in future, we are going to deal with the changing target of the latest document within the Council instead of the proposal that initiates the legislative procedure, which we then normally seek to amend and where the author can take account of our amendments, we may be going down a slippery slope.
This could be unfortunate for the future and I would ask you to invite the Constitutional Affairs Committee to look at that.
I would hope that, unlike five minutes ago, this genuine point of order to make sure our Rules are properly applied will not be misinterpreted as a political manoeuvre to keep something on or off the agenda.
I am not seeking to remove the Nassauer report from the agenda.
Nor was I, just now, seeking to prevent us discussing foot-and-mouth.
My concern was to make sure that we respect our Rules of Procedure because they are the foundation of the powers and privileges of this House.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
You have, in fact, made a general comment about an item on the agenda and we shall take note of this.
It was a request for you to refer this to the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
Madam President, I would like to go back to the issue of the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON interception system.
Mr Swoboda' s wise words were music to my ears.
I glean from those that he is in favour of extending the mandate of the present Echelon committee.
Can the Group of the Greens count on his support if we submit a proposal to that effect?
Relating to Thursday: President.
With regard to Thursday and the debate on oral questions to the Commission on water management in Europe, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that this debate not be followed by a resolution.
Is there a speaker to move this request on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party?
Madam President, it was my group that took the step to make a request about the Commission' s statement.
I should like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to the fact that this problem does not only concern water management in a Member State, in this case Spain, insofar as everyone knows that a very ambitious hydrological plan is obviously included in the period up to 2008 which clearly contravenes a number of European directives, one of which is the framework directive that we adopted quite recently.
Yet, Spain is not the only country concerned. Similar projects exist in Italy, France and Portugal.
We believe, therefore, that it would be a shame if the European Parliament did not make a clear statement, especially when the European directives, for which we voted, are under threat and are also clearly at risk of being violated.
Madam President, I did not request the floor earlier because I did not think that I needed to explain the reasons why our group considers it unnecessary, at the moment, to propose a resolution on an issue which, as has been pointed out, falls within the competence of the Member States, in other words, the regulation of water resources.
Furthermore, I have just heard a completely uncalled-for comment which assumes that a Member State' s hydrological plan - which has not yet been implemented, which is at a stage of open planning, and which is still subject to new suggestions and development - violates a framework directive.
I am absolutely convinced - and this is also expressed in Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m' s reply to an oral question on this issue - that the Spanish Government' s hydrological plan does not only comply with all aspects of the framework directive, but that it respects it absolutely, and the framework directive will be an essential complement to the successful implementation of our plan.
Therefore, because this is entirely an issue involving the management of resources by a Member State, I consider a resolution to be completely unnecessary.
We shall, therefore, take a vote on the request for the debate not to be followed by a resolution.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus agreed.
Speeches relating to points of order
Madam President, I come back to my question to you, which I quite obviously raised at entirely the wrong moment.
I asked you earlier, and I should like to repeat this now, whether you are prepared, in view of the burgeoning debate about the process regarding the application for the removal of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, to answer three brief questions which I would like to put to you.
Madam President, I repeat, you are, of course, under no obligation to answer these questions, but I believe - as you will see from the questions themselves - that, together with your possible answers, they may well dismantle the obvious lack of clarity surrounding this matter.
So my request, as I said, is this: may I put these questions to you, and will you answer them?
Please go ahead, Mr Schulz. I would be delighted to give you as much information as I can about this issue.
Madam President, judging from the correspondence which I have seen so far, and according to the letters which you had delivered to Members' post boxes today, it is quite apparent that you, or the head of your private office, I am not yet entirely sure which - had doubts as to whether the application for the removal of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, transmitted to this House via the Spanish Supreme Court, was submitted in a proper and correct legal form.
The first question which I would like to put to you is this: why did you not consult this House's Legal Service about your doubts as to the application's legality or notify Parliament of your concerns?
In my opinion, the normal procedure in doubtful cases would be to consult this House's Legal Service, which, after all, is available to you in your capacity as President.
Secondly, you opted instead to consult the Spanish Embassy or Spain's EU representation about your doubts concerning the application's legality. You apparently referred the matter back to Spain's representation.
So my second question to you is this: why did you allow more than seven months to elapse without demanding a response to your enquiry?
If I have understood the sequence of events correctly, you referred the matter to Spain's permanent representation in August 2000. You apparently delayed until mid-February before requesting a response.
That is an awful lot of months!
Why did you wait so long, and what, in your view, were the reasons for the delay?
My third question is this: under the present circumstances, would you now be prepared to involve the relevant committee of this House - in this case, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which deals with the issue of immunity - and transfer the responsibility for this matter to that Committee, or do you intend to retain this competence yourself?
Thank you very much. I look forward to your response.
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
I shall give clear answers to the three points that you have raised.
First of all, I would like to reiterate that, according to the Rules of Procedure, the request must indeed come from the competent authority of a Member State, and the President of the European Parliament decides whether to refer the request to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and announces this decision in Parliament.
It is, therefore, the President of the European Parliament who takes the decision and it goes without saying that the President must be confident as to the admissibility of the request.
In this case, I had several reservations, since the President of the Spanish Supreme Court sent this request directly to me and, for several years, all requests to waive parliamentary immunity have been sent by the government of the Member State concerned, with the exception of Portugal, so we are very familiar with the process.
The Portuguese Government had actually been persuaded to provide us with confirmation that the legal authority in Portugal did indeed have competence.
In Spain' s case, however, the precedents related to requests from the permanent representation of the Spanish Government and the Spanish Minister for Justice.
It is, therefore, obvious that I was running the risk that the decision I might take would be appealed against, regardless of the question of the competence of the authority that sent the request.
This is not, then, a legal problem on a European level; it is up to the government rather than the European Parliament, in my view, or its Legal Service, to decide if the legal authority or the government of a country has competence.
The most obvious solution, all the more so because there were serious reservations, was to contact the government of the country in question, to ask if it could confirm whether the President of the Supreme Court can send this request directly to me, even though there is a precedent where this court had used the intermediary of the government several years ago, and no amendment has been made to Spanish law in the meantime on this issue.
With regard to the second question, the Head of my Private Office wrote with this request at the end of August, and I would like to make it clear that he did so on my instructions, as I myself was on an official visit to Poland.
It is not common practice to send a second request to a government of a country if there is no reply.
I think, moreover, that after such a long time, there would have been a great deal to say on this issue.
In any event, it is obvious that there is a problem, since, as you are no doubt aware, I have just received a reply from the Spanish Government to let me know that the issue is very complicated, so complex that it has been referred to the Spanish Council of State to decide, once and for all, which is the competent authority to issue these requests to waive immunity.
It would certainly have been unwise for me to take a decision, either on my own or with the Legal Service, as to which is the competent authority.
You are asking me if I would now refer this matter to the Legal Affairs Committee.
In response, I can say very clearly to you, Mr Schulz, that no, I would not.
I believe that it would be quite rude, when such a delicate question has been referred to an EU Member' s Council of State and to disregard the fact that this Council of State is looking into this and will come to a decision.
On the other hand, Mr Schulz, I can inform you that as soon as I receive the necessary clarification, as soon as the Council of State has come to a decision, which I hope will be very soon, as soon as the Spanish Government has informed me whether the President of the Supreme Court is competent in this area, and if it appears that he or she is indeed competent, I shall announce in Parliament, as soon as I can, that I am referring the request to waive the immunity of these two Members to the Legal Affairs Committee.
That is all the information that I can give to you.
Madam President, I would like to refer to the letter which you have received from Spain' s Permanent Representative, which you just mentioned.
I have been a Member of this Parliament since Spain joined the European Union on 1 January 1986 and, for the first time, this Parliament has established the precedent of a petition from a Supreme Court, not being delivered to the competent committee, but being replied to through the Head of the President' s private office, and the Spanish Ambassador' s letter addressed to the Head of the President' s private office, as if he were a second President.
Letters from the Supreme Court are not replied to by the President of Parliament, but by the Head of the President of Parliament' s private office, and the Spanish Ambassador addresses himself to the Head of the President of Parliament' s private office.
The issue has been referred to the Council of State, where, after being studied, a suitable response will be given to the petition.
If I were the Council of State, I would write a letter asking the European Parliament whether the head of the President' s private office is the competent authority to establish what the competent authority is.
No, Mr Medina Ortega, you are slightly mistaken.
There are several precedents.
As you will see, this will actually be very interesting.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo wrote to me to request that an exhaustive document be drawn up listing all the requests to waive parliamentary immunity and detailing the reactions given to them.
I believe that the House, as well as the Committees that have a particular involvement, will find this document very interesting.
It will show, once again, that almost all the requests, except for those from Portugal, originate from governments and that my predecessors were, in several cases, asked to take the same step as myself, that is, to request clarification.
In particular, there was the case of Mr Balfe, the British MEP.
There have been several instances where you will see that my predecessors Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Klepsch adopted the careful approach that I did.
I believe that this really is a very significant issue and it is very important because it affects all the Members of a Parliament whose powers, we must admit, have increased.
Members' protection is a particularly important matter that must be dealt with very carefully, and, I would like to make a serious point that our actions must be completely divorced from our relationships with the Members that these requests for waivers may involve.
Personally, this is the way I currently work and shall continue to work in the future, wherever these requests may come from.
Madam President, you have given Mr Schulz an answer.
I am grateful to you for that.
We must accept it, but we do not agree with it.
Mr Medina has now made this quite clear as well.
We will continue to pursue this issue.
We will be looking very closely at the reasons why this process has taken so long.
It is not only that the stages within the process are incomprehensible; the length of time involved is beyond belief.
But I would prefer not to continue this discussion with you during this debate, Madam President. Instead, I should like to say a few words to Mr Poettering.
I am quite astonished by his statement.
Yes! I am quite astonished, because I value him, I value him as a fair partner.
But this time, he has astonished me.
First of all, it is quite clear that Mr Schulz was speaking on behalf of his group. Mr Schulz spoke and put questions on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and did so with a great deal of courtesy and moderation.
Those of us who know Mr Schulz realise that he does not always find it easy to be so moderate and restrained, but he managed it on this occasion, in order to make the points on behalf of the Group in a clear and lucid way.
(Heckling)
Our full support for Mr Schulz!
Secondly, Mr Poettering, let me make the following point. I did not speak last time in Brussels.
You, however, said something in Brussels which is extremely dangerous. You said that this Group was going against Austria.
Do you know who else uses this argument?
There is only one person who argues along these lines, and that is JÃ¶rg Haider. He always says: "Anyone who criticises the Austrian Government is going against the country."
(Applause from the left)
I reject categorically - not only as an Austrian, but also as the present group spokesperson - any implication that anyone criticising the government is going against the country.
Our group has never gone against the country or against Austria.
(Applause from the left)
Thirdly, Mr Poettering, what greatly astonishes me is that, if you had a clear conscience, you really would be pushing hard for a decision to be taken prior to the elections in Italy, without any delay here in Parliament.
It was never an issue for our Group or, indeed, for our Italian colleagues who spoke out against it.
Mrs Napoletano did not say that we are against a discussion of this issue.
She was merely critical of the way in which the discussion was being conducted, namely on a party-political basis.
Our Italian friends have absolutely no interest in politicising this matter. What we cannot accept is that the timeframe is so long.
And if you, Mr Poettering, in particular, are genuinely interested in ensuring that a decision is taken, you must also be interested in ensuring that the decision is taken in the European Parliament now, regardless of the Italian elections. Otherwise, there will be suspicions that you know it could be dangerous for Berlusconi, and are doing your utmost to postpone the decision until after the elections.
And you could only quash these suspicions, Mr Poettering, if you were in favour of a speedy decision by this House!
(Applause from the left)
Madam President, Mr Poettering has often spoken out, in this very House, against personal attacks on other Members of Parliament.
I have always respected him for this attitude, in spite of our conflicting political beliefs.
Yet, in the speech he made earlier against the Socialist Group, he insulted a member of my group, Armando Cossuta.
I think that it would do credit to him if he refrained from making such unwise comments in the future.
Mr Schulz, thank you for asking this question.
It gives me the opportunity to tell you that, personally, there is only one aspect of this matter that is not clear to me; and that is the reason why the President of the Supreme Court did not use the intermediary of the permanent representative of the Spanish Government to send us his request, as he had done so several years before.
I must say that I did wonder about this.
You will say that this matter is not my concern and I should not have reservations - this would have been perfectly straightforward.
If that were the case, we could have, in fact, saved at least forty-five minutes this afternoon and we would not be debating this issue now.
Yet, you are asking me why the Spanish Government has taken so much time to give me a reply.
Well, I can imagine and, in fact, I can see today that it is because there is a genuine problem with regard to competence - it could be called a conflict of competence...
(Mr Schulz asked the President a question to which she replied) ...sent by the Minister for Justice and the Spanish permanent representative via the government.
It is very simple.
I repeat, the document that you will receive and which, I hope, will be very detailed, is actually extremely interesting and will give you details of the solutions found for all the situations which have arisen in various countries and the competent authority will always be noted.
I do not think that it is possible Mr Schulz.
I am sorry but you are overstepping the mark a little, and I have been very patient.
I am willing to meet to discuss this with you, if you wish, just as I am willing to see any Member of the House who requests a meeting.
If you wish, we can arrange a meeting so that we can continue this debate.
A number of requests to make points of order have been tabled.
Madam President, I just wanted to say to Mr Swoboda that he sometimes finds it difficult to decide whether he is speaking here as the Vice-Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, as a Viennese politician, or as a former Viennese politician.
I sometimes get the impression that his statements have more to do with the fact that there are local elections in Vienna on 25 March.
Madam President, in effect, the issue of Parliamentary immunity is controversial, maybe because the provisions of the Treaty were written 36 years ago and it would, as I feel, be appropriate to update them.
Unfortunately, this does not fall within the remit of Parliament.
In any case, we could take the initiative ourselves of adapting our Rules of Procedure to circumstances, for the Rules of Procedure are not very clear either.
Then, with regard to this debate, somebody said that the aim is to protect Parliament and that it has nothing to do with the Italian elections.
It may well be a coincidence, but this debate is taking place the week after the announcement of the Italian elections.
Madam President, I just wanted to make a brief comment on Mr Schulz's remark about equal treatment.
I am one of the three permanent rapporteurs on immunity issues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. All I can say is that we genuinely do treat everyone equally.
I also believe that your own approach in the Berlusconi/Dell'Utri cases is simply an expression of equal treatment.
I, myself, am working on a specific case in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in which we have been requesting a statement from the German authorities for nine months and have still not received a reply.
In other words, these processes are quite normal; they are certainly not unusual.
I fully support your approach towards these two immunity cases.
I genuinely believe that the treatment of immunity is not a suitable theme for political discussion in the House.
It is a legal, not a political issue.
That is an important distinction which should be taken into account in the debate, and I am most grateful to you for your approach.
Madam President, on a point of order.
In your legal tour d'horizon you seem to imply that at some point the UK authorities had asked for my immunity to be waived - or that is how it came through in the interpretation.
I should like to assure you that never happened, although I did give evidence in a case which involved a Member for whom a similar request was made.
Mr Balfe, I was referring to when you gave evidence as a witness.
My predecessor was not sure if the authority that asked if you could appear as a witness was actually the competent authority.
The British Minister for Home Affairs gave a reply that he had no objection to your giving evidence, as a witness, I would stress.
Madam President, unfortunately, I, once again, have to request the floor to inform you and the House of another tragedy at sea.
Last week, the fishing vessel Hansa, flying a German flag and with a Spanish and Portuguese crew, sank in the North Atlantic, off the coast of Scotland.
Six of the 16 crew lost their lives.
European fishermen have, once again, paid their tribute to the sea.
Madam President, I would like you and the rest of the House to be aware that the Committee on Fisheries approved a report on this issue last week which, I hope, will be presented to Parliament during the next part-session.
This is our contribution to this cruel profession, which is increasingly beset by greater insecurity.
Madam President, I would like to ask you, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to contact the families of the victims in order to express this Parliament' s condolences and solidarity, and I would like to point out that they all come from Galicia.
I would also like you, Madam President, if you can, to contact the British sea rescue services, whose members, risking their own lives, saved many others.
I shall gladly do what you have asked, Mr Varela.
Madam President, I too wish to speak once again on the subject of deplorable and avoidable deaths.
This time in memory of six Galician seamen who died in a tragic accident while working in Scottish waters a few days ago.
They are to be buried in their own country this afternoon.
At such a time, I appeal to the executive authority of the Union and to this Parliament to take whatever steps are necessary to help improve the living and working conditions in the fishing industry so that we can, as far as possible, avoid this type of accident which, these days, particularly afflicts the seamen of Galicia.
Madam President, less than a fortnight ago you spoke about a previous killing in the Basque country.
In the meantime, 57 people have been arrested.
The conflict in the Basque country bears some resemblance to that in Northern Ireland.
Despite many differences, I can say that Basque nationalists have tried to follow the Irish model.
The Spanish and French Governments unfortunately have not.
They hold the view that the only possible position on armed struggle and the underlying nationalism is to wipe them out.
Until the paths taken in London and Dublin become the main model for Madrid and Paris it seems that the political landscape will remain as it is.
You, Madam President, will continue to back the Spanish strategy, and I will continue to say what my Spanish colleagues dislike most.
That is a very sad reality.
Madam President, I wanted to take the floor in order to expand on your comments at the beginning of the sitting, and to point out that the latest fatal victim of ETA' s barbarity, the Basque policeman IÃ±aki Totorika, belonged to the Basque Nationalist Party, the majority political force in the Basque Country.
As you can see, terrorism is indiscriminate and also strikes at democratic nationalists.
As well as expressing my condolences and solidarity with the family and friends of the late IÃ±aki, I would like, once again, to express, in this parliamentary forum of the European Union, our complete condemnation of this latest attack and of all the murders and violent acts which the terrorist organisation ETA has being carrying out with a view to imposing its ideas through terror.
ETA claims to defend working people and to support a process of sovereignty and peace for the Basque people, and I would ask ETA whether murdering local councillors, cooks, workers and Basque policemen, kidnapping, extorting and assaulting people constitutes their peace plan.
How can anyone believe in a plan that does not respect human rights, and that does not even respect the right to life?
The Basque Country, which I come from, wants peace above all, and that peace can only be achieved through mutual democratic respect.
Therefore, on the journey towards finding this much longed for peace, ETA' s actions and any other type of violence have no place, are unwanted and neither help nor protect anyone, and the best thing would be for them to disappear once and for all and forever, so that we can move on to a phase of free political debate and free democratic decision making by all Basque citizens without exception so that we can decide on the best political future for our people.
Madam President, I notice that Mr Gorostiaga is no longer in his seat.
Like those who share his creed, who murder and then flee, he spits out his poison on this House and then disappears like a coward.
Mr Gorostiaga has reminded us that the Spanish democratic justice system has in recent days made a series of arrests.
Those arrested have been people accused of very serious crimes, of collaborating with armed groups, of apologising for terrorism and of supporting organised crime.
These people, who have been arrested on the orders of an independent and democratic judge, will have every judicial safeguard, they will be defended and heard, they will have a fair trial and, at all times, their dignity as people and citizens will be respected, which is not the case with the victims of Mr Gorostiaga' s friends, who are silenced by a bullet or a bomb, and who are, of course, unable to express themselves freely from the graveyards they are sent to by Mr Gorostiaga' s associates.
Very soon the Basque Country will have the opportunity to speak freely through the ballot box and then Mr Gorostiaga will see the results of the horror he brings to this House.
Madam President, just as Mr Gorostiaga' s speeches are a disgrace to this House, the abominations practised by his ETA friends and represented by him are a disgrace to humanity.
Madam President, I am not going to turn this into a procedural issue, but I would like to draw your attention to a situation which is taking place in Spain.
The company Sintel, which is a subsidiary of TelefÃ³nica, is in a very serious situation in which its 2 000 workers are currently shut in or camped out in the open air in particularly harsh conditions, demanding a fair solution in relation to their jobs.
On behalf of the workers, I would ask you to communicate this concern to the relevant committee.
Madam President, I came back yesterday from Palestine, from Gaza, where I attended the plenary session of the Palestinian Legislative Council which was able to meet for the first time in six months, albeit under certain conditions: the members of the Palestinian parliament had to enter Gaza using Israeli public transport, they were unable to use their cars, they were subjected to searches and many of them were prevented from reaching their destination because of the territories being sealed off.
On 7 March, in the middle of the night, 33 Palestinian villages - between Ramal and Birzeit, where there is a university - were completely sealed off by Israeli soldiers, who went so far as to use tanks and who dug trenches and destroyed 400 metres of paved land; 65 000 people are enclosed in those places.
These are actions which, in my opinion, we can in no way endorse.
I, therefore, call upon the President to make representations to Mr Solana and to present a protest at the way the University of Birzeit has been completely closed off.
The students and teachers of Birzeit had not opened fire, nor had they taken any other hostile initiative: they were there simply to study.
The situation has reached dramatic proportions.
Israel cannot continue to violate the Geneva International Conventions and collective punishment is wrong.
I do not endorse military or terrorist acts carried out by individual Palestinians or organisations, but collective punishment must be opposed because it is a form of tribal vendetta rather than a reaction.
I therefore call upon the President to champion a protest to the Israeli government and to ask Mr Solana to authorise an immediate intervention to bring about the reopening of the occupied territories and put an end to the collective punishments inflicted on the Palestinian people, and to bring about the reopening of Birzeit and its university and the restoration of this people's right to education and life.
Thank you, Mrs Morgantini.
I shall, of course, do what you have asked me to do.
Safe transport of radioactive material
Mr President, I am standing in for my colleague, Mr Mombaur, who is unable to attend as he is unwell, to give the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
The committee's opinion was originally adopted in April 1999, in the last Parliament, and was readopted by the committee in this Parliament by an overwhelming majority with the original wording. The draftsman, Mr Mombaur, noted that only two things had changed in the two years.
I should like to quote his comments that: "First, the Federal German Government's policy of ending electricity production at nuclear power stations after a further 32 years has shown clearly that, at least in the case of the transport of spent fuel elements, safety problems do not exist.
Secondly, it has been made clear that a change of government in one Member State does not provide a legal basis for terminating agreements concluded at intergovernmental level."
Six conclusions were adopted by the Industry Committee, largely of a technical nature, to emphasise the low levels of radioactivity and exposure involved, particularly in comparison with naturally occurring background radiation.
I note conclusions 1 and 2 concerning the Standing Working Group on the safe transport of radioactive materials in the European Union, which was established in 1982 at Parliament's request, which call for its work to continue and for its proceedings to be made public.
I am intrigued to see Commissioner Lamy here this afternoon.
Does this means the Commission is intending to extend the trade in nuclear materials beyond the boundaries of the European Union?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to express my warm thanks to all our colleagues on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism who have made it possible for us to discuss the Commission communication on the safe transport of radioactive material so objectively.
This is not an appropriate theme with which to score political points.
Let me make it quite clear, the most dangerous aspect of the transport of radioactive material today are the demonstrators on the periphery who cut the railway lines in half, dig out railway embankments, and do other similar things. At the moment, some of them are staging a 'lie-in' on the railway tracks in Germany.
That is far more dangerous than the transports themselves.
The Commission communication also makes it clear that in Europe, the vast majority of these movements consist of low-grade radioactive material which is being transported and used to benefit people, that is, as medical products.
No one can possibly object to that.
The Group of the European People's Party, and let me be quite clear on this, we will vote against all proposed amendments presented by fellow MEPs in Parliament, because we believe that in the Committee, we have worked out an excellent compromise which is worth defending at Parliamentary level as well.
Let me stress again, it is not the task of the European Union - as the rapporteur, my friend Konstantinos Hatzidakis, has also pointed out - to prescribe to individual Member States the type of primary energy sources they should use.
If the majority of Member States continue to be committed to nuclear energy today, however, safe and appropriate procedures must be in place.
I hope that the Member States will also genuinely fulfil their obligation to provide information, which is laid down in the communication.
This will be the next test for Germany, when, at the end of March, reprocessed material is due to be transported from La Hague to its final storage site in Germany.
Mr President, today we must assess what this report is about, which is the safe transportation of radioactive materials.
It is a response to the Commission's communication on recent changes to the International Atomic Energy Agency's transport regulations.
I say that because there were times during the debate in the committee when the central issue of transportation of radioactive material seemed to get lost in the wider debate between the pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies.
We should, however, thank Mrs Isler BÃ©guin for starting the work, and certainly our chairman Mr Hatzidakis for finishing it, so we can have that debate here today.
The Commission takes the view that the risk associated with transportation of radioactive material is low but that efforts should be made to inform the public and the emergency services of the safety of the transportation process.
A multi-annual plan should also be adopted by the Community.
We broadly support this view.
Sadly, in the former rapporteur's report, she took a position which included all dangerous inherent radioactivity, went against reprocessing of radioactive material and recommended that the Euratom Treaty be withdrawn and the nuclear sector be covered by a chapter about energy in the Treaty.
We in the PSE felt, as I said earlier, that this was a report on the transportation of radioactive material and had nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the nuclear industry.
That is why we made compromises and I feel at the moment that we have a balanced report we can all support.
On behalf of the PSE, therefore, I can say that we will support the two amendments that we tabled down in the plenary but reject the majority of amendments which either defend the nuclear industry as if no problem exists, or damn it as some form of devil-incarnate industry.
My group believes that the report as it stands, while not perfect, is at least balanced, realistic, objective and addresses the issues that it is supposed to address, namely the transportation of radioactive material.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has, once again, missed an opportunity to do some straight talking about nuclear energy.
It has, once again, side-stepped a fundamental debate on the safe transport of dangerous materials, as if nuclear energy were still the domain of experts and the advocates of nuclear energy and that the debate will, by necessity, be passionate and controversial.
I attempted to open this debate at the public hearing on 21 January 2000 when I was the first rapporteur. The all-powerful nuclear lobby pulled strings again, however.
Although the first report by Mr Maurice was never presented during the previous legislature, the report before us could have been a step forward but that will not happen.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted a resolution, with the full support of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which reveals nothing of the concern about opinion on the extremely sensitive issues surrounding the transport of radioactive materials, whereas my original report was perfectly in tune with the changing views of European citizens on these issues.
This is indeed a dramatic turn of events, which gives us cause to condemn the subtle workings of the agreements between large political groups manipulated by the pro-nuclear lobby.
So, despite the work we have done, the draft resolution before us runs counter to the original proposals and, as a Member of Parliament, I cannot agree to it appearing in a resolution; perhaps silence is tantamount to a crime.
Although on many points I had managed to achieve a fair number of compromises between Members who had worked on this matter and tabled amendments, all this work was smashed to pieces the day before the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism when the main groups refused to vote in favour of our compromises.
The main issues surrounding the transport of radioactive materials, such as transparency, safety and, more importantly, ways of reducing these transports, have been curtailed in the report that was presented to you.
The report adopted by the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is nothing but a paean to the nuclear industry.
As proof of the influence that the pro-nuclear lobby had in the drafting of this change, the amendments presented by the conservatives and the socialists are absolutely identical, word-for-word, as are the acknowledgements from the lobby to the Members, who have gone along with the whole thing.
They want us to believe that the transport of radioactive materials is not a matter for the nuclear industry and that we, the Group of the Greens, are in the wrong debate. I should like to see an end to this hypocrisy!
Although most radioactive waste often takes the form of small packages to be used in laboratories and medicine, this is not the most dangerous material.
In fact, the transport of radioactive waste presents the greatest risk due to the levels of radioactivity.
To say the opposite would be a manipulation of the truth.
Therefore, we are not being in the least bit provocative in raising the issue of the treatment of these radioactive packages, since we are aware that the entire policy on the safe transport of radioactive materials is based on packaging, which would be guaranteed against all eventualities.
Yet, we are aware that many radioactive products including the most toxic, such as plutonium, are being transported around Europe.
Is it a crime of lÃšse-majestÃ© to want to see an end to these bombs on wheels?
In my report, I tried to provide answers to these issues and to raise the critical question about the origin of radioactive materials transportation.
At this point, we reach the issue of the nuclear industry and of nuclear waste reprocessing in particular, since reprocessing in plants in The Hague and Sellafield is what actually causes most radioactive waste to be transported.
If reprocessing did not take place, radioactive waste would not be transported.
That is the simplest solution and it is possible, because we are aware that reprocessing is an economic and ecological anomaly, given what we now know.
The most recent development in the transport of highly radioactive materials is that waste from MOX-fuel processing plants is stored, quite illegally, in The Hague.
This means, Mr President, that it has been illegally transported as well.
There is no point in seeking to curtail the debate, as the report is trying to do.
We might improve it, on the other hand, by voting in favour of the amendments that I have just presented.
Mr President, I very much welcome this report on the transportation of radioactive material within the European Union.
As you are all aware, this is a matter of deep concern to the Irish people, who are particularly upset that there will be increased shipments of nuclear material through the Irish Sea in the near future.
The German Government has already stated that it is ready to restart the shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Cumbria, and the Dutch Government has overseen the transportation of two shipments of nuclear spent material to Sellafield in recent times.
The Dutch Government intends to carry out 17 more shipments in the coming years.
Fighting British Nuclear Fuels and the British nuclear industry is never an easy task - I have been doing it for many years.
That is why I am particularly pleased that the Greater London Assembly set up a committee last week to investigate safety concerns on the transportation of radioactive waste by rail through London.
Trains loaded with spent nuclear fuel from three nuclear plants in the south-east of England regularly cross London bound for the BNFL plant at Sellafield.
They pass through seven boroughs, including West Hampstead, Islington, Hackney, Hammersmith, Fulham, Wandsworth and Bromley.
Cartloads of nuclear waste are regularly stored at marshalling yards in Willesden.
The setting up of this new Radioactive Trains Investigative Committee will hear evidence from British Nuclear Fuels and Railtrack, as well as from representatives from local community groups on this very issue.
It is anticipated that this committee will report back to the Greater London Assembly by the summer.
The committee's foundation comes only a few days after a train carrying spent nuclear fuel flasks derailed as it arrived at the Torness power plant in Scotland.
I am pleased that the members of the Greater London Assembly are now equally concerned by the shipment of radioactive nuclear materials in England and, in particular, to the BNFL Sellafield plant in Cumbria.
I hope that politicians and local authorities in Ireland can join forces with members of the Greater London Assembly and other groups in England to intensify the battle to see that BNFL close down the nuclear white elephant of the Sellafield plant.
A separate but related matter is that it is high time for a full environmental impact assessment to be carried out on the likely environmental damage that could arise from nuclear shipments across the Irish Sea.
Once again, I call on the European Commissioner for the environment, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, to invoke powers under the Euratom Treaty to force an independent evaluation of the environmental risks to be carried out for the shipment of nuclear materials in the Irish Sea.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, on his report.
Mr President, I apologise for arriving a little late, but aircraft being what they are I am lucky to be here at all.
Like Mr Simpson, I speak for the north-west of England, where the nuclear industry is of huge significance - in Springfield, where the rods are manufactured, Sellafield, where they are changed back into something more useful, and Warrington, the headquarters of British Nuclear Fuels.
This industry is never complacent.
It recognises the concerns of people in Britain and Europe about the transportation of nuclear material and takes huge trouble in testing what needs to be done.
Its record in the transportation of dangerous goods is amongst the best.
There has never been a fatality in the transportation of nuclear materials and, if the industry has its way, there never will be.
The debate referred to by Mr Fitzsimons was one that I saw when I was Northern Ireland Minister.
It is tendentious and ill-informed.
It is also an attack - in which, if I may say so, the Group of the Greens is also involved - upon my constituents in the north-west and everyone else who works in this most important and significant industry both in Britain and in other parts of the Union.
This is not the time for a debate on nuclear power except to say that it is the future.
It is one of the greenest ways of generating power anywhere in the world.
The sooner we realise that the better.
I am delighted that my amendments in committee were significant in changing the nature of this report.
I have tabled some more for the vote tomorrow, along similar lines.
I am proud to be associated with the rejection of the original report and, I hope, the passing of the report as amended.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should focus on what the report actually says, for I think that substantial parts of it still show the hand of Mrs Isler BÃ©guin.
I welcome that, and I would also like to thank the Committee Chairman who finished the work.
No one would dispute that nuclear energy and the transport of nuclear waste fall within the competencies of the Member States.
Of course, if agreements have been concluded, they must also be adhered to, especially as far as transport is concerned.
Transporting radioactive material is not a risk-free business, as the report points out.
So I think that what the report says is important: firstly, the safety of people and the environment must have absolute priority; secondly, full information must be provided to the local authorities and community.
Many people in Germany, in particular, are worried at present; they are upset about what lies ahead.
Being able to voice their opinion and take part in demonstrations is part of that.
We are united in our condemnation of violence against people and property, because it is counterproductive.
For our part, let me say this: the proposal put forward in Germany by a politician by the name of MÃ¶llemann to carry out the Castor transports by airship must also be rejected.
It would certainly be impossible to comply with safety requirements and would merely make the transport of radioactive waste even more hazardous.
Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, you and I would probably phase out nuclear energy tomorrow, but we do not make up the majority in the world, or in this society.
So we should concentrate on this communication so that in the immediate future, the transport of radioactive waste is as safe as possible.
If we have then achieved what the German Government has set out to do, namely to agree on and complete the phasing-out of nuclear energy, the two of us might have attained our goal in a few years' time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should not actually have been discussing nuclear safety, but the sworn opponents of nuclear power have changed the report' s course.
The Group of the Greens do not want to understand the undeniable environmental advantages of nuclear power.
What a paradox!
It is obvious, too, that the Group of the Greens' position on nuclear power is based on the ideology of 1968, and they still refuse to engage in frank and honest discussion on the topic.
Their opinions seem to be fixed beforehand, and the facts have no effect on them.
The first version of the report was used as a chance for them to get on their hobbyhorse and oppose nuclear energy.
What is remarkable is that there was no mention, whatsoever, in the report of the Commission' s action programme, which contains many sensible initiatives.
Fortunately, after the amendments tabled in the committee, we have managed to return from a myopic position to one that goes to the core of the matter.
The transport of radioactive material is in compliance with the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Commission has consulted a working party made up of experts - not politicians, note - from Member States.
The working party considers that the modified regulations will give a considerable amount of additional protection, although the original ones were not regarded as in any way inadequate.
The risks are considered to be small and, thanks to the stringent regulations in force, accidents have been avoided for almost half a century. This is so despite the fact that certain, though by no means all, opponents of nuclear power try, irresponsibly, to sabotage the transport operation, for example, by loosening rails.
This makes one wonder who is responsible and who is putting public safety at risk.
I urge everyone to keep to the facts.
The Commission' s remark that the public ought to be told how good the situation is in the final analysis, is, therefore, more than justified.
Because nuclear power increases prosperity and makes for a cleaner environment, it is an inevitable solution to the energy question.
If the nuclear power plants in France were closed down right now, there would be a rush in this Chamber to look for candles.
Mr President, the report goes a long way to meeting our wishes, although there are a few points in respect of which we have tabled an amendment.
Given the sensitive and emotional nature of the topic, the Liberal Group sets great store by a realistic account of the facts, for example by reporting the very diverse expert opinions on the subject of radiation limit values.
Secondly, we believe it would be misleading to suggest that the nuclear industry act in a self-regulating capacity, especially when it comes to safety.
The nuclear industry, too, is subject to internationally binding safety rules on the basis of which consistent standards have been established with which all actors must comply.
Thirdly, recital e) is right to draw a distinction between, on the one hand, radioactive material which consists of isotopes for medical, industrial and research purposes - which makes up the lion' s share of such movements - and, on the other hand, radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels intended for re-use.
That is the most hazardous form of radioactive material, but, relatively speaking, it only makes up a very small proportion of the total.
The distinction between specific nuclear material and radioactive material in more general terms, however, is not clarified elsewhere in the text.
If the Commission were to look into all transport movements of radioactive material, this would duplicate the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is soon to embark upon a similar enquiry.
It would be useful if the Commission were to focus on the transport of nuclear material in the European Union, however.
Fourthly, my group opposes the fact that the wider topic of the duty of consultation, with regard to the transport of all dangerous substances, is addressed in this report.
This is not what the report is about.
The liberals do believe, however, that the local authorities must be consulted on the transport of radioactive materials.
The emphasis should then, however, be on compulsory prior notice of the transport of nuclear material.
Finally, we welcome the IAAE' s decision to evaluate its transport rules every two years and adapt them, if necessary.
We would like to emphasise that, in the interests of a consistently high safety level, the rules will have to be implemented by all Member States at the beginning of next year.
Mr President, first of all I would like to reassure both Mr Chichester and, perhaps, to a greater extent, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin. The reason I am representing the Commission here today is not that the issue of the transportation of nuclear materials has been transferred to the stealthy and all-embracing range of activities of the Commissioner responsible for external trade.
It is actually a far more innocent exercise involving the temporary transportation of files between members of the Commission out of concern to lend a hand from time to time. I must specify that I shall not be stockpiling these files.
Basically, then, the transportation of nuclear material, as you have just mentioned, is often approached in a rather emotional fashion, considering the context and the environment in which this industry operates.
We, in the Commission, therefore, fully appreciate the difficult task that you have had in summarising positions which are often rather contradictory.
We feel that the rapporteur, and also the Members of Parliament and the committee members who have participated in this, should be congratulated on this quite remarkable overview.
As several of you have pointed out in the course of the debate, the nuclear industry, like it or not, assumes a significant load in ensuring the security of our energy supply, and we must, therefore, accept the fact that this industry must undertake the transportation of radioactive material.
The key point we see in the report before you is the confirmation that the measures undertaken nationally and internationally provide a high level of safety in the transportation of this material.
That being the case, there is quite clearly a crucial need for transparency in this matter, as in all matters affecting the nuclear sector.
We acknowledge the need for precise and transparent information regarding the risks which the population at large could or can run. We support and are willing to promote this.
Despite the difficulties arising due to the nature of the material and the limitations necessitated by security considerations, like you, we feel it is important to step up the provision of information.
Obviously, this is an area that has never yet been optimised or perfected and, as Mr Piecyk mentioned, it is true that the States are first and foremost responsible for such matters, but that does not stop us working on measures to improve, for instance, the documents dealing with the transportation of such material.
It is not for us to deliver an opinion on the appropriateness of using reprocessing technology.
This is an essentially industrial solution which must really be decided on the basis of technical and economic criteria and in terms of the need to reduce highly radioactive waste.
