Those who think it will act as a deterrent are the humanitarian organisations, church people and those who have their hearts in the right place and who have to account for where their money comes from and how they use it.
Whom is it imagined will profit from this?
It will be the Mafia and other unscrupulous people.
Take a country like Afghanistan which is now almost surrounded by closed borders.
Pakistan does not want to take any more refugees.
There is no room for more camps in the locality, as some of us call it.
The camps cannot hold any more people, but there are always people who are obliged to become refugees, and they have to pay to get out.
Whom do we want them to pay?
The Mafia, or the church and humanitarian organisations?
If we increase the penalty, then we see the price rise.
People who have to become refugees will pay dearly for the proposal we are discussing now.
A heavier penalty will also mean that there will be fewer suppliers in this market.
Fewer people will offer to help future refugees. Those who remain will be the Mafia.
They will be able to charge their own price, and they will eventually have a monopoly over this area.
I understand that there are Member States which are very worried about this proposal.
I understand that the Swedish Presidency is alarmed by it.
I would urge them very strongly to use their right of veto in the Council and put a stop to it.
In addition, I would recommend that, in the discussion of the proposal, at least two things are ensured.
Firstly, a distinction should be drawn between organisations which intervene for money and for profit, and organisations which do so for humanitarian and compassionate reasons.
This distinction crucially determines the situation into which we put refugees.
Secondly, I think that it is important that we do not pass on our responsibility to just any old carriers.
It cannot be right for some employee of Sabena, Air France or SAS to be made responsible for assessing what should happen in an asylum case.
That is our own responsibility.
Mr President, the world is full of conflict and dictatorship, hardship and poverty and it is the innocent victims who pay the price.
Organised crime gangs with vast resources at their disposal are operating with impunity.
We need more international cooperation between law enforcement agencies.
It is no secret that in some countries politicians and the police are profiting from people-trafficking and tipping traffickers off when operations are about to be mounted against them.
Many of the issues being debated this morning, such as immigration, temporary protection for displaced persons and the level of harmonised penalties to be imposed on carriers transporting people without the necessary documents, are bound up with this dark world of conflict and criminal opportunism.
In the last ten years there has been an unprecedented rise in forced and voluntary migration worldwide.
The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo and elsewhere led to sudden large population movements and the need for temporary protection.
At the same time, asylum issues are growing in importance.
Last year 390 000 people applied for asylum in the European Union.
The United Nations estimates that the modern slave trade is now worth GBP 5 billion and 10% of illegal entrants to Europe come via the Balkan route.
According to the UNHCR my own country, Ireland, came third in Europe after Slovenia and Belgium in the number of asylum seekers it received last year, compared to the size of the total population.
Asylum seekers in Europe were mainly from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The number of applications from Iranians more than doubled.
These people do not get the welcome in Ireland that one would expect, especially considering our own history of migration.
It must reluctantly be said that the Irish have been less than generous in their acceptance of the population movements affecting them.
It is a new phenomenon to us, but it saddens me to see people that I believed to be decent and compassionate acting in a racist and xenophobic way - and that includes many of the people in my own constituency.
I say that with deep regret.
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List, I would like to announce that we are going to vote against the Kirkhope report and against the French Presidency's proposal, which is yet another repressive proposal on migration.
There is no doubt that the considerations expressed by Mrs Cerdeira, Mrs SÃ¶rensen and Mrs Frahm and by the last speaker appear to be well-founded, but in order to be able to evaluate the report and the proposal, we need to take into account a question of principle, and that is that we have reached the point where we are going to have to resort to fragmentation on the issue of immigration policy, for otherwise we would have to admit, or rather the Council, above all, would have to admit that it is unable to regulate this phenomenon or rather that it failed to predict what might happen, that it failed to prevent it and that it is still unable to regulate it through government proposals.
We are bombarded by proposals from the Council and the individual Member States which, on the one hand, say they want to create a common, overall immigration policy while, on the other hand, they are integrating and harmonising areas of repressive law, without defining in any way the contents and criteria which will be - or rather which ought to be - at the basis of the future European immigration policy.
We do not feel that the report and the proposal in question can make any contribution to the quest for an immigration policy; on the contrary, in our opinion, it is precisely these proposals which contribute to events such as the Dover incident, where human lives were lost.
We are just helping the mafia to grow richer.
Mr President, I would like to call to mind once again that the French initiative before us is aimed at combating illegal immigration, and I would like to thank Mr Kirkhope expressly for his balanced report.
The idea is to prevent illegal immigration attempts from the very outset - as a rule in the person' s home country.
At present, carriers are indirectly encouraging illegal immigration in that no checking of travel documents is carried out.
An attempt to enter illegally cannot be detected by the border authorities until the point of arrival in a Member State of the EU.
A simple and efficient solution is being proposed here by the Commission.
The carriers should check on departure whether passengers have the necessary travel documents or visas and, if need be, refuse to carry the people concerned.
To guarantee that these checks are carried out and at the same time take steps to discourage people from knowingly abetting illegal immigration, uniform fines should be introduced in the EU.
This is the only way to ensure a common and coherent stance as regards illegal immigration.
The proposal that the fines should be waived if a request for asylum is made, however, is counterproductive, since as a rule asylum is almost always requested.
For this reason, the fine imposed on the carrier should only be refunded if the request for asylum is subsequently granted.
It is perfectly reasonable to expect carriers to check the documents required for entry into the destination country along with their travel tickets or flight tickets.
This must be made to apply to all types of passenger carriers, including railway companies.
The carrier cannot, on the other hand, be expected to take charge of passengers' return transportation.
This should be handed over to the national police or other appropriate authority.
This is the only way to ensure that the persons concerned are really returned in a proper manner.
A criticism that may be levied at this proposal too, however, is that important aspects of a common policy on immigration and asylum should be considered within the framework of an overall concept and not sneaked into the legislative process prematurely as individual measures.
Mr President, firstly, I would like to associate myself with my group' s concern at this proliferation of partial and fragmented measures, which are sometimes incompatible with the Treaties and almost always incompatible with the Community approach, and about which we are uncertain as to whether they come from the Member States or from the Council.
As some speeches have demonstrated, these responses are dangerous because they offer false and apparently simple solutions to problems which are real and complex.
I believe these types of proposal - and we shall see more in the course of the morning - are completely unviable without a global framework which implements the decisions of the European Council in Tampere. It must implement all of them, as the Commission is trying to do.
The Council' s tendency to introduce repressive aspects, when the reference frameworks for an essential common immigration policy are still not clear, is a problem, Mr President.
The Commission has presented us with a document which intends to deal with the problem of human trafficking.
I would like the Commission to also provide us with a document which defines both human trafficking and common penalties, and that this should fall within the framework of a common immigration policy.
Mr President, we are going to penalise carriers who carry people lacking the appropriate documents.
This is good.
All traffickers in human beings know that they are committing a crime.
Absolutely all of them know it.
I do not believe, however, that we are going to stop them through this kind of measure.
I regret the rapporteur' s position on this issue, because our committee has normally shown a degree of unanimity in not accepting this kind of proposal.
Furthermore, with regard to this one, I have certain particular concerns which have been expressed here: the increased responsibility for control on the part of private individuals, and the serious and real problem of refugees.
I do not believe that carriers are guardian angels and they are not going to accept the possibility of penalties when they are helping people who are truly in danger.
I think we should bear this in mind.
Mr President, my group has therefore decided, by majority, to request the rejection of this proposal and for the French and Swedish Presidencies to ask the Commission to present a global proposal on a future common immigration policy for the Union.
Mr President, first of all, I am not against cooperation against organised crime and illegal immigration in itself, but I am totally opposed to carriers' liability in principle.
I believe it is a back-door privatisation of immigration procedures and, as others have said, it passes the responsibility for checking documents to check-in staff or drivers rather than leaving it with official immigration staff who should be well trained in a non-racist and humane way.
It is a pity that this service was left out of the Article 13 anti-discrimination directive by the Council.
I object strongly to the backing-winners approach of 'your money back' if you have transported a winner in the asylum-seeking stakes.
Like others, I also believe that this is an initiative which is wrong in pragmatic terms, being part of a piecemeal approach to creating a common immigration policy, which we have seen far too much of in this House already.
We must have the framework first and then look at how it is best implemented and whether such harmonisation is appropriate.
This fragmented approach is neither coherent nor sensible.
I would commend to the House the amendment which has been supported by three groups: Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 13.
There are other amendments to this report also worthy of consideration.
I shall be supporting Amendment No 12.
Mr President, the Kirkhope report is not a contribution towards a progressive common policy on asylum and refugees.
The obligation laid down in the Schengen Convention to return passengers, a practice that has failed and has quite rightly been condemned by church and human rights organisations, is to be extended and tightened.
Airline staff are already being forced into the role of auxiliary police as a result of it.
The Member States are simply creating the conditions that guarantee the profits of the gangs that engage in human trafficking.
If carriers who fail to meet their so-called obligations will in future be expected to pay a fine of up to EUR 5 000, one can imagine where this will lead.
The EU will become even more of a community of closed doors.
This is surely not the way in which we want to deal with refugees and immigrants in future.
More than 2 000 people lost their lives last year on the external borders of the Union, according to the estimates of the anti-racist human rights organisation UNITED.
This is a situation that is intolerable in the extreme.
If we want to go down the road of common European framework legislation in matters relating to asylum, then we must also see to it that asylum-seekers are able to come to us.
Otherwise, any directive, even one that is formally based on the Geneva Convention on refugees, is not worth the paper it is written on and fundamentally violates the spirit of the Convention.
Please allow me to conclude with a remark about my own country.
Unfortunately, the German Interior Minister today is one of the most important protagonists for a European policy of closed doors.
Germany is blocking efforts in almost all areas to make refugee and immigration policy more humane.
Every proposal from the Commission that moves in this direction is rejected by the German Interior Minister.
A proposal like the one we have before us on the table today would undoubtedly be supported without reservation by Mr Schily, since he breathes the spirit of defensive measures and tightened controls.
I call upon all of you here not to allow the spirit of a Europe of closed doors and defences against people who seek our help to win the day.
Vote against the Kirkhope report!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no question that we are all in favour of sensible management and control of immigration, including by means of protecting the external borders of the Union.
I believe that we are all in agreement as regards this and that there is no need to argue about it.
However, I think we also agree, on the other hand, - and Mr Kirkhope especially, as a former British Home Affairs Minister, will agree with me here - that we will ultimately not achieve very much with all these individual measures and that we are dealing with an area in which we are not seeking to solve the basic problems but, by taking small steps, at least to achieve something.
If this is the case, then it is also clear that our discussion must be as free from ideology as possible.
If we also agree, then, that we want an ideology-free discussion and we know that illegal immigration can never, in fact, be completely prevented - in other words, there will always be illegal immigration, no matter what happens - then, of course, we have to admit that we can ultimately achieve very little with penalties for carriers alone.
If we are in agreement about this too, then we must also acknowledge, Mr Kirkhope, that if we want to do something, then we have to engage in discussions with the carriers themselves.
I am currently engaged in discussions with representatives of the international transport trade unions and I think there is still room for finding common ways forward on this.
But when one speaks with these companies, Mr Kirkhope, one realises that your proposals are not at all helpful and that they attempt to frame the French initiative, which itself was already rejected by the carriers, even more restrictively.
At this point, I ask myself why we are dealing at all with a report that no one supports.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not everything that is legal is also legitimate.
Not everything that is illegal is also illegitimate.
We have spoken a great deal here today about crime.
In my opinion, however, it is not a crime to help needy people who wish to enter the EU actually to do so, simply because this is illegal; the crime is the closed-doors policy of the EU.
This is acknowledged even by the UNHCR.
In a study of those who traffic in human beings, the UNHCR found that the problem lies with the fortress policy of the EU and that the only way to change this situation is to open the borders further, not to introduce measures against the so-called smugglers.
There is a second problem that I would like to raise in connection with this report, which wants to call the carriers to account to a greater extent. In Germany this has led to racist behaviour, and has even led the authorities to call upon taxi drivers to behave in a racist manner.
They have said that you can tell if someone is illegal or not when he is standing on the German-Polish border and wants you to provide him with transport; taxi drivers themselves have no powers to check these people' s papers.
They have been told that these people are easy to recognise!
No human being is illegal, and one cannot possibly tell whether or not a human being is in an illegal situation.
A final point that has made me very sceptical is that, at the time when there were still two Germanies, the GDR and the FRG, in the 1970s, Germany' s supreme court reached a decision stating that people smuggling was legitimate, in other words exactly what I was talking about, and that it was even legitimate to demand money for this.
Commercial assistance to refugees, therefore, which you are more or less criminalising here, was at that time highly commended.
This makes me fear that the whole issue is being exploited, that we do not dare to take action against the refugees and those who have been made illegal, and therefore need new victims.
This is why you are seeking out those who assist refugees, irrespective of whether or not they are being paid.
It is they who need our support so that more people are able to cross the border cheaply.
Mr President, may I start with a remark on procedure.
These debates in Parliament on initiatives from Member States are somehow incomplete because there is a piece missing.
The author of the initiative does not take the floor and does not address the arguments of Parliament.
The Commission, I must tell you very frankly, is in a very awkward situation in these debates because we are not the authors of these initiatives.
We do not even have the right to present an amended proposal, we just participate in the debate.
So, it is difficult for the Commission to take the floor and defend the proposal, or attack the proposal, because, up to a certain point, we are sidelined in this debate.
Of course, I share your concern that a piecemeal approach is not the adequate way of addressing this very sensitive issue of illegal immigration.
We have tried to give some support to a coordinated and integrated approach to illegal immigration and to immigration as a broader issue but we need to address the initiatives that Member States raise such as the current one.
Therefore the Commission will confine itself to three main remarks.
The first, which perhaps is a pure truism, is that the issue of carriers' liability is a very complex and sensitive one.
Like some of the previous speakers, the Commission thinks that carriers' liability may be an efficient tool in fighting illegal immigration but the effectiveness of carriers' liability depends to a large extent on a well-balanced approach.
Such a well-balanced approach is extremely difficult to achieve because it is necessary to take into account the legitimate interests of all sides, not only the Member States but also the persons in need of humanitarian protection, and the interests of the transport industry.
Your discussion this morning and the discussion that is going on in the Council have shown that it is extremely difficult to strike a balance which is acceptable to everyone.
I do not think that we are privatising the fight against illegal immigration.
I must say that I see it very differently.
I think that the management of immigration falls within the responsibility of Member States, of public authorities, but we have to call upon civil society to be engaged in the management of immigration.
This broad concept brings not only the responsibility of carriers but also the commitment of NGOs into the common management of immigration policy.
So, we have one strict criterion to analyse the French proposal.
The initiative should be welcomed if it provides added value to the already existing provisions of Article 26 of the Schengen implementing convention.
The draft we are considering today is only a first step.
In the long run it will be necessary to go further and look coherently at all means of transport including freight transport.
Therefore, the Commission, for its part, will assume its responsibility on this issue and we will try to prepare the ground in close cooperation with all interested parties for a more harmonised European approach.
We think that we will be able to bring along a proposal covering all means of transport and built upon close cooperation with humanitarian organisations, with the carriers themselves, and, of course, with law enforcement agencies.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Temporary protection for displaced persons
The next item is the report (A5-0077/2001) by Mr Wiebenga, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof [COM(2000) 303 - C5-0387/2000 - 2000/0127(CNS)].
Mr President, I concur with what Commissioner Vitorino stated a moment ago, namely that, essentially, the EU Member States have failed to set up a European asylum policy.
In Tampere in 1999, the government leaders may have been brimming with good intentions, but they never got beyond drawing up a wish list.
The European Commission' s scoreboard, dating back to 2000, lists the necessary measures in a more readily understood format.
However, it already appears that the Council meeting of Ministers for Justice will fall short of the goals which have been set.
This also applies to the setting up of a reception scheme for displaced persons.
The present draft directive is the third proposal which is being presented to the European Parliament, no less than four years after the first one in 1997.
The European Parliament endorsed the first two, but the Council of Ministers is struggling to reach a decision on these.
It has never been exactly clear which Member States thwarted the proposals, as everything is done behind closed doors.
The Council of Ministers has remained silent, and that is once again European asylum policy at its worst.
This attitude is reprehensible, for we would do well to remind ourselves of what is actually at issue.
This proposal provides for situations such as those which occurred a few years ago in Bosnia and later on in Kosovo, situations in which the mass influx of displaced persons has to be absorbed by the European Union, situations in which people are being driven away from house and home, where villages are burned to the ground and where people are at their wit' s end.
This affects hundreds of thousands of people at the same time.
Of course, they deserve a dignified reception.
Of course, the European Member States should share out the responsibility fairly and squarely by making sound agreements.
This has not happened to a satisfactory level in the past.
And we can already foresee that, when a similar tragedy soon strikes Macedonia or maybe Algeria, the European Union will, once again, not be prepared.
Mr President, the European Commission has done a good job.
The present proposal outshines the previous two proposals.
The sharing of responsibility among the Member States has now been included in the scheme and is now inextricably linked to it.
That aspect, therefore, will enter into effect at the same time as the rest of the scheme.
And there are many other aspects which have been arranged far more efficiently than in the previous proposals but which I will not elaborate upon at this stage.
That is the good news.
I would now like to mention a few aspects where there is room for improvement.
The first thing that springs to mind is the link with the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, particularly the key principle of it, namely the non- refoulement principle, the principle that refugees cannot simply be returned home.
This must be spelled out more clearly in the proposal.
The Council of Ministers must be tied down to deadlines when it takes decisions on the implementation of the temporary protection of displaced persons, and the European Parliament - this, too, is an old complaint, Mr President - must be more involved in the decision-making process.
The proposal falls short in one area: that of the sharing of responsibility - we used to talk about the sharing of the burden, this is now referred to as the sharing of responsibility - between the Member States.
What is at issue here is which Member States make what effort with regard to the reception of the large numbers of displaced persons.
In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo, countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria received large numbers of displaced persons, whilst other Member States did too little.
The Commission now proposes, first of all, to share the financial burden on the basis of the Refugee Fund.
Mr President, it is my conviction as your rapporteur that this aspect really needs to be reinforced.
This is first of all about implementing the EC Treaty which expressly stipulates that the Council must help strike a balance between the efforts of the Member States in this field.
The word 'balance' encompasses more than the word 'solidarity' which is in the proposal at present.
More than anything, we need to distribute the displaced persons across the Member States proportionately: hence Amendments Nos 4 and 11.
I naturally hope that these will be adopted by this House.
Also, the provision must be deleted whereby Member States can opt out altogether from receiving displaced persons.
Quite the reverse: every Member State must be able to justify its supply of reception facilities very well, and that is set down in Amendments Nos 31 and 32.
Mr President, all things considered, we have a reasonable proposal before us which this House will hopefully be able to accept.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, behind the incredibly complicated title of the draft directive lies a relatively straightforward problem.
What we are dealing with here is the issue of sharing the burden of receiving refugees from civil wars.
It is as if the awkwardness of the title in itself makes it clear just how uncomfortable the underlying issue is for Europeans.
The way in which Europeans have so far handled the issue of burden sharing can only be described as a complete tragedy.
The problem is one that we have been familiar with for many years.
We know from painful experience what happens when civil wars break out in an area such as the former Yugoslavia, and people flee in their tens and hundreds of thousands - and, of course, they go wherever they can be sure of being safe from persecution and war.
In the past, this has meant especially Austria, but also Italy, the Netherlands and Germany.
In the Bosnian war, for example, my country received more than twice as many refugees as all other countries put together.
This is the reason why those concerned have been pressing for a solution to this problem for years.
But so far this has not been enough to make the Council produce anything more than declarations of solidarity with those receiving refugees.
May I remind you of the very unfortunate attempts of Commissioner Vitorino' s predecessor, Mrs Gradin.
Those interested might care to take a look at these.
This is why I am grateful to you, Mr Vitorino for taking up these problems energetically after Tampere.
I would like to add that, unlike the previous agenda item, this is not an initiative by a Member State but an initiative of the Commission and the Commissioner responsible.
To that extent, you are also responsible for it.
Much as I welcome what you have done in principle, I also have some objections concerning particular details.
The issue of burden sharing is tied to one single problem.
Will it or will it not be made a rule that all Member States must receive refugees?
If, Mr Vitorino, you adhere to the principle known as two-sided voluntary action, meaning that refugees should be able to decide for themselves which Member State they wish to enter, and that Member States should only take in refugees voluntarily, then everything will remain exactly as it is and absolutely nothing will change.
The burden of receiving refugees simply cannot be offset by financial contributions.
The first thing that has to happen is that Member States should not to be able to back out by making a financial contribution; instead it should be obligatory for all Member States actually to take in refugees according to a certain system. This system would, of course, take into account the absorptive capacity of each country and all other conceivable viewpoints; it would also, of course, ensure that families are not torn apart and also, of course, on a quota basis, take into account the wishes of the refugees themselves.
But it must be laid down in writing that every Member State has a duty to make a personal contribution in terms of receiving refugees.
This is the first weak point in your draft.
Thankfully, this has been corrected by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and I hope that Parliament will go along with the opinion of the Home Affairs Committee.
The second point, Mr Vitorino, relates to family reunification.
The indeterminate concept of the family that you use cannot be imposed upon all the Member States.
Those wishing to permit the entry and residence of all eligible relatives in addition to the core family may do so.
Member States cannot, however, be forced to do this; it must be included on an optional basis.
This is our second serious objection.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, on his report, which gets to the heart of the problem we are facing at the moment: temporary protection for people in the most difficult circumstances.
I regret that Mr Nassauer has ignored what the rapporteur said about the use of language and has talked about "burden sharing", because the issue is actually how different Member States accept their responsibilities and try to treat people in very desperate circumstances fairly.
The rapporteur also referred, quite rightly, to the Kosovo crisis, in which Member States failed to take on their responsibilities and poorer states, such as Albania, were left to deal with large numbers of refugees.
With the new mechanism that should be avoided.
If there is a mass influx of refugees into the Community, Member States will have agreed in advance to share the responsibility.
This temporary protection needs to cover not only spontaneous mass influxes into the Community territory but also non-spontaneous influxes, when people have been airlifted out of difficult areas by Member States, or perhaps other parties, and possibly assisted to come to the EU.
We must ensure that appropriate provisions are in place.
Another very important point on which my group has tabled an amendment, Amendment No 44, concerns the speed and the workings of the directive.
When a refugee crisis occurs, it is absolutely imperative that the Member States act as quickly as possible.
I applaud the rapporteur for introducing a time limit for the Council decision.
However, my group has tabled an amendment to bring that forward.
We do not believe that three months is acceptable.
We are asking that it should be one month.
I am fully aware of the logistical and organisational difficulties that this presents, but action needs to be immediate and an emergency Council meeting is a small price to pay for ensuring that those in need receive protection.
Amendments Nos 45 and 46 concern the rights of individuals.
When they are in Member States they have the right to asylum and protection.
We should ensure that these people are not forced to return to their countries if that is going to create desperate problems for them.
Member States must try to do more to integrate refugees into society.
Young people should be put into education and adults given the opportunity to work as quickly as possible, so they can be seen as active and useful participants in society.
We hope that situations like Kosovo will not happen again, but if they do we must ensure that we are prepared.
My group will be supporting this with the amendments to which I have just referred.
Mr President, I welcome Mr Wiebenga's report, not only for its strengthening of the practical arrangements for sharing responsibility for Kosovo-type situations which I am sure our citizens can relate to as a demonstration of European solidarity, but also for Mr Wiebenga's insistence that a regime of temporary protection must not undermine and become a substitute for the Geneva Convention and the rights of beneficiaries to apply for asylum.
Mr Wiebenga has added some useful, strengthening amendments to the clause already in the Commission proposal: for instance, on insisting on non-refoulement, to insist that the Dublin Convention shall not apply and that the host Member State shall consider the asylum application, and on the involvement of UNHCR.
All these are to be welcomed.
I am sorry that the PPE-DE Group insisted on forcing amendments to the article on family reunion.
I feel the clause about unmarried partners which says that Member States may admit an unmarried partner if the legislation of the Member State treats unmarried couples in the same way as married couples is slightly perverse.
I would have thought that it would be rather odd to treat them differently if domestic legislation did not.
The other point I want to make is the contrast between Mr Wiebenga's report and the previous one by Mr Kirkhope.
Mr Wiebenga's report is based on a Commission proposal in line with the Tampere conclusions and the scoreboard.
It passed through our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs constructively, without major dissension and results in a report which sensibly improves the Commission proposals.
What a contrast to the series of Members States' proposals.
Mr Vitorino said politely what many of us in Parliament are saying rather more rudely, that the Council and Member States need to get their act together on asylum and immigration.
Mr Wiebenga's report has been a model of how we can work constructively between the Commission and Parliament.
All we need is the Council to work as constructively with us.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate rapporteur Wiebenga on his report.
With the mass influx of immigrants who escaped the conflicts and the attendant dangers in former Yugoslavia, Europe was, for the first time since the Second World War, faced with forced migration on a scale which was, both qualitatively and quantitatively, outside the range of our experience hitherto.
The draft legal framework for temporary protection in the case of mass immigration has been developed in the past decades and varies from Member State to Member State. They apply different social rights schemes which people enjoy during temporary protection.
Some Member States recognise the right to work and family reunification, others do not.
The new Commission proposal includes all the conclusions of the Treaty of Amsterdam' s implementation and reproduces the discussions in the Council, as well as the response of the Member States to the refugee crisis in and around Kosovo.
The proposal forms part of the recent Commission initiatives with regard to the asylum policy on account of the new Convention.
However, the NGOs have expressed concern that a temporary protection scheme might undermine the international policy for the protection of refugees if no guarantee is given that sufficient precautionary measures have been taken to prevent misuse.
The Commission recognises this risk when it states that temporary protection is a responsibility which is of crucial importance to the European Union, but it needs to spell out that it does not intend to undermine the protection of refugees.
We therefore share the rapporteur' s opinion that the proposal for a directive contains a considerable number of improvements on the previous two proposals.
The sharing of the burden among the Member States is no longer separate from the stipulations.
Despite this, I would like to quote a critical example: let us not forget the refugees in Sangatte and Calais, who are desperate for temporary protection provision for displaced persons.
Mr President, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for his report and the Commission for the fact that this proposal has finally been presented and will hopefully soon be put into effect.
And I was so glad to hear Mr Nassauer use the word solidarity.
I thought it was a good word until I realised what he meant.
It was solidarity with ourselves.
It is interesting that Mr Nassauer - and the PPE-DE Group, I assume - think that this proposal should primarily be about distributing the burden.
I thought it was supposed primarily to be about saving people's lives, that is to say the lives of people who are victims of war or civil war or other similar events leading to mass displacement and the need for aid.
It is, of course, absurd, really. The world's poorest countries in Asia and Africa do not need special rules on mass displacement, but that is what we need in the rich, well-organised EU.
That is how matters stand, however.
The authorities in our countries have not been able to demonstrate sufficient flexibility within the present rules, and this proposal is therefore clearly necessary.
There are still a few problems with the proposal, I think, but, when all is said and done, my group will end up supporting the report and, thus, this initiative, because it is so patently necessary that we get it implemented quickly.
And I will, at any event, do everything I can to prevent the issue of burden sharing' s being made into something which can turn victims of catastrophe into hostages in our own internal battles and our solidarity with ourselves.
There is a need for solidarity in this world, not with ourselves but with the world outside.
Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which really addresses the problem, and to thank him for it.
Austria has always played an important part when it comes to receiving refugees and displaced persons, and has also contributed more than its fair share to solving the resultant problems.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Nassauer for adding to what the rapporteur has said in this respect.
However, it is high time a satisfactory pan-European solution was found to this problem. It is not enough just to call for solidarity between all the Member States.
As regards reception of persons by the Member States, the Commission proposal only talks about Community solidarity, but this concept needs to be firmed up in the spirit of Article 63(2)(b) of the Treaty.
The purpose of the directive as described in Article 1 should also include the idea that displaced persons should be allocated to the Member States with due regard for their absorptive capacity.
However, the solidarity mechanism operating between the Member States should also cover both aspects, that is to say both the financial and personal aspects of solidarity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point I would like to return to the two points on which we are critical of the Commission proposal.
The first is the issue of dual optionality in the allocation of refugees from civil wars, that is to say the possibility that a refugee has to select a country, and a country's right to reject any refugee.
The founding fathers created the 'European home' as a place for solidarity, above all.
This solidarity can still be seen today, for example when European funding is used to support structurally weak regions.
So not only is the call for more equitable burden sharing as regards receiving refugees justified, but also burden sharing itself is an expression of solidarity between the peoples of Europe.
As various Members have already pointed out, only a few Member States bore a share of the burdens resulting from the civil wars in former Yugoslavia.
It is all very easy for Mrs Frahm to talk big, because she comes from a country which has not, so far, exactly distinguished itself when it comes to such acts of solidarity.
Unlike the governments at the Nice Summit, we, as directly elected Members of the European Parliament, are obliged here to overcome national differences and to opt for a European solution founded upon a quota-based allocation of refugees in accordance with Member States' absorptive capacity.
Otherwise, dual optionality will render the positive approach adopted in the Commission's proposal superfluous.
The second important point is family reunification.
Here, too, a fundamental principle of our Community is at stake - subsidiarity.
Today it will be decided whether the EU should reserve for itself, in a centralist way, the process of defining and regulating what constitutes a family, or whether in the first place the concept of a nuclear family, which is common to all Member States, should be taken as a basis, with regulations going any further than that being at Member States' discretion.
The compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, provides for the latter.
This follows this House's tradition of fighting the attempts of the Brussels bureaucracy to arrogate to itself the powers of the Member States.
Today, you have a chance to demonstrate what this concept of subsidiarity means to you.
I urge you to vote for the fair traditions of this House and for the fundamental principles of our Community of values, and not to be swayed by purely national interests and party political calculations.
I urge you, when it comes to these important issues, to vote for Mr Wiebenga's compromise amendments.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the effort he has made to improve this report.
In recent years, Europe has had to face situations which we thought had been eradicated once and for all in our part of the world.
In view of these events, I believe that we can no longer ignore our moral and political obligation to establish mechanisms to deal with a humanitarian catastrophe, when all other prevention mechanisms fail.
The European Union must act as one on this.
I wish to say on behalf of my group that we are in favour of distributing responsibilities amongst the Member States.
I am not going to use the word burden because, having seen the faces of men and women in refugee camps in Macedonia, who are just like you and me, Mr President, it seems to me to be horrendous and repugnant to call them a burden.
I believe that it in doing this we must take clear account of the situation and show a degree of flexibility, which the rapporteur acknowledges, simply to listen to the will of the refugees and to prevent them, as a result of their temporarily weak position, from effectively becoming a burden to be transported to where we, completely regardless of their views, decide.
I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the effort which he has made to clarify the time periods, to clarify that, in this case, it is especially important to respect the time periods within which things are decided, and to support the amendment which our group has presented in order to specify and to reduce these time periods.
In relation to family reunification, I wish to say to Mr Nassauer that I do not understand this obsession you have.
The Right has convinced us, even the most stubborn of the Leftists, that the family is a necessary asset and an important pillar of our society.
Is this only the case for Europeans?
Mr Nassauer, are you on the Right going to leave your mother or brother in a situation of special need if a violent situation arises in your countries?
Can we not, for temporary protection, take account of these especially serious situations which can cause particular anguish, and bring these people to the European Union together with their families?
I truly believe that we can take account of them.
With regard to the definition of the family, it seems to me that the Commission' s position that each Member State should apply its own definition of the family is more than reasonable and we are going to support this position.
I hope that the Council does not make us wait another four years for a decision on this issue.
I believe that Mr Wiebenga did not realise that he was taking on such a great responsibility when he produced his first report and that he will not mind being rapporteur for this issue for life.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Wiebenga for his sterling work.
I can tell you that it is a very rare occasion indeed when all Dutch groups agree on refugee policy.
Although we offer our unqualified support to the report as a whole, my group would now also like to make a few observations, of which I should like to mention two.
The first concerns the much-debated Article 13(1).
The Commission suggests that Member States which equate unmarried couples with married couples in their national legislation should also do so in the case of family reunification.
It is not, therefore, a matter of imposing family law standards, but about equal treatment within a Member State.
It is, in my view, a modest proposal, but it touches upon an important principle.
I am, therefore, disappointed that this is being played down in the report, more specifically in Amendment No 22, which turns this modest proposal into an empty statement.
It now claims that Member States are entitled to reunify unmarried couples.
That does not require European agreement, for that is already the case now.
The Commission proposal relies on solidarity among Member States and their generosity in offering reception capacity, but there is no big stick.
The rapporteur attempts to make the reception scheme less non-committal, and I support him on that, but solidarity is not given any financial leverage.
Like the rapporteur and some others here, I am convinced that a sharing of the financial responsibility at European level is necessary to prevent Member States from passing the buck to one another.
I also believe that it is unwise to start moving people around unnecessarily.
Pursuant to Article 24, the Refugee Fund has to provide for financial solidarity.
But this fund has a maximum of EUR 10 million annually at its disposal for displaced persons.
That just about covers the cost of two tents and a hot-water bottle.
Unless this fund grows substantially, I fear for Europe' s hospitality.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive defining a European temporary protection regime in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons from third countries replaces the proposals for joint action on the same subject that we discussed in 1997 but that were not implemented because of what I regard as justified reservations on the part of several Member States.
Unfortunately, although today's proposal is more flexible on certain points, it remains open to several serious criticisms.
The first is that to introduce this temporary protection comes down to creating a second status. That status is parallel to the status of refugee, of beneficiary of political asylum recognised under the 1951 Geneva Convention, but much broader than that.
The beneficiaries under this new system would not just be persons who satisfy very specific criteria for the grant of political asylum but also very broad categories of third-country nationals who apparently had to leave their country of origin for a variety of reasons.
Article 63(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam does indeed provide for the introduction of this kind of regime, but it refers only to temporary protection.
The Commission proposal, however, although theoretically confined to protection for not more than two years, risks creating de facto situations very likely to continue for longer than that, since provision is made only for the voluntary departure of the persons concerned.
We regard that as a serious defect of the Commission's proposal.
Our second major criticism is that although the States must give their assent to the physical allocation of the protected persons - which represents some progress over the earlier version - the new text seems, in fact, to absolve the Member States of their responsibility.
This problem could have been avoided if the basic decision by the Council to launch the temporary protection regime had been taken unanimously.
But the Commission proposal only provides for a qualified majority decision, which, in our view, was not legally necessary and basically seems quite inadequate for such a serious issue.
Mr President, within this disordered debate on certain aspects of immigration, we are dealing with a proposal for a directive of great importance because it attempts to regulate the fair and coordinated efforts which the Member States are obliged - and I stress, obliged - to make to receive displaced people and refugees from third countries.
Let us not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with a humanitarian problem of the highest order.
Nobody wants to abandon their land, their culture or their family.
The first question is therefore how to understand and show solidarity, so that we can assist these people and make their terrible situation less burdensome.
As well as immediately meeting their humanitarian needs, we also face the problem of where to place these refugees, as this debate is demonstrating.
Is it a proper solution to distribute them numerically according to a system of quotas, thereby replacing the two-fold principle of respecting the will of the Member States and of the refugees themselves?
I sincerely believe not.
Would it not be fairer to use the European Fund for Refugees, as Spain proposed, and give it more financial resources than it has at the moment, in order to help the Member States receiving more refugees?
I believe so.
The problem is also that a great number of asylum requests are rejected because they do not come from genuine political refugees, but from economic immigrants.
As is also being demonstrated here, we are facing a very confused debate in which there is no definition of the different types of economic immigration as opposed to those involving asylum for humanitarian or political reasons.
The issue is to resolve the problems created by the current asylum procedure, and thereby make the number of asylum seekers much more reasonable and make the distribution of responsibilities fairer.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that those people who have committed criminal acts for supposedly political reasons have been excluded from temporary protection.
This is a further step by the European Union in the fight against terrorism.
The amendment presented in committee by the Spanish delegation of our group endorses a vote in favour of the report despite some of our reservations on certain aspects of it.
Mr President, the draft directive on displaced persons represents a new step towards European asylum policy.
But we are a long way off the ultimate goal, not least because the Council has hitherto appeared unable to reach decisions on Commission proposals.
As far as I am aware, there is still no agreement on the directive on family reunification within the Council' s working party.
The Council will perhaps be able to deal with this temporary protection directive more promptly, as it is not being 'hindered' by a codecision procedure in this case.
It is, however, questionable how much further problems have to escalate before the Council can rise above the mutual differences and can adopt a truly European approach.
Despite this, I should like to identify two positive aspects today.
First of all, the drive with which the Commission acquits itself of its task as legislator in the European Union and the care it applies to keeping the balance between the national interests and the ultimate goal of Tampere are quite remarkable.
Commissioner Vitorino deserves every support for his excellent helmsmanship in this matter.
Secondly, the content of the directive itself is balanced and therefore by and large acceptable.
First and foremost, it is stated that the rights and duties of displaced persons should as far as possible approximate to those of people with a different residence status.
In addition, further to its debate, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has called for more light to be shed on the relationship between the displaced persons status and the regular asylum procedure.
They should not be mutually exclusive.
At the end of the day, the use of the temporary protection instrument is merely a contingency measure which should not undermine the individual right to asylum.
Furthermore, I am delighted that it has been clearly laid down that all Member States have to contribute their proportionate share to the actual reception of displaced persons.
I thank Mr Wiebenga for amending the directive to that effect.
However, I also share Mrs TerrÃ³n' s and Mrs Buitenweg' s severe criticism of the compromise, which is very disappointing indeed and should not really call itself a compromise, as far as the definition of "the family" is concerned.
We have not heard the last of this.
Mr President, the Italians have an expression which I have always loved tutto il mondo e i paesi and today we are talking about a variety of legislation relating to what is clearly one of the most passionately debated and in many cases inadequately legislated for issue in our Community.
The tragedy of people cut up in civil wars, which is the main focus obviously of Mr Â­Â­Â­Wiebenga's report, is only one of the issues we are facing.
Many colleagues today have spoken on the basis of experience in their own countries of how these issues are handled.
For far too long the Commission or the Council, holding its meetings in secret and expressing solidarity very often between themselves about these issues, have covered up what we really need to know about future policy on immigration, asylum, refugees, etc., within the Community.
Coming as I do from a small country on the periphery where very often the difficulties of getting there have prevented us from being a focal point for those seeking asylum or refugee status, I sometimes feel uncomfortable when having to debate these issues with colleagues who have much greater experience and whose countries are called upon very often to share a huge amount of the responsibility for people tragically displaced by civil war, as has recently happened.
Of course we share our responsibility.
We have to.
It is our duty as one human being to another, but what we must absolutely insist on in all our immigration policies, not just in the context of mass displacements of people in the event of civil war, is that we must have a much better thought-out, much more humane and generous, and, above all, merciful policy towards those who come to us for help in these tragic situations.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, on the work he has carried out and on his clear desire to improve the text which we have been presented with.
I also believe it is fair to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino, because it is evident that the proposal for a directive, the draft presented to us today, greatly improves on the proposals which have previously been presented to this House.
Although other Members have highlighted important aspects of the issues we are dealing with, I do not wish to ignore certain aspects which I consider to be fundamental.
I believe that it is important to stress the guarantee of the right of these displaced persons to family reunification on the same basis as holders of residency documents and, although this may be a personal view, I believe that the issue of unmarried couples has not been sufficiently dealt with.
We understand the difficulties which have arisen in studying this problem and we will support any steps which may lead to a solution.
Another issue which I feel to be important is clarity on the distribution of responsibilities between the Member States in the event of a massive influx of displaced persons.
The Member States must deal with this type of situation in a homogenous and cooperative way.
It is also important to make it clear that people who have benefited from the temporary protection system also have the right to make a request for asylum and that the Geneva Convention must be respected to the full, including its principle of not returning asylum seekers to their country of origin.
The role of the European Parliament must be strengthened and, in cases of temporary protection, it is essential that it be consulted.
We must all prevent visa restrictions, which were imposed in the case of Kosovo, for example, which brought shame on every one of us.
I believe that on this occasion Parliament has done its job.
The Commission has also demonstrated its will and done its job.
We just have to hope now that the Council does its duty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our view the Commission's proposal for a directive on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons forms part of a global vision of how to establish a European asylum system.
The European Union needs an exceptional mechanism at its disposal so that it can react rapidly to mass influxes and respond immediately to the need to protect displaced persons, a situation we have seen in Bosnia and Kosovo.
The object of this mechanism is to ensure that the asylum system can work over the long term, while also ensuring that it is consistent with access to the normal asylum procedure and with the Geneva Convention.
We based our proposal on the idea that Member States must grant temporary protection on the basis of a Council decision, adopted by a qualified majority, that confirms the existence of a mass influx.
That protection is granted for not more than two years, but the Council may also at any time, if the conditions are right, terminate it by joint decision.
I believe that while the directive gives the Member States a degree of flexibility in managing their asylum system for the duration of the temporary protection, it also guarantees the beneficiaries absolute access to the asylum procedure, and at all events does so at the moment when the protection period expires.
We have finally established not only equal rights for those enjoying temporary protection but also principles governing returnees.
In Tampere, the Heads of State and Government emphasised the need to ensure solidarity between the Member States on the question of temporary protection.
And we know that the European Parliament is extremely concerned with this principle.
I believe I discussed it with Mr Nassauer more than seven years ago.
That is why the Commission has endeavoured to give a clear form to the concept of Community solidarity and greater depth to the content of Article 63(2)(b), on the balance of effort and responsibility between the Member States.
This solidarity is reflected first of all in the financial aspect, thanks to the links created with the European Refugee Fund.
I know that the financing of that fund is not very ambitious, but perhaps this is an area where it would be more rational to ask how the fund can help to strengthen financial solidarity.
At the same time, let me emphasise, in this proposal we have adhered to the principle of sharing the burden with regard to the physical reception of the refugees.
This solidarity between Member States with regard to reception is reflected in the principle of voluntary action by both sides.
I understand Mr von Boetticher's problem and even agree with his comment about the difficulties.
The idea of ensuring voluntary action by both sides first came up during the German Presidency and has gained ground.
Of course, it presupposes both that the Member States are willing to take in refugees and that the beneficiaries in their turn are willing to go to the territory of the Member State in question.
That is why, from the outset, the decision to grant temporary protection specifies either the capacity of Member States to absorb refugees or the exceptional reasons that prevent them from taking in any more displaced persons.
But I do want to emphasise that these really must be exceptional reasons.
Basically, refusal to accept new refugees where a decision has been taken to grant temporary protection must be quite exceptional.
Moreover, the concept of voluntary action by both sides introduces a transparent system.
And that transparent decision-making system is essential, for peer-group pressure has a role to play here: it must persuade everyone to agree to cooperate in the matter of reception, including the physical reception of beneficiaries of temporary protection.
I cannot guarantee that the system will work.
But at least we have tried to design an instrument that will guarantee the principle of solidarity in the matter of physical reception, and the principle of financial solidarity.
I warmly thank the Members who have taken part in this debate.
Let me draw particular attention to the contribution made by the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, with his excellent report.
If I am a little nervous today it is because he taught me a great deal about the subject and I feel rather like a student facing his professor.
I am a teacher by profession.
So you know what I am talking about.
But in any case I want to say that we have taken careful note of all the amendments that were tabled.
I regard these amendments, even those on solidarity, as a source of inspiration for the several weeks of negotiations that lie before us in the Council, which should produce a final result in May. At least I hope we will reach a conclusion by the May Council.
Some of your amendments modify the level of beneficiaries' rights and the Commission remains very keen to see a fair level that cannot be revised downwards.
As for solidarity, we note that some provisions have been strengthened, especially those concerning reception between Member States. Despite the delicate nature of this question, we are doing our best to find a realistic, fair and, in particular, viable solution.
Once the principle of voluntary action by both sides is respected, some amendments, in spirit if not literally, could, as I said earlier, help bring the negotiations to a final conclusion.
Thank you Commissioner Vitorino.
With regard to your comment on teachers and pupils, there was a brilliant Neapolitan man of the theatre - he was Neapolitan but also Italian and European - who used to say that you can never say you have taken your last exam.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Visas/Mutual recognition of decisions on expulsion
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs:
by Mr Deprez (A5-0066/2001),
I. on the initiative of the Republic of Finland with a view to the adoption of a regulation reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications [11834/2000 - C5-0559/2000 - 2000/0805(CNS)];
II. on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic with a view to adopting a Council regulation reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for carrying out border checks and surveillance [5736/2001 - C5-0044/2001 - 2001/0802(CNS)];
by Mrs Frahm (A5-0075/2001), on the initiative by the Republic of Portugal for adoption of a Council regulation on the period during which third-country nationals exempt from visa requirements are free to travel within the territory of the Member States [8210/2000 - C5-0286/2000 - 2000/0806(CNS)];
and
by Mr Nassauer (A5-0065/2001), on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council directive on mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals [10130/2000 - C5-0398/2000 + 13968/2000 - C5-0004/2000 - 2000/0819(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the main object of the initiative of the Republic of Finland which we have before us today is to reserve to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications.
The initiative of the Portuguese Republic in effect pursues the same object, namely to reserve implementing powers to the Council, but this time with regard to border checks and surveillance.
As regards the basic issue, I would call on Parliament to reject both initiatives because in my view they contain four serious political errors.
The first is a political error against the Community spirit and against the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
When it was decided that under the Treaty of Amsterdam the Schengen acquis would be transferred from the third to the first pillar, this was done in order to remove this matter from the intergovernmental framework and integrate it into the normal legal and institutional framework.
By reserving itself implementing powers, the Council would, in effect, be rejecting the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam and, in practice, perpetuating the intergovernmental methods that used to apply.
The second mistake is, I believe, an institutional one.
Let me remind Members that Article 202 of the EC Treaty is not just any old article.
It forms part of the institutional provisions in the strict sense, which the Court of Justice considers should take precedence over other provisions.
In reserving itself implementing powers, in considering that this constitutes a specific case - which, however, it has not supported by a detailed statement of grounds - the Council is in my view taking liberties with a fundamental provision of the Treaty establishing the European Community. That is something I find unacceptable.
The Council committed a third mistake, this time vis-Ã -vis the Commission.
To justify reserving itself implementing powers, the Council maintains that visas and border control policy are a sensitive area.
That argument does not stand up to analysis, especially when we remember that the regulation laying down a uniform format for visas expressly allows the Commission to take implementing measures, which are in fact secret, in what is clearly a particularly sensitive area.
I would also be interested to know how much longer the Commission of the European Communities will stand by and watch the Council in effect dismantling its powers.
Not only is the Council exercising the power of initiative that belongs to the Commission; on top of that it now wants to deprive the Commission of the implementing powers conferred on it by the Treaties.
The fourth error concerns Parliament directly.
By reserving itself implementing powers - and I want every Member to realise this - the Council is completely depriving the European Parliament of the information to which it would have been entitled under the usual comitology arrangements.
This refusal to provide information is all the more serious because some decisions already are and will continue to be taken in the framework of procedures classified as confidential.
For example, by virtue of what is known as the prior consultation procedure, certain third-country nationals who wanted to enter an EU country, a Schengen country, would not be able to do so because a country, whose identity we would never know and which would not necessarily be the country of destination, had vetoed that person, for reasons we would never know and that would never have to be justified.
I certainly do not want to create confusion by suggesting that we must have a right to scrutinise individual decisions on each visa application, but I cannot accept the fact that on such fundamental matters, which affect the citizens' basic freedoms, the Council will never be accountable to anyone either for its priorities or for its selection criteria.
That is not just a democratic deficit, it is a real denial of democracy.
That is why I call on Parliament to follow the unanimous example of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and quite simply to reject outright the initiatives of the Republic of Finland and the Republic of Portugal.
Mr President, this is probably one of the thinnest reports which this House has dealt with for a long time, but it is hopefully also the last time I am given such an assignment.
If the Socialist Group and the PPE-DE Group so wish, then perhaps even small groups may also be permitted to draw up reports on matters of interest.
This report concerns a Portuguese initiative which tackles one of several problem areas in connection with visa policy.
Unfortunately, however, this proposal - the Portuguese initiative - will create a number of problems because it does not really tie in with the other Schengen rules. Since, moreover, the situation is such that, in a very short time - in April, if I have understood correctly - the Commission is to come up with an initiative tackling all the problems surrounding the freedom to travel within the territory of the Member States, and since the Commission also shares my concern about the problems which the report will create, I very warmly recommend a vote in favour of my report and, thus, the rejection of the Portuguese initiative in favour of the later initiative to be produced by the Commission.
When we deal with these subjects, however, I think it might be a good idea if, once in a while, we were to take stock of what we are actually doing when we take these initiatives, which are, of course, all offshoots of the Schengen Convention and ideas about the 'area of democracy, freedom and justice' we talk so much about.
The proposals with which we are dealing today and those with which we dealt previously are largely about closing this area of freedom, democracy and justice, which might be said already to be in the process of becoming isolated.
We are, of course, well aware that our part of the world will require a labour force in not very many years' time.
We are well aware that several Member States are already facing the fact that we need a significant level of immigration if we wish to maintain a standard of living anything like that which we have at present and if, in addition, we aspire to a secure old age in which others work while we, hopefully, have time to ourselves.
That is why it is so incomprehensible that we should continue to keep people out of our area, that we should accept that people will die en route to the EU, that we should be prepared to see the corpses of refugees or of people seeking a better life washed up on the coasts of the EU and that we should prefer to see these people as corpses than as citizens or as useful individuals in our part of the world.
This is amazingly difficult to understand.
My own country, Denmark, is among the worst.
Ministers in positions of responsibility talk about putting refugees on desert islands, and when they talk like that, then the level of debate is as might be expected and anything is suddenly permitted.
In my country, the term cultural struggle has acquired a resonance to the effect that all cultures must be combated if they are not Christian.
The liberals in my country think that all refugees should be assembled in camps in the world's poorest countries.
In the light of this, I am glad that my country is not involved in the common policy on refugees and, as a result, does not have any influence on those policies the EU is drawing up at the moment for, in spite of everything, the situation is a bit better than if Denmark had had any influence.
When the Wall came down in 1989, we all believed in a Europe without walls, but we are well on the way to putting walls up.
We are not building them between us, we are building them around us.
We should be asking how it is possible that we, the richest part of the world, so consistently choose repressive solutions.
How can it be believed that an area of democracy, security and justice can be developed when repressive solutions directed against refugees are consistently chosen?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning Commissioner Vitorino complained that he had to comment on an initiative that was by no means of his own making.
He is going to be faced with the same problem again, because we are now talking about a French initiative.
It is concerned with mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals and it is another case demonstrating that there are good reasons for reserving the power of initiative solely to the Commission.
It is evident that the Commission is in a better position than the individual Member States to promote the Community interest, whereas individual Member States tend to concentrate on their own interests.
So this is another piece of evidence that suggests we should press for the Commission to have a monopoly on legislative initiatives.
This initiative dates back to the end of the French Presidency, at a time when the Presidency's achievements were threatening to look very slim indeed.
So they rapidly came up with a whole string of initiatives just before the final whistle, in order to improve things somewhat, and they were all pretty rushed.
I would recommend those of you who take an interest in legal matters to compare the first and second drafts.
The first draft is all good will and politics, whereas the lawyers have crawled over the second draft and turned the whole thing into something that could reasonably be called a legislative initiative. In other words, there is a very considerable difference in the legislative quality of the first and second drafts of the initiative.
Furthermore, the legal objective of the initiative is now quite clear.
It quite simply means that an expulsion decision made, say, in Paris, would be binding throughout the Community.
That makes sense - after all it would be complete nonsense if a decision made in Paris could be appealed against in Helsinki or in Berlin or in any other Member State within the area of freedom, security and justice.
But the Community needs a legal basis for such action.
A legal objective is no replacement for a legal basis.
That is a lesson we have just learnt from the European Court of Justice's ruling on the tobacco advertising directive.
In that case too there was a legal objective which very much deserved to be debated, but the ECJ made it clear that there has to be a legal basis in the European treaties.
The Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs twice unanimously rejected the French initiative on the grounds that there was no such legal basis.
The French Government based its initiative on Article 63 of the EC Treaty, where you will find a legal basis for a European expulsion law.
That is not quite the same thing as mutual recognition of decisions at national level concerning expulsions.
A Community expulsion law would be a directive in which the Community lays down a proper legislative procedure stipulating the circumstances in which an illegal immigrant can be expelled and possibly even deported. However, in this case we are talking about all the Member States mutually recognising expulsion decisions and other similar decisions reached in accordance with their respective national legal frameworks.
That is quite a different kettle of fish.
As we have been rather more careful recently about whether the European Union and in particular the Community aspect of it can do everything it would like to do, we in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs were firmly of the opinion that while we support the legal objective pursued by the initiative, we can see no legal basis for it.
We therefore propose that this initiative be rejected.
At the same time we have immediately presented a suggestion for solving this problem.
It is perfectly clear that this difficult situation could be resolved if there were a European expulsion law.
So the inevitable consequence of this process is that we call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a directive creating a European, a Community expulsion law, which is also binding within the Community.
That would solve all the problems associated with this initiative.
Mr President, given the way this morning' s debate is going, I wonder whether we are in a seminar, in a big lecture, or in a Parliament whose obligation is to legislate and to provide solutions to European society' s current problems.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very worrying that this Parliament has rejected en bloc Council initiatives such as the ones we are considering here and that this demonstrates great disarray in the legislative process which the Treaty obliges us to follow.
Free movement, for example, is a fundamental aspect, which requires legislation that is crystal-clear to both the citizens of the European Union and to those from third countries.
I agree with the reasoning that Mrs Frahm expresses in her report for rejecting the initiative and for expecting the Commission to fulfil the objectives proposed on the scoreboard, because we do need to consider all the scenarios in which nationals of third countries who are authorised to circulate within the territory of the Member States may find themselves in. It is also necessary, for the sake of this legal coherence, that the solutions proposed do not contradict the Treaties.
The same can be said of Mr Nassauer' s report, in which he has expressed himself well and in which he rightly criticises the lack of legal rigour of the French Government' s initiatives on the mutual recognition of decisions regarding expulsion.
We should truly be considering whether the European institutions are providing a rigorous response to European society' s current demand that we create a policy on immigration which respects the principles of freedom, equality and justice that go hand in hand with European culture.
Immigration and everything relating to it requires a tripartite pact between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, which will impose some order on this debate.
The majority groups in this House, as happens in our own countries, must reach a consensus on the great principles enshrined in Chapter IV of the Treaty and its legislative implementation.
We must achieve joint consensus and consideration.
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the path of confrontation which we are taking will not help to reach a solution to the problem, but rather make it worse, which would have dangerous consequences for all of us.
Mr President, I could at this point make an exceedingly short contribution - so short that it would consist of the single word 'no' .
No to these three initiatives.
And yet here we are, going through the motions of a debate all over again.
The authors of the proposal are absent so we are having a pleasant chat with the Commissioner on the subject, as he pointed out just now. Consequently, I think I will take advantage of the time allotted to me under the Rules of Procedure to make a few remarks.
They will appear in the Minutes and should then reach the Council.
Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the work they have put into carrying out a thorough legal analysis of the proposals. Their authors often seem to neglect to do so.
I shall deal separately with Mr Nassauer' s report because I think the other two reports concern different issues.
With regard to Mr Nassauer' s report, I should like to reiterate what I said earlier this morning.
All too often we are presented with apparently simple proposals concerning very real and complex problems.
Obviously, if you tell someone who is not that familiar with our literature that a person who has been expelled from one Member State should be expelled from all Member States, that first person is bound to agree. It seems sensible and logical.
However, things are not that straightforward.
An individual' s human rights have to be respected. So for this to come about a clear legal framework is needed, an effective common immigration policy, and an awareness of how and why a decision on expulsion should be dealt with in all Member States.
I must congratulate Mr Nassauer on not having been taken in by the apparent simple-mindedness, if not simplicity, enshrined in the Council' s proposal.
Turning to the reports by Mr Deprez and Mrs Frahm, I have to say that I think we really are in a very worrying position. These two Members have already explained far better than I could the technical and legal reasons why they advocate rejection of this proposal.
I should, however, like to refer to a matter which seems to me to be of the highest political importance. The proposal considered by Mr Deprez contains the following sentence, "Because Member States have an enhanced role in respect of the development of visa policy" .
This reflects the political sensitivity of the matter, in particular where relations with third countries are involved. It is used to support the argument that the Council should have the right to exercise implementing powers in this area.
I find this very worrying. I believe it is a matter of great concern as we discuss a common visa list and are already implementing the free movement of persons.
Will both Parliament and the Commission be called on again to come to the defence of the principle of freedom of movement and the Community bases for the implementation of this principle? Will we have to re-enact debates held prior to 1992?
I trust the Council will take due note so that we can avoid doing so.
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has always been, and remains today, a paradoxical part of the world.
At the same time as walls are being torn down within Europe, new walls are being built to prevent people from making their way to Europe at all.
As the EU' s external walls rise higher, more and more people are falling into the hands of unscrupulous people - middlemen who profiteer from refugees' anxiety, fear and desire to survive and give their families a better future.
We know that, in the last year alone, hundreds of people, including children clinging to the undersides of buses and lorries, have lost their lives - some of them off the Turkish coast, in Spanish waters and at Dover - in the hope of finding a better future in our part of the world.
A few days ago, a young Kurdish man was shot by the police in a medium-sized town in Sweden.
Exactly what happened, we do not know.
What we do, however, know is that he had no valid identity papers and was to be deported.
Asylum policy is a common concern for the EU, but the disparate, and in some cases desperate, proposals received by the European Parliament threaten basic humanitarian values.
It must go without saying that every refugee who wishes to stay within the EU must have his case carefully examined.
European leaders must reflect upon why the smuggling of human beings into Europe is so dramatically on the increase.
The UN' s Secretary-General has been very clear in his criticism of the EU and of the EU' s obligation to protect asylum seekers' rights.
To impose visa requirements upon the citizens of approximately 130 countries in unworthy of European democracy.
The basic rule must be that people have the right to travel freely into the EU.
Mr Vitorino, the Commission should devote itself to shortening the list of countries upon which visa requirements are imposed. This is what Schengen cooperation should be about.
We in the ELDR Group regret that no overall asylum strategy has been presented and linked to labour market and immigration strategies.
As matters now stand, there is no overview or comprehensive vision.
Tighter measures, visa requirements and the threat of expulsion do not basically solve these problems.
I am a keen supporter of the EU and have wanted for a long time to see common rules within refugee and asylum policy, but we Liberals are not prepared to accept some kind of fenced-in Europe.
The Iron Curtain must not be replaced by a more modern electronic variety.
Mr President, as I rise to speak in this debate I cannot, of course, help thinking about the situation which the Spanish public is currently facing as regards the serious issue of immigration.
Spain's national government, supported by its majority in parliament and despite opposition from the remaining political parties, has forced through a law on immigrants, which denies 'illegal' immigrants basic human rights including those of freedom of association and freedom to join unions.
Meanwhile, dead bodies are appearing on the beaches of the south of the Iberian Peninsula, many of them women and children who have perished in an attempt to reach land in search of work and opportunities for earning a living lacking in their home countries.
The sight of these corpses is a dramatic reminder that we are faced with a humanitarian problem that cannot be dealt with by adopting a faint-hearted or xenophobic approach. It needs to be approached in a rational, generous and forward-looking way, as the rapporteurs have done.
I share the views of the Committee on Petitions on the Nassauer report on the initiative of the French Republic, namely that this vital issue needs to be resolved by making the European Union, when faced with the realities of immigration, an area of freedom, security and justice and not a society based on exclusion and expulsion, as so tragically personified by the young people found dead on the beaches that separate us from Africa.
Parliament and the Commission need to prioritise work on an overall approach to immigration taking account of its humanitarian, economic, cultural and political aspects.
We should not, on the other hand, forget that the eastward enlargement of the Union will inevitably lead to extraordinary internal migration flows creating a new social framework which we will not be able to address properly unless we solve the serious problem of immigration from third countries.
Mr President, what is the best way to keep out all the undesirables?
What further barriers can we add to fortress Schengen to protect ourselves from outside threats?
That is the impression made on me by some aspects of the reports we will be voting on today; at the same time I approve the three rejections.
Less than a month after the tragedy of the East Sea that ran aground on the French coast, with 908 people crammed into the holds of an old tub, including three babies born during the crossing, we run the risk of perpetuating the image of a Europe that is suspicious of foreigners and wants, above all, to strengthen its borders, while alleging that the intention is to combat the trafficking in human beings.
The European Union cannot pursue an immigration policy based purely on policing, as the President of the French Human Rights League said a few days ago.
The news shows us more horrors by the day and we hear expressions of indignation and emotion from all sides.
We are bound to be shocked by the pictures of Kurdish families, dreaming of peace and freedom, who came to seek a future without persecution.
They follow on from the pictures of the 58 Chinese immigrants who reached Dover only to be found dead among crates of tomatoes, of the fugitives from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Albania, Iraq, Africa or any other region stricken by poverty and war.
Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
So the time has now come to strengthen the right of asylum as set out in the Geneva Convention; the idea of temporary protection, which does not prejudge recognition of refugee status, goes in that direction.
We know that trafficking in human beings exists and that there are criminal networks.
We are all aware that fabulous sums can be made out of exploiting human misery.
So if we are to combat this trafficking effectively we will have to attack the roots of the evil.
Repression alone is not enough.
We must impose severe penalties on those who organise and are responsible for this trafficking but we must also look into the reasons why individuals, exploited in a cowardly way, find themselves shunted from country to country, from continent to continent, in their search for El Dorado - all in the name of liberal globalisation.
We must not confuse the traffickers with their victims.
We must seek out and penalise those who exploit illegal labour.
In fact, immigration and economics go hand in hand.
Yet the proposal to harmonise the penalties imposed on carriers could prove to be the wrong track to follow and could even be turned against certain people who are simply trying to help men and women under threat.
Let us not make solidarity and humanity into an offence.
While the European Union is rightly seeking to pursue a humane development policy, let us make it clear that development depends on the free movement of people, their knowledge, their culture, as well as their suffering and their hopes.
We must guarantee that freedom of movement.
A society that decides to be tight-fisted and selective in granting residence permits, visas, places in holding centres, is a closed and sectarian society.
Do we want a Europe that shuts itself off from the world; do we want a Europe that sorts people out and divides them up into good and bad refugees, acceptable immigrants and permanent exiles?
When will we see Council initiatives and proposals for directives drawn up in a spirit of openness to the world, a spirit of welcome and humanity, rather than one concerned primarily with policing and security?
Frantz Fanon wrote, "We always want to walk in the company of man, of all men."
I hope with all my heart that Europe can finally offer us that freedom.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Bonino List.
Something which very rarely happens in this Parliament occurred during the last voting session, and it occurred at the vote on the Ceyhun report, when Parliament rejected a Member State's proposal almost unanimously.
The debate on these three reports, but also on the Kirkhope report, highlights an extremely clear-cut problem: we are not concerned with the merit of the proposal but its method.
I therefore hope that, during this voting session, Parliament will once again heed the advice of the rapporteurs and the vote of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which calls for the Council's and Member States' proposals to be rejected.
I hope, in particular, for a political solution, for Parliament to regain the dignity which a democratically elected institution which represents the citizens ought to have in matters of justice and home affairs, if only in terms of Parliament's institutional role.
What I mean is, ultimately, Parliament has basically the same powers in this area as a non-governmental organisation.
We Members often forget or prefer to forget this fact, but, as we know, under the Treaty, we have no decision-making power or influence over the outcome of the legislative process.
We feel that this is outrageous, particularly in an area which concerns the individual freedoms and rights of the European citizens.
It is an outrage that democratic control is exercised by Council officials in these matters.
It is an outrage that the work of Parliament and the work of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are, in fact, sidelined in favour of proposals which we are forced to discuss, proposals put forward by individual Member States, by groups of Member States, by the Council or by the States holding the Presidency, proposals which do not have a proper legal basis.
Frequently, almost without exception, these proposals are the political manifestos of Member States which are perfectly aware that their proposals will never be adopted by the Council.
Thus we find ourselves discussing matters which will never see the light of day or which will have to be re-examined, for the Council will never manage to reach a definitive conclusion.
Therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for assuming a radical position rejecting the Council's proposals - a position which we consider to be appropriate to their role as Parliamentary rapporteurs.
I confirm that we will vote for the motion. We trust that, in the future, Parliament will do more than just protest, that Commissioner Vitorino will do more than just record the existence of a situation, and that tangible measures will be taken to change this state of affairs.
Mr President, I wish to speak about the French Republic's initiative on the mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals, which aims to prevent the free and unchecked movement within the Union of foreigners who are the subject of an expulsion decision.
So we regard it as most opportune at a time when the pressure of illegal immigration is rising and we regret the fact that the European Parliament intends, rather arbitrarily it seems, to reject it.
The French initiative seeks to introduce a kind of mutual application of certain judicial decisions, i.e. a new form of cooperation, which in principle deserves more attention.
Under this proposal, if a Member State decides to expel a third-country national who presents a threat to public order or is an illegal resident, another Member State on whose territory that foreigner found himself could automatically enforce the expulsion measure, subject, of course, to any legal appeals.
Despite the advantages of this proposal, the European Parliament's responsible committee is rejecting it for two reasons that I do not find convincing.
Firstly, Article 63(3)(b) of the Treaty establishing the European Community would not constitute a relevant legal basis.
This is not true because that article is concerned precisely with cooperation measures for the repatriation of illegally resident foreigners.
That is very much the case here, since mutual recognition is indeed a measure that comes under that category.
Secondly, we are told yet again that the French initiative is too repressive and that first we need to establish a global European immigration policy.
That is obviously a delaying tactic, for its proponents were very careful not to use the same argument a while ago when we were discussing the temporary protection of third-country nationals.
The French Republic's initiative on the mutual recognition of decisions on expulsion therefore certainly deserves to be approved.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my total support for Mr Deprez's views, that is his rejection of both the Portuguese initiative and the Finnish initiative.
These two proposals undermine Article 202, which establishes the general principle that the Commission alone has powers to implement the rules which the Council lays down, although the Council may also reserve the right, in specific well-founded cases, to exercise directly implementing powers itself.
The justification put forward is that the Council wishes to reserve for itself the right to exercise implementing powers for a five-year transitional period because the Member States have an enhanced role in respect of the development of visa policy, reflecting the political sensitivity of this area.
This is not in itself, however, a sufficient reason for breaching a general principle of Community law. And it is not a valid argument, because it is contrary to the principle of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the legal framework of the European Union, which specifically applies in this area.
With regard to the Frahm report, I believe that we should also support the rapporteur's position, which is to reject the Portuguese initiative. One of the reasons for this is that this initiative would lead to a lack of consistency in the rules governing the movement of third-country nationals within the territory of the Schengen Member States; the Schengen Convention covers three categories of third-country nationals who have a right to travel within the Member States: those required to have a visa, those exempt from any visa requirement and those who have a residence permit.
This initiative only covers the second of these categories, thus fragmenting the right to travel of third-country nationals without indicating to what extent these rules revoke, replace or modify the Schengen acquis.
The Nassauer report also - and quite rightly - proposes that the French initiative should be rejected.
Given that there are three proposals that we intend to reject, I would like to make an appeal to the Commissioner, AntÃ³nio Vitorino, and to the Commission, that they should take the initiative in this area, thus ensuring the overall consistency of the Community framework of which it is the institutional guardian.
Mr President, unfortunately, because we have no consistent, integrated policy on asylum and immigration, we are being bombarded by initiatives by Member States trying to intervene, in a totally fragmented manner, in various areas, and either ignoring or circumventing the institutional and legal framework of the European Union, as in the case of the present initiatives by France, Finland and Portugal, which the European Parliament would do well to reject, precisely as our rapporteurs, whom I congratulate, have proposed.
This Chamber must stress once again that the Council can only exercise implementing powers which would otherwise be awarded to the Commission in specific cases and once a detailed statement of grounds has been given.
Today the Council wants us to believe that visas and border checks are a specific case and to reserve for itself the implementing powers which belong to the Commission.
At the same time, of course, it is ignoring the European Parliament and the required consultation procedure by amending decisions without consulting the European Parliament.
In resorting to these tactics, the Council is doing nothing to speed up the process of shaping a common European immigration policy; on the contrary, it is being obstructive, it is failing to take decisions and the Tampere process is making no headway whatsoever, thereby sustaining a climate in Europe which fosters racism and xenophobia and results in the sort of accident which we saw in Dover.
There can be no doubt whatsoever that, if we want to create a common European area of security and justice, we need to oppose unilateral initiatives by Member States and make standard arrangements.
Everyone crossing a border into Europe should be subject to the same rules and requirements, thereby ensuring smooth entry and residency procedures.
Individual Member States and individual legal systems cannot be given the discretion to examine visa applications.
Of course, we hardly need stress yet again that fortifying the borders and policing measures will do nothing to reduce migratory pressures and illegal border crossings as long as there is a huge prosperity differential between our countries and our neighbours.
So what the Council should do is to authorise the Commission, on the basis of the Tampere procedure, to take the necessary initiatives so that we can use assent procedures to introduce, as quickly as possible, a common immigration policy which regulates all outstanding issues fairly and is based on our common humanitarian European values and democratic tradition.
Mr President, the three reports being debated today have a common subject: the application of European Union policy to immigrants.
They respond to demands by the Member States of the European Union either for greater flexibility as regards the period of residency of immigrants and a more lenient Community institutional framework, as in the case of Portugal, or for faster action on the decisions taken at Tampere on mutual recognition by all the Member States of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals, as in the case of France.
All three reports have been rejected by the competent committee on formal grounds.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be abstaining from the vote on the Deprez and Frahm reports and voting in favour of the Nassauer report, which rejects France' s initiative, because we, of course, disagree with the content, not the form of the initiative.
The question which arises is why this constant preoccupation with immigrants?
Perhaps there is no institutional framework?
On the contrary. Both Union and national legislation have transformed the European Union into a well-guarded fortress in which there is no place for humanitarian values or solidarity, let alone the European Convention on Human Rights.
My country, Greece, is currently discussing a bill along these lines on so-called immigration policy which, to put it bluntly, treats immigration as a crime and anyone who fails to denounce or who assists an immigrant as an accessory to the crime.
The causes of immigration stem, in our view, from the very policies of developed capitalist countries and the European Union, which plunder the wealth and rob the people of the fruits of their labour in the immigrants' countries of origin, condemning them to a life of under-development and poverty.
This is what causes mass immigration.
Another cause of immigration is imperialist intervention, which foments national and local wars, causing huge waves of refugees.
These current waves of immigrants, this modern slave trade suits big business in the countries in which the immigrants end up just fine. Can there by any doubt that what we have here is an inhumane interplay of the interests of slave traders, immigrants, war-mongering imperialists and those who exploit immigrants in the so-called host countries who, basically, as modern-day slave-masters, encourage unemployment and illegal immigration in order to attack the interests and rights of local workers in the coarsest manner?
That is why protecting the rights of immigrants, both legal and illegal, must be one of the first and most urgent duties of the popular movement...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are holding a joint debate on four Member State initiatives: on mutual recognition of expulsion decisions, on implementing powers with regard to the procedures for examining visa applications and for carrying out checks outside the Schengen borders and, lastly, on freedom to travel within the Schengen area.
I will begin with the aspects relating to the provisions that come within the Schengen framework.
First of all, I want to congratulate Mr Deprez on his precise and detailed examination of institutional relations in regard to the power to implement the rules established by the Council, powers relating to comitology as laid down in Article 202 of the Treaty establishing the Communities.
The Commission does, in fact, believe that it should be possible to amend, adapt or update some of the provisions in the joint consular instruction, in the joint handbook and in the specifications of the Schengen consultation network, by a simplified method based on comitology.
We can also subscribe to the initiatives of the Republics of Finland and Portugal, but we cannot subscribe to the majority of the proposed measures, which reserve implementing powers to the Council without, however, providing any circumstantial evidence that this really is a specific case that is an exception to the general rule laid down in the Treaty.
The Commission agrees with the analysis and the arguments put forward by Mr Deprez in his explanatory statement.
Joint consular instruction, the joint handbook and the specifications of the Schengen consultation network have been integrated as the legal basis for Articles 62 and 67 of the Treaty of the European Communities, under Title IV.
However, Title IV contains no institutional derogation from Article 202 of the Treaty.
Moreover, most of the implementing measures linked to these instruments are purely technical in nature.
They constitute no more than the practical formulation of political decisions taken by the Council in primary legislative acts, which are themselves governed by the appropriate provisions of Title IV.
Consequently, I wish to express the Commission's total satisfaction with Parliament's position, a position entirely in line with that of the European Commission.
And for the time being, the Commission not only emphasises its agreement but also hopes that the Council will listen to and accept the rapporteur's arguments, which I hope Parliament endorses, and the arguments along the same lines put forward by the Commission.
In the event that it adopts a different interpretation, we will no doubt consider reacting by taking other measures...
...measures which the Commission and Parliament can, in fact, take jointly.
The Commission can endorse the aim of the Portuguese proposal for a regulation concerning the period during which third-country nationals who are exempt from the visa requirement can travel freely within the territory of the Member States.
Indeed, Article 62 of the Treaty invites the Council to adopt, within five years following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, measures laying down the conditions under which third-country nationals can move freely within the territory of the Member States for a period of not more than three months.
However, and here it manifestly contradicts the Portuguese proposal, while the Treaty lays down a period of not more than three months, this is certainly not restricted to third-country nationals exempt from the visa requirement.
That is why I agree with the comment by your rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, that it is not a good idea to regulate the situation of a single category, just as it seems obvious to me that we cannot extend the period of residence on the territory of the Member States beyond three months, up to a total of six months, solely on the basis of reciprocity agreements.
The Commission realises that the main object of the Portuguese initiative - for underlying reasons that are easy to understand - is to safeguard a number of existing bilateral agreements between the Member States and, for example, third countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan and Australia.
Nevertheless, as I think I have made it clear, the method applied in this Portuguese initiative does not appear consistent with the Treaty, nor does it seem advisable to confine it to just one category of persons.
For our part, we can confirm that the Commission intends in the near future to present a global proposal on the right to travel within the Schengen area, so as to avoid taking the kind of fragmented approach that could be an obstacle to transparency, to legibility for the citizens, and to legal certainty.
Finally, I come to the proposal for a directive on the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions, which the French Presidency presented last July.
Taking the long-term view, it would seem desirable to allow an expulsion decision taken in one Member State to be executed in another Member State, without the latter having to take a new expulsion decision.
The French Republic's initiative should be regarded as no more than a very first step towards achieving this objective, which we must recognise as an ambitious one.
So far, no common policy on repatriating asylum-seekers has been formulated in the framework of asylum and immigration policy.
That is why I think it would be a much better idea, for the time being, to lay down common standards and principles, so that later on we could establish a binding legal framework governing the mutual recognition of measures to terminate a period of residence, in particular expulsion decisions.
With a view to defining such a policy, and as stated in its programme of work for the year 2001, the Commission will draw up a communication on a common policy on repatriation.
This policy will include common principles, together with common standards and measures.
The most important common principle is to give primacy to voluntary return over forced return.
The European Refugee Fund supports Member State efforts in this field.
The discussions that will follow this communication and that will cover every aspect of the policy on repatriation promise to be very difficult, in view of the tensions between the Member States' need to implement the decisions and, on the other hand, the obvious human dimension.
In my view, persons who do not or who no longer satisfy the conditions laid down for enjoying the status of permanent or temporary legal resident should normally be asked to leave the territory of the European Union unless the Member States concerned have a legal obligation of whatever kind to allow them to remain.
If we wish to formulate a common immigration policy that is as complete as possible, we cannot leave aside the question of repatriation, which, if I may put it that way, is the other side of the coin.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
European crime prevention network
The next item is the report (A5-0070/2001) by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizen's Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden with a view to the adoption of a Council decision setting up a European crime prevention network [13464/2000 - C5-0717/2000 - 2000/0824(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the studies and statistics on major social emergencies stress that the right to security is one of the greatest demands of the European citizens.
Crime, in its most varied forms, is rightly perceived by our citizens to be not just a threat to physical safety but a genuine, ever-increasing, intolerable threat to the freedom of movement, the freedom to work and the freedom to live a normal everyday life.
This psychological concern has led to an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions and increasing mistrust of other people.
This sense of insecurity affects absolutely everybody: companies, families and individual people, particularly women, the elderly and children.
In this context, it is often very difficult to separate large-scale organised crime, large-scale criminal phenomena, and what is known as small-scale crime; this is particularly true of urban areas, one example being drug distribution and drug pushing.
Mr President, there was a time when the first thing people asked for was timely crime prevention and sure penalties for criminals.
Now the situation has changed: people demand safety above all else and, therefore, crime prevention in particular, maybe because the number of particularly abhorrent crimes, such as all crimes related to paedophilia and the sexual exploitation of women and children, is increasing at a worrying rate.
Crime prevention must therefore be interpreted - and is being interpreted - as a certainty enabling people to exercise their freedoms, and the citizens are demanding precisely an undertaking that we will implement all possible measures to contain the spread of crime.
I believe that the importance of crime prevention has been stressed by Parliament on repeated occasions, and Parliament has produced a large number of instruments in this field.
It was also appropriately and explicitly recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and then acknowledged on a number of other occasions up to and including the Tampere Council, which explicitly proposed to reinforce international cooperation on crime prevention by establishing a crime prevention network between national authorities.
This proposal was then accepted by the French Presidency and the Swedish Presidency, which intend to establish this network of information and exchange of experiences and best practices to prevent crime through a proposal for a legislative initiative.
The undertaking would include the exchange of information and news in as short a time as possible precisely in order to be able to study the origins of criminal phenomena. It would operate in a similar way to the way in which the Lisbon Drug Monitoring Centre operates, albeit in a different sector, which monitors changes in drug distribution from their origin.
The objective is therefore to be able to study criminal phenomena right from their origins, monitoring the enormous capacity for evolution and veritable metamorphosis of crime to adapt to new forms of prevention, apart from anything else, and thus find new channels for expression.
To sum up, the network is a network for the exchange of information and best practices. It is certainly not an attempt to take away from Member States the power to make fundamental decisions on security policies, which are obviously the prerogative of the individual States and therefore the individual national parliaments and governments.
In my opinion, we are simply showing the citizens that Europe is in the process of creating a genuine area of freedom and justice.
I would like to thank all the Members for their cooperation and Mrs TerrÃ³n, in particular, for the amendment she tabled, which has enhanced and complemented our work.
Welcome
The President of the Assembly of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mr Stojan Andov, is in the official gallery.
On behalf of this House, I would like to welcome President Andov and I hope that his visit to the European Parliament will run completely smoothly and be very fruitful.
European crime prevention network (continuation)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative we have before us to create a European crime prevention network is intended as a response to the growing need to fight crime.
The necessity for greater and more effective international cooperation in this area, especially at EU level, has been recognised.
However, we know that such cooperation is weakened by differences in definitions, procedures, structures, and so forth.
There is therefore a need for comparable data in terms of studies carried out, statistics, penal policy, structural factors and so on, and on crime, victims of crime and criminal justice in the European Union.
The main objective is to evaluate the various activities, and to endeavour to identify the key measures that are both desirable and practicable in priority areas, thus improving the European Union's capacity for response and the effectiveness of crime prevention policies both at national and international level.
These were the policy guidelines that emerged from the Tampere European Council, which led to the High Level Conference held in the Algarve in Portugal in May 2000 agreeing on the need for a multidisciplinary joint approach to crime prevention.
It is vital to guarantee the safety of Europe's citizens, who wish to live in peace, and this increasingly means not only effectively fighting crime but also adopting intelligent crime prevention policies which also involve the capacity to understand and react to psychological and sociological phenomena which make people feel unsafe, or increase such feelings.
Prevention of this kind, which is necessary to reduce crime and the causes of crime both quantitatively and qualitatively, should cover all forms of crime, including organised crime and not forgetting to pay special attention to the areas of urban, juvenile and drug-related crime.
This is an important and ambitious project, because crime knows no borders.
So this network is intended to promote cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States, and the collection and analysis of information on actions undertaken and best practice in the field of prevention, with the aim of assisting future decision-making in this area.
It could be said that there were two different camps in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. One camp was of the view that this network should be limited to intervention in areas with a direct European and international dimension, and the other focused exclusively on small-scale crime.
I believe that the compromise amendment approved was a good solution, as it did not exclude any aspect of crime prevention.
We are well aware that organised crime and small-scale crime are two distinct phenomena requiring different answers. Organised crime is a priority area for the Union and its Member States, whereas small-scale crime is primarily a matter for local, regional and national institutions.
The role of the EU in preventing small-scale crime should be limited to promoting exchanges of information between national authorities so as to encourage an exchange of best practice and research while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
The citizens of the European Union are justified in calling on the Union to efficiently tackle the problem of the growing threat to their freedom and rights caused by crime.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, for her report, and I would also like to express my thanks for the work done in our committee, which approved this particular report unanimously.
I believe that it is only by acting in unison that we can make progress in the battle against crime.
This report provides us with a basis for establishing an efficient network which will allow us to fight crime across Europe in a coordinated way, but without limiting our scope for action.
This is not an attempt by the European Union to arrogate powers to itself, but rather to optimise the exchange of information between the relevant authorities in the Member States.
Over and above this objective, the report also deals with the involvement of civil society organisations, universities and European institutions such as Europol and Eurojust in the crime prevention network.
This is something we would like to see because it saves reinventing the wheel in terms of crime prevention in each individual Member State, so that available resources are used better.
We welcome this.
This crime prevention network is also important in other respects.
The network will provide the Council and the Commission with the information they need to draw up appropriate crime prevention strategies.
This is to be welcomed, because it will give the various national authorities a greater interest in exchanging information with the network, not least because they will be able to air their concerns at European level.
This will also significantly speed up the process of coordinating national strategies.
When it comes to organised crime and modern forms of crime, this is particularly welcome, as the national authorities often complain that criminals have the upper hand, because these authorities cannot react quickly enough to evolving trends and types of criminality.
This will enable us to create a network providing universal information, greatly improving reaction times in crime prevention.
The network is also very important as regards the candidate countries, as it can help to get a better handle on the problems that can result from transition periods.
We will therefore be voting for the report with our own amendments, and we are very pleased that those responsible for implementation are finally getting the support they need from Parliament and the Council.
Mr President, I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on her work on this report and in endorsing the majority of the proposals within it.
Within the European Union a new institutional framework to fight against organised crime has been put in place following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
It provides for the development of common actions in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters while preserving Member State responsibility for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal securities.
Parallel to this endorsement, the European Council launched two action plans for combating organised crime, aimed at overcoming disparities with national procedures in establishing more efficient judicial cooperation.
Most of these recommendations have been fully implemented.
The enhanced role of Europol certainly represents a major step forward in this context.
The conclusions of the Tampere Council meeting present a strong political message, reaffirming the Union's wish to overcome difficulties in prosecuting all forms of cross-border crime while protecting the freedoms and legal rights of individuals and economic operators.
It is important that all EU institutions work together to ensure a coherent strategy against organised crime.
The primary motive of much organised crime is financial crime.
The EU policy in the fight against financial fraud is pursued simultaneously under the first and third pillars of the Treaties.
I support the extension of the mandate of Europol to investigate money laundering matters.
There must be a European-wide political agreement concerning the framework decision on the identification, seizure and confiscation of products of crime.
Certainly from an Irish perspective, the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996 has proved to be very successful in tackling this area of crime.
Establishing safety and confidence when we are faced with cyber-crime is another area which calls for a collective response on a global scale, given the world-wide dimension of the Internet.
Computer-related crimes do not stop at conventional State borders.
It is clear that activities that are unlawful off-line will not cease to be unlawful by going on-line.
A considerable number of actions to fight cyber-crime are already under way in international fora.
The Council of Europe is putting the finishing touches to the world's first international convention on cyber-crime.
The European Commission has also presented a legislative proposal on child pornography on the Internet, in line with the provisions of the Council's European cyber-crime convention.
I support the framework programme being brought forward by the European Commission to combat the traffic in human beings by developing effective cooperation across the European Union in judicial procedures in this regard, and also by establishing closer links with the accession countries.
Mr President, it would almost appear that we have to vote on a issue which is a foregone conclusion, that is on whether Parliament is for or against crime.
Our concern is completely different from anything discussed thus far: our concern is whether or not to stage another bureaucratic monstrosity. We are against this.
We are against it even though we know that there is no Member of this or any other parliament, or rather, there is no sensible person on earth, I feel, who would not be against crime and in favour of its prevention.
However, whether we want a bureaucratic monstrosity is another matter.
As we know, when the European Union is unable to find solutions at institutional level, it resorts to monitoring centres, networks and bodies: monitoring centres, networks and bodies which, in actual fact, infringe the democratic rights of the citizens, entrusting them to institutions which are not democratically controlled.
The Lisbon Monitoring Centre has been mentioned.
I do not want to go into the issue of a European Union which widely funds a United Nations crime-fighting body.
The United Nations decided to carry out an internal inquiry into how these funds are spent: of course, the European Union does not feel the need to do this.
It was said of bureaucratic monstrosities such as Europol, Eurodac and Eurojust that it is precisely they which now prevent us from regulating criminal policies.
There is another reason why we are going to vote against the motion.
Without wanting to detract from the rapporteur's work, it is the very proposal of the French Republic and Sweden which fails to apply the principle of subsidiarity in this area.
As yet, we fail to understand what the concept of crime prevention is, for it is not defined anywhere in the proposal or the report.
This is why we are going to vote against the motion: primarily because it supports this European network.
Mr President, the French and Swedish initiative on cooperation between national bodies in the fields of juvenile delinquency, crime and drugs is a follow-up to the Tampere Summit.
This European strategy is based on the principle that EU intervention is bound to give added value to Member State policy.
But today we are facing a tangled web of programmes and a mountain of incoherent measures.
In the field of justice and home affairs alone, we are now being proposed a sixth programme, Hippocrates.
We can rightly ask whether having more of these programmes is the way to fight crime more effectively, especially since the budgets for the programmes are so derisory.
What will be done with the millions of euros allocated to this programme every year?
Furthermore, Hippocrates is not easy to understand.
On the question of financing, for example, the share financed from the Community is not to exceed 70% of the total cost.
Given that the Commission's partners could be universities, administrations or NGOs, how is the remaining 30% to be financed?
Nothing very precise is said about the definition of the proposed forms of prevention or of organised crime either.
Some of the measures are, in fact, rather anecdotal, such as the provision in Article 3 concerning the annual European Crime Prevention Awards.
Measures are therefore being created and introduced with no regard to their relevance or effectiveness.
It is time to stand back and think, rather than rushing ahead, and to take the necessary steps to establish effective cooperation between the national prevention policies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and to say very simply, given the late hour, that the Commission supports the Franco-Swedish initiative to create a European crime prevention network.
This is an initiative which represents a good example of Member States' use of their right of initiative, because it was worked out in close cooperation with the Commission itself.
We believe that this network should focus as a matter of priority on the prevention of small-scale crime, that is urban crime, juvenile crime and drug-related crime, and the proposed Commission communication on crime prevention suggests the creation of a European crime prevention forum which would give priority to the prevention of organised crime.
We believe that there is a great deal to be done to establish the relationship between organised crime and small-scale urban crime, and for these reasons we are pleased that Parliament is supporting this initiative by the French Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino, for your speech. It was very concise but extremely informative.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
We are certainly keeping the precedent set by the Ceyhun report in mind, Mr Watson.
Before proceeding to the vote on the draft legislative resolution, I give the floor to Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ for a point of order.
Mr President, we are about to conduct a strange vote, as we did last month, on this strange new method of a legislative initiative by Member States.
The amended initiative has been rejected.
We are now called upon to vote, firstly on an amendment tabled by our group requesting that the Council be informed of the rejection of this initiative and that the Commission be asked to prepare a new proposal within the framework of its right to take the initiative.
We shall then have to vote on the draft legislative resolution and a favourable vote is needed to inform the Council that we have rejected its initiative.
It is complicated, but it is the same as the situation which arose at the previous plenary sitting and was explained by Mr Watson.
That is to say, the next amendment does not fall. Rather, we still have to vote in favour of rejection for the sake of consistency.
Mr President, I am the rapporteur who was in the same position last month.
But what I cannot understand right here and now is this: we have nailed our colours to the mast and made a decision.
What are the representatives of the Council in this Chamber here for, anyway?
They should at least tell us now how they stand in relation to this, before we carry on voting.
Mr President, on this, as indeed on the two subsequent reports we are going to vote, we should now vote in favour of the legislative resolution which rejects the Council's proposal.
Mr President, I would like to withdraw everything but the first 29 words of Amendment No 33, so that we are only voting on the first 29 words.
The rapporteur was made aware of this beforehand.
The rapporteur has asked for the floor.
Mr President, I would like to point out that competition is an important area of policy, but that it is not part of the Built-In Agenda.
I therefore still urge Members not to vote for this amendment.
Mr van den Bos has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I was unable to make it on time for the votes today due to the extremely bad flight connection between Amsterdam and Strasbourg.
It is unfortunate that Air France is unable to provide this connection without any serious delays.
This means that we cannot carry out our duties here on time and effectively, for which I once again lodge a protest.
Mr President, I would ask you to hear me out, right to the end of the 60 seconds available to me for this explanation of vote before you form an opinion.
This morning, I took part in an important meeting organised by Mr Pronk on pensions in France.
The French director of the French Caisse des retraites explained to us how the Caisse des retraites works - or rather, does not work.
Pensioners in France, and in Europe as well, will have to tighten their belts. They will have to work for 45 years and, throughout Europe, will have to wait until they are 70 before they can retire.
There will probably be a law saying that they can only eat once a day.
This is why I voted for the document on sugar: because it is very useful for sweetening the pill for the pensioners who, throughout Europe, are going to need a lot of sugar for energy.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo. However, I am under the impression that many pensioners prefer to use saccharine.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Daul report calls for an extension of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector, and that is why I have rejected it.
The system has got nothing to do with the market, it is more like something from a planned economy, a combination of production quotas, minimum prices, import tariffs and export subsidies.
All in all, this is not something we should commend, it is something we should criticise, especially as it is downright expensive for the European taxpayer.
The Member States allocate specific regions and quotas to the sugar manufacturers and this sugar is then sold within a protected national market.
You have to bear in mind that 100 kg of white sugar cost EUR 28 on the world market and that the intervention price, the European Union's guaranteed price, is EUR 65.
This is too expensive and it is bad for EU consumers and sugar processors.
This is not a sustainable solution.
. (PT) We broadly agree with the rapporteur's view that the Commission's basic proposal to reduce sugar quotas by 115 000 tonnes should be rejected.
Nevertheless, we regret that our amendment, which aimed to correct the injustice committed by the Commission in allocating Portugal's quota, has been rejected.
Our current quota is just 70 000 tonnes, and the total production rights allocated to growers represent just 20% of the country's consumption.
This means that the economic viability of the only sugar beet processing plant in mainland Portugal, in Coruche, could be jeopardised if it does not reach an output close to 100 000 tonnes.
An increase of 30 000 tonnes has therefore been proposed.
This adjustment would create a level playing field for Portuguese growers and would guarantee the sustainability of sugar beet production, which in any case can and should be increased when the Alqueva dam comes into operation.
Similarly, with regard to the Azores, we believe that it is vital to guarantee the viability of the only existing plant, on the island of SÃ£o Miguel, whose operation is essential for that ultraperipheral region.
The reason why I voted against the modified proposal was that the report proposed to maintain a system that has not been reviewed for 32 years.
The CMO for sugar is unsustainable in the long-term given the constraints in Category 1 (Agriculture budget).
Furthermore, it has major implications for the European taxpayer, for jobs in the food and drink manufacturers and for consumers.
More importantly, this report rejects improvement in management of the sugar regime of which one small measure was the Commission proposal for the abolition of the storage levy.
My opposition to reinstating the storage levy scheme is based on three factors. First, the storage levy is passed on to consumers.
Abolishing the system, therefore, will mean that sugar manufacturers will bear the storage costs.
Second, the abolition of the storage levy scheme will inject an element of competition into the highly distorted market.
This will benefit the sugar-using industry and consumers as well as enabling observers to evaluate the effects of limited competition on the EU sugar sector.
Finally, the budgetary resources allocated to the system (EUR 300 million per annum) could be redirected towards other agricultural expenditure.
The second principal concern about this report is that Daul's amendments extended the current regime until 2005-6 contrary to the Commission's proposal of an interim regime lasting 2 years.
I am opposed to another five year roll-over.
The momentum for reform is mounting.
EU sugar prices are 2.5-3 times the world level.
Such a system threatens to jeopardise the EU's credibility in relation to impending enlargement and WTO obligations.
This report also ignores the conclusions of a recent Court of Auditor's report denouncing the regime as wasteful and mismanaged and stating that the current system leads to substantial costs for the EU budget and consumer.
I have a lot of empathy and support for the farming industry, and I know that many of them recognise that serious and considered reform is necessary to ensure that the sugar sector is prepared for the demands of the future.
By contrast, the consequences of another roll-over would be deeper and deeper quota cuts, which would shrink the base of EU industry and lead to unemployment.
Similarly, artificially high prices cannot be sustained.
They are detrimental to the sugar-using industry and the consumer, and a degree of competition must be incrementally introduced in this sector.
One of the further areas of concern was that comprehensive studies were undertaken to evaluate viable alternatives to the current regime which take into consideration the impact on producers and consumers in order to enable the Commission to draw up more detailed proposals for further reform of the sugar regime on the basis of these reports.
. (NL) We should naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result obtained.
In particular, the amendments tabled by Mr Mulder (ELDR Group) might well mean that the European agricultural policy is finally looked at.
Although we cannot agree on the content of the current sugar policy, we have voted in favour of the amended report because, more than anything, policy is about keeping prior arrangements, as in the case of Agenda 2000.
We should, however, like to underline that the evaluation, with the possible reviews in 2003, should very much take place.
In our opinion, it is wrong just to talk about reviews and subsequently delay the decision-making process, which will ultimately lead to a decline in social support for agriculture.
The present European agricultural policy is no longer appropriate to our times.
The era of firm product subsidisation will, in the short term, need to be replaced by another system.
The landscape, for which the agricultural sector is largely responsible, will need to be maintained, and we can imagine that a compensatory income will be provided for this.
The European citizens will understand this.
We should also like to make a general remark on rapporteurs and their possible vested interests in the topics of their reports.
We would ask you to include in the Rules of Procedure a clause to the effect that any interests must be notified beforehand so as to avoid even the semblance of a conflict of interests.
Farming is an economic activity in the fullest sense and needs long-term prospects.
At a time when farmers are having to face up to new challenges, such as the need to provide good quality products, and to ensure that agriculture pays more respect to the environment, we must give them the means to look ahead to the future.
The world market in sugar is highly unstable. This sector should therefore be given the instruments of stability that our producers badly need, while ensuring that these instruments are flexible enough to allow farmers to take real advantage of more favourable economic situations.
The ACP countries and India have told us how important the price guarantee that the Cotonou Agreement offers them is to the development of their sugar industry, allowing them to prepare themselves for a global economy.
The European Union must emphasise the commitments it entered into towards them.
We endorse the call on the Commission to present impact studies of the various aspects of the COM in sugar, of the possible alternatives to this production.
In the light of the findings, it will then be possible to envisage, if necessary, a review of the COM, but not before 2006, the date set for the general review.
- (SV) As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I have voted against this report.
All initiatives aimed at reforming the common agricultural policy ought to be supported, including this modest proposal from the Commission for a moderate reduction in sugar quotas.
We believe that the EU must open its agricultural sector to the developing world.
The position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is therefore misleading in as much as it defends a continuation of the present EU policy based upon subsidies and tariff barriers against surrounding countries.
I, like other members of the Conservative British Delegation, voted today for a limited extension of the current EU sugar regime in the Daul report.
We all wish for and are committed to a comprehensive overhaul of the common agricultural policy, but this is more likely to happen in a thorough and systematic way if reforms of other sectors are considered as part of a general package in 2006, and besides, there is no absolute guarantee that an earlier ending of the sugar regime would necessarily deliver immediate cheaper sugar prices to the consumer.
Moreover, the current crisis facing our farmers in Britain requires as a priority that this reform be postponed for the time being in order to prevent further deterioration of their economic circumstances and preserve stability of our rural communities.
I strongly oppose Mr Daul's report on the sugar market which aims to extend the existing system, unchanged, until 2006.
I find the Commission's dose of sugar market reforms much sweeter to swallow.
Reform of the sugar market is crucial to tackle over production and high prices on the EU market.
Moreover, it is necessary to comply with WTO rules.
It is important for European consumers and for the European taxpayer.
I want to see the production quota cut by 115 000 tonnes each year and to abolish the reimbursement of storage cuts.
Drastic changes are needed in 2003 when the Commission will review the cereal, oilseeds and dairy sector.
We need to make cuts in the agricultural budget which is in dire need of reform.
The bottom line is that the common agricultural policy must be radically overhauled and reformed.
We waste far too much of the taxpayer's money on this budget and we must look carefully at restructuring and reforming our agricultural policy across the EU.
I do not support this report which far from being sweet, leaves a rather bitter taste.
Kirkhope Report (A5-0069/2001)
Mr President, along with the majority of Parliament, I voted against this document which seeks to harmonise the Community penalties for those who smuggle illegal immigrants onto Union territory.
I feel that it is much more important - and so do all the pensioners who sent me to the European Parliament - and would be much more useful to combat illegal immigration into Europe by stepping up controls at Europe's borders.
Rather than punishing and fining those who are caught in the act of entering European territory illegally, it would be more appropriate to channel more resources and funds into improving controls at Europe's borders.
I supported the proposal for a Council directive on the harmonisation of penalties imposed on carriers transporting illegal immigrants into the territory of the Member States.
Contrary to what some speakers alleged during the debate, it is not aimed at turning the carriers into border police, since they obviously do not have the means of checking the authenticity of the residence and travel permits of the people they transport.
In fact, this proposal provides for penalties only in the case of illegal immigrants who have no documents whatsoever, and that is clearly something a carrier would have to take note of.
Following its usual strategy, the European Parliament began by voting for amendments that completely destroy the balance of the proposal.
In particular, it has exempted carriers from any penalties if an illegal passenger seeks asylum immediately after arriving on the territory of the country of destination.
That derogation is unacceptable, for it is common knowledge that the majority of applications for asylum are unfounded and just made to gain time.
At a pinch, one could consider refunding a fine already levied on a carrier if a passenger does, in fact, obtain asylum.
But it is difficult to go further than that without inflating the number of applications for asylum made for reasons of convenience.
After upsetting the balance of the text in this way, the European Parliament then rejected it, expressing its annoyance that Member States were presenting such 'repressive' texts, on the basis of the right of initiative they still have, for the time being, in this area.
We, on the contrary, thought the proposal for a Council directive deserves to be followed up, since the European Parliament, fortunately, only has a consultative role here.
A first text was presented to the European Parliament in September 2000, on the initiative of the French Presidency.
This proposal was designed to prevent the tragedies that result from the actions of unscrupulous carriers who are prepared to exploit human distress and misery.
I welcome it.
Indeed, I think it is high time we tackled this problem head-on, to avoid any repetition of the tragedies of Dover and Saint RaphaÃ«l.
The aim of this directive is to supplement Article 26 of the Schengen Convention and to define its implementing conditions.
This French initiative defines the obligations of carriers who bring foreigners whose application for asylum has been rejected into the Union.
It proposes harmonising the penalties, which currently differ widely from one country to another, imposed on carriers who have not respected their obligation to carry out checks.
I must admit that I am disappointed by the Swedish Presidency' s text, which steps back from the original text drawn up at the initiative of France.
It is confined to improving the situation in only a very limited way within the actual scope of Article 26 of the Schengen Agreement, although, pursuant to the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, a far more significant step forward could have been taken.
This lack of ambition is apparent when we consider the scope of the text. It does not apply to international rail traffic and it does not precisely define the obligations and financial penalties, which consist of a deterrent penalty of not less than EUR 2 000 per person.
Furthermore, the exemptions from the penalties are not acceptable.
For instance, the text provides that the carrier is not liable for any penalty if the third-country national seeks asylum immediately after arriving in the territory of the State of destination, even if the application is subsequently turned down.
It should surely be up to the State and not the carrier to check the asylum seeker's eligibility.
In the same context, the carrier is exempted from the penalties if the person carried is granted refugee status or leave to remain under a subsidiary form of protection.
While I entirely endorse the initiative and the approach of the French Presidency, I found some of the amendments made to the proposed text unacceptable.
I therefore rejected them.
My colleagues and I, the British Labour members of the PSE have voted in favour of some aspects of the Kirkhope report.
In doing so, we recognised that the proposals were far from perfect but that they did at least attempt to address part, albeit just one part, of the present unsatisfactory situation.
The European Union and individual countries must do more to address the problems and circumstances in the countries of origin that cause people to seek refuge in the European Union.
Progress in this area cannot be made overnight and in the meantime the interests of desperate people, understandably fleeing from conflict, persecution or other hardship, are not well served by pushing them into the hands of the unscrupulous and the criminals; those who seek to make a living out of trafficking people.
It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that traffickers do not profit.
Several of my colleagues and I have been to Calais and seen what goes on there.
I have witnessed first hand the very casual attitude of many of the lorry drivers and their companies.
These carriers must do more - they must properly check all vehicles and all modes of transport to try to avoid another Dover-type tragedy.
All the companies who own the lorries and other vehicles and all carriers of all types must take responsibility for their actions - corporate responsibility from the top downwards.
Equally, there is rationale behind trying to approximate the fines across the different States to ensure that we have a combined front against these traffickers.
This in turn means that all Member States, Britain, France, Belgium and the others alike, must ensure that there are proper systems in place and that the laws are enforced.
In supporting some parts of the Kirkhope report we recognised the complexities of the issue and will continue to work for a full and comprehensive common asylum system for the European Union, one that has humanity and the interests of the most vulnerable at its core.
.
(DE) With regard to the harmonisation of penalties imposed on carriers transporting thirdÂ­country nationals lacking the documents necessary for admission into the territory of the Member States, I wish to say, on behalf of those Members of this House who belong to the Austrian Freedom Party, that although we are in favour of effective measures to prevent illegal entry, these should be taken within the framework of and taking account of the national systems of sanctions which have developed organically.
We have accordingly voted against the minimum penalties proposed, but we do not question the fundamental objective of efficient measures to prevent illegal entry.
- (SV) We have voted against Mr Kirkhope' s report on carriers' liability and call upon the French Republic to withdraw its initiative regarding penalties for carriers transporting passengers with inadequate travel documentation.
The Council' s initiative is another in the series of fragmented proposals aimed only at excluding people from entering the European Union.
For us, it is unthinkable that the Member States' responsibility for checking passports should be transferred to private transport companies.
It is unfair that check-in staff at airports and at harbours, air stewardesses or ticket collectors should instead be given the right to decide who should be granted entry to the European Union.
That is precisely what the result will be if the rules of the Schengen Convention and Mr Kirkhope' s proposal regarding penalties are put into practice.
The right to asylum under the Geneva Convention must be a cornerstone both of Schengen cooperation and of the EU' s common refugee and immigration policy.
The severe sanctions proposed by the Council constitute a significant threat to the right of asylum.
The many people who at present succeed in fleeing from war and oppression and arriving at the EU' s external borders would never succeed in entering the EU if new or increased penalties were to be imposed upon transporters.
Free movement within the European Union must not be implemented at the cost of the EU' s erecting barriers against the surrounding world.
Continued cooperation within the Schengen framework and the common immigration and asylum policy must be characterised by the European tradition of a generous refugee policy in which the right to asylum is guaranteed.
. (NL) It is true that we cannot possibly give shelter to the entire world and that we cannot solve the problems of the world by sending everyone this way.
But it is also a misconception to think that we can keep Fort Europe closed to people who have to, or want to, leave the world outside Europe.
It appears that those people are willing to part with a great deal of money and take huge risks to enter Europe.
We will only change this if we help improve the world outside of Europe, for example by not dragging cheap raw materials and semi-finished products from those regions and by not doing business with oppressive regimes.
Imposing minimum fines undermines the autonomy of the Member States in terms of their criminal law, and the prescribed increase from EUR 3 000 to 5 000 only makes matters worse.
The Kirkhope proposal will only lead to more illegal migration and to higher profits for the mafia.
That is what you get when you punish idealistic helpers and cut off legal access options.
As I already said on 15 February in the context of the Ceyhun report on illegal entry, it is crazy to penalise the solidarity of action groups and churches with political refugees and war victims.
- (SV) We Swedish Christian Democrats appreciate the set of problems that has given rise to the proposal but nonetheless choose to refer this back to the Council and the Commission whom we call upon to develop a proposal taking a more holistic view of the EU' s asylum policy.
The present proposal is problematic because there is a risk of transferring responsibility for making prior checks on asylum seekers to carriers who do not have the required knowledge or authority.
As a result, the right to seek asylum may be undermined, especially since refugees often have difficulty obtaining passports and visas.
I congratulate the last French Presidency on its plans for tough penalties across the EU on carriers illegally transporting third-country nationals into Member States.
Illegal immigration and human trafficking is a key issue for the European Union, and we must work together to tackle this challenge.
Whilst there is, of course, a strong case for genuine asylum seekers applying through the usual routes, the influx of illegal immigrants being smuggled into British ports, often by people-trafficking gangs, is alarming.
We need to send a strong signal to the traffickers that no matter where they operate in Europe, the penalties they face will be harsh.
The response to the UK-Italian proposal for EU teams of police and immigration officers to work in the western Balkans has therefore been encouraging.
Truck drivers must be part of this operation and carry out thorough checks on their vehicles to ensure there is nobody on board.
More disturbing, however, are the atrocious conditions that these immigrants suffer on their journey on trucks and lorries.
Of course, the victims, arguably, are prepared to take drastic risks to enter the countries of the European Union.
We should therefore be also looking at the root causes of this displacement, whether it is persecution in their home countries, poverty or other reasons.
All of us are extremely fortunate to be living in prosperous, democratic countries, and I for one, certainly hope we can open our doors to those who do not live in such fortunate circumstances.
These are simply common-sense measures that will help prevent people being smuggled into countries across Europe.
The British Labour government is carrying out measures to speed up applications for asylum-seekers and is making the system fairer and faster, so that people will be encouraged to make official applications rather than risk their lives on lorries, ships and trains.
Wiebenga Report (A5-007/2001)
Mr President, this morning, I talked to Mr Fitto on the telephone. He was a Member of the European Parliament, an Italian like me, who left us to become the Chairman of the regional council of Apulia in Italy.
Naturally, he is very interested in matters concerning the crowds of immigrants which flood into his region, Apulia, which is opposite Albania and into which huge numbers of Albanian immigrants have come.
He shouted at me down the telephone, saying, "But is it only now that you are doing something to help the States and regions which are flooded with crowds of immigrants?
Why didn't you take action a year, two years ago, at the time of the crisis?
You are late, very late!"
In my opinion, he was right to tell me off, rather than the European Parliament, because, in effect, I would like - and I am calling for this now - the European Parliament to have the power to take swift action in these situations, not to wait two years to do anything.
I voted against the Commission's proposal on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of persons fleeing upheavals of various kinds in third countries.
I had already set out serious objections during the debate and now the European Parliament's amendments have only made matters worse, as, incidentally, have the explanations given by the Commission.
In particular, the proposal for a directive seemed to recognise the fact that a Member State cannot have a quota of refugees imposed on it against its will.
However, Commissioner Vitorino has just presented the situation quite differently.
According to him, Article 25 does indeed provide that a Member State can declare itself unable to take in these persons, but it will have to justify that declaration and the justification must be genuinely exceptional.
Moreover, he pointed out that the decision to introduce the temporary protection system was taken by a qualified majority, implying that a Member State that declared itself unable to take in refugees could not have a right of veto.
The European Parliament went even further by adopting amendments that make it totally impossible for a Member State to dissociate itself from a majority decision on the physical allocation of these refugees.
Moreover, the European Parliament endorsed the Commission's proposals on organising the situation of temporary refugees as though they were to remain in the host country for good, in particular by accepting the right of families to be reunited.
We believe that every Member State must remain master of its own territory, that it cannot have the presence of unwanted foreigners imposed on it, and that while there may be cases where it is necessary to give temporary protection, it must be given mainly with an eye to the repatriation of the persons concerned.
In a world of increasingly open borders, the flood of refugees is not about to dry up.
Those who welcome the progress of globalisation but wish to add a social dimension to its economic component must not forget that the movement of goods also means the movement of people.
The arrival on the French coast on 19 January of a group of 910 Kurdish refugees clearly illustrates the growing involvement of networks of organised crime in illegal immigration.
Above all, however, this massive influx of refugees quite plainly raises the question of the right to seek asylum on European soil today.
It highlights the existence right inside our borders of real trafficking in human beings, which, according to some experts, is approaching the scale of the traffic in drugs. This can be discouraged only by the establishment of genuine channels of legal access to immigration.
The organisation of legal immigration channels in Europe would tangibly reduce the pressure put on the right of asylum by the fact that it is really the only one that exists, together with the right of persons persecuted in their country of origin to be reunited with their family. Under the 1951 Geneva Convention, the right to seek asylum is indeed a fundamental and inalienable individual right that needs to be strengthened and protected from any political considerations.
