In conclusion, I would welcome any improvements that could be made to the implementation rates for structural-funded programmes and projects.
We must tackle this by improved forecasting of payment requirements, but I firmly reject any notion that global amounts could in any way be reduced.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has already been said about this budget and a number of speakers have followed the trend started by the President of the Commission.
If everything is stupid, the very rigour of this budget is stupid.
If the Stability Pact is stupid, if it needs to be revised in order to make our countries and our economies less rigid, then, Commissioner, if anything can be described as great stupidity here, it is the stupidity which leads us, while ten countries are knocking on our door, to restrict ourselves with a highly complex budget that is pared down to the very minimum, forcing us to use all our ingenuity - and, in this regard, I pay homage to the skill of our rapporteur - in order to be able to make any provision at all for Afghanistan and many other subjects, a budget, lastly, that remains fixed and, if possible, even smaller than before.
All this at a time when our States - and your President echoed this very eloquently - believe that we need to break the locks of laws that appear stupid, even to the States which are the guardians of these laws.
Let us also, therefore, consider the budget in this light.
I do not feel this budget takes account of the facts.
I believe that, at this time of enlargement, the Convention certainly needs to consider a new European Treaty, it needs to consider giving Parliament more powers, as it could certainly use them, but also, most of all, it needs to consider the fact that 25 States cannot operate with a reduced budget designed for 15.
That is what I wanted to say in relation to the current climate.
With regard to Thursday's vote, I feel that, yesterday, in the Committee on Budgets, we envisaged a measure that I consider important.
We have just learnt that North Korea is surreptitiously using the civil nuclear programme we are funding, at a high cost of over EUR 20 million, for military purposes, in deliberate violation of the agreements concluded with the international community.
We believe we could strike a blow, when voting on the budget, by placing the appropriations concerned on reserve: this, Commissioner, could perhaps be a way forward, not least where the Council is concerned.
Lastly, we have a budget which I believe to be innovative in other areas.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say firstly that I find it very regrettable that the other half of the budgetary authority is not present today.
It would certainly be right and proper for the Council to attend these debates.
Even though we had a debate on the general principles of the Budget at our last plenary part-session, it would certainly be fitting for them also to be present when we get down to brass tacks - and at Parliament's first reading we really do get down to brass tacks.
In this respect I am very pleased that we have tabled an amendment which, at least initially, places the funds for the increase in Council staff in the reserve and asks a few more questions.
I hope that this amendment will also be supported by a sufficient majority.
It is linked to conditions which the Council can fulfil by the end of the year so as not to jeopardise enlargement.
I actually wanted to start by thanking the Council for making this morning's Solidarity Fund event such a success and for enabling us to reach an agreement.
In this context, however, I hope that the Member States concerned, and in particular the German Government, will now also announce their figures quickly.
We have all made every effort to meet the budgetary conditions.
We have now met both.
We have Budget lines, we have a legal base, and now all we need is money.
If the Commission is still waiting for information in this respect I find it more than shameful.
It is the end of October and it actually ought to be available.
I should like to highlight just a few points, because my fellow group members have already addressed a number of issues.
First, a fundamental comment: it is increasingly clear that the decisions made by the Heads of State and Government in March 1999 on Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective up to 2006 were a wish list of items, which may have been sensible in 1999 but which are no longer relevant to the challenges currently facing the Union.
I should like to illustrate this using just two figures: if we are able, according to the financial perspective, to spend EUR 42 billion on the agricultural policy but can, after considerable effort, only scrape together a final total of EUR 47 million for common activities under the Common Foreign and Security Policy then this shows an imbalance in our political priorities.
Europe's activities in Category 4, in particular its support for the peace process in neighbouring countries - an important task whereby we must help to transfer our European legacy of peace to other regions - are on very, very shaky ground.
The decisions that were made in March 1999 do not help us to meet these obligations in the long term.
I hope that something can be done here - we have of course tabled various amendments in an effort to shore up this work - and that we will at last be given a better chance to do justice to this important task which is incumbent on the European Union in the twenty-first century.
Allow me to address a second issue, one on which I also ask for the support of Members from the other groups.
We have tabled an amendment stating that, in the work on the trans-European networks, special attention should be paid to eliminating bottlenecks to the enlargement countries.
I would be delighted if a majority of this House could support this.
We cannot have a situation where enlargement cannot at the end of the day take place in practice.
It will admittedly happen on paper, but without the necessary infrastructure it will not be able to take place in economic terms.
The Community is called on to act here.
We are doing a great deal for those countries wishing to join us, but we must redouble our efforts.
Madam President, I will do what I can.
I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Stenmarck on behalf of the Socialist Group on a very solid and well-worked report.
But I would like to go further and thank him on my own behalf for the good will and cooperation he has lent me in my temporary work as accidental shadow rapporteur.
Ladies and gentlemen, as has already been pointed out, the preparation of the budget by the other institutions for 2003 has demonstrated the great pressure which the administrative needs relating essentially to the costs of preparation for enlargement exerts on the maximum limit of heading 100.
My group fully supports the rapporteur with regard to the main objective, which is, quite rightly, to provide the institutions with the necessary means for a good preparation for enlargement to 25 countries, which is just around the corner.
To this end, the rapporteur has tried to provide the institutions with adequate means to meet their priority needs.
My group also supports Mr Stenmarck's strategy of frontloading, in other words, providing for the use of surpluses available from the present financial year 2002 to bring forward certain expenses forecast for 2003 and therefore relieve the burden on the 2003 budget, as the rapporteur explained at length during his speech.
Having said this, I shall focus on a series of points that my political group sees as priorities:
First point.
All the institutions - in fact, the European Parliament was the last - just before the vote in the Committee on Budgets, have presented, under pressure essentially from the Socialist Group, a budget based on a rigorous cost-efficiency calculation.
And to use this twelfth language that Mr Wynn described as the Community jargon, the so-called 'Activity Based Budget' has been presented because it is clear that the institutions need a transparent system of financial management for the sake of efficiency.
With regard to staff, I would like to mention two points.
Firstly, my group has always supported the idea of the institutions having the necessary human resources, providing that the needs are real.
We are therefore pleased that the Committee on Budgets has voted in favour of our amendment, in which we request a description of the functions and needs in order to be able to determine precisely what support is necessary in the case of institutional posts. But only for institutional posts.
We therefore reject Amendment No 1 presented to the House by the Group of the European Peoples' Party, which requests that it also be extended to Members of Parliament who have similar responsibilities.
With regard to pensions, I would like to say that this is shameful.
I was general rapporteur for the 1999 budget and in that report I placed great emphasis - almost a separate report - on the urgent need to resolve the problem of the pensions of European civil servants.
We are now in 2002 and we are still making the same appeal.
Mr Ferber, I would also have liked the Council to have been present, since that is the first obligation it must fulfil.
Furthermore, my group has always argued that the citizens need to be aware that the European Parliament is their home; a transparent home.
We therefore support a pilot project to broadcast plenary sittings live.
And, Madam President, because there is no blank cheque here, with a view to the 2004 budget, the European Parliament's Bureau should present us with relevant proposals in this regard.
In order to minimise human suffering and enhance our own credibility, we need to introduce one more correction to the external relations budget.
It remains extremely regrettable that we are still more than EUR 3 million short on the landmine issue.
Funds for this cause have already been cut back worldwide.
The European Union should not take part in this trend.
Some 50 people, mainly women and children, are still affected every day.
An enormous amount of money is still required, particularly for the aftercare of the victims and the relatives.
Moreover, we as Parliament must also meet the commitments entered into in 2001.
We are now incurring payment arrears while the EU has proven that it can make an effective contribution specifically in this field.
This is why the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has re-tabled my amendment.
Our Parliament should recognise that the banning of landmines must also involve non-state players.
Parliament is adopting a consistent stance by endorsing the amendment.
A slight increase in the funds will result in a considerable reduction in the number of people suffering.
Madam President, the exercises in financial engineering required by the current budgetary process demonstrate, once again, the precariousness of the Community financial framework.
We are not, of course, opposed to the priorities that the rapporteur has outlined.
As a matter of fact, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work.
We believe, however, that other approaches could be pursued in order to achieve these priorities, without prejudice to and with total respect for the legitimacy and the competences conferred on us, and particularly which would give us an advantage in achieving these very priorities.
The most important aspect of this situation is the revision of the financial perspective. Or, in the absence of such a revision, the full use of the prerogatives that the Treaties confer on us.
It is, in fact, unacceptable to maintain and sustain a budget that is clearly inadequate for the set of priorities that we are coming up with.
Objectively, the means to achieve the ambitions that are being proclaimed are lacking.
Parliament is constantly losing power and the result is clear to see, especially in heading 4, in which we are seeing a clear and ongoing pressure on cooperation with the least-developed countries, given the inclusion in this category of pre-accession aid for the candidate countries and sums for the reconstruction, first of the Balkans and now of Afghanistan.
This situation must change.
Having said this, I should like to say something about a particular case: that of East Timor.
I shall start by saying that I agree with the sums decided on by the Committee on Budgets.
I do not agree, however, with eliminating the specific line for that young and much-benighted country.
This would send a damaging and destabilising political message to a population that gained independence only a few weeks ago and which is still facing all manner of shortcomings.
This would be a political message that does not, furthermore, tally with the resolutions that we have adopted, or even with the Sakharov Prize that we awarded.
In addition to which, making funds available under the Asia budget line at a time when the path of future cooperation between East Timor and the European Union has not yet been defined would clearly be an act of rashness.
I therefore believe it is right and crucial that the situation that has been created should be rectified in plenary.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this 2003 budget is catastrophic, nostalgic and historic all at the same time.
Catastrophic, first of all, because it is based on a whole series of things which are unacceptable.
For example, the bargain or British cheque.
One night, at Fontainebleau - Mrs Thatcher tells this tale in her memoirs - President Mitterrand said to her 'Madam, you will get your cheque'.
In fact, however, since then, the United Kingdom has become a net recipient.
It is as if a millionaire continued to go to the soup kitchens and considered that this was actually part of the Community acquis.
Second catastrophe: the RALs, for example, not only in the field of the Structural Funds, but also in the field of agriculture.
The difference between the budget on which we voted and the appropriations actually committed, actually taken up, is such that, over ten years, European small farmers have lost out on almost the equivalent of an annual budget.
This budget is not only catastrophic, however. It is also nostalgic.
Everyone has said it, this is the last time there will only be 15 of us.
As the Hungarian President rightly said to us earlier, in a Europe with 25 Member States, there is no question of having two speeds, with some countries receiving 100% of the agricultural subsidies and some, initially, only receiving 25%.
The balance of political powers will be such that we will not be able to carry on this way.
The 2003 budget, however, is an initial response to this need, and that is why it is historic.
Not historic because of a number of pretentious things such as the APS - annual political strategy - or ABB - activity based budgeting.
These things have existed since the 1960s with the planning, programming, and budgeting system.
No, if this budget is historic, it is because it is the first to exceed EUR 100 billion, the first in budgetary history to reach three figures.
And although it took 43 years to get there, it will take barely ten years to exceed two hundred and reach the EUR two hundred billion mark.
In this respect, sooner or later, these two hundred billion will, of course, force us to establish a European tax.
We must welcome this budget, it is the last easy budget, the last simple budget.
In future it will be open season on taxpayers, although it is true that, for our British friends, this will replace fox hunting, which has now been outlawed.
Madam President, this budget has just been described as nostalgic, catastrophic and historic. I believe it is a sound, well-balanced budget and I would like to thank Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck for their perceptive work.
I would like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to points which might seem minor but which concern Parliament's use of its power of initiative.
With due regard for the interinstitutional agreement and the Financial Regulation, the European Parliament is about to vote on new pilot project and preparatory action initiatives, which I believe will be useful for European integration.
The first point concerns preparing small and medium-sized businesses for enlargement.
I feel this will be an important signal to industry which will make that network of small businesses which is so vital for our economies feel more involved.
I am convinced that practical measures would have much more effect than a series of information campaigns.
The second initiative which I would like to mention concerns a programme known as ENEA, dedicated to the elderly, which seeks to repeat the success of the Erasmus and Socrates programmes in the context of the movement of the elderly.
The innovative nature of this programme lies in the fact that it could develop as an interface between culture, social policies and health and that, if Parliament endorses the pilot project, it will be providing the Commission with the opportunity to create a programme which will encourage dialogue between elderly people from 25 different countries.
The last point I would like to mention is the environmental initiative, which, by means of the funding of reforestation measures and the creation of a seed bank, will allow us to promote the mechanism for clean development laid down by the Kyoto Protocol.
This project seeks to promote positive measures at European level to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, while creating an operative structure for the collection and preservation of seeds and plants, many of which would otherwise be lost as autochthonous species, and the use thereof for the purposes of ecological restoration.
This will also create employment, for the diversification of farming will certainly pose problems and require new goals to be set.
The Commission must, of course, now inform Parliament without delay of the measures it intends to take to comply with the recommendations of the budgetary authority if all this is to be put to the vote on Thursday and again in December.
I would like to thank Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck once again for their work, and I hope that the Commission will continue to seek that close cooperation which we have enjoyed in recent months.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard several Members, including the general rapporteur, refer to the RALs and present questions and proposals to the Commission, as well as examine the possibilities for simplification.
I would like to draw your attention to a curious phenomenon: the implementation of the Structural Funds, which represent one of the most voluminous headings, is much greater in the poorest countries of the Union than in the wealthy countries, which is contradictory by anyone's standards.
Logically, it should be expected that the more developed countries should have better implementation and better administration, but this is not reflected in the data they present us with.
Perhaps more specific questions should be asked of the Council.
When considering this issue, we cannot be homogenous and assume that everybody is equal.
I am speaking on a personal basis, but also as permanent rapporteur for the financial perspectives.
I would therefore like to focus on two points.
Firstly, I would like to ask the Council - which, although it is absent, I hope will read the Minutes - whether it intends to comply with what was agreed last year in relation to the contribution to the programme of restructuring the fleet which traditionally fished in Moroccan waters, and which we agreed to restructure as a result of the lack of an agreement with that country.
The Union's budgetary authority, that is to say, the Council and this Parliament, agreed in December 2001 to include, and I would stress, 'in the 2003 budget at the latest', the EUR 27 million still required to finish the programme.
However, in the draft budget, the Council has eliminated a budgetary heading that the Commission had included to this end and I would therefore ask what this means.
Does it mean that the Council does not intend to respect its commitments or does it intend to concoct an excuse?
And do not dismiss me as lacking trust, since what I have is experience.
I have being fighting this fight for many years.
We in the Committee on Budgets propose to you two possibilities which, furthermore, may be complementary.
On the one hand, to carry out a transfer of appropriations in November which are not going to be used in Category 2.
Up until 18 October, EUR 105 million remained uncommitted.
The Commission now tells us that it could only use 9 million.
I would ask it to make an effort with this 105 million, and then we will see what it can achieve.
Otherwise, we should really mobilise the flexibility instrument laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement for the next financial year.
This is not very orthodox, it is true, but it could be accepted, since there is an exception laid down in the article of the Agreement.
Furthermore, I hope that the Council, as it sometimes does, will fulfil its promise and that we can come to an agreement before December.
The second issue is the cut in traditional policies on third countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, in heading 4 they are constantly asking us to increase our aid to new countries, and this is done to the detriment of old ones.
This also implies a consideration by the Council of the total amount for this heading.
Madam President, I should like to touch upon quite a small part of the budget, namely that relating to the decentralised agencies, as they are called.
Two agencies have the problem of being physically situated in countries where the rate of inflation is higher than the EU average, and this erodes their budgets and, therefore, their ability to carry out their tasks.
One of the agencies is that in Dublin, which is engaged in developing the social dialogue, partly in the candidate countries. The other agency is that in Turin which develops vocational training in the Balkans and within the framework of the MEDA and TACIS programmes.
The Commission's budgeting does not take account of this problem of inflation, and I believe that more new agencies are at present being established in order to ensure there is the necessary administrative expertise.
The agencies differ greatly from one another in the ways in which they are set up and in the tasks they have, and I therefore hope that, in the future, we can obtain a budget reading that better takes account of the agencies' different structures and different needs.
Madam President, I too would like to express my concern over the lot of development aid in the budget.
Rigour is the watchword.
Budget headings are removed and reduced, and I feel we are far from a budget that meets our needs and expectations.
Apart from the fact that the increase in this part of the budget is only superficial, since account must be taken of the inclusion of pre-accession aid for Cyprus, Malta and, in particular, Turkey, the general trend conveyed by the figures is not an indication of a great desire on the part of the Union to shoulder its responsibilities with regard to the South.
How odd it is to set the objective of eradicating poverty and, at the same time, cut funds for development aid.
The cuts are clear: less for food aid, less for Latin America.
They are particularly serious for the Mediterranean and the Balkans, without counting the possibility of further cuts which will have to be made if funding for aid to Afghanistan is not found from other resources.
Who can we convince that this so-called reallocation of funds to other headings will lead to more appropriations, greater effectiveness in responding to the needs of the people concerned?
Without a proper review of the Financial Perspectives, the pressure on heading 4 is becoming untenable.
Following the abolition of the Development Council, such a budget would send a very bad signal.
Another example is the negotiations which have just begun with a view to the signing of economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners.
Considerable adjustment efforts are asked of them; that is a financial constraint which cannot be sustained by the ACP countries themselves or by the EDF, but which requires supplementary funds to be specially allocated by the European Union.
Lastly, I wish to lend my support to my group's proposal to create a specific heading for aid to Palestine.
Some claim that the projects funded by the European Union should be abandoned, if they are destined to be systematically destroyed.
Several months ago now, Commissioner Patten estimated the destruction of such infrastructures by the Israeli army at EUR 20 million.
Nevertheless, the Union must certainly not give in to the law of the survival of the fittest and must act as required by law.
That is what Commissioner Patten has constantly reiterated, calling for a serious and concerted effort required to reform and rebuild the Palestinian Authority, as the only viable interlocutor in future peace talks.
This will be achieved through the political and budgetary transparency of this objective.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we already mentioned some of the priorities of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the 2003 Budget in our debate two weeks ago.
Today, I should like to concentrate on making a number of comments on the text that we have agreed with the Council on future cooperation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
In future negotiations with the Council, the Committee on Budgets is proposing to introduce an institutional mechanism providing for greater parliamentary involvement before the Council makes decisions on foreign policy spending commitments.
As you know, in recent years we have been repeatedly confronted with the problem - particularly because of the crises in the nineties - of the Council making spending pledges and then Parliament having to find emergency funds from somewhere by cutting the amounts allocated to other foreign policy priorities.
That is why we want to have a mechanism whereby the Council involves Parliament at an earlier stage, and here we are proposing firstly that Parliament be consulted when possible joint actions are being examined, if necessary on a confidential basis.
Secondly, we are asking for Parliament to be informed by the chair or representative of the chair of the Political and Security Committee about any mandate and above all about the financial impact of a joint action.
Thirdly, a joint work plan should be drawn up by the Commission and Parliament setting out priorities for the coming period.
This is an offer to the Council and only if the outcome is satisfactory will we authorise the funds for the policing mission in Bosnia at second reading.
Initial indications are very positive and I believe that this is a very important step towards also subjecting the Common Foreign and Security Policy to parliamentary scrutiny in the future.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our rapporteurs, GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm und Per Stenmarck, have already produced the broad outlines of our future Budget for 2003.
Previous speakers have highlighted particular points and added new ones.
I wish to do the same and highlight one small point, one that Mrs Buitenweg has already mentioned.
My particular concern, as incidentally has been the case for some time now, is small and medium-sized enterprises and above all micro-enterprises.
We cannot invent a new priority every financial year, so I am sticking to this one.
That is why I will also repeat what many of you know, but it will not do any harm to remind you of it again: 99% of all companies in Europe have fewer than 50 employees.
They employ more than half of all workers and are also responsible for around half of the European Union's entire turnover.
On average each company employs five people.
It is small and medium-sized enterprises that are very innovative and growth-driven.
They therefore play a decisive role in the fight to increase jobs and reduce unemployment.
That, for a social democrat, is what counts!
We are already doing a certain amount at European level to increase the competitiveness of SMEs; let me remind you of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship.
However, we want to do even more.
The project 'SMEs in border regions' should be replaced by a project on 'SMEs and enlargement' and - a number of social democrats have in any case spoken strongly in favour of this - we want a project that helps SMEs to implement the concept of 'Corporate Social Responsibility - a business contribution to sustainable development'.
So far these proposals have tended to be directed more at the large companies.
This comes as no surprise: after all they were involved in drafting them.
We do not consider this to be wrong, far from it, but now we want them to be extended to include guidelines for our small and medium-sized companies.
We want a pilot project on SMEs and social responsibility.
Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs.
Every year I am shocked at the huge amount of work they have to do.
What are my general comments on the budget?
It is widely known, also from previous years, that I am a great fan of carrying out what we have agreed as far as possible.
We should thus remain committed to the financial perspectives.
This year too, there are a number of budgetary items which go beyond these financial perspectives.
This is particularly the case in category 4.
We should, in my opinion, adopt a flexible stance for once.
As far as the necessary expenditure for Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund is concerned, I believe we should use the flexibility instrument and confer with the Council.
Whenever I discuss the budget, I cannot help but mention agricultural spending.
I have once again tabled a host of amendments, and I hope that if they are approved by the plenary, the Council will be prepared to adopt them.
We currently have an FMD investigation committee, which has made a number of recommendations on which you will be able to vote later on this year. However, a number of things are already clear.
It is unacceptable for us to slaughter animals on a large scale again in the future, as we have done in the past.
This is why I have tabled amendments for developing better vaccines and better testing methods, distinguishing between infected animals and inoculated animals, and so on. Also, in my opinion - which is incidentally universally endorsed - agricultural production should focus on quality.
The public, however, should know what quality is.
Europe needs to develop its own quality system which is readily recognisable to its customers, and funding has been made available for this purpose, provided the system is effective.
Finally, with regard to the cost of controlling animal diseases, I believe that it is unacceptable for us to earmark a relatively small amount in the budget for this purpose every year, while every year it becomes apparent that if a real epidemic were to break out somewhere, it would cost billions.
In my view, we need to develop European insurance systems.
Finally, I have noticed that cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament has been good to date.
I hope that this will continue to be the case in future.
Madam President, on behalf of the Budgetary Control Committee, I would also like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, who, I know, have done an immense amount of work on their reports.
Also the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terry Wynn, for the way he expedited the votes in some highly-charged discussions recently.
It is good to get all the work through so rapidly, and I thank him for the way he did that.
My committee was mainly concerned with four areas.
The first was OLAF, Europe's anti-fraud office.
I believe that we have sorted out the problem all the parties in this House had in finding a suitable wording for an amendment about OLAF's funding for the coming year.
But we still have concerns about the dialogue between the Commission and OLAF in the budget process.
Realistically, I am particularly worried that it poses questions about OLAF's independence; it is part of the Commission in this process and we can amend its budget in that way.
The second area was export refunds, something on which Mr Mulder, the previous speaker, is an expert, as is Mr Casaca from the Socialist benches, and a subject I know very little about.
I understand that they are relatively happy with the outcome of the amendments they tabled in this field.
Thirdly, we were interested in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, concerned about the valuation of the euro because so much could have been counterfeited.
Perhaps we should have been more worried about the bizarre comments by the President of the Commission and tabled an amendment about that.
Fourthly and more importantly, we were very concerned about the reform agenda within the Commission and that is why I draw the attention of Members across all the parties to the amendments to the FÃ€rm Report, especially in relation to Commission reform.
The Commission's former chief accountant has drawn our attention to a number of concerns about the computer systems and how to ensure that our taxpayers' money, our national governments' money, is being spent correctly if the computer systems used do not support each other or provide proper figures.
No doubt we shall come back to this in future debates, but those were the main concerns raised by the Budgetary Control Committee.
Madam President, Commissioner, our wonderful rapporteurs, one of the issues which comes up time and time again in debates on the budget is the proper administration of expenditure.
That was the case and continues to be so where other areas as well as the Structural Funds are concerned.
We have received many comments on this issue, almost all of them expressive of indignation but hardly any of them proactive.
However, a number of solutions have been put forward this, as in past years, including the placing of funds on reserve, and we heard this proposal reiterated just a few minutes ago.
I believe that this particular medicine would do more harm than the illness, and so I feel that the right direction to take would be that of simplification.
It has already been said that Commissioner Barnier has set a major project in motion in this field and involved Parliament. Proposals have been developed which, if implemented without delay, will make it possible to limit the loss of Structural Funds appropriations by Objective 1 regions.
However, that is not enough: we need to streamline the all too numerous bureaucratic elements and the endless succession of requests for documentation and controls, and we need a consolidation of funds which responds to the current situation through the integration of development measures.
This is crucial for enlargement too.
A stronger Union does not necessarily mean a more ineffective Union - quite the opposite: the simplicity of the rules and the application of the principle of subsidiarity will make the European budget a flexible political and accounting tool which is free from the burden of the RALs, and, most importantly, it will result in a closer, more intimate relationship between the European Union and the citizens.
Madam President, as I mentioned in the previous plenary session, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs largely welcomed the Council's first reading of the Commission's draft budget.
It is also true that the committee feels that the EU budget for 2003 is considerably more modest than it has been in recent years.
As we all know, this is due to the fact that the considerable information initiatives financed by the EU budget ahead of the introduction of the single currency are now behind us.
However, I will return to this issue in a moment.
Our committee proposed a very modest number of amendments to the budget and I was greatly disappointed that these were almost entirely rejected by the Committee on Budgets.
As I said, the requirements were very small and should have been acceptable, particularly in the case of the committee's position and proposal regarding the PRINCE programme and in particular its sub-section B5-3061: information initiatives relating to the single currency.
There was broad agreement within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the information initiatives should be concentrated on those countries which have not yet introduced the single currency and, to a certain extent, also on candidate countries, which will introduce the single currency one day.
The fact that this amendment was rejected becomes even more regrettable when we consider that at least one, and perhaps more, of the current Member States is highly likely to hold a referendum on the single currency next year.
With this in mind, it seems logical that the funds should be earmarked for these countries, rather than being spent on information initiatives of questionable benefit in the countries which have already been highly successful in introducing the single currency.
It is difficult for me to see what use information measures may have in these countries where the euro is already a reality and part of everyday life.
As Wim Duisenberg, chairman of the European Central Bank, says, the Central Bank has never had any problem selling its product.
I share this view and believe that these measures can be taken by each country which has introduced the euro without any contribution from the EU budget.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the vote at first reading of the 2003 budget, I must confess to mixed feelings.
We are working to overcome the constraints of the Community budget as best we can and find the best possible arbitration.
Having said that, I cannot prevent myself from thinking that we placed these constraints on ourselves.
The now regular reduction in the Community budget as a percentage of GDP seems to me to be of particular concern.
Once again, we do not appear to want to equip ourselves with the means to fulfil our ambitions.
The situation of heading 4 is a prime example of this.
The Council, in the context of large multinational conferences, undertakes to support various very worthy causes: the reconstruction of Afghanistan, campaigns to fight AIDS, etc. Then, when it returns to Brussels, it does not seem to want to give us the means to keep its promises.
We owe it to ourselves to remind the Member States of their duty to ensure coherence and, in particular, to fulfil our ambitions with regard to enlargement.
More generally, I believe that the current Financial Perspective system has shown that it is no longer capable of fulfilling the needs of Europe.
I would not like you to think, however, that our draft budget is bad.
On the contrary, I believe that, in many areas, we have succeeded in making progress and finding compromises that are acceptable to everyone.
I welcome the fact that, as regards heading 1, the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets clearly reflect our wish to make the common agricultural policy fairer, more just and more sustainable, and to strengthen its rural development pillar.
The budget must first and foremost fulfil the citizens' expectations.
The amendments proposed by my group with regard to the 'information and communication policy' chapters are along these lines and are essential to the future of Europe.
The same is true of support for small businesses and craft trades.
As Mrs Haug stated in our various speeches, that must be a priority.
Employment depends on it.
These appropriations cannot be refused year upon year.
I would nonetheless like to thank our two rapporteurs for having instigated new methods of budgetary debate, for greater transparency, because all this is indispensable with a view to increasing citizens' awareness of European politics in future.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Stenmarck.
He has managed to enshrine our desire for a WTO parliamentary assembly in the budget.
This is, I believe, a historic act.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is deeply proud that this has been achieved, at least in this reading.
Secondly, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should also like to thank Mr FÃ€rm very much for his understanding of the problems facing small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in border regions, where I believe that this initiative will be very well received and to which it will offer huge benefits for the future, particularly with a view to enlargement.
I see a further problem.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy adopted the sixth framework programme of research unanimously.
Since this was agreed with the Commission and the Council, however, a new problem has arisen.
On the one hand, we have a development on Basle II that poses a serious threat to the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises, and at the same time enlargement is imminent and the economy is currently in a very poor state.
Mr Walter has already said, quite rightly, that we need to strike a balance and that at present things are out of balance.
We are losing revenue.
So, what do we need to do to improve tax revenue?
We need to prevent even more companies from going bankrupt because bankruptcies threaten to cause a huge increase in unemployment.
This trend could be exacerbated if we do not prepare for the introduction of Basel II in good time.
I myself am an economist, but I believe that the sixth framework programme really does need a Basle II-related research priority - creditworthiness for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I would strongly urge Mr FÃ€rm to support us on this important matter, because we need new instruments so as to continue to guarantee the stability of Europe, and what we need is a stability pact for SMEs.
Madam President, as draftsman for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am broadly happy with the position the Committee on Budgets has taken on our amendments.
I should like to thank Mr FÃ€rm for his help and support.
I am particularly glad that we have maintained my amendments on the security of our EU delegations.
I believe that is of tremendous importance.
I am also glad that we have managed to restore the cuts on the human rights and democracy line.
I understand the strategy of the rapporteur in relation to Afghanistan.
I would just like to make sure it is clear that nothing is going to undermine our commitment to reconstruction in Afghanistan.
I am disappointed, however, that my amendment on landmines was not accepted - the EUR 3.15 million - because that would take us up to the amount to which we had originally committed ourselves.
The line on landmines was very much a European Parliament measure.
I would hope that we can, in our voting, consider restoring that figure because it would take us up to what we originally proposed.
I am disappointed at the amendments whereby EUR 15 million for Palestine is put on reserve under some interesting conditions.
I would hope that we could put all the money for Palestine above the line.
On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I too should like to thank the rapporteurs who have worked so hard, within all the confines, to bring this budget to a successful end.
Incidentally, we held a very extensive debate yesterday on the issue of the three percent, and Mr Prodi should, in my view, simply advise all countries to adopt the EU's budgetary system, for if they were to do this, they would never suffer any shortages again and always have surpluses.
This is the problem we are facing: the system is such that surpluses always arise.
Countries can easily adopt this system, but the only problem is, of course, that certain wishes cannot be met.
The system is ruthless and we have to live with it.
In my view, we have come up with a number of sound solutions to make the system more workable than it has been in the past.
After all, we can protest loudly at a lack of funding, but if you consider what is returned to the Member States, then this always strikes me as a little strange.
We should do something about this.
This has also been laid down in the interinstitutional agreement, and this should also be taken into consideration.
We must simply be able to manage the funding we have at the moment better and not commit everything without giving it a moment's consideration.
We are reasonably pleased with the outcome of, and particularly with the project on, mobility for the elderly which was included in this budget at the instigation of Mr PodestÃ .
I am unhappy about one point, namely the way in which foundations - and I am mainly referring to the foundation in Dublin - are being treated.
If the costs in one country rise faster than in the rest of the EU, there is a certain rule in the Community that provides for this. This is the way it is.
It is impossible for the Committee on Budgets, and especially the person responsible in the Committee on Budgets, to say in such cases: 'Oh no, this does not concern us at all; we simply do not give this money; they will have to draw on their own reserves'.
These reserves do not exist, which is just as well.
This is only a minor point and I do not want to spend too much time talking about it, but it is still important that we do something about it.
Madam President, once again this year we have been struggling with the strict ceiling on category 4, given ever-increasing demands arising from growing international instability and a consequent diminution of the poverty focus of EU aid to developing countries around the world.
But the whole Parliament - not just the Committee on Development and Cooperation - has been clear that development is a political priority overall in this year's EU budget, with support for the global fund against AIDS, TB and malaria.
The Council in its May resolution says it is committed.
The Commission says it wants to retain its board seat.
Yet the EUR 120 million contribution last year is reduced to a proposal of just EUR 35 million for next.
No, Parliament does not want the European Union to provide the minimum possible.
It recognises that AIDS/HIV is the most serious challenge to humankind today; that the United Nations has declared at least 7 billion is needed worldwide; and that proposals amounting to 5 billion have already been tabled.
The global fund represents a bold new approach - fast-moving, participatory and accountable.
The European Union must demonstrate that it can achieve the same vision, imagination and commitment by significantly raising its own financial contribution and offering real European leadership in tackling the most devastating global challenge of our times.
Mr President, I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets has endorsed so many of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in particular budget line B7-524 - assistance in the nuclear sector.
We call for an appropriate sum for cancer equipment in the Republic of Belarus, which is still significantly affected by the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in adjacent Ukraine.
Up to 23% of its territory was contaminated; about 2 million people - including 500 000 children - live in the radioactively contaminated areas.
The sickness rate in the contaminated areas has grown dramatically.
For instance, the number of children under the age of 18 suffering from thyroid cancer is 50 times higher now than before the accident.
Among the adult population, the growth of the number of thyroid-gland cases has increased fivefold.
The most effective method of controlling these tumours is high-dose-rate brachytherapy, which minimises exposure to radiation of healthy organs and tissues during radiation treatment of malignant growth.
High-dose-rate brachytherapy requires high-tech equipment and, due to the high acquisition and maintenance costs of this equipment, Belarus needs assistance.
We should not let our very real concerns over democracy and human rights in Belarus prevent us from helping its children.
Madam President, Mrs Figueiredo, the draftsperson of the opinion, has clearly communicated to the Committee on Budgets and to this House the concerns of the Committee on Fisheries in relation to this draft budget for 2003.
You will be aware that the whole of the CFP represents for European Union budgetary expenditure less than the smallest of the agricultural common organisations of the market; the Union budget intended for fisheries is smaller than that for cotton, for example.
I would like to remind the House of the commitment made by the Council and Parliament to provide the EUR 27 million corresponding to this financial year for the restructuring of the fleet that fished in Morocco.
The people concerned, who are fishermen and shipowners, hope that this commitment will be met, regardless of the form of budgetary or accounting engineering adopted.
Although there are no resources to increase the lines for social dialogue and coastal fishing as we would have liked, the Commission should take account of Parliament's desire for these two issues to receive more support.
Madam President, I wish to speak about regional policy and transport issues, but first let me congratulate the rapporteurs and the committee chairman on their work.
Unfortunately, my news is not good news.
The trans-European networks, despite the commitments made by the Essen Council, are progressing at a snail's pace.
Priority works are at a standstill and the Council's response is further cuts.
This being so, we in the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport wish to give our unconditional support to the amendments, also backed by the Committee on Budgets, which are designed to rectify this situation somewhat.
Secondly, I also wish to express our serious concern about the disbursement of funds from the Structural Funds.
We got off to a very slow start in 2000, for which the Member States were mainly to blame and the same applied in 2001.
We know that the Commission is trying to do something about this and that Commissioner Barnier has tried to do something about this, especially with his recent communication and the meetings he has been holding with Ministers from the Member States.
However, the Member States must do what they can.
Someone commented, and I entirely agree, that the situation is worse in the rich Member States than in the poor.
So they must do what they can to ensure funds are disbursed quickly and, of course, the Commission must monitor developments closely so that we can put a stop to this problem because, if things go on as they are, I am afraid that, in the end, a big chunk of Structural Fund resources will go to waste.
Madam President, the vast majority of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I am rapporteur, have been taken into account in the 2003 budgetary procedure.
Regrettably, three of the committee's amendments that I consider to be important were rejected or altered.
They are being put to the vote again in the plenary.
They concern firstly cooperation with third countries on migration.
Here we want the commitments to be increased by a further EUR 5 million.
I am convinced that the only way to improve the situation is to step up cooperation and that means more funds from the European Union.
Secondly, they concern the European Refugee Fund.
I do not think that I need to dwell on this as the issues are actually already well known.
The third point is the Celex budget.
Although the situation has changed immeasurably since the attacks on the USA, we have done a great deal without demanding a dramatic increase in expenditure.
I therefore think that all of our demands - these three points - are justified and would ask you to bear this in mind when you vote.
Madam President, if you want to find out what is really important for a person, do not ask them.
Just ask to look through the stubs on their chequebook or the entries on their credit card account and you will find out.
This afternoon we are actually looking through the stubs of the Commission's chequebook and what do we discover? EUR 2.4 billion spent on olives but EUR 240 million on the Socrates Education Programme for the European Union.
As budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, I cannot but help notice that we spend one tenth of the money on education that we spend on olives.
On information for enlargement, the Commission proposed EUR 14 million in the budget - a good sum you might think, until you see that the subsidy proposed for bee keeping was EUR 16.5 million.
I am not criticising support for bee-keeping, but I think that this Parliament was right to increase the amount that the Commission wanted for information on enlargement from EUR 14 million to EUR 21 million.
If people in the candidate countries and the existing countries do not understand enlargement, then we shall only have repeats of the problems that we experienced in Ireland.
On that EUR 21 million, the Budgets Committee accepted the proposal from the Committee on Culture that EUR 1 million should be set aside for training future MEPs from the candidate countries.
We had the President of Hungary here this morning, which shows that clearly politicians from the candidate countries are looking forward to joining this Parliament and they need training to be able to do that properly.
I am also pleased that we have been able, if this budget is now passed, to reinstate the amount of money for e-learning, namely EUR 17 million as opposed to the Commission's proposal of EUR 9 million.
It is not just that our budgetary priorities are wrong, the system is also wrong.
I will pay tribute to the support we have had from the budget rapporteur this year and from the Commission, but the Council is absent this afternoon.
It has been absent from discussions with the committees looking at the proposed budget.
It really should be ashamed of its position in this respect.
I agree with Mr Perry and the other speakers who, over the afternoon, have pointed out that the Council needs to be present at this debate.
I would like to stress this on behalf of Parliament.
It is important that the Council takes part in our debates and gets to hear our views.
Madam President, I would like to devote my two minutes to expressing my satisfaction at the fact that the proposal which has been put forward allows increased work on trying to prevent the spread of poverty-related diseases, primarily HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.
We know that these diseases create enormous difficulties and problems for millions of people and that years of development work are quickly eroded due to these diseases causing so much sickness and death.
As long ago as in the 1990s it was possible to make forecasts, particularly regarding the spread of HIV, suggesting that in certain cases up to 25% of the adult population in some countries would be infected.
These forecasts were dismissed.
I must say that both the international community, including donor countries and individual countries in the South, took these problems far too lightly.
Until very recently, the Commission has also done very little within the framework of its aid.
As we now have a new directive on how these issues are to be handled, and particularly as we are increasing the budget, there is now an opportunity for us take on much greater responsibility on this issue.
I would particularly like to stress the importance of us ensuring that the global fund which has just been set up has enough money so that the EU and Europe are able to have a proper and stable influence on this work.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking both rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets and the members of the Committee on Budgets for the fact that - and this is a first - the lion's share of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have been adopted by the Committee on Budgets in the same or altered form.
These amendments, Commissioner, pertained to three areas.
The first group of amendments related to violence against women, including genital mutilation, rape, the stoning of women etc., in a large number of countries worldwide.
We have for the first time included a clause in the budget that stipulates that the aid we provide to a number of countries can be suspended if they fail to respect women's rights.
I welcome this and thank the Committee on Budgets.
This is the first area that has been adopted.
A second area is about women and decision-making.
In many Member States, a great deal of progress has been made in the field of political decision-making by women.
Trade unions and employers, however, have done very little to promote the presence of women in their organisations.
This is nonetheless necessary, for trade unions and employers have more or less acquired the status of legislator in a large number of Member States: agreements concluded by them have the force of law.
They have thus acquired a great deal of power but have not made as much effort to bring women to the fore as our national parliaments and our national political parties have.
This amendment has also been adopted, for which I thank the Committee on Budgets.
An amendment that has not been adopted - and I will call on the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou in this connection - is the amendment on more flexible standards for the financing of projects intended for women.
The standards are very high at the moment.
Many women's organisations are unable to comply with them.
This is the only amendment that has not been adopted.
I should nevertheless like to express my thanks on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Thank you for this contribution.
As a woman, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your work over so many years on women's issues.
This work has clearly produced results this time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)
Question No 38 by Raimon Obiols i GermÃ  (H-0645/02):
Subject: Food crisis in the Tindouf refugee camps
As a result of statements made by Radhouane Nouicer, UNHCR operations manager for North Africa and the Middle East, we learned in early September of the food crisis affecting the 155 000 Saharawi refugees in the Tindouf refugee camps.
The WFP reports that if no new food aid is received, refugees will only get 11 per cent of their daily food requirements - about 231 kilocalories per person - in October, compared with the standard ration of flour, pulses, beans, vegetable oil and other products, providing a daily total of 2 100 kilocalories.
The children are in an especially serious position, since according to UNHCR data 35% of them are suffering from chronic malnutrition and 13% from rickets.
We are aware that the Commission has limited resources at its disposal, but is it able to make an immediate contribution in order to alleviate this impending food crisis?
What mechanisms could the Commission use to encourage the Member States to make fresh contributions to the WFP?
A major part of ECHO's strategy is dealing with forgotten crises, and this is quite important.
This is also why we are providing continued assistance to the Saharawi refugees.
ECHO is the largest source of aid to these refugees.
Over the last three years, ECHO has more or less doubled its assistance to the Saharawi refugees from about EUR 7.5 million in 1999 to EUR 14.34 million this year.
While the World Food Programme is responsible for the basic foodstuffs ECHO is concentrating its assistance on supplementary food products in order to ensure a more varied diet.
However, in view of the problems the World Food Programme has had in finding the donors it needs to meet its commitments ECHO decided, in 2001, to set up a three-month buffer stock of basic products such as cereals, pulses, oil and sugar, which the WFP can use in case its supplies arrive too late for distribution to the refugees, the condition being that the World Food Programme should undertake to replenish these buffer stocks.
This arrangement has been invaluable, with 13 such loans totalling a volume of 12 153 tonnes in the period until the end of October 2002.
The problem is that so far only 5 589 tonnes have been replenished, leaving the buffer stocks very low, at a level of 17.24% of the full amount.
It was against this background that, at the beginning of September 2002, the World Food Programme and the UNHCR issued a joint appeal for further international assistance to satisfy the needs for basic food items.
While it may be correct that the WFP could cover only 11% of needs in October, it must be said that this figure relates only to deliveries from WFP and does not take account of deliveries from other donors.
ECHO financed 300 tonnes of rice, delivered in October, and the use of the ECHO buffer stock I mentioned has made an important contribution, enabling us to satisfy the total needs for basic food products in October.
So it is not the case that in October they only received 11%.
As I have explained, the situation is much better.
Let me say a few words about the ECHO global plan for these refugees, which was adopted by the Commission this year.
This plan, involving an amount of EUR 14.34 million, should reduce the full impact of the crisis.
Over 80% of the ECHO 2002 global plan consists of food products.
Under this plan, a further 5 000+ tonnes of basic foodstuffs are due to arrive in the coming weeks.
In addition, over 3 000 tonnes of ECHO-financed supplementary food products will be supplied in the next few months.
The WFP has also announced that it is sending over 4 000 tonnes of basic foodstuffs.
This is the good news.
Nevertheless, there is still cause for concern, particularly as regards the January and February distributions, owing to the possible lack of foodstuffs to satisfy total needs in that period.
There is some donor fatigue.
This is the background.
I agree with the question in this respect.
This is also why ECHO is involved in different ways in raising donor awareness about this conflict and these people.
Mr President, I simply wish to thank the Commissioner for the information he has provided us with and the Commission in general for the work it has done, in particular ECHO, to alleviate this situation which is very worrying from a humanitarian point of view.
The High Commissioner, Mr Ruud Lubbers, used the word 'unacceptable' and I would add politically sordid.
If the political explanation for this unacceptable, from a humanitarian point of view, situation is donor fatigue, it must be said that some donors are fatigued by really very small sums.
If there is any other explanation, this is all the more sordid, because there are much more worthy and, above all, effective ways to apply pressure than to make women and children suffer as a result of the issue of food aid.
In summary, thank you very much, Commissioner, for your information and your work.
I have just one supplementary remark.
Tomorrow, in Copenhagen, there is a conference on Forgotten Humanitarian Crises.
This reflects a very deliberate and systematic effort by the Commission, through the humanitarian office ECHO, to work out a methodology to identify what could be called 'forgotten crises' - ones where the CNN factor does not draw attention to the people in need.
This falls into that category, so I definitely welcome the question and the opportunity to answer it and to highlight problems.
That makes the dialogue with Parliament meaningful and useful.
Question No 39 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0630/02):
Subject: Allegations concerning use of EU aid to finance terrorist activities in Palestine
Allegations have been made on a number of occasions in recent years that EU aid to the Palestinian Authority has been used to finance terrorist activities.
In May this year, the Israeli Government handed over a report to the Commission which it claimed proved that the Palestinian Authority had enabled part of the EU aid received to go to terrorists or even terrorist activities by, for example, inflating the cost of the civil service.
What possibilities does the Commission actually have of monitoring how the aid is used?
In what way has the Commission made use of the information provided by the Israeli Government?
There have been several allegations about alleged misuse of European Union monies by the Palestinian Authority.
Some time ago, part of the Israeli Government prepared a dossier claiming to show that President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority used funds provided by the European Union, along with Norway and some other countries, to finance supporters of terrorism or even directly underwrite acts of terrorism.
These are most serious allegations.
They have been carefully examined by the Commission.
I should stress, as I have already done before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets, on 19 June, that, on the basis of all the documents made available by the Israeli Government, the Commission has not found evidence of European Union funds being used for purposes other than those agreed between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority.
The Commission provides EUR 10 million a month to the Palestinian Authority in budgetary support.
This constitutes 10% of their overall budget.
European Union support has helped prevent the total collapse of Palestinian institutions and, therefore, preserved one of the interlocutors in the peace process.
At the same time, it has provided the necessary pressure and guidance for serious reform, particularly in public finances.
Let me remind the House that, ultimately, the European Union provides budgetary support to mitigate the effects of the freeze of revenue transfers totalling over USD 680 million by the Government of Israel over the last couple of years.
Budgetary assistance is subject to a number of conditions relating to administrative and judicial reform, financial control and so on, which are reviewed and strengthened on a regular basis.
Disbursement of budgetary support is monitored on the ground by the Commission and the International Monetary Fund, which reports on a monthly basis on economic and fiscal developments and provides information covering revenue developments, evolution of employment, wage bill and non-wage current outlays, developments of capital expenditure and so on. The merits of our budgetary assistance have been widely recognised, not only by the Council of Ministers, but also by the international community.
The United States and the other members of the quartet - the UN and the Russian Federation - have recognised the progress which has been made in the management of the Palestinian Authority's financial affairs, thanks to our aid.
Achievements in reform, which have been made largely thanks to our budgetary support, include the establishment of a single treasury account, the consolidation of all the Authority's public finances and progress towards a modern system of financial control.
Next comes the imposition of an austerity budget, then the containment of arrears and, finally and very importantly, the adoption or entry into force of key legal acts, such as the judicial independence law and the basic law.
It is also worth remembering that, in recent weeks, Israel has paid over USD 45 million to the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Finance, which is a small but still positive step.
This money has been transferred into the same treasury account as the EU budgetary support and is subject to the same European Union and IMF monitoring mechanisms I have just described.
I hope some Members will reflect on that sentence.
Israel has therefore recognised that progress has been made in the financial domain, and that is in no small part due to our policy-based financial assistance and budgetary support.
Ultimately, Israel should resume regular transfers and in that respect I welcome the constructive discussions held recently between Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush.
Finally, it is our firm view that financial support should be continued.
Withdrawal of budgetary support will lead to collapse of the Palestinian Authority, further chaos and a more desperate humanitarian crisis.
The Commission will continue to monitor the use of budgetary support and compliance with all the conditions attached to it.
We will, as always, investigate all allegations of the misuse of funds as a matter of the utmost priority.
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his response and for his involvement in this issue.
When the Israeli Government publishes these details, we as members of the European Parliament naturally wish to get to the bottom of the matter.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner the following questions:
Do you feel that relations with the Israeli Government are good and that the Israeli Government believes that the report submitted to the Commission and to the European Parliament can be removed from the agenda? Or do the Israelis maintain the accusations contained in the report?
I also wonder whether you believe that the aid which the EU is giving to the Middle East is sufficiently well controlled in general rather than just in this case.
I am afraid that, unusually, the honourable Member's information is slightly out of date.
I am not aware of the Israeli Government insisting that the facts they presented before are accurate and, indeed, were they to do so, I cannot quite understand why they should have resumed transfers to the Palestinian Authority using exactly the same mechanisms that we ourselves use.
It would be a very curious thing for them to do.
This is a story that keeps coming back, whatever facts are produced to refute it.
However, it is not irrelevant to note that the other members of the quartet - that includes, as I said, the United States and the United Nations - not only support what we are doing but believe that we have been in the lead in promoting reform, not least of the Palestinian Authority's finances.
Commissioner, I have listened to you answer this question on a number of occasions.
I have known you for some 20 years now and I know you to be a man of honour who has always been opposed to terrorism.
Let me ask you two questions: do you not get frustrated that, when you give such a clear and unequivocal answer, Members do not accept your word?
Secondly, would you not also agree that our aid to Palestine in fact contributes to eliminating the sort of conditions in which terrorism thrives?
I am grateful to the honourable Member for what he said initially.
Who would not be?
He knows that I am a man of legendary generosity of spirit, so perhaps I just have to take it as a fact of political life that however much you tell some people the truth, they prefer to ignore it.
It would be helpful if some of those who keep making these accusations would sometimes turn up in the Chamber or at the committee meetings where I have been refuting the allegations.
It might also help if they would occasionally read the newspapers and see what is being said and done about the reform of the Palestinian Authority.
But I suspect that one or two of them have their own games to play, games that owe very little to fact but a good deal to prejudice and malevolent whimsy.
Secondly, with regard to the impact on conditions on the ground, the situation on the ground - and this is not easy to dispute - is appalling.
We have recently had the report by the UN Secretary-General's special envoy, Catherine Bertini, followed up by a further study.
The private remarks of the British Ambassador in Tel Aviv have been reported in the Israeli media.
I do not believe for one moment that impoverishment, degradation or hunger - all of which have existed in some form in Palestine - are conducive to Israel's long-term security.
Are you more or less likely to encourage lack of moderation or extremism in the conditions that exist in the West Bank and Gaza?
I hope that the points that Mr PÃ©rez made to us during the EU-Israel Association Council yesterday about the humanitarian situation on the ground will lead to some improvement.
I hope that the increase in our assistance to UNWRA will help improve the situation and I hope that the Israeli Government will listen to some of the things we are saying, for instance about the blocking of 500 containers of World Food Programme assistance in Ashdod Port at the moment.
What does that have to do with the security of Israel?
So, I totally sympathise with the argument that Israel should have assurances about its security, but I do not think that making life intolerable for Palestinians is the right way of achieving that.
I would remind you that two questions can be asked and I give the floor in chronological order; Mr Tannock has the floor.
If Commissioner Patten or his office take this view, then why have they so strongly resisted the initiative by myself and Members from other political groups to raise signatures in this House to request that Parliament set up a committee of inquiry into these very grave allegations?
If what he says is correct, surely such a body would vindicate his position, clear the air and reject these ongoing allegations of funding of terrorist activities by the PLO, but also, perhaps more insidiously, the funding of race hatred and the brainwashing of young Palestinians in their schools, which furthers long-term animosity and potentially creates future suicide bombers?
The honourable Member has added to the first part of his question allegations about Palestinian textbooks being funded by the European Union.
Again and again, in this Chamber and in committees, we have pointed out that these allegations are totally without foundation.
We have made available to Members of this House the report by heads of mission in Jerusalem, which again exposes the extent to which this is a simple, straightforward fabrication.
So when the honourable Member asks me: why do I not welcome a committee of inquiry into a previous set of fabrications? What on earth does he think I will say?
Setting up such an inquiry - and I do not for one moment think that this House would vote for it - would make it look as though there were some legitimacy in these allegations.
Furthermore, if you set up an inquiry like this, just think of the impact on everybody in my services who ever has to sign a cheque for UNWRA or for anything to do with the Palestinian Authority.
It would have the effect of drying up assistance to the Palestinian Authority and to UN and humanitarian organisations because of the psychological effect, and this at a moment when we are preparing for the ad hoc liaison committee donors' meeting in early December, when the European Union - and my thanks to the budgetary authority and my colleague, the Commissioner for the budget - will be expected to take a lead in providing more humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians.
Who will expect us to do that?
The Americans will, the UN will and the Israelis will - not to mention the rest of the international community.
So I say to the honourable Member, and I am sure that his question is not prompted by any malign motives, that the notion that this proposal to set up an inquiry is somehow helpful to me and to the cause of humanitarian relief in Palestine and to finding a political accommodation to save us from this blood feud, is about as far from reality as it is possible to go.
I would like a committee of inquiry on these issues like a 'hole in the head'!
Question No 40 by JosÃ© MarÃ­a Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado (H-0688/02):
Subject: Russian Federation - expulsion of Catholic priests
It is well known that in the Soviet era many Catholics were displaced from the Baltic States, Poland and Germany into the Russian heartland.
The pastoral care of these people is being frustrated by recent expulsions of five Catholic priests.
Are these expulsions by the Russian authorities compatible with the international obligations of the Russian Federation in respect of human rights and freedom of religion?
The Commission actively promotes the principle of religious freedom as part of our dialogue on human rights with the Russian authorities.
We fully share the concern of the honourable Member over recent expulsions of Catholic priests and, as the honourable Member will know, other Christian denominations have been affected recently as well.
This practice is not compatible with Russian commitments on human rights.
In particular, the joint statement of the last European Union-Russia Summit in Moscow states our common aim of strengthening society, based on respect for democratic principles and human rights.
The Commission will continue to impress the message upon the Russian authorities that the effective partnership that the Union and Russia are trying to establish necessarily has to be based on a series of fundamental core values, among which is full respect for human rights, including freedom of religion.
Within the framework of our intensive political dialogue with Russia, the European Union has repeatedly raised its concerns regarding freedom of religion in Russia.
The Commission continues to raise these and other related human rights issues with the Russian authorities.
In parallel, the promotion of human rights in Russia will continue to be a priority in the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
As Parliament will know, Russia is a core country under this programme.
I repeat to the honourable Member my personal concern about this issue and my determination that we should raise it whenever we need to with the Russian authorities.
Mr President, I do not need to ask any supplementary question.
I simply wish to thank the Commissioner for his comments and make it very clear that, naturally, the question referred to Catholic priests, but this affects all non-orthodox Christian denominations given that there is still a certain tradition (if I may put it that way) of territorial monopoly which is not compatible with the right to religious freedom.
I would like to thank the Commissioner once again and wish him every success in his efforts.
As the honourable Member and I have both noted, other churches have been involved.
For example, there was the case of a Swedish Protestant pastor.
A number of Protestant missionaries were similarly expelled, and last year the Moscow branch of the Salvation Army was disbanded.
So this is an issue of general concern.
Whenever Christian pastors or missionaries are treated in this way, it should be a matter of considerable concern.
Having spent Good Friday this year in Shanghai Cathedral where the Veneration of the Cross was celebrated by the Bishop of Shanghai, who spent about 20 years of his life in solitary confinement in prison, I am aware - as are we all - of the remarkable sacrifices made by Christian missionaries, priests and bishops in countries where, alas, freedom of religion is not enjoyed as it is by and large in the European Union.
This reply from Commissioner Patten concludes the first part of Questions to the Commission.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
Question No 41 by Erik Meijer (H-0707/02):
Subject: Preparing, buying and using a special bookkeeping system by the European Commission
With regard to the matter referred to in written questions E-2557/02, E-2558/02 and E-2559/02:
Can the Commission confirm that around 1995 the Commission had planned to use 4000 licences from the German software enterprise SAP, specially developed for its purposes?
Can the Commission confirm that it finally bought 700 licences from SAP and that only 300 or 400 of these licences were really used?
What is the number of licences currently in use?
How are those licences actually used?
Mr President, when the Commission placed an order with the software company SAP at no time did it think in terms of an order of magnitude of 4 000 users.
In the public call for tender of 1994, a figure of 1 053 potential users was given as an indication.
On the second point: following the public call for tender, which was published in the Official Journal, the Commission - and specifically the SINCOM Council - decided to conclude a framework contract with SAP to buy SAP R/3 software licences worth EUR 1.5 million; that was the value of the order including the associated service agreements.
This amount covers the use of the financial accounting module by 600 civil servants, the vast majority working in the budget and Financial Control Directorates-General, as well as a few users in the internal and external audit services, for example the Court of Auditors, and in the operational Directorates-General.
On your third question: the actual number of users of the SAP financial accounting software currently stands at 300.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response.
My additional question is whether you are of the opinion that the Commission has fully exhausted all the options that were prepared and paid for.
If not, why not?
Will you be making more effective use of them, given the fact that you are quoting a higher number than was eventually used?
Mr President, as you know, the SAP R/3 accounting system is used both by the financial control services and by the accounting, or bookkeeping, department.
I would, however, be quite happy to answer your question in more detail in writing.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for answering the question.
I would be interested to know how the system has actually been prepared for the enlargement of the European Union.
This will of course present particular challenges in terms of bookkeeping.
We are also aware of the accusations that have appeared in the media.
What precautions will you take in the future to ensure that the existing system will guarantee, even after enlargement, that financial management is tailored to future requirements and that the European taxpayer is protected?
Mr RÃŒbig, the accounting system that we have does not only consist of the SAP R/3 software that has just been mentioned; the SINCOM 2 system is also available for services that manage funds.
All of the Commission's services and all offices that manage funds are linked up to this.
As far as enlargement is concerned, the number of services linked up will not actually be increased immediately now.
Pre-accession aid is also managed using this system.
Preparations for enlargement obviously require the candidate countries and new Member States to take certain measures.
Accounts for the Commission will of course have to be opened in the central banks or national treasuries.
Very intensive preparatory discussions are underway between the Budget Directorate-General and the individual accession countries about the whole business of collecting own resources and using the national treasuries.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
Question No 42 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0654/02):
Subject: Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the granting of visas
On 27 July 2002 the Spanish-Argentinian couple Juan Carlos Manteca Cendrero and Carlos Daniel Bettio submitted an application for a residence visa on the grounds of family reunification to the Spanish Consulate-General in Buenos Aires (Argentina) so that Daniel Bettio, an Argentinian citizen, would be able to reside legally in Spain. They attached the required documents, having been informed by the Consulate that visas had been granted in the past to people in the same situation, i.e. same-sex couples.
On 13 August 2002 they received notification that the visa had been refused 'because they did not meet the conditions laid down in RD 864/2001'. The section where an indication must be made as to which specific condition has not been fulfilled states 'negative report of the government or labour authority'.
Taking account of the specific circumstances of this case and the widely-held suspicion that same-sex couples are being refused visas, which would be a violation of equal rights, and bearing in mind that this would also be in breach of rights enshrined in the Spanish Constitution and EU law, in particular the Treaty of Amsterdam, which lays down that everyone enjoys equal rights regardless of their sex or sexual orientation, can the Commission say whether it might be proposed that the burden of proof be reversed in view of such incidences of sexual discrimination (refusal to grant a visa to Carlos Daniel Bettio)?
Is it aware that this type of discrimination in the granting of visas is occurring in the EU?
What steps can be taken to prevent it?
What measures are available to us to avert or take action in such cases
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo raises the issue of the rejection of an application for a residence visa submitted by an Argentinean citizen on the grounds of family reunification in Spain with his Spanish same-sex partner. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo considers this rejection to be discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation.
Family reunification of citizens of the Union not covered by Community law in the field of free movement and residence, as in this case, is not yet the subject of a Community instrument and remains subject to the national law of each Member State.
A refusal to grant the residence visa must be contested before the competent national authorities.
Article 63(3)(a) of the Treaty stipulates that the Council shall take steps in the field of conditions of entry and residence, as well as standards concerning the procedures for issue of visas and long-term residence permits by the Member States, including for the purposes of family reunification.
Family reunification measures must be adopted in accordance with the obligation to protect family life and the prohibition of discrimination.
In its amended proposal for a Council directive on family reunification, the Commission, at the request of the Council, removed the provision designed to bring the family reunification of EU citizens' family members, when said citizens are resident in a Member State of which they are a national and have not exercised their right to free movement, into line with the family reunification of EU citizens' family members where said citizens have exercised their right to free movement.
The situation of these people will therefore be addressed in a specific proposal at a later date.
Community legislation currently in force in the field of free movement and residence of EU citizens and members of their families provides for the family reunification of spouses, but not unmarried partners.
In order to take account of the rapid evolution of the family unit in society and recognition in some Member States of special legal status for unmarried couples, as well as the need to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination against unmarried partners of both sexes, the proposal for a directive on the right of EU citizens and members of their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, adopted by the Commission on 23 May 2001, extends the right to family reunification to unmarried partners where the legislation of the host Member State likens the situation of unmarried couples to that of married couples, in accordance with the conditions laid down by this legislation.
Mr President, I would be grateful if Commissioner Vitorino could respond to this question personally, orally and in plenary session since on this issue the European Union is clearly opening up the way.
Proof of this is that just this morning, in this House, the European Parliament approved a motion for a resolution in favour of homosexual refugee partners having the right to family regrouping.
Does the Commissioner then think that we could apply this position to the case we are dealing with now?
The Commissioner knows that we are referring to a current demand and I would ask him to respond so that we may know what we should do in order to contribute to obtaining positive results.
Mr President, as I said in my written response, we proposed to the Council, within the framework of the directive on family reunification, a specific rule governing unmarried partners, including same-sex partners.
At the request of the Council, we withdrew this proposal from the directive, on the basis that it would be preferable to address this issue in a specific legal instrument.
We are currently working on the preparation of this document.
I make no attempt to hide from Mrs Izquierdo Rojo the fact that the difficulty lies in the sheer number of legislative solutions laid down in the fifteen Member States with regard to the legal recognition of unmarried couples, in particular same-sex unmarried couples.
We have to strike a balance between a non-discriminatory solution and compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
We believe there should be no discrimination, in the case of third-country nationals, when the national legislation of the Member State lays down the recognition of comparable rights for married and unmarried couples, including same-sex unmarried couples.
Question No 43 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0659/02):
Subject: Combating paedophilia
The lenient sentences recently given to people charged with taking part in a major paedophile network in France frustrated public opinion.
In view of the fact that none of the existing programmes on combating organised crime or on police and judicial cooperation is directly concerned with paedophilia, will the Commission take practical steps to draw up a proposal for the harmonisation of Member States' legislation in regard to the definition of the offence, penalties, the age of the victims and their care, and draw up a programme to combat the phenomenon?
Does the Commission have comparative data on the legislative and judicial means of combating this tragic phenomenon in the various Member States?
Does the Commission believe that Europol and Eurojust have the appropriate infrastructure to track down and crack down on such networks?
As Parliament knows, in December 2000 the Commission proposed the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
I am very happy to tell you that, on 14 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached political agreement on the Commission's proposal.
This framework decision is one of the most far-reaching instruments so far when it comes to the approximation of criminal law.
It addresses various forms of sexual exploitation of children, such as coercing a child into prostitution, pornographic performances and abuse of a recognised position of trust.
Child pornography, both on- and offline, is also covered.
As regards penalties, the Council has taken steps to establish a general approach to the approximation of penalties.
This is also the main reason why the Council took so long to adopt this framework decision.
Now, the framework decision stipulates levels of penalties ranging from between one and three years for basic offences to between five and ten years in circumstances that aggravate the offence.
The framework decision does not approximate the age of sexual consent.
The Commission believes that this is an issue for the Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
The age of sexual consent, as defined by national law, is, however, used as a dividing line for different levels of penalties.
The idea is to reflect the principle that the younger the victim the worse the offence.
In terms of final assistance, the STOP programme is a very valuable tool in combating paedophilia.
The DAPHNE programme also specifically refers to paedophilia.
The Commission will continue to support projects in this field through the new AGIS programme for law enforcement and judicial cooperation.
Turning to the final part of the question, the Commission can confirm that it has comparative information on the legislative and judicial means to combat this tragic phenomenon.
Europol has produced a report on this subject, demonstrating that it is very active in combating child pornography.
Europol has recently been involved in several successful large-scale operations.
The Commission is convinced that once Eurojust is fully operational, it will encourage and improve cooperation between the Member States in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children, by facilitating mutual legal assistance and the implementation of extradition requests.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your explanation.
I am sure all the honourable Members agree that this is a crucial issue, especially as the victims are children; the courts and the authorities do not generally take them seriously and they find it hard to talk about what they have suffered, meaning that few cases ever get to court and children rarely obtain justice.
The problem is being exacerbated by enlargement, not just because borders are opening up and facilitating crime, but because poverty, which is proving hard to combat in the candidate countries, also lies at the root of the problem.
Do you have any specific plans to involve candidate countries in programmes to combat and cooperate on this problem and care for the victims?
I share your view that we need to give priority to actions of this kind as far as candidate countries are concerned.
I guarantee that the commitment of candidate countries has already been taken into consideration in the latest generation of Daphne and STOP programmes, and they are already being involved in concrete action.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the framework decision just adopted by the Council will be part of the acquis.
That means that candidate countries will have to incorporate this new framework decision into their own national criminal law by1 January 2004.
The Commissioner will be interested to know that I had the honour of chairing a meeting last week on the issue of child pornography, organised by the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.
We had an excellent presentation from the officer from Europol, Mr Morgan, and I also had the pleasure of announcing the agreement that I think had just been published in the papers that day.
But I would like to ask how you think extradition requests will work when, for instance, material originates in third countries, where perhaps the same kind of basic legislation does not exist?
Secondly, what should be our approach to this kind of material arriving from outside the Community?
This is clearly going to be the route taken in future to circumvent legislation both here and in the United States.
There are specific provisions in these proposals to deal with the problem of paedophilia on line on the Internet.
We need to guarantee that judicial cooperation, above all mutual legal assistance with third countries, takes into consideration the need to consolidate the evidence needed for adequate criminal prosecution.
We can only seize the material at the last station in the territory of the Member States.
For instance, in the case of material that comes from third countries, we need to use the common cooperation agreements on mutual legal assistance to request the authorities of those Member States to act against those who produce such material.
I would like to add also that, in this general framework, we must make the best possible use of the Council of Europe convention on cybercrime throughout the Internet.
It is quite clear that producing illicit material concerning paedophile pornography is a criminal activity.
Therefore, the Council of Europe convention would be fully applicable.
Question No 44 by Ioannis Marinos (H-0664/02):
Subject: Designation of terrorists as 'political prisoners'
Following the recent arrest of terrorists in Greece, most of those arrested have admitted belonging to the terrorist organisation 'November 17'.
However, over the last few days the Greek press has reported - on the basis of information from the above persons or their lawyers - that 'some of them intend to alter their confessions with the aim of securing their release in 10-12 years' time'and have invoked the status of 'political prisoner' on the basis of 'similar instances in other European countries', as press publications and TV analyses have reported.
Is the Commission aware of the existence of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union, given that after the recent changes in Community legislation terrorists face tougher treatment, even if it is assumed that the murders and robberies they commit are inspired by 'noble' ideological motives?
The European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.
They have been recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Commission is therefore unaware of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union, since the mere notion of political prisoners, that is, people who have been in prison or prosecuted only for political reasons or opinions, would be against those founding principles of the Union.
As regards extradition between Member States, therefore, mutual confidence in the national judicial systems has resulted in revision of the political offence derogation in relation to terrorist crimes.
Article 5(1) of the 1996 Convention relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union, which supplements the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957 thus states: 'For the purposes of applying this Convention, no offence may be regarded by the requested Member State as a political offence, as an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives.'
This statement covers the terrorist offences referred to in the first and second articles of the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, to which all Member States of the Union are party.
The Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant, which will soon replace the previous extradition system, includes terrorism among the offences that will give rise to surrender, pursuant to a European arrest warrant, provided the offence is punishable in the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence or detention order for a maximum period of at least three years.
The political nature of the offence cannot be put forward as grounds for non-execution.
Finally, the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism establishes a common definition of terrorist offences.
It lists serious crimes deemed to be terrorist offences, when committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population and unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act, or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation.
In this definition, reference to ideological motives is therefore irrelevant, both for defining a terrorist offence or avoiding considering it as such.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I shall inform my honourable friend, who is unable to be here today to discuss this with you, that there can be no remission of sin for any crime committed, as he points out, on the grounds of ideological motive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fighting terrorism is surely the most important objective in the world today.
That is why I would be interested to know what initiatives the Commission plans to take on judicial matters in the light of the most recent developments.
First of all, I think that we need to pursue our important achievements since 11 September 2001, mainly the transposition into the national legal systems of the framework decision on the definition of terrorism, and the transposition into national law of the framework decision concerning the European arrest warrant.
Secondly, I would like to emphasise the role of police cooperation and the exchange of information between intelligence services on terrorist activities, based in particular on Europol's anti-terrorist unit and the special team of anti-terrorist magistrates in Eurojust.
New initiatives relate, in particular, to ongoing negotiations with the United States on a mutual legal assistance agreement, including extradition, and the conclusion of the agreement on exchanges of information between Europol and the law enforcement agencies of the United States.
Finally, as regards legislative initiatives for the year 2003, we are giving priority to the financing of terrorism, but it is still a little too soon to disclose the concrete initiatives that we will be putting forward to Parliament and Council next year.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We will take each question in order until 7.30 p.m.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 45 by Richard Corbett (H-0613/02):
Subject: Livestock markets
In the light of increasing public concerns about the treatment of animals at livestock markets and at slaughter houses, is the Commission now willing to consider proposing a Directive laying down minimum standards for the protection of animals at such markets?
As rightly pointed out by the honourable Member, there are increasing concerns about the treatment of animals at livestock markets.
It is the Commission's intention to cover this area when proposing new legislation on the protection of animals during transport before the end of this year.
Practical experience and scientific knowledge are today available to help the Commission in doing this.
In particular, the Commission's objective is to ensure that Member States ensure that animal welfare considerations are an integral part of the operation of livestock markets.
Acts of cruelty or negligence observed in some markets are the result of operators' ignorance and insufficient supervision by the competent authorities.
Therefore, the Commission believes that it is necessary to increase the training of personnel handling animals at markets.
The Commission also considers that market operators should be primarily responsible for securing respect of welfare rules.
They should be accountable for welfare rules as they already are for animal health rules.
However, it should be remembered that day-to-day enforcement is the responsibility of the Member States.
Substantial improvements can already be achieved under the current national provisions.
It is not the role of the Commission to supervise livestock market operations but to ensure that Member States respect the EU provisions in this regard.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for that answer and to encourage him, when preparing that draft legislation, to examine whether or not there is a case for phasing out livestock markets entirely.
I believe that in certain countries they have virtually ceased to exist.
After all, it is not just a question of animal welfare, it is also a question of the spread of disease.
Perhaps in the modern age such markets are no longer the best way of dealing with the trade in animals.
If the Commission concludes that they must remain, then they should be properly regulated.
I welcome what the Commissioner has just said, but does he agree that it should apply not just to the transport of animals that fall to some degree under the existing directive but to the protection of all animals that pass through such livestock markets?
Concerning the first part of your supplementary question as to whether it might be appropriate to phase out the livestock markets altogether, the position is that for some farm species this is a necessary marketing tool.
There are long traditions in relation to the sale and marketing of animals in this way.
Their use derives from historic and socio-economic reasons that cannot be ignored by a simple ban.
However, I agree that in addressing this issue in the context of Community legislation, we are looking at it in connection with the animal transport legislation we are working on at the moment.
I fully agree that this issue is not just relevant to animals under transport, but to all animals.
Nonetheless, it is in the context of that legislation that we are looking at the issue.
As I indicated a moment ago, it is important to ensure that there is proper training of staff who handle animals, not only in the context of transport but generally.
This is one of the objectives that will be contained in the legislation currently being drafted.
Question No 46 by Philip Bushill-Matthews (H-0633/02):
Subject: Food safety
Would the Commission reveal what immediate action it proposes to take, and how such action will be effective, in dealing with recurrent problems of the non-removal of spinal cord in meat processed by abattoirs in Germany and France?
The Commission attaches great importance to the correct removal of specified risk material, since it is one of the most important ways of protecting the health of consumers against the related risk of BSE.
In addition to being an unacceptable threat to health, these incidents also serve to undermine consumer confidence in the effectiveness of the Community measures relating to BSE.
According to Regulation 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain BSEs, specified risk material must be removed at the slaughterhouse or, in case of the vertebral column of bovine animals, at the cutting plant.
Carcasses, half-carcasses and quarter-carcasses containing no specified risk material other than the vertebral column may be dispatched to another Member State.
In the latter case, the removal of the vertebral column should take place at the cutting plant in the Member State of destination.
Shortcomings in the proper implementation of the removal of specified risk material, in particular spinal cord, have been reported in carcasses produced in different Member States: Germany, Spain, France, the UK, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Italy.
The Commission has on several occasions reminded the Member States of the importance of properly implementing the removal of specified risk material.
In the case of recurrence, the Commission has requested strong action, such as suspending the licences of the plants responsible or introducing corrective measures.
The Commission has requested that it be informed of the corrective measures taken.
In subsequent inspections carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office on BSE and BSE-related matters in the Member States, the removal of SRMs has been found to be reasonably satisfactory, with minor deficiencies relating mainly to technical and operational difficulties.
The Commission is also funding a research project to find alternative and more effective ways to remove the spinal cord.
This project is nearly finished.
The Commission is closely following the situation and will, if necessary, remind all the Member States of the obligation to remove the spinal cord of bovine animals aged over 12 months.
Implementation of the corrective measures notified by the Member States to remedy the situation will be further assessed by the Food and Veterinary Office.
Finally, it should be borne in mind that the vertebral column is currently defined as specified risk material in carcasses from bovine animals aged over 12 months in all Member States except Portugal and the United Kingdom.
Any remnants of spinal cord in the vertebral column should therefore already have been automatically removed as specified risk material at the place of destination before sale to the consumer.
I note your remarks with interest, Commissioner, and am delighted to hear that the Commission takes this issue seriously, but your role as I see it seems to be confined to reminding Member States, requesting strong action and then requesting to be informed.
With respect, do you feel that is satisfactory or do you feel that the public will find that satisfactory, because these are problems that are recurring?
Since I tabled this question, literally in the last couple of weeks, we have had an example in the UK of Germany once again breaking the rules by sending no less than its 13th consignment of meat containing banned spinal cord to the UK.
Has the Commission no powers to do anything more than request or remind?
If it does not, should it not have such powers?
How much longer will it go on requesting and reminding before some action is taken by somebody?
This issue has been closely monitored and, based on the preliminary results in 2002, the actions taken by the Member States have resulted in a decrease in the number of infractions concerning remnants of spinal cord.
Of course, the Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely, and if the problems recur, will place the matter on the agenda of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health to emphasise the importance of the proper removal of specified waste material, in other words, spinal cord, at slaughterhouse level, and to require strong corrective actions.
I have spoken directly to the competent ministers in a number of Member States about this, with the result that licences for slaughter plants have been suspended in two particular Member States for a period of time.
These are strong sanctions which can be requested by the Commission and which have been implemented.
To that extent, I believe that the strength of such sanctions, when imposed on food processors, is that they tend to improve standards.
Ultimately, there is always the option of bringing infringement proceedings, but in these circumstances, given the passage of time necessary to get such proceedings into court, it does not seem to me to be the most effective method of seeking compliance.
Finally, as you probably are aware, I am currently working on a piece of legislation on feed and food controls, which envisages imposing financial sanctions for failure to comply with this kind of legislation.
That will hopefully be brought to the Commission in the very near future and, if adopted, will be made public and come to Parliament in due course for further discussion.
Question No 47 by Mary Elizabeth Banotti (H-0639/02):
Subject: Diabetes
It is estimated that by 2010 there will be thirty million people in the EU with diabetes.
What is the Commission doing to address this catastrophic rise in diabetes and is the Commission proposing any research action or information campaigns to address this issue?
The Commission recognises that diabetes is a chronic disease that poses a major public health challenge to the Community.
Its causes are closely linked to the health determinants of diet, obesity and physical activity.
These determinants are clearly linked, and a separate approach to each is not likely to be successful.
The Treaty limits the competence of the Community in the field of public health by stating that Community action must fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.
As regards diabetes, the work of the Commission has therefore concentrated on encouraging cooperation between Member States through public health programmes.
Through these programmes the Commission has encouraged policy development and measures related to the determinants of type 2 diabetes, namely nutrition, obesity and exercise.
In the new public health programme entering into force on 1 January 2003, attention is given to improving data collection on key health indicators such as nutrition-related mortality and morbidity.
Emphasis is also placed on developing common strategies on health determinants such as nutrition.
The existing health promotion, health monitoring and cancer programmes have provided concrete support to a variety of initiatives on diet, nutrition, obesity and physical activity.
For example, the support given to conferences such as those held under the French and Danish Council presidencies on the issues of nutrition and obesity.
The Eurodiet report on nutrition is now published and available on the Commission website, making it available to a wide international audience.
The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), financed by the cancer programme and carried out by the International Agency for Cancer Research in Lyon, is another major initiative on the links between diet and disease.
The project, supported by the health promotion programme sli na slÃ¡inte, is an initiative to promote physical activity as part of a prevention strategy.
All of these activities will have had an impact on the prevention of diabetes.
A status report on the place of nutrition in all Commission policy areas, not only public health, will shortly be finalised and published.
Taking account of the limits set out in Article 152 of the Treaty, the Commission does not intend to set up a specific priority plan related to diabetes.
Instead, the approach followed by the new public health programme is designed to ensure a complementary and horizontal approach to prevention, rather than the old approach of looking at diseases by means of separate and individual programmes.
The new programme is policy-driven and aims to promote policy and activities on health determinants that will have an impact on key challenges such as type 2 diabetes.
Through its framework research programmes the Commission has supported diabetes research in the past.
Significant financial support has been made available for this type of research.
In the Fifth Framework Programme, diabetes research was covered under the quality of life and management of living resources programme.
The total funding has been more than EUR 18 million.
Diabetes research continues to be a priority in the upcoming Sixth Framework Programme under the first priority thematic area 'Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health'.
Research funds will be distributed on a competitive basis following calls for proposals, and information will be made widely available, for example on the research website.
In addition to support for research projects, the Sixth Framework Programme will provide funds for fellowships as well as for networking of national diabetes research activities under the chapter 'Strengthening the foundations of the European research area'.
That aspect is considered particularly important in order to contribute to the creation of a European research area.
Finally, it should also be mentioned that foods presented as designed to satisfy the particular nutritional requirements of people with diabetes should currently comply with the requirements of Council Directive 89/398 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses.
The Commission intends to present a report to Parliament and the Council on the desirability of special nutritional provisions for people with diabetes.
May I take this opportunity to wish every success to World Diabetes Day on 14 November.
I hope to be able to join with those who are promoting this when the diabetes testing and awareness campaign is launched here in Strasbourg on 19 November.
Commissioner, that was a very long, quite technical answer.
I would like to raise a couple of issues with you.
Firstly, all the best thinking on diabetes is that special food should not be targeted at diabetics.
The best diet for people with diabetes or those at risk of developing diabetes is good, plain, fresh food, not processed foods.
It was only with great difficulty that diabetes was mentioned in the Sixth Framework Programme.
I hope that when you are considering it, the provision of a chair for diabetes nurses in one of the Community universities will be one of the priorities for support.
The cost to the health services within the Community of a condition which, as I mentioned in my question, will affect approximately 30 million people by the year 2010, has to some extent to be taken into consideration.
In the light of what is coming down the line, I would be interested to know whether the Commission proposes to take a more proactive approach to this.
It is certainly true that the costs related to any health care are increasing day by day and year by year in the Member States.
The fact of the matter is that public health professionals and, indeed, some governments are now giving more attention to investing more in health promotion and disease prevention.
The emphasis in the past has all too often been on spending large sums of money on health care.
If this change takes place, as your question implies, that will greatly affect the issue of diabetes, on which you focus particularly in in your question, but also other diseases.
I firmly believe that, when the public health programme is up and running under the three-stranded approach from January 2003, valuable information and data will be gathered under the first strand.
Then, under the strand of health determinants, we will be able to promote the healthy lifestyle and balanced food intake that you mentioned in your supplementary question.
I am looking into the correlation between, for instance, diseases like obesity and food, and I hope to report the results between now and the end of the year.
As the parent of a diabetic daughter, can I support the honourable Member in her plea for Commission action and particularly congratulate her on the initiative that she and Mr Bovis are taking to bring this to the attention of Parliament.
Because of the rise in the number of sufferers from this disease, there is often conflicting advice about the various treatments.
Yet we hear almost daily of new research developments, both palliative and surgical.
Does the Commissioner not agree with me that we need to to be able to offer the citizens of the European Union clear guidance about the progress of research?
The Commission and the European Union could play a significant part in ensuring that the rise of this disease is matched only by the information about how to treat it and how to avoid it in the first place?
Once again, I refer you to the first strand of the public health programme that will be in operation from 1 January 2003.
The information that will be gathered and the data that will be made available will assist considerably in coming up with solutions and in the dissemination of valuable information, not only in the Commission and the other institutions of the European Union but also, obviously, in the Member States.
In addition to what I said earlier about the various programmes and the work and investment that has been undertaken already in this area, I forgot to mention that a project, supported by the health promotion programme, to create a masters degree course in nutrition is on the way.
That answers the earlier question by Mrs Banotti which I forgot to reply to.
Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease.
My personal view is that the best results would be achieved by applying the principle of subsidiarity when it comes to changing people's eating habits and increasing the amount of physical activity, which are the two fundamental issues.
The EU, on the other hand, should be able to operate on a broader front by helping to implement the major population studies needed for the future, so that we can tackle the issue in a more constructive way.
Long-term studies of population groups in various European countries should be something which the EU could contribute in order to achieve good results.
I can only refer to the answer to the earlier questions, that a great deal of work has already been undertaken on this and much more is in the pipeline.
I mentioned earlier the work that I am currently undertaking on the connection between nutrition and, for instance, obesity and the question of good health generally.
I think that the major leap forward will take place when the public health programme is up and running.
I have high hopes for that programme.
There are high expectations in Member States, and I also believe that there is a substantial degree of support from Member States' health ministers.
I would just like to tell the Commissioner that I was not referring to a masters degree in nutrition.
I was referring to the chair for specialist nurses in diabetes, for which there is an application before the Commission.
I just want to clarify that.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
Question No 48 by Marit Paulsen (H-0660/02):
Subject: Salmonella and meat preparations
On 12 November 2001, the Swedish requirement that meat preparations imported from other Member States must undergo compulsory testing by the Swedish authorities was abandoned after the Commission had pointed out to the Swedish Food Administration that meat preparations - such as marinated chicken - were not covered by the salmonella guarantees that Sweden had negotiated on accession to the EU.
During 2002, the Swedish Food Administration and five municipalities in Sweden are investigating the presence of salmonella in meat preparations imported from other Member States.
The results so far show that approximately one third of the sampled batches have tested positive for salmonella.
Is it really the Commission's intention to exacerbate the situation in regard to the spread of salmonella within those areas of the EU which are relatively uncontaminated, at the same time as working on a regulation to achieve a uniform situation with regard to salmonella throughout the Union?
Question No 49 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0669/02):
Subject: Salmonella in marinated meat
In conjunction with five Swedish municipalities, the Swedish National Food Administration has taken some 40 samples of imported meat preparations, approximately one third of which tested positive for salmonella.
Chicken products were the worst offenders.
In November 2001, the Commission decided that the rule concerning compulsory salmonella testing does not apply to meat preparations.
However, when meat preparations are imported from a country outside the EU, the Swedish guarantee applies.
The tests conducted in Sweden show that meat preparations must be subject to compulsory salmonella testing if the salmonella guarantee is to be effective in that country.
What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that meat preparations are subject, as soon as possible, to compulsory salmonella testing before being exported to Sweden?
I am concerned about the frequent incidence of salmonella in meat preparations imported into Sweden and about your worry that this could affect the salmonella status of Sweden.
As you are aware, Finland and Sweden were granted additional salmonella guarantees in the context of their accession to the European Union.
These additional guarantees cover the trade of certain live animals, eggs, fresh fish and mincemeat to Finland and Sweden.
You propose that the Commission should extend the additional salmonella guarantees to meat preparations.
The only way to do so would be to amend the Community legislation on meat preparations.
However, the directive on mincemeat and meat preparations already lays down a salmonella criterion for meat preparations.
Any meat preparation produced within the Community must meet that criterion.
It is good that the Commissioner is concerned over the high incidence of salmonella in meat preparations imported into Sweden.
We now know that there was an oversight in our accession negotiations.
What we are now discussing is not related to heat-treated products.
We know that salmonella disappears in such products and only new contamination will reintroduce salmonella into them.
In this case, it is about the fact that anyone can put a chicken in a bag with a few grams of salt and claim that it is a preparation.
That is the main problem.
It is slightly absurd that I am Parliament's rapporteur in the case of a directive aimed at creating salmonella controls across the whole of the EU which look very much like the Scandinavian controls.
As such, it is a little odd that a quick decision cannot be taken on having a salmonella guarantee for preparations which are not heat treated.
If we are to achieve salmonella control across the whole of Europe, we need salmonella-free areas, wherever they may be, to be able to protect themselves while others catch up.
The extension of the additional salmonella guarantees to cover mincemeat was not proposed by the Commission.
The reason why the additional guarantees should not cover meat preparations, the existence of the salmonella criterion, applies also to mincemeat.
However, it has to be noted that it is probably easier to control salmonella in meat preparations than in mincemeat.
Therefore the salmonella criteria are more effective for meat preparations than for mincemeat and this can be used to justify the application of additional guarantees to mincemeat and not to meat preparations.
I am sure that Mrs Paulsen is aware of the legislation that is going through the Council at the moment which was discussed at the last meeting of the Agriculture Council.
It ran into the buffers to some extent and now has been put back for discussion at the next Agriculture Council.
This issue will be discussed on that occasion.
Meat preparations in general are being looked at, but not just for Sweden and Finland.
We want to improve standards for the EU as a whole and that is reflected in this legislation, which I hope will get through the Agriculture Council in December.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for the responses we have received so far.
As you are no doubt aware, Sweden has put many years' work and a great deal of money into trying to eradicate salmonella.
The fact is that this work is now under threat as we are importing salmonella from other EU countries under the current system.
As the Commissioner has quite rightly pointed out, there are rules for the meat preparations in question.
The problem is that these rules are clearly not being followed, with as much as one third of the products checked actually carrying salmonella.
In this case, is it not reasonable to request that, as long as the EU is not managing to ensure that the rules are followed, Sweden should be allowed to apply the same type of salmonella control to meat preparations as is applied to many other types of product in order to prevent the spread of this infection?
As I said earlier, the Commission is well aware of the dangers of salmonella.
In fact, approximately 200 people a year die in the European Union from contracting the disease of salmonella.
In this context, it is my intention to propose improved sampling rules and a stricter limit for salmonella in meat preparations.
This should contribute to decreasing the salmonella contamination in meat preparations throughout the whole Community.
In addition, the ongoing revisions of Community legislation on food hygiene and, as I said earlier, on zoonosis, will strengthen the controls on salmonella along the whole food chain, from farm to table.
This will obviously have a positive impact on the situation as regards salmonella in foodstuffs throughout the entire European Union and not just in individual Member States.
Question No 50 by Joachim Wuermeling (H-0673/02):
Subject: Export ban on cigarettes - WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
Last year the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2001/37/EC
The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is at the moment holding its fifth meeting in Geneva.
Concerning the regulation of contents of tobacco products, the text released by the chair for further discussion does not set harmonised standards but provides for each party to adopt and implement standards as recommended by the Conference of the Parties, including standards and best practices for testing and measuring the content and emissions of such products.
The final text of the Convention is expected to be ready in March 2003.
Should this provision become a part of the final text of the Framework Convention, and considering the timetable foreseen for the establishment of the Conference of the Parties, it is indeed possible that such recommendations could be produced by 2007.
The Commission believes that the adoption of common standards for the regulation of the content of tobacco products and emissions and the adoption of common rules for measurement methods are essential measures to be taken by all parties to the Convention.
Recommendations made by the Conference of the Parties can be a very important instrument for harmonising standards, and parties should therefore be called upon to duly consider them.
However, as such harmonisation could lead to a lowering of the level of public health protection, the Community's position is that such recommendations should not be binding.
That is to say, their adoption should be left to the discretion of the parties.
This would allow parties, such as the Community, to keep their already existing strong legislation in this field.
In this context, I would like to draw to Mr Wuermeling's attention the fact that, according to the negotiating directives provided by the Council, the negotiations must aim to base the operative provisions of the Framework Convention on existing Community legislation.
Finally, concerning the very last part of Mr Wuermeling's question, the Commission firmly believes that the negotiations on the Framework Convention will be successful and is doing its utmost to ensure that an efficient instrument with the maximum impact on tobacco consumption will be agreed upon.
However, in the extremely unlikely event that the negotiations should fail, the Commission would not see this as a reason to propose modifying the provisions of Directive 2001/37 on exports.
Mr President, I should like firstly to thank you very much for the information and to present Mr WÃŒrmeling's apologies, as he had to leave for Berlin at very short notice to attend an important meeting.
I should then like to add two short questions, which the Commissioner may be able to answer briefly together.
Might it not be the case that the Commission's negotiating position would possibly be improved if it reserved the right in the negotiations to amend the directive in respect of the export ban if necessary, because it could then exert pressure on the other countries to go along with such a recommendation?
Secondly, if the negotiations fail do you expect production to shift significantly from the European Union to third countries?
Does the Commission know, or does it have any estimates of, how many jobs might be lost in the European Union as a result?
The negotiating position of the Commission is that we want to achieve the best possible outcome for public health.
That is the overriding consideration.
It will be the motivation for me and my staff in negotiating on behalf of the EU, where the issue is within Community competence.
The question whether production will shift to third countries is often raised.
In other words, are jobs going to be affected by this?
I have two answers to that question.
First of all, public health cannot take second place to job considerations.
That is fundamental as far as I am concerned.
I have already said that on a number of occasions.
Even if there were concern about jobs, some work was undertaken on this when the legislation we now have before Parliament was being considered.
There was certainly some evidence available to us in those Member States that introduced, for instance, strict legislation banning the advertising of tobacco products.
Unemployment did not increase as a result.
There was a shift in other directions.
Therefore, I have never seen any convincing evidence that introducing legislation of this type would have adverse effects on employment.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
As the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 51 to 108 will be replied to in writing.
On behalf of myself and the Members of the European Parliament, it is a great pleasure to welcome you, Mr President, to our House today.
It is an especially great pleasure for me, as an Irish European, in a week when the people have spoken and told the leaders of the fifteen states of the Union that the time for enlargement has come.
Tomorrow you will be back in Hungary to commemorate and celebrate your nation's national day, and to recall the brave Hungarian uprising of 1956 and the proclamation of the republic in 1989.
On the floor of our House today stands a very special symbol of that moment - the Hungarian flag raised during that period in 1956.
(Applause)
The martyrs of that 1956 revolution in a way died for Europe and for the values that today, through the enlargement of the European Union, we are now anticipating and creating.
And so those people did not die in vain, Mr President, and your being here today is a mark of their contribution to Europe.
The values they died for are the values that now unite us across our continent.
Mr President, I have no doubt that your country will be one of our new Member States in 2004.
This Parliament was the first of the European institutions to set a clear timetable for enlargement.
We want Hungary in the Union and we want your representatives in our Parliament, directly elected by the people of Hungary, for the session starting in the summer of 2004.
(Applause)
What we are now poised to achieve is the direct result of the events of 1989 in which Hungary, once again, played a decisive role.
It was Hungary that first agreed to open the iron curtain for people from the former German Democratic Republic waiting in the German Embassy in Budapest for passage to West Germany.
One of my own treasured possessions at home in Ireland is a piece of wire cut in August that year on the Hungarian/Austrian border.
It symbolises for me the night that Europe has lived through.
Enlargement symbolises for me the day ahead of us.
Mr President, I want you to feel at home here.
I want you, as the President of your republic, to understand that in being here today on the eve of your national day you are coming home.
For the first time on our continent we are creating something powerful and new, through the free will of free and sovereign peoples and on the basis of shared values, not this time at the point of a sword, or at the barrel of a gun.
As a young man you studied in Strasbourg; it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the European Parliament, to ask a man who studied at a student's desk now to speak at a rostrum before the largest directly elected transnational parliament in the world and to share with us our common sense of the Europe in the making.
(Applause)
Mr President, first of all I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the European Parliament for commemorating the Hungarian revolution of 1956.
I stand here to address you for the first time at the Plenary in Hungarian.
Hopefully, it will very soon be one of the official languages of the European Union.
With your permission, however, I would anticipate this possibility now and will continue my address in Hungarian.
You will have the opportunity to listen to it in English, hopefully with a good interpretation
The next item is the report (A5-0329/2002) by Mr Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on an Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the Council concerning access by the European Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy and on amendments to the Rules of Procedure [2002/2130(ACI)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, should it be adopted, will take us into uncharted territory.
Why uncharted territory?
Because it will give us the opportunity, on the basis of an interinstitutional agreement with the Council, to examine secret military documents and be party to certain information and will therefore enable us to develop a means of extending parliamentary scrutiny to these areas.
This has been under negotiation for years and I should like in particular to thank the Swedish Presidency, now a distant memory, and the Spanish Presidency for their help, which has made it possible for us to negotiate here today.
Of course this paper is not perfect.
We are entering new territory here and that is why learning is also the order of the day.
We must not, however, go too far at the outset, because this is a very sensitive area and at stake are the security interests of the Member States of the European Union and all of our fellow citizens.
That is why everyone, both the Council and Parliament, first needs to learn how to work together and to build confidence, so that the necessary information and control processes can then be set in motion on this basis.
That is why we have also made it clear that either of the two sides can terminate the agreement after two years, so as to draft a new agreement on the basis of the experience acquired, and that this is therefore not a permanent arrangement but just a first step on this sensitive issue of internal security.
It has also been explicitly stated that this agreement in the field of foreign, security and defence policy is without prejudice to future agreements on the transparency of internal documents for internal policies.
As has been said, agreements also need to be reached in these areas.
I will make it quite clear that in my opinion it is quite conceivable, if not a necessity, that measures will be adopted in internal policy areas, where there are particular sensitivities due to the possible participation of third countries, and that these might go very much further even at the first attempt than is the case in this document.
I believe that we have achieved something here that certainly bears comparison with the standards in national parliaments and that the security standards, which we ourselves need to develop in this House, will also certainly have their part to play in enabling us to meet the requirements, just as the five Members of the special committee will have to undergo security checks by their respective Member States.
As you can see, there are no separate rules here either; the situation is comparable to that of national Members of Parliament.
On this basis we can find solutions that will help us to make further progress.
I should like to ask you to support both of these papers on amending the Rules of Procedure and on the agreement itself.
I would also ask you to reject one of the amendments, because it concerns the extreme case of criminal offences being committed, by whichever side.
This is something that could arise whenever the handling of public funds and public documents is involved.
It is regulated elsewhere - not in the Rules of Procedure - and does not need to be regulated here.
It is far more appropriate here to proceed in accordance with the traditional principle that action will be taken against anyone committing a criminal offence.
Ultimately, of course, we rely on the consciences of those who know of any such criminal offences to speak out, so that action can be taken against their perpetrators.
I think that this marks a step towards greater transparency and control of our foreign, security and defence policy, and if someone had said five or ten years ago that we would be negotiating the establishment of a committee of this kind in the European Parliament, I would not have thought it possible.
This shows how far the European Union as a whole has come since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Cologne Summit on security and defence policy.
However, it also shows a commensurate need for parliamentary scrutiny.
That is why I would urge the House to support this initiative.
Mr President of the European Parliament ... no, EB of the EB, Mr President of the European Parliament ... no, EB, EB.
What is all this about?
You can either present and justify all of this as being in the interests of the State, just as Elmar Brok, whom I personally hold in high esteem both here and in other professional contexts, has done, or you can comment a little on the procedure and how this agreement has come about and consider why someone behind me always says, 'EB, EB' when I say, 'EP'.
We certainly need to be a little wary here.
I welcome the fact that this agreement will give Parliament a bit more power and that there is also going to be the opportunity to examine certain documents.
I do not wish to run the risk of the little man behind me, who always says 'EB, EB', being proved right by people confusing the European Parliament, 'EP', with EB, 'Elmar Brok'.
Why am I saying this, and why, strange as it may seem, are they seen as one and the same thing?
Because I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the way in which this has been negotiated is not exactly exemplary, and that the fact is that, in the final analysis, we are faced with a take it or leave it situation.
Many Members hardly had the chance to be involved in the negotiating process and above all it is now once again EB who has access to internal documents and, as he himself also said, he is pleased that only Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are involved while the EP, the European Parliament, is left out in the cold.
We can, indeed we must, live with these objections, because obviously this can be seen as a foot in the door, but as I see it - and I am not the only one - the report does contain some reassurance. It says in the explanatory statement: 'It is ... crucial that the Agreement includes a provision that it will be reviewed after two years at the request of either of the two institutions in the light of the experience acquired in implementing it.'
I very much hope that those who are involved now, that is the two EBs and their friends, will not act in such a way that the agreement is unilaterally terminated by the Council or whoever it may be, so that the EP then has an opportunity to have more of a say when the text is redrafted and actually to become what someone previously called a fully-fledged parliament. Each of the individual committees should be able to have their say and fair account should be taken of the very diverse views represented in this House, so that this clash is avoided, and also so that we prove that what was mentioned earlier is true; that we are in agreement here that there can be no democracy without transparency, and that includes within this House.
Mr President, when, during the Swedish Presidency one and a half years ago, difficult negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission resulted in agreement on Article 255, or Regulation 1049, this was a major step forward.
Common legislation on the rules for citizens' access to documents was an important step towards increasing scrutiny of, and confidence in, the European institutions.
Transparency is the basis of a democracy and the precondition for citizens' being able to follow and participate in public decisions.
We can therefore increase confidence in, and the legitimacy of, EU cooperation as a whole, two things that we unfortunately know are both in short supply.
We liberals always push for maximum transparency.
We were not entirely satisfied with a number of sections of the legislation, and we believe that there was an exaggerated fear of releasing documents.
When it comes to the Common Security and Foreign Policy, this is an area in the course of development.
There is major interest in these issues among citizens and journalists.
Naturally, certain documents cannot be made public.
Such documents must be kept confidential. We also realise this.
Having a small group of members who have access to these highly sensitive documents is, however, one way of ensuring a certain degree of, admittedly limited, parliamentary control in this area, which thus puts pressure on the Council.
In this way, Mr Brok's proposal is a wholly reasonable agreement.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party believes, however, that it is necessary to make sure that it does not become too common for documents to be automatically referred to this small committee.
Most documents should, of course, be made available to everyone else, the general public, journalists and every other interested party.
There should be a few absolutely vital and sensitive documents which are made available to this smaller circle.
I was pleased that Mr Brok said that we should have a careful evaluation of this agreement.
We could have this in conjunction with a general review of the transparency regulations.
In this way, we will hopefully come to realise that transparency as a principle is not dangerous.
Mr President, on very solemn occasions, those of us in Parliament and in the other institutions of the EU talk about how we should go about bringing the EU closer to the people.
One of the ways of doing this would be to give people an opportunity to participate, play their parts and be partners in the whole of the decision-making process taking place in and between the institutions of the EU.
The prerequisite of people's being able to take on that role is that they be able to obtain a feeling for what goes on before the decisions are taken.
That is why the principle of access to documents is so important.
As my fellow MEP, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, said, we are all of us aware of there being confidential documents that are difficult to make available.
The European Parliament has, in my view, embarked upon a slippery slope, however.
We find ourselves in a position which we should not have occupied.
As the people's guarantors, as the custodians of democracy and as the institution that should be the democratic guarantor of this project, we have now moved into an area in which we consent to people's not being given access to documents, with only ourselves or a small group of us having such access.
In this way, we are complicit in considering our own interests or, more accurately, those of a small group of MEPs at the expense of the interests of European citizens and their opportunity to be players in the democratic process.
As my other fellow MEP from the Group of the Party of European Socialists put it, the whole process involving public access to, and scrutiny of, documents has taken place behind closed doors.
That is in itself a problem when we specifically talk about transparency and public access to, and scrutiny of, documents.
That is why I do not warm to this document.
Mr President, our rapporteur, Mr Brok, who negotiated this agreement, has already stated that we are in a whole new area here.
He also said that either party could propose that this agreement should be reviewed after two years.
Nevertheless, on behalf of my own group, I should like to draw attention to the weaknesses of the arrangement right from the start.
The agreement refers to the fact that it would be, as it were, inspired by best practices in Member States.
