The future does not lie in the concentration of holdings as the massive grubbing-up plan suggests.
We must build that future by making our wines more competitive, especially abroad.
That is why we think that the first priority for a reform of the common organisation of the market in wine should be to make our wines more attractive through a major plan to promote and market them in the world.
I was glad to hear you say as much just now, Commissioner; we now want to see action.
(EL) Madam President, I should like to warmly congratulate my honourable friend Mrs Batzeli on her excellent work and express my satisfaction, because this report was undertaken by our honourable Member from Greece, which has a history of wine-growing going back centuries.
Wine, as an agricultural product, has always held centre stage in our life, in our customs, in our traditions, in our history, in our joy and in our sadness.
In other words, it is an integral part of our civilisation.
It is therefore a very positive thing that this report reflects to a large degree the views of the Greek wine-growing sector.
At the same time, Mrs Batzeli's report constitutes a clear stand by the European Parliament in light of the new common organisation of the wine market planned by the Commission and sets caution and logic against what are in my view the Commission's hasty and simplified initial thoughts.
I would ask that we vote for the report as it stands.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs for their work.
This is the third reform of the wine sector in 12 years, and I am glad that a Commission Communication has now made it possible to reconcile the very different positions and objectives.
The reason our points of view started out so divergent is that wine is a very emotional subject.
I always say that wine is among the most elegant of agricultural products.
This divergence is also evidenced by the tabling of almost 600 amendments.
In my opinion, a great deal of this report can be seen in a very positive light.
It contains many compromises.
I should like to emphasise in particular that traditional oenological practices really have been taken into account.
It must be made quite clear, however, that there is no option whatsoever for duplicate compensation or support for the regions, as we could not justify that to the European taxpayer.
One problem remains that is of significance to Austria.
Proper account has yet to be taken of the issue of the labelling of table wines.
At all events, we want to see table wines labelled differently from quality wines.
There must be a clear distinction for consumers.
Finally, I would ask the Commissioner to read this own-initiative report carefully.
I am convinced that she and all her staff will do so.
It contains some good proposals, which the Commission will hopefully incorporate into its proposal on the new common organisation of the market in wine that it is due to present to us in the summer.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would just like to touch on some of the major issues that have been raised by many of you in this very important debate.
Grubbing-up was mentioned by almost all of you.
I am not quite sure that you listened carefully to what I said in my introduction, namely that we need to ensure that grubbing-up does not disrupt important and legitimate social and environmental concerns.
Listen carefully, and I will take this into consideration when we make the legal proposals.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said very clearly that grubbing-up should not be forced upon our winegrowers.
Exactly.
It should not be, because the decision on grubbing-up is one for winegrowers and winegrowers alone to take.
It is not a decision for the Member States or for the Commission, but exclusively for the winegrowers.
But we should not force those growers that are today struggling to be successful in winegrowing to remain in a business where they cannot make money year after year.
So let us give them a possibility to leave the sector in a decent way.
On distillation, I have yet to meet anyone willing to tell me, off the record, that crisis distillation could ever make good sense.
On the contrary, I think it gives our citizens an excuse to portray the common agricultural policy in the most negative way, referring to the old-fashioned methods and tools that we used in previous times.
We cannot defend spending half a billion euros every year on getting rid of wine that nobody wants to drink.
This does not work and I hope you will support me on this.
Therefore, we need promotion.
It is something that the European Parliament has stressed over and again and I am prepared to make a push on this.
But promotion at European level must not be a cushion for the wine sector.
The wine sector itself also needs to be much more aggressive.
In Ireland we have seen the consumption of wine increasing.
And today 70% of the wine consumed in Ireland is imported from outside the European Union.
Therefore, I simply did not understand why at the recent World Ploughing Championships in Ireland, which attracted 250 000 visitors, only two wine producers were present, neither of them from Europe.
I can only ask why.
On imported must for vinification, I have said clearly from the beginning that we have to put everything on the table and I have taken note of the reactions from the European Parliament, from different Member States and from stakeholders.
Christa KlaÃ mentioned that there are huge differences within the different regions.
I have been able to see this for myself and therefore I think we have to stress the importance of the idea of national envelopes in the Commission communication.
I think it is an excellent possibility for Member States and for regions to allocate the different tools and the money as part of a national envelope completely tailor-made for the different regions.
I think this is crucial.
Quite a lot of you stressed that we need to base our future in the wine sector on quality, quality and quality, and I can totally endorse that.
I am looking forward to holding discussions with you in the future on the wine reform that I will present to the Council, hopefully just before the summer break, and then I will be happy to come here to the European Parliament to present it at the same time, as the basis for our future discussions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (SK) The EU wine sector produces some of the world's finest wines and has enormous potential which must be further developed in a sustainable manner.
The constant growth of the market in China, which is now beginning to actively produce wine, together with increasing production in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada and South Africa, has resulted in wines from the 'New World' gaining a considerable market share at the expense of European wines.
I agree with the Commission that supply and demand imbalances in the wine sector, and increasing challenges on European and international wine markets point to the need for reform in this sector as well.
However, I completely disagree with some of the solutions proposed in the Commission's communication of 22 June 2006.
The plans for a massive and indiscriminate grubbing-up of vineyards pose a particular threat to the environment, and constitute in my view an unjustified attack on Europe's wine heritage.
Winegrowing, which primarily relies on natural resources, has a positive effect in terms of protecting soil against erosion.
As the driving force of rural development, viniculture also holds out the promise of longed-for prosperity for many European regions.
With their tradition of viticulture, Slovakia's regions have focused on promoting enotourism by tapping the potential of the Lesser Carpathian, KamenÃ­nska, HontianskÃ¡ and Tokaj Wine Routes, and they are now expecting CMO reform in the wine sector to secure the dynamic growth and competitiveness of the European wine sector by allocating adequate financial resources and, above all, through fostering innovation.
I agree with the Commission on the importance of simplifying and harmonising the legislative measures and of making the European wine sector more competitive, at the same time as guaranteeing environmental sustainability.
However, while, on the one hand, the support given to European farmers and the heavyweight agricultural budget need to be reduced gradually in favour of other policies, on the other hand, the EU needs to protect the fundamental sectors of its economy.
The wine sector certainly counts among those, with an output that in 2005 yielded almost EUR 2 million, and which in Italy alone involves more than 2 500 000 businesses.
It must not be totally abandoned to the rules of the free market: free competition could have a harmful effect on the quality and diversity of our production, which is mainly based on the activities of small businesses, which are unable to compete internationally.
I also regret the attempt - which has sadly been carried through - by the countries of northern Europe to alter the conditions of competition within the EU by offering aid to those who use sucrose as a means of increasing the alcohol content of wine, without maintaining aid for the production of must, which is a common practice in Italy and in other Mediterranean countries and which guarantees that our production is of a better quality.
Radio Spectrum (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Hall, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, entitled 'Towards a European policy on the radio spectrum'.
rapporteur. - Madam President, firstly I would like to thank all the people who shared their knowledge and expertise with me when I was preparing this report.
I would particularly like to thank the Commission for its generous help, as well as my colleagues, the shadows from the other groups, for their very constructive and cooperative suggestions.
The basic theme of the report is that the current method of managing radio spectrum is no longer adequate in the face of constantly emerging new technologies.
These new technologies need to make use of radio spectrum, but the quantity of radio spectrum will always be limited simply by the laws of physics, so we have to find ways of making sure that this precious resource is used as efficiently as possible.
Policy on radio spectrum may sound like an obscure matter of no interest to the citizen on the street, but the end result of that policy is of fundamental interest because it is a question of jobs and economic growth.
If we fail to reform our approach to radio spectrum, we are failing European industry, which is poised to become a global leader in communications technology.
All the innovation that the industry is coming forward with will fail to develop properly if no spectrum is available and if the industry is blocked from operating across the European market of 500 million people.
The Lisbon Agenda is the driving force behind the new approach to spectrum.
But there is also the need for Europe to be forward looking in the way it makes services of public and general interest available.
I will come back to that in a minute.
First, I should like to say a few words about the changes proposed.
At present, spectrum is managed on an administrative command and control model whereby certain frequencies are allocated to certain specific uses.
The report argues that this administrative model needs to be supplemented now by a more flexible approach which would include more unlicensed use of spectrum and the tool of spectrum trading.
An essential element of this more flexible approach is that spectrum should be made available without conditions being attached as to the service to be provided or the technology to be used.
In other words, the market-based element of spectrum management would be service- and technology-neutral.
This freeing-up of spectrum would clearly raise issues for existing users, such as the question of potential interference.
It is therefore very important that the changes take place within a clear legal framework and with pre-established dispute resolution mechanisms.
In several places, paragraphs 11, 13 and so on, the report emphasises the importance of maintaining services of public and general interest and supporting cultural and linguistic diversity.
It is important not to get this political commitment mixed up with the technical issue of how such services ought to be delivered.
I believe it would be a big mistake to ring-fence the frequencies currently used by broadcasting services by insisting on their exclusion from any new approach to spectrum management.
That is because we would actually be damaging our ability to support a broad range of socially useful services if we insisted that the delivery mechanism for providing those services remained exactly the same, frozen in time at the very period when all other uses of spectrum are evolving very rapidly.
To take one example, we face the challenge in the EU of stopping a rift opening up between the internet haves and the internet have-nots.
One easy way to roll out internet access to the poorest regions of our poorest countries would be by way of wireless broadband, taking advantage of some of the broadcasting frequencies freed up by the switch from analogue to digital broadcasting, the digital dividend.
I use this as just one example of why we need to affirm our commitment to services of public and general interest, but also as an example of why we must not treat the frequencies currently used by broadcasting as somehow untouchable. We need to make the most of opportunities to provide services in new ways by new technologies and to more people than at present.
And it is vital to support the growth of a knowledge-based economy in Europe.
So, it is important to open up the possibility of more flexible use across the whole of the radio spectrum without ruling out certain frequencies.
Finally, I welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group, which serves as a balanced summary of the key issues at stake.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, I have to compliment the European Parliament, in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Hall, for realising the importance of the choices Europe is about to make with regard to radio spectrum policy.
This is an area where political decisions have a direct impact on the quality of jobs and growth in the European economy.
Services dependent on radio spectrum represent around 2 to 3% of Europe's GDP.
There have been studies for the World Bank and for the OECD which clearly link the development of electronic communication services to economic growth.
An econometric study made for the Commission tentatively associated better spectrum break relation with 0.1% of extra GDP growth per year.
This would quickly cumulate to deliver real benefits.
The urgency of the matter can be summed up in the word 'convergence'.
Practically all communications are quickly becoming digital and there is an increasing number of infrastructures competing to carry services.
The old categories are disappearing and we need to respond with a regulation that permits the spectrum users to choose the mix of services and technologies that they prefer and that in many cases permits them to buy and sell spectrum rights to each other.
The reasons for regulation are still strong.
We have to manage interference.
We need to ensure that the rights to use spectrum are clearly defined and we need to ensure a level playing field.
The report that we are debating tonight is in most aspects in line with this policy vision and I want to thank the rapporteur for her efforts.
One area of divergence concerns including spectrum for terrestrial broadcasting distribution in the planned reforms.
We are not questioning the importance of the television companies' public service function, nor their contribution to cultural and linguistic diversity.
We should, however, think very carefully before we privilege one specific form of broadcasting distribution without regard to the costs to our society in terms of opportunity.
A case in point: the report quite rightly highlights wireless broadband as a tool for rural development and for breaching the digital divide.
This requires tough choices about the balance between broadcasting and other services.
There are necessary decisions to be made to safeguard the resources and functioning of public service broadcasting, but we should not use spectrum policy as a substitute for real debate.
The amendment gives a more balanced approach by mentioning the need to secure stability and security for media services and the importance of a level playing field for new entrants and new technologies.
I have one final point to make: on the basis of the full analysis, the choice of the national regulators is to award spectrum to broadcasters.
These users must also have the same obligation as any other users to be good stewards of a public resource and use it as effectively as possible.
We think that our reform proposal would help to implement this principle.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Technological innovation opens up tangible new opportunities for Europe.
Switching to digital technology leads to a surplus in what has till now been a scarcity in frequencies available.
It is therefore appropriate and necessary to make it possible for a part of that surplus to be used for new technologies, thereby opening up a dynamic territory for the European information and communications industry.
The regulation required for this purpose needs to be created in such a way that the traditional system, unlicensed use and frequency trading be part of an effective spectrum management.
Clear rules are needed, which indicate what and how much we allow in the area of frequency trading.
The opinion of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is that we need very soon to make spectrum trading itself, as well as its guiding conditions, perfectly clear.
In this regard we must handle broadcast frequencies with particular care.
It must be ensured that frequencies cannot be accumulated, and that there be no monopolies.
We have to promote the spread of new technologies to less developed regions and rural areas, but in such a way that they not be made to bear the costs of this.
It is the firm opinion of the Group of the European People's Party that in the process of regulating this area, we need to bear in mind social, cultural and political considerations, in order to advance the expression of cultural and linguistic diversity.
In the process of drafting the report, I mentioned time and again the various specialties of the new Member States, which will have to be taken into account when regulations are drawn up.
I was therefore pleased with Mrs Trautmann's initiative in this matter, and I support it.
Finally, Member States need to open up frequencies for the purpose of Europe-wide technological harmonisation, and this must be done on the basis of a consensual agreement.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Hall, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to express an opinion on the reallocation of radio frequencies.
This is a very important dossier and the Commission's reasons for wanting a proposal that seeks to optimise or maximise the benefits of this resource of course stem from changing technologies, the existence of the digital dividend and the desire, clearly expressed in the Lisbon objectives, to give everyone access to new services, be it the Internet, mobile telephony or many others besides.
We have just spoken of broadband in particular, which could help to reduce the digital divide from which the European Union suffers, especially in rural and thinly populated areas.
We must therefore seek to ensure a rational use of frequencies that will guarantee universal coverage in the 27 countries of the Union with a view to sustainable development of all areas.
Frequencies are in fact a resource, a public good, common to us all and strategic for the Union, and we must ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently in the long term.
Just as we speak of energy efficiency, I believe we can also speak of radio spectrum efficiency.
I would like to welcome the Commission's attempts to give a new European dimension to the use of this digital dividend and avoid a repetition of the very real problem we had, and which the companies concerned saw as such, when the UMTS networks were put up for sale.
It proposes the creation of a market.
We have to be able to find a way of providing greater flexibility, avoiding speculation and monopolies and making frequencies accessible to new services and new entrants.
I believe it is right to want to do so.
We must find new opportunities for innovation there, but we must be careful how they are marketed, whether it be by licences, auctions or assignments, in particular of public or free-access services, even if on a temporary basis.
These different approaches remain to be defined.
In our committee we had a debate on the place of broadcasters and I would like to say here most emphatically that for my part I have always defended the special nature of the information programmes, the cultural programmes provided by broadcasters, especially public broadcasters, who do not have the private capital necessary to pay for access to the market on the same terms as, let us say, ordinary companies.
Therefore, if we are to take account of this situation while being fair and impartial, that is why the Socialist Group has tabled an amendment seeking to take account of radio spectrum efficiency, the balance between respect for public broadcasts and respect for State broadcasts on safety, also the role of regulators and the role of business.
Madam President, I shall be brief.
From the point of view of my group, which welcomes the Commission's approach in principle, there are five important points.
We want to ensure that the new approach proposed by the Commission does not result in the formation of oligopolies.
Germany has had bad experiences with the auctioning of UMTS licences.
Our group wants services ensuring diversity to take priority at all times.
I agree with Mrs Trautmann that broadcasters should always enjoy particular respect for the job they do, for our societies and the public.
We want to see technical neutrality and interoperability.
We want to really see blanket coverage.
This is important to the Commissioner, too, since she bears co-responsibility for rural affairs.
We in rural areas do not want to be disadvantaged any more, and we, too, want access to high-speed Internet connections.
In addition, the procedures for auctions should be fully transparent and comprehensible in future.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, I presume an answer would be expected from the Commission, but I promise I shall keep it short.
I share the appreciation of Parliament regarding the vital role played by public service television and other media for democracy, diversity and for the encouragement for a public debate.
It is necessary that future regulations continue to ensure that this programming can be distributed to the citizens in accordance with the public service obligations assumed by those broadcasters.
However, assuming that these goals can be satisfied and keeping in mind the reality of convergence, we should carefully assess the need for the spectrum required to offer a public broadcasting service and to ensure its efficient use.
In consequence, we need to provide broadcasters with the means and the flexibility to continue to develop their offer to the benefit of our society.
We have listened carefully and your comments will be taken into account during the revision of the telecommunication regulation, which will be proposed by the second half of 2007.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.

Transportation and illegal detention of prisoners (vote)
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, I should just like to inform the services that, due to an inconsistency with the report voted on in committee, points 114, 127 and 128 must be brought into line with the rest of the equivalent paragraphs.
Therefore, if Amendment 228 is adopted, Amendments 234 and 235 must also be adopted.
(FR) I quite understand that the House has decided to vote on the whole package of amendments.
However, can someone explain to me what my group should do, in the case of a collective vote, to endorse some of the amendments and not to endorse others, or even to reject them?
What must we do in that case, Mr President?
Because, in the case in point, we want to endorse some of the amendments and vote against others.
What do you propose, Mr President?
That is why the groups were asked in due course to submit requests for separate votes, which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in particular, did do.
The amendments that caused the most problems and on which the groups wanted to vote more precisely will thus be withdrawn from the collective vote and will be submitted to you a little later on.
If your group has not requested separate votes on certain packages of amendments, that means, in principle, that they do not pose any problems.
I do not want to re-open the debate on this subject.
(Mr Guardans CambÃ³ insisted)
Everyone understood your position, and I hope that I have given you the most neutral technical explanation possible.
You do not have the floor, Mr Guardans CambÃ³; you have already spoken twice.
(Mr Guardans CambÃ³ continued to insist)
If you wish to request an additional separate vote, specify which one, and I will incorporate it.
I would like a separate vote on Amendment 38.
- Before the vote on paragraph 60
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, the oral amendment aims at replacing a singular with a plural: the word 'document', relating to Italian cooperation, would become 'documents', and the rest of the paragraph would agree in the plural.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
(IT) Mr President, I should just like to say that, following the adoption of this oral amendment, our group is withdrawing Amendment 261.
- After the vote on paragraph 66
(FR) Mr President, I believe that it is in everybody's interest for the groups to vote as they have decided to do.
The fact that the amendments of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group have been withdrawn from the voting list is currently causing confusion amongst many Members; they think that they are voting on the Union for Europe of the Nations Group's amendments when in fact the vote relates to the original paragraphs.
I would therefore ask you to carry out an electronic verification of the vote on the original paragraph 66, and I would ask the honourable Members always to check whether the vote relates to the original or to the amendment.
(NL) Mr President, what is making voting more than usually difficult is the fact that my headset is telling me that we are voting on 66, the screen is saying the same thing, and you are saying 68.
We ought, I think, to be hearing the same thing from you as we are told by the screen and over the sound system.
(Voting time was suspended at 12 noon to make way for the formal sitting, and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
Voting time
The next item is voting time.
(For details of the outcome of the votes, see Minutes)
Before starting the vote, I am going to give you some important information in this regard, particularly in relation to the vote on the Fava report.
As you know, the Fava report, which we debated on Monday evening, is a report for which there are many amendments.
I am used to chairing the vote, but I have never seen such a thick dossier for a single report. However, we might be able to speed things up.
This has nothing to do with any foreign power intervening; the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is simply proposing that some collective votes be held in order to enable us to save at least half an hour.
The problem is that this proposal arrived very late in the day and that your voting lists could not be adapted to incorporate it.
Therefore, if you agree to some collective votes being held, you are going to have to pay very close attention to your voting lists.
The layout itself of the list has not changed, we will follow the same order, but we will go a little bit quicker.
I should like to know whether the House agrees with this proposal, which is going to save us some time.
(Applause)
Mr Pirilli, I believe that you are going to present this proposal, on behalf of the UEN Group.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am making this proposal on behalf of my group and under Rule 155(6) of the Rules of Procedure: I propose a block vote on 122 amendments that are complementary to each other, in order to simplify procedure.
In any case, these amendments are workable in relation to those that I propose should be put to the vote individually.
Each of these in fact makes its own main point: from violation of State secrecy, to the security of European citizens and States, to the faked kidnapping of Abu Omar, a CIA spy, who was picked up to save him from certain death and not deported to GuantÃ¡namo, but sent back to his own country, where he lives under suitable protection and gives interviews.
The amendments to be put to the vote separately are therefore the following: 71, 73, 113, 114, 115, 121, 122, 124, 210, 212, 213, 214 and 216.
I also propose individual votes, amendment by amendment, from 38 to 69 and from 245 to 256.
All the other 122 amendments can be put to the vote as a block.
(DE) Mr President, much as I would like to make the vote a shorter business, I do have to point out that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has submitted to the Tabling Office a list of the votes that we want to split, and this list - which has also been endorsed by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group - must be followed in the voting process.
Everything else can be voted on en bloc.
We can agree to things being handled in this way, but, if they are not, we will have to take everything one thing at a time.
I can confirm that the request by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been passed on and that we will in fact hold some collective votes, except for the separate votes that you have requested and that have been incorporated in the announcements that I just made.
Mr Guardans CambÃ³, you have the floor to speak on procedural issues only.
(FR) As regards the procedure, I cannot accept the principle of collective votes on certain amendments without having first received the list in writing and without having a break so that I can study it.
So, I am sorry, but there are blocks in which we want to keep some things and reject others.
Every sentence in this report counts, Mr President.
If we had known about this proposal beforehand, we could have gone ahead with it.
However, we have a list of votes that is calibrated virtually to the last centimetre, and our group is not going to risk an erroneous vote just for the sake of saving five or ten minutes.
I am sorry.
The comment made by our fellow Member is entirely valid.
That is why it is the House that is going to decide.
I am therefore going to give you a first option to vote on: to accept the Union for Europe of the Nations Group's proposal, which would enable us to hold collective votes while keeping the separate votes that were requested by certain groups.
(The House indicated its agreement to the proposal)
I would also point out that we will be taking a break at around midday in order to welcome a prestigious guest, the President of the Italian Republic.
In view of the thickness of the dossier, we will probably break during the vote on the Fava report.
I would ask you right now to kindly excuse the services, but we have no other option.
(IT) Mr President, so as not to interrupt the vote on the Fava report, which as we all know will be a complex vote, I should like to ask whether it might be possible, if the House agrees, to invert the order of business and thus vote first on the simpler and briefer reports and go on to vote on the Fava report after President Napolitano's speech.
It is clear, Mrs Muscardini, that if we do not start with the Fava report, we will not conclude it today, which means having to interrupt the vote on the Fava report in order to conclude it the day after, which I believe would be even more disastrous.
You will understand why I cannot act on your request.
Let us try to proceed allegro vivace, ma non troppo.
Formal sitting - Italy
President of the Italian Republic. - (IT) Mr President, I am sincerely grateful for your kind words of friendship towards me and towards Italy.
They reflect the feelings and the efforts that we shared during the period when we worked most closely together.
Above all, we collaborated in our respective roles in producing the Constitutional Treaty, for which you now reiterate your staunch support.
Allow me, then, to offer you my sincere compliments in return, and my very best wishes at the start of your important mandate.
Mr Poettering, Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on coming back to this Chamber I have the same feeling of belonging that inspired me throughout the years that I spent in the European Parliament: belonging to Parliament as an institution and belonging to Europe.
I had been a member of my own country's national parliament for decades, but I at once felt at ease in taking up my duties as an elected Member of this House when I was called upon to join it.
I felt no awkwardness, because the European Parliament, at least since 1979, has had the same dignity, authority and democratic legitimacy as any other freely elected parliament.
I felt no contradiction, either, because I have always believed that there should be no misunderstanding or antagonism between national parliaments and the European Parliament, but just mutual respect and fruitful cooperation.
Most of all, I have always been convinced that one can represent the views and interests of one's own country just as well in the European Parliament as in one's national parliament: here, in the Chambers of Strasbourg and Brussels, one takes a broader view of problems and choices that have to be understood in a European dimension, yet also in the interest of our national communities.
What unites us all is precisely the sense of belonging to Europe, seen as a common heritage of values and ideas, traditions and hopes, and as the prototype of a new political and institutional entity capable of rising to the challenges of the times in which we are living and of the foreseeable future.
That explains the special kind of experience that one gains in the European Parliament.
The political representatives acting here are not bound by restricted, divergent national outlooks and, even though they may well differ on certain issues, including important ones, and on votes that are certainly significant, they largely agree in their view of the basic objectives that must be pursued in order to further the integration of a united Europe.
When - as has happened so many times over the course of the decades - there has been a choice between pushing forward to broaden and strengthen European unity and just marking time or even pulling back, the European Parliament has always played a dynamic role: it has sent out a clear message, backed by a huge majority, to push ahead with developing the Community and broadening its horizons and ambitions.
Indeed, with the first elections to the European Parliament by universal suffrage in 1979 - an important event - it had seemed that consolidating the parliamentarian and constitutional nature of the European Union would inevitably follow, in order to strengthen the democratic bases of the integration process, to guarantee the citizens their rights and the chance to participate.
The European Parliament moved in that direction when, on 14 February 1984 - exactly 23 years ago today - it approved the draft Treaty establishing the European Union.
The draft, which had been drawn up and debated at the instigation of Altiero Spinelli, unfortunately never became a Treaty and, despite the long and far from fruitless journey that followed, often inspired by the proposals of Spinelli's draft, a number of issues remained unresolved and were to surface again.
When, on signing the disappointing Treaty of Nice, the governments agreed on the need to address the major themes for the future of Europe and to launch a genuine constitutional process, Parliament committed itself wholeheartedly to making its contribution by helping to seek adequate solutions to the questions raised in the Laeken Declaration of December 2001.
Parliament can indeed feel proud of the dynamic role that it played more than ever at that time, especially in the Brussels Convention - in its working groups, its plenary sessions and its Praesidium.
Ladies and gentlemen, 2001, 2002 and 2003 did not see a pause; rather, it was a time of serious, genuine and profound reflection.
The material that was then put forward to the Intergovernmental Conference for final decision was a text packed with analysis that had been considered and discussed at length.
The outcome was undoubtedly a compromise, but not a poor one: a middle ground was found between diverse viewpoints; each side, including Parliament, had to sacrifice its demands and proposals to some extent in order to arrive at an agreement that could actually advance the cause of European unity and integration.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, can we perhaps now blithely say that that Treaty - it is no accident that it is called 'Constitutional' - is dead?
Is that extraordinary, prolonged political and cultural effort destined to end up in oblivion?
Are the signatures of 27 Heads of State or Government at the foot of that text now worthless?
Of course, we are all too aware of the traumatic effects of the votes against ratifying the Constitutional Treaty in the referendums held in two of the six founding countries of the European Community.
We are equally well aware of the issues raised by the spread, in other countries as well, of doubts and scepticism about the path that Europe should take and about the European Union's current situation and future prospects.
In reality, we are paying the price for having made little effort to involve the citizens in the major decisions about European integration and unification, or to inform public opinion in every country about the extraordinary results and progress that we have achieved in 50 years and the new, ever more pressing needs to strengthen the EU in terms of its cohesion and its ability to act.
All of that, however, must not lead people to underestimate the reasons for the Constitutional Treaty signed in Rome in October 2004, or the solutions that it contains.
These are practical, albeit partial, responses - which we need to ensure are better understood and appreciated - to the citizens' own demands, including their demand for more transparency and democracy in the Union.
While the Constitutional Treaty represented a happy middle ground overall, it must be remembered that a good compromise means accepting certain ideas and giving up others.
People should not forget that when they say they are going to rework the 2004 text: nobody should think of shifting the balance of the established compromise to the benefit of his or her own views.
Starting new negotiations may be like opening Pandora's box, with the risk of having to start again from scratch and begin a debate when nobody knows what the outcome will be or how long it will take.
Eighteen of the 27 Member States, representing 275 million European citizens, have ratified the Treaty: they deserve our respect for having upheld the commitment signed in Rome.
It is quite clear, mind you, that the majorities that voted against it in the French and Dutch referendums must also be treated with respect, and that every effort must therefore be made to clarify the concerns that led to those rejections.
The time has come, however, for Europe to find a way out of the impasse.
No one can seriously claim that, after its huge enlargement, the EU does not need to redefine the overall framework of its values and objectives or to reform its institutional structure.
Working on a draft Constitution for Europe was not a formalistic exercise, nor was it a whim or a luxury: rather, it was a response to a profound need in Europe at this moment in its history.
Nor can the Europe of projects or results be put forward today as an alternative vision and strategy.
Admittedly, Europe has certainly not stood still for the last two years.
It gave the most telling proof of what it can achieve on the international stage when it succeeded in speaking with a single voice on the war in Lebanon, thus launching a dynamic new mission for peace in that region and throughout the Middle East.
Alongside this renewed political initiative, some further items to write down on the credit side of the balance sheet for this period are the drawing-up of some important directives and the agreement on an albeit limited increase in the meagre financial perspective for 2007-2013.
This was achieved with substantial input from the European Parliament through the powers it gained under the codecision procedure.
Nonetheless, ladies and gentlemen, the EU cannot go very far down the path of results with its current institutional framework.
It is certainly important to sketch out and propose new Community policies, as the Commission did recently on the environment and energy issues, which have now become major, critical problems because of climate change and the tensions over oil and gas supplies.
We know from long experience, however, that Commission documents, communications and even legislative proposals may produce scant results or only very slow progress. That is shown, for example, by the long, hard road towards a European immigration policy, which has already taken many years.
We also remember how the introduction of the single currency was not followed up with the economic governance that would have been necessary, not least to ensure that the objectives of that great project, the Lisbon Strategy, were effectively met.
What, then, are the decisive factors in making projects thrive and in making a Europe of results really grow?
The strength of the institutions and of their political commitment is decisive.
It is decisive that the Union should have institutions that are stronger than the resistance put up by those Member States that are still closed in on themselves, defending anachronistic prerogatives and vain national pretensions.
The Constitutional Treaty cleared away any fear or suspicion of a swing towards a centralised superstate by more clearly enshrining the distribution of powers and guaranteeing respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
It could be claimed instead that it did not go far enough in adapting its operating rules and decision-making procedures to the challenge posed by the enlarged EU or in introducing the new Community policies that are needed.
The most decisive steps forward in the Constitutional Treaty were towards a common foreign and security policy, an effective European area of freedom, security and justice, structured cooperation in the defence field, and enhanced cooperation in other fields.
If, however, talks were started all over again and some party began to question those innovations, starting with the appointment of a European foreign affairs minister and a European department for external action, you can be sure that somebody else would demand instead that the 2004 Treaty be supplemented or expanded with bolder and more consistent new measures to push the integration process along.
For example, the proposal to extend the scope of majority decision-making within the Council might understandably be tabled again, not least because getting rid of the unanimity rule and the veto does not prevent but rather encourages people to seek broad understandings and to reach acceptable agreements quickly.
Similarly, another point that would be put forward again if talks were restarted would be to get rid of the need for unanimity regarding future reviews of the Treaties and their entry into force.
All parties therefore need to have a good sense of realism: realism together with a determination to keep in check the tendency - which has resurfaced again - to weaken and water down the choice that was made more than 50 years ago now.
What was chosen then was the prospect of a Europe that was able to integrate, a single yet plural entity enriched by its diversity, aware of its common heritage of civilisation, and strong through combining cooperation among national governments with a new supranational dimension.
We are about to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, and it is important to use the occasion to reaffirm that prospect and that choice, while clearly setting out our new rationales and our new ambitions.
The Community idea was born in Paris back in 1950, however, when the very distant goal of a European Federation or a United States of Europe was first sketched out.
Today, we confidently expect Paris to make a reliable contribution to overcoming the crisis that began with the failure to ratify the Treaty in 2004.
Our partner, France, has such a keen sense of its role in Europe and the world that it will not fail to provide us with its now decisive input.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have drawn your attention to a few of the essential points forming the backdrop to the decisions that have to be made in the near future, without going into detail about the manifold legal, technical and political ideas that have recently been advanced in the search for a way out of the institutional impasse.
Italy has every confidence in the German Presidency's commitment, both to the principles and values that the Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, referred to in her speech in this Chamber, and to reaffirming Europe's objective of adopting the Constitutional Treaty.
Whatever form the roadmap that is now being mentioned may take, it is important to agree that the citizens need to see the Constitutional Treaty already in force, together with its message and programme, before the elections are held in 2009.
On that basis, my own message and programme is to appeal to the sense of responsibility and the political commitment of all those in positions of leadership in our countries.
No one can deny the extent of the new threats, challenges and opportunities facing us.
Europe will only be able to influence international relations and global development, recover its drive and dynamism, and count for something in the world if it strengthens its own cohesion and unity, by swiftly equipping itself - as a Union - with the institutions and resources that it needs.
The alternative - as we must realise - is a dramatic decline in the role of all our countries, indeed, in the historical role of our continent.
Allow me to repeat the words with which Jean Monnet ended his memoirs in 1976: 'We cannot stop when all around us the whole world is on the move.'
Thirty years later, those words are even more true: they buzz in our ears like an insect from which we can no longer escape.
The leaders of all our countries must therefore show that they are equal to this awareness and this responsibility, and they must be able to release a new European political will.
The European Parliament must shout louder than ever in calling for consistency and courage, as in the past.
Italy will play its part, Mr President; it will make its contribution as it has done ever since the integration process began.
This contribution is symbolised by the figures of a far-sighted statesman, Alcide De Gasperi, and of a passionate prophet and fighter for the European idea, Altiero Spinelli, the centenary of whose birth we are celebrating this year.
In referring to their example and in reaffirming Italy's European commitment, I know I can speak for my country as represented by all of its political groups together and by its citizens' heartfelt beliefs.
At the same time, I have tried to address you, ladies and gentlemen, on a more personal note, as dictated by my strong feelings.
Sitting on these benches and working in this Parliament taught me more and more clearly that one can only serve the cause of our peoples, our nations and our joint future by working for a united Europe.
President Napolitano, thank you very much for such an important speech.
We have every confidence in Italy.
Mr President, we thank you most warmly for the great speech you have just delivered.
You stand in the tradition of the great Italian figures who contended for the unity of our continent, something that you do not only when addressing parliaments, but also when you go out and talk to young people, as you did at the University of TÃŒbingen in Germany a few days ago.
For this great dedication you have our heartfelt thanks, and we wish you strength and health for the future, so that we may continue to work together with the same dedication for the unity of our continent.
We thank the President of the Italian Republic.
Thank you, Giorgio Napolitano.
(Applause)

Transportation and illegal detention of prisoners (continuation of vote)
- After the vote on Amendment 268
(DE) Mr President, the oral amendment has been agreed with Mr Fava, so it enjoys the rapporteur's support.
It is an addition to paragraph 82 and I shall now proceed to read it out.
'Deplores the inquiry by the prosecutors of Hamburg North against three journalists of Stern magazine and one collaborator of the Financial Times Deutschland on the basis of complicity in betrayal of secrets'.
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 31
(FR) This is an oral amendment that merely updates the information.
It concerns the following addition to the end of paragraph 110:
'takes note of the decision by the Spanish authorities to declassify secret documents held by the intelligence services concerning the use by CIA-operated aircraft of Spanish airports;'.
This is an update.
(ES) Mr President, in order to respond positively to Mr Guardans CambÃ³'s proposal and try to save his oral amendment, I would like to propose to the House - and my group could approve this - that we simply add 'at the request of the Judge of the High Court'.
If that is possible, we will be able to accept it, Mr President.
If it is not possible, Mr President, my group will be opposed.
(The amended oral amendment was accepted)
(ES) In fact I am taking the floor to say that, in agreement with the rapporteur -who is also going to present an oral amendment later on following Article 184 - we have agreed to withdraw this amendment from this paragraph so that we can then support the rapporteur's amendment in 184.
We are therefore withdrawing our amendment from this paragraph.
(IT) Mr President, for the same reasons given earlier by Mr Romeva i Rueda, myself and my colleague, Mr Meyer Pleite, who tabled the amendment in question, are also withdrawing our amendment.
- Before the vote on Amendments 234 and 235
On this point, too, I need clarification from our rapporteur.
In your view, Mr Fava, have Amendments 234 and 235 lapsed following the vote that has just taken place?
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, they are compatible.
A point of order, Mr President.
There is a PPE-DE amendment on paragraph 125 that I have tabled.
It is amendment 258 and you seem to have skipped over it.
I would appreciate it if we could take a vote on that amendment.
- Before the vote on Amendment 258
(DE) Mr President, I would just like to point out to my group that there is an error in the voting list.
On this point, we are voting with a plus.
Mr President, on a point of order, even the interpreters cannot keep up with you.
Would you please slow down.
There are people making mistakes in the voting. Please!
(Applause)
- After the vote on paragraph 184
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to paragraph 184.
I shall read it in English:
'Expresses serious concern about the content of the information in the air control register of Portugal list regarding stopover of military planes through military bases in Europe on the way from and to GuantÃ¡namo'.
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 242
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, the purpose of the oral amendment is to add the following phrase: 'calls on the Member States to sign the above-mentioned convention without delay;'.

Voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP (vote)
- After the vote on the Commission proposal
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission will withdraw its proposal.
Vice-President of the Commission. (IT) I shall, of course, report back to the College of Commissioners on the outcome of today's vote.
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, I do not think that the Commission has cleared it up terribly well, but I think it is not withdrawing its proposal, and so we need to clarify the legal situation.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented the second report on voluntary modulation after the referral of the first report back to committee in November 2006, under Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure.
As no agreement was possible with the Commission, the committee has had to reiterate its position, so we are dealing here not with a new report, where Rule 52(3) may be applied again, but with the confirmation of the first report.
The Legal Service of the European Parliament, with which I have consulted on this issue, has informed me that, in our specific case, the last sentence of Rule 52(4) has to be applied mutatis mutandis, which means that we have the vote on this legislative resolution and that a second referral to committee according to Rule 52(3) is not appropriate, so we are not referring it back to committee.
I propose, therefore, that the House should vote in favour of Parliament's legislative resolution because we have already rejected the Commission's legislative proposal.
Therefore, the ball is now firmly in the Commission and Council's court.
We await a new proposal with great interest.
(Applause)
I am going to try to summarise this clearly.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is proposing that, instead of referring the report back to committee, we take the exceptional step of proceeding directly to a roll-call vote on the draft legislative resolution, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.

Climate change (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 21
(NL) Mr President, according to our voting lists, Amendment 9 will lapse if Amendment 21, tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), is adopted.
I should like to ask that Amendment 9 be voted on in addition to Amendment 21, which stipulates 20% as a basis for sustainable energy and in our amendment, that of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we advocate 25% by way of gradual increase.
This could therefore be seen as an addition.
If it is voted on additionally, I should like to ask our group to vote in favour of Amendment 21.
As there does not appear to be any opposition on your part to Mrs Corbey's proposal, we are therefore going to vote on these two amendments.

Lisbon Strategy (European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007) (vote)
Mr President, it is a very straightforward oral amendment.
In the second line there is a phrase beginning 'have made it clear that no source of energy must be left unused'.
We want to insert three words so it would read, 'have made it clear that no sustainable and safe source of energy must be left unused'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)

The next item is voting time.
Explanations of vote
(DE) Mr President, I rejoiced to learn that the report made it unequivocally clear that neither the Austrian Government nor any official entity or authority in Austria had any kind of improper part in this.
I have nevertheless voted against the report on the grounds that the assertions in it are made without the backing of any kind of proof, yet they have not been removed from it, and, above all that the factual error concerning Europol has not been deleted either.
What that means is that the report continues to contain a misrepresentation of the facts in which it is insinuated that Europol had employed members of the American secret services, something that is without any substance whatever and the very opposite of the truth.
A report containing errors such as these does damage to Parliament's credibility and is a contributory factor in so many of its Members having voted against the report as a whole.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fava report is worth little more than a collage of press cuttings; while it pretends to uphold human rights, it is in fact an attempt to demolish the power and effectiveness of anti-terrorism activities.
The demand to see the full names of Italian military secret service personnel published on the European Parliament website just shows the level of irresponsibility of someone who hypocritically says he supports the fight against terrorism and then, in fact, takes every suitable opportunity to prevent it from being put into practice.
Parliament cannot and must not grant itself the power to strip EU national governments and Member States of their full sovereignty in matters of protecting their citizens' security, which is and must remain the inviolable province of the nations and Member States.
Mr President, the British Conservative delegation voted against the Fava report.
We regarded this report as an expensive exercise duplicating the work of Senator Marty in the Council of Europe.
It is full of unproven allegations, makes unreasonable demands of the Council, criticising Mr de Vries, Mr Solana and NATO arrangements, which allow cooperation with the United States of America as our ally in the fight against international terrorism.
The report calls for unacceptable Articles 6 and 7 sanctions against EU Member States, demands consular protection for UK residents, undermining the concept of British citizenship, and does not accept diplomatic assurances against torture in extraditing suspected terrorists to third countries.
Our case rests.
in writing. I voted against this report, not because I am unconcerned about allegations of international wrong-doing, but because this report builds its case largely on unsubstantiated speculation.
Even before this report was written there was a virulent anti-American political agenda driving it towards its conclusions of today.
Hence, its preference for press cuttings, rather than hard evidence.
In consequence it exudes imbalance to the point that it will bring comfort to terrorist and anti-democratic forces.
in writing. (SV) We have abstained in the vote on the report on the CIA's alleged use of European countries for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
There is no doubt that, in the fight against terrorism, human rights violations have been committed - a state of affairs that is substantiated with examples in the report.
We Swedish Conservatives condemn these acts of cruelty.
By mixing facts with assumptions and unconfirmed rumours, the report is in danger, however, of weakening, rather than strengthening, the justified criticism.
We opposed the setting up of the special committee because we believe that suspected crimes should be investigated by the judiciary.
Responsibility for investigations has, in the first place, been exercised at national level.
For example, the Swedish constitutional committee has examined - and passed judgment on - the Swedish Government's conduct.
The issues mainly dealt with by the report are those coming within the competence not of the EU but of the Member States.
On these issues, the governments of the Member States are responsible not to the European Parliament but solely and exclusively to their national parliaments as long as no European legal rules have been broken.
If Member States have failed to comply with commitments at European level, it is the Commission's responsibility to investigate such violations and to go to court in connection with them.
in writing.
The Irish members of the Fine Gael delegation voted in favour of the report as a whole, as we support the general thrust of the report and its strong stance against the process of extraordinary rendition and the involvement of EU countries or airports in that process.
However, I would like it noted that we do not agree in full with the wording of paragraph 125 of the report.
I attempted to delete paragraph 125, but was unsuccessful in doing so (the vote was narrowly lost).
That being said, the majority of the report is worth supporting, as a strong statement against the process of extraordinary rendition, as a breach of international law.
Therefore, we have voted in favour of the report as a whole.
I abstained from the final vote for the following reasons:
1. This report is ill-timed and ineffective;
2. A decision that reconciles the need for commitment to protect human rights with support for the fight against terrorism and its causes is only acceptable if it engenders broad consensus;
3. This report has not engendered such consensus and has not produced the political analysis of this issue that is required;
4. The document focuses too much on the investigation into what has happened in the Member States, and fails to draw the salient conclusion that the citizens' inalienable right to protection and the integrity of the Member States needs to be upheld within a framework of respect for individual human rights;
5. Lastly, a report on this sensitive issue should be coordinated with the intervention of the European Council and should take account of any decisions made by the Council of Europe.
in writing. I am voting for this report by my colleague Mr Fava on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
Let us be clear that I do not agree with everything in the report.
There are a number of highly contentious elements, including gratuitous references to the former Secretary of State for Defence in the UK, which we have rejected here this morning.
It has been claimed that much of the argumentation is not evidence-based.
One could say the same thing about the case for intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld: there are things we know, things we don't know and things we don't know we don't know.
Well, here I know that our Temporary Committee and its rapporteur Mr Fava have identified a serious abuse of human rights in breach of international law in the Union.
My vote is to endorse that clear overall finding and not the associated detail, which, inevitably in the absence of clear cooperation by the authorities, is speculation, which, while often right, is from time to time wrong.
The argument used by the German Presidency to shrug off the problems and shirk its political responsibilities regarding the 'use of European countries by the CIA for the illegal transportation and detention of prisoners' comes as a surprise.
Believe it or not, the Council claims that the affair lies outside its remit, even though it adopts one political position after another on whatever it considers to be of interest, and even though it is abundantly clear that these issues have been addressed as part of EU-NATO and EU-US relations.
It has once again been demonstrated that such attitudes are, at the very least, indicative either of an attempt to provide a smokescreen for this unacceptable violation of international law and the most basic human rights, or of connivance with, and even subservience towards, the USA.
The report drawn up by the temporary committee - which provided many of the victims with an identity and a voice - represents a further contribution towards the emergence of the whole truth and will help the national parliaments, the bodies actually charged with carrying out checks and balances on the behaviour of governments, to do their duty.
This is something that the Portuguese Communist Party has long been calling for and proposing in the Portuguese Assembly.
in writing. I voted for the Fava report, despite the changes made by nervous colleagues.
The so-called 'war' on terror has been used by some to rework international law and defy international conventions on human rights and the treatment of those detained (on suspicion, not proof) without trial or any due process.
Human rights are universal and indivisible: the EU is committed to upholding these rights.
This report confronts us with an uncomfortable reality and we urge Member State Parliaments and Governments to investigate fully what may have been happening on their territory.
This committee did not have full investigative powers, but we do have the power to make political recommendations.
They should be acted upon if we really want to uphold our values.
in writing. I support this report investigating the alleged secret CIA 'rendition' flights.
As human rights form a core value of the European Union and by extension the activities of the European Parliament, it is right and proper that the European Parliament as an institution discusses and investigates possible human rights violations within its borders.
in writing. Today's report by Mr Fava raises some critical issues which are about the core fundamental rights of everybody in Europe and across the world.
The report paints a shocking picture of human rights abuse and illegal activity, all of which was tolerated by Member States including Ireland.
The Irish Government's hear-no-evil, see-no-evil approach to illegal renditions is unconvincing and unacceptable.
The report points out that at least 147 CIA-operated flights made stopovers in Irish airports including by aircraft involved in 'extraordinary renditions' or kidnappings as we would normally call them.
Now all of us who seek the truth about these kidnappings must take this issue to our national parliaments and directly challenge the national governments at home in our countries.
The real pressure must be applied at home where the people who permitted and tolerated these actions will feel it.
To this end, I am calling on the Government to launch a full parliamentary inquiry in the DÃ¡il immediately into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit.
Sinn FÃ©in supported the report to lend our weight in the European Parliament to this call.
in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) voted for the Fava report because we believe that it is important for the European Parliament to have investigated the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
MEPs are directly elected and answerable to our constituents.
We investigate all manner of issues on behalf of them and we could not ignore calls that Member States may have breached their treaty obligations under Article 6 of the EU Treaty which outlines the basic principles of democracy, human rights, and respect of law.
The EPLP voted for amendments which moved the focus of the report away from personalities and party politics to the substance of the rendition allegations.
The EPLP have voted for a more balanced and fair report in Plenary than the report which emerged from Committee stage.
in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) voted for the FAVA report because we believe that it is important for the European Parliament to have investigated the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.

We investigate all manner of issues on behalf of them and we could not ignore calls that Member States may have breached their treaty obligations under Article 6 of the EU Treaty, which outlines the basic principles of democracy, human rights, and respect for the law.
The EPLP voted for amendments which moved the focus of the report away from personalities and party politics to the substance of the rendition allegations. It is for this reason that the EPLP voted against amendment 29.
The EPLP have voted for a more balanced and fair report in Plenary than the report which emerged from the committee stage.
The report describes and - up to a point - confirms the disclosures and facts which have come to light on abductions, secret flights, illegal detentions in secret prisons, torturing and so on by the CIA on European soil.
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party abstained from the vote because they consider the stand of the grassroots and socialist party previously in government which backed and backs the so-called anti-terrorist strategy of the USA and agrees with all these actions to be hypocritical.
Today, under the weight of the grassroots outcry about these disclosures, they are trying to appear as champions of the 'terrorist policy' and as protectors of human rights in order to rescue the 'lost honour' of the ÎU.
We radically disagree and have no intention of helping to delude the peoples as to the nature of the policy to 'combat terrorism'.
It is the imperialists' pretext to construct a gigantic repressive mechanism throughout the world with the basic objective of establishing their supremacy and hitting the grassroots movements and opposition.
At a time when the European Parliament is doing its utmost about violations of human rights, autocratic laws for striking the movement and restricting demonstrations are being promoted throughout the ÎU.
Personal files on all and sundry and the signature of new agreements with the USA are being promoted.
I voted in favour of the Fava report because it is an historic step in the fight against a criminal international parastate.
Apart from the huge responsibilities of the European Council, there are also clear responsibilities for the governments of several Member States.
On completion of this complicated investigation by the European Parliament, it is vital that examining committees be set up now in the national parliaments of the Member States - which unfortunately include Greece - which appear to be involved in the CIA's illegal activities.
The baton in the fight against the international parastate is now in their hands.
The German Federal Government bears a great deal of shared responsibility for the CIA's torture flights; such is the verdict of the report of the committee investigating the CIA's activities, which was adopted in the European Parliament today.
The German Federal Government - a coalition composed of conservatives and social democrats - can no longer avoid facing up to the consequences, even though it is obvious that it has been in response to pressure from it that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament have watered down some of the report's language.
The European Parliament has come to the conclusion that, 'according to information given by Murat Kurnaz's lawyer and information provided by the German authorities, there was a prospect of the release of Murat Kurnaz from GuantÃ¡namo in 2002 but this was not accepted by the German authorities' and that 'Murat Kurnaz's lawyer was told by the German Government that it was impossible to open negotiations with the US Government on his release because Murat Kurnaz was a Turkish citizen' even though 'all investigations had established, by as early as at the end of October 2002, that Murat Kurnaz posed no terrorist threat'.
My colleagues and I are agreed that this gross misconduct on the part of the representatives of the former Social Democrat/Green Federal Government needs to be investigated.
The foreign minister, Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who formerly coordinated Germany's secret services, should desist from deceiving the public and at last face up to his responsibility for what happened back then.
I voted against the Fava report, otherwise known as the CIA report, for four reasons.
Staunch defence of human rights, the rule of law and democracy, which I advocate, cannot be delivered by political action underpinned more by naÃ¯ve left-wing anti-Americanism than by the actual defence of these values.
It is not for Parliament to monitor the Member States.
This is the duty, first and foremost of national parliaments and any violation of this principle is inherently a political error and a legal anomaly.
The report makes the unforgivable mistake of drawing definitive conclusions from unproven, controversial statements, turning opinions into truths and insinuations into facts.
As regards Portugal, even with the adopted amendments, there is still a degree of imbalance between what has been proven (or even declared by the alleged victims) and what has been concluded, or, worse, presumed to be true.
Lastly, I should like to praise Mr Coelho for his tireless work in promoting balance, reason and the defence of our key principles and values.
I take the view that had he been the rapporteur rather than the chairman of the committee the report would have been substantially better balanced.
in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has just given its verdict on the work done by its Temporary Committee concerning the use of European airspace by the CIA for the illegal transportation of prisoners.
The verdict was unsurprising: condemnation of the many Member States that have effectively given their support to the CIA.
Mr Fava's report has one great quality, which is to point out a common basis of fundamental values: respect for human rights, the condemnation of torture and respect for the legal framework in the fight against terrorism.
It also has one great failing: it totally overlooks the fact that the only thing restricting our governments' efforts is reason, reason that allows them to reject the impossible: the secret services will never be welcoming and transparent!
Let us not confuse humanism with naÃ¯ve optimism.
As the philosopher, Alain, put it: 'there can be no freedom without security; security is worth nothing without freedom'.
This concern for security in the context of freedom justified my abstention.
I am convinced that my friend, Antoine Duquesne, the former Minister for the Interior of the Kingdom of Belgium, would have delivered the same message, if he could have voted today.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
Since January 2006, a great deal of work has been carried out by Parliament's Temporary Committee, which is responsible for conducting investigations into the allegations made in the press on this sensitive issue.
I should like to point out that, if its work is to be legitimate, it is important for the Committee to rely on tangible and verifiable evidence, so as to remain somewhat impartial.
The MEPs are vested with a duty of transparency and information towards the citizens; this information must therefore be guided by a concern to provide the most accurate feedback possible.
While the final report does not fulfil this demand as well as it might, I decided to vote in favour, convinced that, through these committees, Parliament is required to play a decisive role in terms of helping to ensure that the human rights and fundamental values to which the Union fully adheres in its Treaties are respected.
Thus, the fight against terrorism must be waged in compliance with the international law in force, and no human rights violations can be justified.
I voted against the adoption of the aforementioned final report because it contained references to Poland that did not reflect the findings of the work of the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners.
The committee found no evidence, other than press reports, to confirm the existence of secret CIA prisons in my country.
Mere supposition, unsupported by evidence, cannot be used as the basis of a final report on such a serious issue.
in writing. Mr Fava should be commended for steering through our House this difficult and sensitive report on rendition allegations.
Abuses of human rights, torture and illegal deportation must be condemned in today's Europe.
in writing. (DE) I reject the CIA report on the grounds that it does not do even the most basic of the things that I expect of a report from a committee of inquiry, whether in terms of its methodology or of its analytical processes.
The conclusions differ in no way from those reached by the Council of Europe's investigator Dick Marty, some of whose former witnesses have since changed their minds.
Although this should not be taken to mean that I approve of what the USA has done, I have to say that, in this report, truth, facts and honesty have given way to suppositions and accusations.
in writing. (SV) Many unfortunate incidents in the fight against terrorism have been noted.
However, these issues have already been dealt with by the United Nations Human Rights Council and by the Council of Europe.
The Swedish Government has taken the criticism concerned on board.
There is therefore no reason for discussing this issue in the European Parliament too.
I have therefore voted in favour of many of the proposals but abstained in the vote on the report as such.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of adopting the report on granting European Union financial aid to Moldova, aimed at supporting the balance of payments and foreign currency reserves.
I did so because I am convinced that these resources will allow one of the poorest countries in Europe to overcome its current financial difficulties.
Additional exceptional support should prove very useful in facilitating and supporting the implementation of the Government of Moldova's economic reforms.
Bearing in mind the positive social and economic changes in Moldova, including the recent abolition of the death penalty, I believe it is appropriate to strengthen bilateral links with Moldova and deepen its relationship with the European Union.
A grant of up to EUR 45 million will send out a strong signal from the European Union, especially in the context of the Russian ban on the import of wine from Moldova and the higher prices demanded for energy.
in writing. I am in support of this financial assistance to one of the poorest countries in Europe, which has been economically hard hit by events in its region.
I particularly welcome the amendments which seek to increase the role of the Parliament.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council decision on providing Community macro-financial assistance to Moldova.
Indeed, despite making definite economic progress, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe.
Since 1 January, Moldova, which shares a border with Romania, has actually bordered the European Union, and the Council wants to help it cope with its commercial and financial difficulties.
I should like, nevertheless, to emphasise that this solidarity, valued at EUR 45 million, is of an exceptional and limited nature and requires certain conditions.
The granting of aid must be made subject to the fulfilment of objectives such as the increased transparency of public finances and respect for human rights.
Finally, I believe, above all, that, in the wake of the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, the European Union's spirit of solidarity must now extend to the countries of the southern Mediterranean.
Thus, through its neighbourhood policy and its Euro-Mediterranean partnership, the EU must ensure that its financial instruments remain effective and that its trade with the countries of the southern Mediterranean increases.
in writing. A total ban on drift nets and its effective implementation needs to be prioritised by Member States.
Too many dolphins, porpoises and seals die needlessly due to the use of these nets.
A standard definition should be welcomed in order that there can be no loop-hole in the use of these destructive nets.
in writing. (SV) Because the June List does not believe that the EU should have a common fisheries policy, we have voted against this report.
We would also take the liberty of referring to earlier explanations of vote concerning fisheries policy.
This purpose of this regulation is to clarify the fishing gear that can be classified as drift nets by harmonising a common definition for all regulation in this area.
Drift nets have a major impact on fisheries resources and on marine ecosystems, and an economic impact - in terms of competition and loss of income - on fishermen using more traditional gear.
Against this backdrop, the EU has adopted United Nations Resolution 44/225 introducing a moratorium on the use of drift nets as part of the Community acquis (Regulation No 354/1992), despite some regional exceptions at Community level.
As such we support the content of this report, which will help improve control and reduce the impact of drift nets in Portuguese waters, in particular in the Exclusive Economic Areas of the Azores and Madeira, as these waters are visited by fleets from other Member States, which use this gear in fishing for tuna and other marine species, either due to a loophole in the law or illegally.
in writing. (SV) The report contains quite a few constructive proposals for preventing overfishing.
I have therefore voted in favour of this proposal for pragmatic reasons.
The EU's fisheries policy has, in general, militated against long-term sustainable exploitation of the sea's resources by subsidising fishermen's purchases of efficient boats.
Fisheries policy is also prejudicial to the populations of poor countries inasmuch as the EU purchases rights to fish in these countries' waters from weak governments.
The EU should therefore return fisheries policy to the Member States and see to it only that the Member States do not overfish species that move in more than one country's territorial waters.
I mistakenly voted in favour of the proposed resolution, when I had meant to vote against, as I did on the legislative proposal.
I therefore request that my vote on the legislative resolution be amended (to a vote against).
in writing. The reason I did not vote for the Agriculture Committee's proposal to reject the Commission's proposal on voluntary modulation is that doing so would further delay the start of the new rural development programmes and their funding.
This would have a negative affect on farmers and rural communities in my constituency, who badly need these funds.
The lack of funding for rural development is a problem for Wales.
This has been caused by a combination of the UK not getting a fair share of the EU funding, the UK Government's defence of its budget rebate and the UK Presidency's financial perspectives deal.
As a result of this failure by government, Ministers will look to modulation to top up this fund.
Subsidiarity must be ensured so that the decision to apply voluntary modulation or not and at what level is taken at the appropriate level.
In my constituency that would mean the National Assembly for Wales rather than at Member State level.
There are wide differences in approach and distinctive rural communities across the UK and it would be totally unacceptable to have a single level.
There must also be full and additional matching funding from central government funds.
As we have said before, the key issue here is that the Commission's proposal is not a proposal for genuine modulation.
Such a proposal would increase aid to those who receive the least, or receive nothing, and reduce aid to those who receive a large amount, so as to ensure greater fairness in the distribution of aid among producers, countries and crops and to support small and medium farmers and family farming.
We feel that the Commission should table a fresh proposal in order to create genuine, compulsory modulation, which would guarantee greater fairness and release financial resources by introducing a maximum limit to aid per holding (capping) and a percentage increase in aid for farmers who receive the least from the CAP (modulation), for example, by proposing a 15% to 20% increase for small or medium-sized farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 in aid, and taking various circumstances into account even when they receive more than that.
Without this, there is a risk that existing inequalities will be exacerbated.
We therefore urge the Commission to recast the proposal in order to ensure that a decision on this issue does not ultimately lead to the renationalisation of the costs of the CAP.
The Commission has so far not done this, however.
Hence our decision to abstain.
Parliament has already rejected the Commission's proposal for voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP of up to 20%.
According to this proposal, funds earmarked for farmers would be provided under the second pillar of the CAP, namely rural development; that is to say, they would pass to the national budgets of the Member States that decide to employ this modulation.
The removal of aid for farmers would raise issues of competition between farmers from countries that do not employ modulation and those from countries that do, and between farmers in the latter category depending on the level of modulation decided upon.
For this reason I share the view of the rapporteur, Mr Goepel, that we should once again reject the Commission's proposal.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the European Union's common agricultural policy should be phased out.
We also oppose the new subsidies under the designation, 'rural development'.
We wonder why the EU believes that the Member States cannot manage to develop their rural areas themselves.
We are faced with two alternatives in this vote: the Commission's proposal and the proposal by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
In this situation, we have chosen to vote in favour of the Commission's proposal, since it is better than the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is quite absurd.
The report's explanatory statement contains a whole range of views.
For example, it criticises possible abandonment or renationalisation of the common agricultural policy - a development that the June List would find desirable - and complains that it is contrary to the European Parliament's right of participation, a view that the June List does not share.
In addition, the explanatory statement maintains that the health check on the long-term budget should only form the basis of proposals for the financing period after 2013.
The June List completely rejects that view.
We believe that the mid-term review should lead to cuts in the agriculture/rural development budget as early as in the current budget period of 2007-2013.
The June List observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision regarding the EU's agricultural policy.
Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to all the various groups within the agricultural industry.
in writing. I voted for the proposal to introduce voluntary modulation of the CAP as it has been used more effectively in the UK than in any other Member State.
It has been used as an essential source to fund rural development schemes throughout the country.
in writing. - (FR) In addition to decoupling aid and production, the CAP reform has introduced a new tool: modulation.
In practice, this is the option to transfer part of the appropriations, the direct payments to farmers, to rural development appropriations.
It is called a 'transfer from the first pillar to the second pillar'.
As much as twenty per cent of the funds may be transferred under voluntary modulation.
The Member States may choose this modulation from an abridged menu, rather than from one imposed on them, which serves up 'direct aid' as a main course and 'rural development' as a dessert.
In reality, modulation amounts to robbing Paul the farmer to feed Peter the landscape gardener.
This is a budgetary technique that is meant to disguise the shortage of appropriations with the impression that one can choose how these scarce appropriations are managed.
in writing. (DE) The EU's appearance of taking up the cause of agriculture does nothing to change the fact that we are constantly losing farmers and that more and more farms are now being run only as a sideline.
In a situation in which big business and royalty benefit from our subsidies and we cannot manage to get our organic farmers' case heard by the WTO, one can hardly be surprised that this is the way things are going.
Comprehensible indicators of quality and health benefits would be desirable as means of guaranteeing fair prices for healthy products, but the most vital thing of all is that the EU's subsidy jungle be simplified, if need be by returning agriculture to national jurisdiction.
It is for that reason that I have voted against the Goepel report.
in writing. The British Conservative Delegation recognises the vital importance of agri-environment schemes.
However, for three major reasons, Conservatives voted in favour of rejecting the Commission's proposal on voluntary modulation.
Firstly, for British farmers, voluntary modulation would be anything but voluntary - they would be forced to accept a cut of up to 20 % of the value of their single farm payment, while the rest of Europe's farmers would not.
Had Tony Blair negotiated a better EU Budget deal for the UK on rural development monies, our farmers would not be facing this bleak prospect.
Secondly, the proposal that we are called to vote on is, in any case, unacceptable to the British Government itself because it does not allow for regionalisation, it restricts the Government's freedom in deciding spending priorities and it maintains a franchise unsuitable to the UK's farming structure.
Labour MEPs did not move a single amendment to bring the proposal more into line with their Government's wishes!
Finally, Commissioner Fischer Boel's most recent statements suggest that Parliament's overwhelming opposition to the proposal cannot be totally ignored and that some form of compromise may emerge.
We sincerely hope that this is to the benefit of British farmers.
in writing. (DA) We are voting against Parliament's proposal that the Commission should withdraw its own proposal and in favour of the Commission's proposal.
We think that Parliament is trying to blackmail the Commission with the threat of withholding 20% of rural development resources.
Instead of affecting the Commission, this would hit the farmers, who would not see their money paid out, and, especially, the EU as a whole, the reputation of which would scarcely be enhanced if shameless blackmail between the institutions were in future to become the norm.
On behalf of the Danish delegation of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
in writing. The proposed CAP reforms should be supported.
It is disappointing that for the second time Parliament has rejected these reforms which provide a sustainable approach to rural development.
The vote today will again delay payments to farmers in Scotland and the UK.
MEPs cannot demand reform of the CAP on the one hand and then not support reform in practice.
Our constituents time and time again ask for reform of the CAP.
It is worrying that the national and vested interests of a few are being allowed to distort the urgent reform of the CAP.
The Trans-European Networks for Transport (TEN-T) represent an investment in guaranteeing accessibility within the European area, and form a key part of the Lisbon Strategy, both as investment in innovation and in job creation, and via the creation of structures that help speed up cohesion and socio-economic development.
Consequently, the meagre increase in the financial resources earmarked for the TEN-T and the slowness in implementing the TEN-T priority projects are major causes for concern.
It is therefore vital that the Member States attach maximum priority to realising these projects and do not shy away from adopting all the measures needed to complete them.
In addition to the priority of cross-border links, there needs to be better coordination and transparency in the procedures if we are finally to see the fruits of over a decade of work.
These projects are of vital importance to cohesion on the European continent, to intermodality, to interoperability and, lastly, to easing traffic congestion.
Decisions must now be taken to enhance the leverage effect of Community funding.
Today, we must have no hesitation in correcting mistakes, effecting the necessary changes and ensuring that these projects move forward as quickly as possible.
(DE) Mr President, while I would like to make it clear that the delegation of the Austrian People's Party has always been forthright in its advocacy of pro-active action to address climate change, we have nevertheless voted against this resolution on the grounds that it attempts to bring in nuclear power through the back door.
We have always been equally forthright in rejecting this form of energy, which, in our view, has no future.
It has been a cause of great surprise to me that so few of the self-proclaimed opponents of nuclear power - in particular those belonging to the Socialist Group and the Group of the Greens - have nevertheless voted to endorse this report.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on climate change, because I firmly believe there is an urgent need to define a European Union strategy on this issue, which is of such importance to humanity.
It seems very important for the European Parliament to make its voice heard on the matter.
The Member States of the Union and the European Commission are facing a tremendous challenge.
How can economic development be supported whilst at the same time protecting the natural environment?
Experts are calling for emissions of gases containing CO2 to be limited, and for research and innovation in the area of renewable energy and energy saving technologies to be supported.
It is also important to cooperate with countries outside the European Union and, in particular, to make citizens aware of the dangers resulting from climate change.
We are all responsible for protecting the Earth.
We must understand, however, that reducing emissions and pollution will involve additional costs for European enterprises and citizens in the short term.
If we consider that countries such as China, Brazil and India are producing more and more carbon dioxide and other noxious substances every year, the Union should help them to change over to cleaner and more energy-efficient production methods.
Trade in so-called green technology and the development of renewable sources of energy should be promoted.
We need to take this action for our own sakes and for the sake of future generations.
(FI) Mr President, in point 34 of the resolution on climate change, which we have just voted on, the Commission was asked to assess the risks to nuclear institutions posed by floods and tsunamis that are caused by climate change.
There is a Finnish campaign behind this idea which is based on a fictional novel, and for which there is no scientific basis.
In the story, a tsunami, brought about by climate change, causes an accident that results in massive damage to a nuclear power plant.
I am in favour of exercising great caution and assessing the risks, but this initiative was annoying and downright embarrassing for the reputation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
First of all, climate change does not cause tsunamis.
That idea is considered absurd by serious researchers.
My colleagues behind the initiative are right to say that an assessment of the risks of power stations is always necessary, but wrong to let it be understood that this had not already been done.
No power plant is built without ensuring that it is flood-resistant.
That is why I am also forced to ask the Commission to assess the political risks arising from parliamentary initiatives based on pure fiction.
I am happy that this time the problem was avoided.
in writing. (SV) We voted in favour of Amendments 3 and 8 because we think it would be a good thing if the EU Member States could agree unanimously on taxes that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, we do not support decisions on tax taken on a majority basis at EU level, because we Swedish Social Democrats believe that tax decisions should be taken at national level.
We broadly welcome the adoption of this document, yet another on climate change.
It is a document that asserts, or confirms, our undertakings as regards reducing emissions and promoting alternative energies.
It does not, however, deal with other equally important points such as promoting energy efficiency and the use of high-quality public transport; these alternatives are covered either fleetingly or in watered-down form.
It also emphasises the proposal to commercialise emissions rights, or to put it more aptly, the 'right to pollute'.
As we have been saying, this would run counter to the stated objectives, on account of its commercial nature, as those who can pay will still be able to pollute.
This will affect in particular countries with weaker economies that do not have the money to buy these emissions rights.
Whilst there are some welcome proposals in the areas of emissions reductions and renewable energy, there are other proposals that would be difficult to implement given the stringent requirements placed on the different countries, especially given the opposition to them.
In any event, we shall carefully monitor the implementation of some of the ideas in the report, whilst fighting to ensure that they are not exploited for the purpose of further concentrating energy in the hands of the wealthiest countries or in such a way that it is the consumer who has to carry the can for the pollution costs of the polluting companies.
The results of the Paris session are a slap in the face for everyone who believed that opposition and interests would be overcome in light of the serious danger of the planet's overheating and of the catastrophic medium- and long-term repercussions for the peoples of this earth.
However, the resolution on climate change, which is a fighting text, does not propose material and specific solutions.
To a large extent it expresses wishful thinking and maintains a reliance on the same methodology responsible for today's acute problems, favouring market mechanisms, imposing taxes and contributions on the workers and exempting the multinationals.
It clearly states that the reduction in emissions will contribute towards competition and towards achieving the Lisbon and Kyoto objectives.
It is precisely this policy of capital that is responsible for contaminating the environment and for emissions and it cannot be a criterion for protecting it.
Moreover, all those who ratified the Kyoto protocol are showing on balance significant deviations, while the USA continues to increase greenhouse gases, together with China and India.
Consequently, Kyoto has little to do in practice with reducing emissions.
The conclusion is that the EU of capital and its political spokesmen are destroying the planet on the pretext of environmental changes and their only concern is how to make more profitable use of the Kyoto 'market mechanisms'.
in writing. I agree with the general aims of the Council resolution.
While I agree with the content of the Verts/ALE amendments and the commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020, I believe that the amendment was too narrowly focused and I abstained from the vote on that particular amendment.
in writing. Climate change is perhaps the most significant political challenge of our time.
The type of steps called for in this resolution, and collective action at the multilateral level are essential if climate change is to be combated.
in writing. While I supported the resolution, the EU needs to take additional initiatives to address climate change
Shop shelves are full of low value, perishable goods that have been transported tens of thousands of miles to satisfy consumer pricing expectations.
The carbon footprint left behind by this form of global trading is colossal.
I am therefore calling for the introduction of a "Carbon Labellingâ system, which would give consumers the information to make responsible and wise choices.
in writing. Moves to make the European Parliament a carbon neutral institution require to be pursued as a matter of urgency.
Tackling climate change is the challenge of our time.
We all need to play our part.
Perhaps it will be the argument of our carbon footprint, rather than any other, which will finally end our Strasbourg sojourns every month.
After all, we as MEPs should practice what we preach.
in writing. (SV) The greenhouse effect is one of the great problems of our time.
It is therefore important that considerable efforts be made to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
One of the best and most important methods of eliminating such emissions is to have nuclear energy replace energy produced through the burning of coal and oil.
The IAEA has observed that nuclear energy is one of the keys to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It is unfortunate that the resolution in question chooses to ignore this fact by insisting that emissions should not be reduced through the use of nuclear energy.
It is for this reason that I am voting against this resolution.
(DE) Mr President, we all know that fighting terrorism can only ever be a cooperative effort, and there is no doubt about the importance, to the European Union, of the USA as a partner in this, nor, indeed about the need, to this end, of the exchange of data and information, yet this must be done in accordance with rules accepted by both parties.
Now that we have decided on those rules, which - ranging from the specified use to which data may be put to conversion to a push-system, by way of the non-storage of sensitive data - have gained broad majority support, and have, above all, managed to commit the authorities in the USA to informing their counterparts in the European Union of terrorist suspects, I am happy to give this resolution my support.
I am persuaded that - should Commissioner Frattini be mandated to conduct negotiations - it will be possible to achieve a good outcome in the interests of the security of the EU's citizens.
in writing. UK Conservatives are in full support of measures which highlight fraudulent financial transactions for the benefit of funding terrorism.
However, this motion for a resolution fails to mention the results of investigations carried out by the Belgian authorities.
Also the motion fails to recognise the importance of ensuring that access to such data should be limited to appropriate law enforcement agencies trusted with counter-terrorism action.
In the case of the PNR agreement, Conservatives believe that it is the sovereign right of a country to ask for information on people entering its territory.
Any agreement on data transfer should recognise this right.
The more appropriate method to handle such agreements and ensure high standards of data protection is through a mechanism of intergovernmental cooperation.
For these reasons British Conservatives voted against the resolution.
The EU is fully committed to the fight against global terrorism, on the basis of its human values and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.
No motive, however laudable, can justify the absence of democratic legitimacy.
Accordingly, the sharing of data must be subject to constant parliamentary and judicial monitoring.
There are serious doubts regarding the processing of personal data by the US authorities, which indiscriminately hoard data, in breach of European data protection legislation.
What is more, the arrangements are not reciprocal: US citizens are afforded must greater protection in Europe than Europeans in the United States.
I therefore believe that a common framework must be set up with the United States with the aim of safeguarding guarantees regarding the sharing of sensitive information in the context of the fight against terrorism.
Parliament will have to keep a close eye on the PNR agreement to be negotiated by the Commission.
We have always expressed our opposition to the establishment of an agreement with the United States on the sharing of personal data, in relation either to PNR or to SWIFT.
This is firstly because the agreement forms part of a broad context of securitarian measures - note the programme of illegal phone tapping in the United States - on the basis of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', which has been a pretext for unleashing interference and aggression on countries and peoples when US imperialist interests have been at stake.
We are also opposed to this agreement because no valid guarantees are given that the citizens' legitimate rights will be safeguarded by the implementation of the agreed rules governing personal data protection, including those defined by the EU itself.
Furthermore, the effective monitoring of these agreements on the part of the national parliaments is not guaranteed.
There is no doubt that the seriousness of the current state of affairs would be minimised by the establishment of more specific measures, more effective methods of controlling the personal data to be transferred, limits on the use to which data can be put, information for the citizens, and the citizens being afforded access to their personal data.
What is really needed, however, is an end to this securitarian onslaught, which, on the pretext of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', undermines the citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees.
in writing. Sinn FÃ©in believes the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Agreement should not be entered into lightly or behind closed doors.
The PNR Agreement forms part of the so-called 'war on terror' and will infringe the civil liberties of Irish citizens.
EU Member States should not allow themselves to be bullied into applying an Agreement which fails to guarantee the data protection rights of its citizens.
Ireland should take the lead within the EU Council in demanding a more acceptable Agreement.
I am calling on the government to amend the proposed Agreement before its adoption to ensure that at a minimum: the annual joint review includes a requirement for an evaluation of the Agreement covering both the detail of its operation and also its effectiveness against its stated objective of 'fighting terrorism'; and that any change in US, EU or Irish data protection provisions relevant to the operation of the Agreement would prompt an immediate and transparent renegotiation of the Agreement requiring further approval by both houses of the Oireachtas."
in writing. - (EL) The resolution by the European Parliament on the transmission of passengers' personal data by European airlines (PNR) and the scandal of the provision of information on financial transactions by SWIFT customers to the US security services reveals the true character of the pronouncements by the political forces behind the European one-way street and European subjugation.
Their protests about the violation of the protection of personal data and of privacy in the resolution are converted to a belief that 'the ÎU and the USA are fundamental and loyal allies in the fight against terrorism'.
That is why they also propose signing a new agreement on the transmission of passengers' personal data, with the same content as the previous one, and the removal of information on financial transactions for 'judicial investigative purposes', provided that the USA gives guarantees that it will be protected.
The new agreements proposed add to the disclosures about the criminal activities of the CIÎ in Member States of the ÎU, with abductions, detentions in secret jails and torturing of 'terrorist suspects', thereby proving that, despite their hypocritical pronouncements, cooperation between the ÎU and the USA is deepening, in a bid to restrict fundamental rights and grassroots freedoms, on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
- (SK) I have voted for the adoption of the resolution of European Parliament on the contribution to the Spring Council scheduled for 8 and 9 March.
I have expressed my support for the amended wording of the resolution, because I consider the preservation of internal market competitiveness and the implementation of a strategic innovation policy focusing on energy efficiency to represent a clear and up-to-date response to the issue of how to achieve the Lisbon Strategy goals.
In the interests of enhancing the transparency and clarity of the Strategy, I support the process of improving the drafting of consumer protection laws.
An essential point in the resolution is the appeal to national parliaments to embrace national reform programmes, as success in meeting the ambitious Lisbon goals is dependent mainly on the initiative of each of the Member States.
In this context, I would like to mention the Slovak example where, thanks to the structural reforms made by the government of MikulÃ¡Å¡ Dzurinda, we are already witnessing real results, for example almost 10 per cent economic growth and the creation of hundreds of new jobs.
The Minerva Strategy, which involves mobilising innovation in support of the national economy and developing scientific and educational activities, constitutes an implementation of the Lisbon Strategy that aims to make Slovakia one of the most advanced, modern and prosperous societies worldwide, and thereby possibly also a source of ideas and inspiration to other Members States of the Union.
in writing. (SV) We supported the resolution on the Lisbon Strategy.
We believe that, in the future too, the Lisbon Strategy must be based on the need for social policy, economic policy and environmental policy mutually to support each other.
In the ongoing work on the strategy, it is important to emphasise an overall perspective whereby it is efficient and open markets, education, an active and egalitarian welfare policy and a progressive environmental policy that together contribute to growth and job creation.
We did not, however, support the demand that obstacles to job creation, including obstacles to the creation of relatively low-paid jobs, must be removed.
This might be interpreted in terms of opening up a low-wage market, something to which we are absolutely opposed.
On the contrary, we want any such development to be prevented.
This can be done by allowing collective agreements and cooperation between the social partners to play a more significant role.
We are also opposed to wordings that encourage the exploitation of 'clean energy' and carbon dioxide-neutral energy technology, because they might be interpreted in terms of our being in favour of the expansion of nuclear energy.
We should prefer to see increased efforts to develop renewable energy with a view to promoting sustainable development.
The resolution before us reveals the true nature of the 'Lisbon Strategy' - the European-level agenda of the employers and the large financial and economic groups - which was reinforced by the 2005 relaunch of the Strategy and the launch of national reform programmes in all Member States in order to push through so-called structural reforms, aimed at making labour relations more flexible, deregulating the markets, liberalising services, commercialising education and research and privatising social security.
Now that the liberalisation of services has been achieved, the Strategy now has its sights set on labour relations with so-called 'flexicurity', total deregulation and the liberalisation of unfair dismissals.
I wish to point out that social concerns and objectives, which had previously served to help disguise the true nature of the Lisbon Agenda, have now disappeared.
The fact is that since 2000, in the EU of the Strategy and the eurozone era, there has been weak growth in the economy and in employment, an increase in job insecurity, poverty, social exclusion and income inequalities, and unemployment remains high.
A sea change away from the EU's current policies is therefore needed.
The ideas of the three main groups of this House are so similar where economic, trade, social and employment policy are concerned that they have straight away tabled a single resolution on the forthcoming European Council.
That, in itself, is reason enough for me to reject it.
Reflecting, as it does, a pathetic, exclusively pro-European way of thinking, this text contains everything that is responsible for Europeans' growing hostility to your system: the little piece, written in a roundabout way, about the unemployed being responsible for their unemployment - 'poor swines' as Gabin said in La TraversÃ©e de Paris - that about the benefits of immigration, which come at the cost of plundering of elites in the developing world and of pressure on wages in Europe; that about the necessary reform of our social protection system 'in the light of the development of global dynamics', which obviously means that they are doomed; the little piece about random acts of discrimination, when the most scandalous discrimination is directed at Europeans, on their own soil; that about growth, with no mention ever being made of purchasing power and consumption, of the explosion in the number of poor workers or of the responsibilities of the euro; and, finally, that about 'blessed globalisation', which is an oxymoron.
Your eternal solution is to have yet more Europe.
Really, you deserve to fail!
in writing. I and my British Conservative colleagues have supported this motion for a resolution as we have always been supportive of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy to enhance Europe's competitiveness and the development of a dynamic and innovative economy, improve labour market flexibility and promote deregulation in the EU.
We also support the call for Member States to refrain from protectionism.
We believe that this resolution broadly supports these aims.
This does not mean that we endorse the entire list of detailed policy measures listed in the resolution.
Rather we are supportive of the broad thrust of what we believe to be the liberalising effect of the text, which is absolutely overdue.
in writing. I am particularly supportive of the amendment which calls for the promotion of ILO core labour standards and decent work agenda.
Further, I support the avoidance of environmental dumping as a crucial element of fair competition.
Social and environmental aspects must be built into trade development.
in writing. The 2010 deadline of achieving the Lisbon goal of becoming the most dynamic and knowledge-based economy in the world is looming.
Part of this goal is about getting more women back into the workplace.
During the Barcelona Summit of 2002 agreement was reached by Member States that by 2010 a third of children under three and 90% of children aged three to six would be provided with childcare places.
Apparently only five Member States have achieved this goal.
If we want more women to enjoy the freedom of work we need to have the availability of quality and affordable childcare as a key political priority.
I voted against the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe presenting ideas for the 2007 spring Council in relation to the Lisbon Strategy.
Indeed, two paragraphs that I considered crucial have been adopted by my fellow Members, even though I feel that they go against my European convictions.
Firstly, the European Parliament has agreed to support the policy permitting the private funding of universities and to encourage the private sector to give its verdict on market needs regarding education and training.
This measure may lead to a form of competition between universities, which could compromise equality in university education.
Furthermore, the European Parliament has decided to ask the Member States to review the ineffective social models in the light of their long-term financial viability, of developing global dynamics and of demographic trends, with the aim of making these social models more sustainable.
In my view, this amounts to nothing more and nothing less than a blatant threat to our social security systems.
Merely because of these two options, I decided, contrary to my convictions, to vote against this resolution.
The joint resolution on the Lisbon Strategy by the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, social democrats and liberals adopted by the European Parliament proves once again the agreement between the political spokesmen of capital on promoting their strategic choices.
The priority of euro-unifying capital is the effective and fast promotion of the guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, which expresses its ambition to increase its profits, so that it can be imposed on monopoly competition through a barbaric attack on all the rights earned by the working classes.
The objectives of the strategy of capital loyally applied by the New Democracy government, with the support of PASOK, are set out in the resolution; in other words, the advent of capital in the sectors of health, welfare and education, through public private partnerships, the position of research in serving the monopolies, the liberalisation and commercialisation of energy, the restructuring of employment relations and the abolition of the social insurance system.
Particular importance is attached to adjusting the education system to the needs of the competitiveness of capital.
The Greek Communist Party group in the European Parliament voted against the resolution and calls on the working classes to step up its fight against all the anti-grassroots policies of the ÎU and its 'centre right' and 'centre left' governments and to claim permanent, stable employment with rights, a national social insurance and health system and free state education.
in writing. (SV) The proposal contains quite a few constructive proposals concerning the importance of increased competition and improved conditions for enterprise and innovation.
However, the Lisbon process must be regarded primarily as a national matter, which is why it is unfortunate that Parliament is getting involved in a number of areas that it is for the individual Member States to decide on.
For example, the report discusses how the Member States are to organise their social insurance and how they are to guarantee that everyone who leaves school is offered work or can take advantage of measures aimed at making them employable.
I am therefore voting against this resolution.
The text adopted today, which follows on from the Commission communication on the Community's policy on the radio spectrum, is rather contradictory in some areas as it creates the impression of bringing together ideologically opposed positions.
The report contains proposals aimed, inter alia, at safeguarding public service(s); maintaining a certain, possibly high, level of national sovereignty when it comes to managing the spectrum; transferring some of the benefits arising from the new technologies to the least developed regions; recovering frequencies for the public domain where they are not used in accordance with the commitments made; protecting public interests and frequencies of strategic importance; and maintaining high levels of quality in 'services of public or general interest'.
It also makes a point, however, of welcoming the Commission's proposal to introduce a market-based approach to the spectrum and to establish a clear legal framework providing for competition-based solutions.
Ultimately, despite its good intentions, it gives the green light to pursuing neoliberal policies and to worshipping at the altar of the market, which will jeopardise the provision of public services.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report as it argues for fair and non-discriminatory access to spectrum and maintains that all technologies should be treated the same.
A combined approach to the management of the spectrum, in order to achieve greater flexibility and market reponsiveness, will contribute to social and economic benefits arising from its use.
in writing. I would like to support the rapporteur in attempting to address the serious concerns over efforts to exclude broadcasting frequencies from the proposals, in particular regarding the digital dividend which will become available following switchovers to digital broadcasting.
There is a need to push broadcasters to use spectrum efficiently.

External dimension of the fight against terrorism (debate)
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, international terrorism is the most dangerous threat to peace, security, human dignity and integrity.
Being an invisible enemy, which is geographically diffuse, and which can be found inside and outside of our borders, it needs to be fought in a way that is different to the way the European Union has had to fight its enemies in the past.
The European Union's anti-terrorist strategy must be global, multilateral and based on the United Nations system.
Any unilateral and exclusively military response is doomed to failure.
The fight against terrorism will be won in the field of values.
It is therefore crucial, in order to defeat terrorism morally, to increase the awareness of it and mobilise our public opinion.
We must at no point lower our guard.
We must not just react following a massive attack, but rather we should act in a permanent and proactive manner.
A strengthened CFSP is vital to our success.
This means making improvements, providing better resources and better coordination amongst European intelligence and information services and more work on uncovering terrorism's funding channels.
In its external actions, the Union must focus on stopping certain States providing support for terrorist groups, through coercive measures and sanctions, and it must help weak States to strengthen their institutions and their democracy in order to prevent them from harbouring terrorists.
Madam President, preserving the rule of law and human rights in the fight against terrorism is not just absolutely crucial for moral reasons.
It is the raison d'etre of our strategy, because that is precisely what the terrorists want to destroy: the values on which our co-existence is based.
If we give ground in this area, as in the case of the Iraq War, GuantÃ¡namo, Abu Ghraib or the illegal CIA flights, we will be providing the terrorists with excuses, which they will try to use as justification, and we will be fuelling their activities.
Restricting fundamental rights does not create more security, but rather more fear.
We need free societies that feel secure in themselves.
Fearful societies have already lost the fight against terrorism.
The security/freedom dilemma is a false one.
We will be safer if we are freer, more open and more inclusive.
Prevention, which is so important and which failed both on 11 September in New York and on 11 March in Madrid, is crucial, as is greater efficiency in police and judicial action.
Our CFSP must contribute to eradicating the fertile ground upon which international terrorism thrives.
Terrorism is never justifiable.
We must never talk about causes, but rather the circumstances that feed it, the first of which is the humiliation and disdain suffered by millions of Muslims, which they perceive as arrogance on the part of the West, and the exacerbation of endemic conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Another is the disrespectful treatment of a religion that is followed peacefully by more than 1 300 million people throughout the world.
We are dealing with fundamentalist fanatics, who are dogmatic, but not a particular religion or belief.
We sometimes forget that there have been more Muslim victims of Islamist terrorism than Western victims.
This explains the international success of initiatives such as the Alliance of Civilisations, adopted by the United Nations, in opposition to the clash of civilisations advocated by fundamentalists from one side or another.
As well as better resources, international terrorism must be beaten by means of intelligence and tenacity, not by means of inflammatory speeches that only demonstrate fundamental weakness.
Fascism, firstly, and then Stalinism, decades later, were defeated in the ideological field, without surrendering the principles that lie at the heart of our societies, including freedom of expression exercised in a responsible manner.
My report places particular emphasis on recognising the victims as principal actors, to whom the public powers must listen.
We therefore have four direct victims of the massive attack of 11 March in Madrid in the gallery. JesÃºs RamÃ­rez Castanedo, JesÃºs Abril Escusa, Isabel Casanova Ortega and Euclides Antonio RÃ­o Grajales.
I would like to thank them very much for being here.
Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I would like to thank your House's Committee on Foreign Affairs, and your rapporteur Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, for the report on the external dimension of the fight against terrorism, which has been presented today.
It is a comprehensive report and discusses a number of extremely important issues on which we are largely of one mind.
The terrorist threat is now, more than ever, international in character, and the measures taken by the European Union to overcome it can, in fact, be successful only if they form part of a coordinated global effort at combating terrorism.
At its meeting in December 2005, the European Council adopted an anti-terrorism strategy for the European Union in which the general outline of the European Union's anti-terrorist measures is marked out, and, at the same meeting, adopted the European Union's strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment for terrorist purposes, in both of which documents the external dimension of anti-terrorist activity is exhaustively discussed.
There are three important points that I would like to highlight as regards terrorism's external aspects, namely radicalisation and recruitment, cooperation with external partners and the international legal framework.
Firstly, the principal object of the anti-terrorist strategy consists in preventing people from resorting to terrorism, and action must also be taken to deal with the factors that can help to radicalise people and make them susceptible to recruitment by terrorist organisations.
In its foreign policy measures directed against terrorism, the EU has continued to endeavour to consider every possible issue connected with radicalisation and recruitment, and has shared with its external partners its experience and best practices in dealing with the problem.
The European Union has also broken new ground in including anti-radicalisation measures in a special technical aid programme for combating terrorism.
Meetings featuring dialogue between religions and cultures have been held as part of the ASEM process and the Barcelona process, and under the auspices of the Anna Lindh Foundation; the EU has also set up working parties to discuss in depth how it might improve its public diplomacy and its contacts with Islam both within the EU and outside it, and we want to continue to move this forward in a determined manner.
Radicalisation and recruitment will also continue to be addressed in future programmes of technical support in combating terrorism and will remain an important feature of the dialogue with third countries.
Secondly, there is cooperation with external partners, and, in pursuing its objectives in the field of anti-terrorism, we have continued to collaborate closely with partners outside the European Union.
The political dialogue with partners is an essential component in the European Union's foreign policy action against terrorism, and the status of respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while at the same time combating terrorism as key issues in it reminds me of the debate we had this morning, in which there was a high degree of unanimity.
A considerable amount of work has been done with a number of countries in order to improve cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
The European Union and the Member States have agreed to provide technical anti-terrorist support to certain countries that are to be regarded as high-priority cases, and progress has been made in political consultations with others of their kind.
The European Union has also helped to build up capacity at regional level, for example, at the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC) in Indonesia and the African Union's anti-terrorism centre in Algiers.
We continue to attach high priority to anti-terrorist cooperation with the United States.
Politicians and experts from the European Union and the USA have worked together on intensifying their dialogue, and the EU has extended its dialogue on anti-terrorism issues to include other partner countries such as Israel, Australia, Canada and Russia, as well as those that participate with it in the Europe-Mediterranean Partnership, in considering areas of common interest and options for cooperation, notably the provision of technical assistance to other countries.
Thirdly, in the international legal framework, the European Union has continued to press for a key role to be given to the United Nations in the combating of terrorism.
Since the adoption of a comprehensive agreement on international terrorism, including a clear and unambiguous definition of it in all its forms and manifestations, would indeed send an important signal and would show the international community taking determined action to counter the terrorist threat, the European Union will continue to make every effort to reach international consensus on one.
The recent adoption of a United Nations strategy, with the aim of stepping up international cooperation with third countries in combating terrorism also represents an important advance, and the European Union is prepared to join with all other states belonging to the United Nations in implementing it; this is one of its priorities for the future, and it intends to make use of its dialogue with external partners to press for the implementation of this strategy across the board, as also for an exchange of ideas as to how this goal might best be achieved.
I believe that your House would, by bringing this issue to the attention of your partners in dialogue in third countries, be making a supremely valuable contribution to achieving that goal.
As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the institutions of the European Union are largely agreed on the priorities for combating international terrorism.
I can tell your rapporteur that his report and a long-term exchange of views such as that in which we are currently engaged help to deepen our shared understanding and help us to devise suitable measures to combat international terrorism.
It would also send a message to those who have been the victims of terrorist atrocities.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, firstly I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, for his report.
Let there be no doubt: terrorism is a threat to all states and to all peoples.
It is criminal and it is unjustifiable under any circumstances.
The Commission therefore fully shares the view of the report that terrorism constitutes an important threat to security, to peace, stability and the democratic values on which the European Union is founded.
The Commission also shares the objective of combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights.
All anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with both international humanitarian law and international human rights law.
While largely agreeing with the report, I would like to comment on two points.
Firstly, the report is calling for the adoption of a definition of terrorism.
Since the UN has not yet agreed on a definition and since such an agreement still seems distant, although we are working towards that, I would like to recall that relevant universal conventions and protocols already provide a common legal understanding of what constitutes an act of terrorism.
The Union also has a definition of terrorist acts in its framework decision on terrorism.
These are solid legal foundations.
Secondly, the report calls for the extension of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity.
I think we should be cautious, before altering the definition of crimes against humanity included in the ICC Statute.
Such an endeavour might be counter-productive in the efforts to broaden support for the Court.
The complex relationship between international humanitarian law and the definition of terrorism may lead to further complications.
The Commission welcomes the interest of the Parliament on the external aspects of the fight against terrorism.
In the current environment of open borders, efforts to fight against terrorism, internally and externally, are aspects that are closely linked.
It goes without saying that Vice-President Frattini and I are working closely together in order to make these efforts mutually reinforcing.
We strongly agree on the need to support the United Nations consistently with our policy of effective multilateralism.
Equally, the emphasis put on prevention is very important for the Commission.
Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism need to be tackled.
Tackling the root causes of terrorism lies at the heart of our external policies, and the report's recommendations for a more coherent and effective EU policy also largely go in the right direction.
Let me highlight the important contribution that the Commission makes to the fight against terrorism.
Firstly, with Member States, the Commission is implementing the 2005 EU counter-terrorism strategy, of which our colleague and President has talked.
Terrorism also features regularly during meetings with our partners and in international organisations.
For example, as I speak, a major meeting is under way with Commission participation in Berlin in order to prepare the Heiligendamm Summit of the G8 in the areas of terrorism and organised crime.
Secondly, the Commission is an important provider of capacity-building assistance to some 80 third countries aimed at improving governance and administrative capacities in related areas.
A number of priority fields mentioned in the report, such as border management and terrorist financing, are priorities for Community assistance.
Thirdly, the Commission is working in new areas which should improve EU action in the fight against terrorism, such as the protection of critical infrastructure, the fight against violent radicalisation and terrorist recruitment, bioterrorism, radiological threats, explosive detection technologies, terrorist use of the internet, as well as terrorism in the context of crisis management, and there are obvious links to our efforts in fighting organised crime and drug trafficking.
Afghanistan is, for instance, a serious case in point.
Finally, and in reply to one of the requests of this report, the Commission wishes to confirm that it intends to produce a communication in the course of 2007 focusing on global and trans-regional security challenges.
The focus will include key aspects relevant to human security and focus on counter-terrorism.
You may be aware of my personal commitment to support the human security discourse.
What better way could there be to address conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism than to promote both freedom from fear and freedom from want.
Despite what is being done, I think we can all agree that we must work together and enhance our collective performance in fighting against terrorism.
We will try to play our part, but we are certain that the collective effort with Parliament will be a more important one.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the task, on behalf of the Committee on Development, of drafting an opinion on this report on the external dimension of the fight against terrorism, which was drafted by my colleague, Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
We can only talk about this issue by adopting an approach that encompasses our development policies, for the benefit of the countries of the South, in particular.
As uncompromising as it certainly is, this opinion highlights a series of crucial points, which have already been addressed in this House, concerning the very definition of terrorism, respect for human rights and relations with the various migrant populations of Europe, in particular.
This opinion also deals with the issue of the difficult coexistence between the fight against terrorism and the need to safeguard respect for human rights in all circumstances, so that no one can justify the denial of the one for the sake of the other.
Our report then goes on to raise the issue of the fight against terrorism from the perspective of the repercussions that its funding methods may have on the quality and effectiveness of European development cooperation.
Thus, we highlight, for example, the fact that, currently, a large number of measures adopted by the Member States that do not come directly under a policy for reducing poverty in the countries of the South have sadly been included in official development aid. These include, for example, the funding of military investments, the repatriation of illegal immigrants, some immigration policy-related expenditure, and I could go on.
The Committee on Development also wishes to draw our Parliament's attention to the fact that, by including in official development aid financial support for a range of activities connected with the fight against terrorism, we will merely be further compromising its main objective, which is to eradicate poverty.
This opinion was adopted by nearly all of the members of the Committee on Development, on 6 November.
However, the majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs sadly did not think it worthwhile to adopt any of the paragraphs in this opinion.
That is why we have decided to re-introduce the main thrusts of this text, in the form of amendments to the report, and I therefore call on all of the democratic groups to endorse them so that, alongside the necessary fight against terrorism, we can carry out effective development policies aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which represent the real long-term - even very long-term - solution to terrorism and to all the suffering that it leaves in its disastrous wake.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (ES) The fight against terrorism is a priority that requires solidarity from all of the Member States and commitment from the democratic countries.
Security is a genuine fundamental right that cannot be exercised at any expense, but in strict accordance with the law and respect for human rights. International terrorism threatens human rights and freedoms.
The sinister distinction between murdering terrorists and political terrorists, between armed wings and political wings, only makes the whole thing even more criminal to the detriment of the law.
To hold dialogue of any kind with terrorists is unfair, pointless and offensive to the victims.
The Member States must pay particular attention to promoting intercultural relations and enhancing inter-religious dialogue amongst the members of civil society, with a view to improving co-existence, tolerance and mutual understanding.
The Union must rationalise, coordinate and facilitate the actions of its instruments, Europol, Eurojust, Cepol and the Situation Centre, and others pursuing the same aims, in order to detect and prevent links between terrorism and other forms of crime.
I would ask, Madam President, when drawing up prevention strategies, that the horrendous experiences of the victims be respected and taken into account in particular, as I say in my report.
The victims must be acknowledged and protected.
Terrorists begin to lose when the victims make the truth of their experiences known and society listens to them.
With regard to prevention, Madam President, prevention cannot and must not be used as a missile amongst democratic countries and States.
The last time prevention failed was on 30 December 2006 in Madrid.
We do not criticise failures in prevention. We work hard to ensure that they never happen again.
I shall draw to a close, Madam President.
We will only be able to tackle terrorism with determination when all of the democratic countries, together, and the Union in the singular, have a clear view of the threat, and the threat is lethal, permanent and destined to remain with us.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating you, Madam President, on your office as Vice-President, in which capacity you represent the region of Eastern Westphalia-Lippe, from which we both come, and that is cause for pride.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and point out that terrorism is a cross-border phenomenon.
We will succeed in countering it only if cross-border cooperation is in place within the European Union and with the states and organisations outside it.
Putting this in place is often a slow business, particularly if we consider the internal policy aspect of our shared security problem, which is still arranged between the states, and that is why implementing the positions of the individual Member States can sometimes be very laborious.
That is evidence of the fact that, if we want to be more secure against terrorism and organised crime, we need the European Constitution as a more effective means of making obligations in the common sphere more binding and improving the decision-making process.
Along with close cooperation between the security bodies, it is also urgently necessary that the causes of terrorism be addressed.
There may be no justification for terrorism, but it does have its causes, to which we have to give our attention, and I see political, economic and social issues as being of great significance here.
There must also be no more token gestures of a certain kind.
If it were to be possible, for a joint effort, for example by way of the Quartet, to resolve the Middle East issue, that would take much of the wind out of terrorism's sails.
I cite that as only one example of the interconnections that exist in this area.
Something that is apparent from the report, and that I find most especially important, is the need for us to make use of inter-cultural dialogue.
We have to make it clear to people in the other regions of the world, too, that we value their culture, their religion, and their development as equal to our own, if such causes of dissension are not to arise from feelings of cultural inferiority.
That is a particular duty.
All these things have to be done in accordance with the rule of law and with respect for our values, for, if we surrender the latter, the other side will have won, and that is why we have to take our values and the rule of law as our shield.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, terrorist acts are always criminal, but terrorism is also always a political project.
I think its current manifestation aims to subvert the humanitarian values of equality, whether it be between gender, religion or nationality.
It also seeks to undermine civil rights - the civil rights of a plural democracy.
But we have to be very careful in expressing those values.
If we choose to call them 'our' values rather than treating them as universal values, I think we will fall into the trap of the 'clash of civilisations'.
Our best defence of those values, therefore, has to be primarily political.
We must demonstrate the strength of those values by ensuring freedom and quality of life for all in Europe and globally.
Security measures certainly have to be applied: the collection of intelligence, the prosecution of lawbreakers and, indeed, the prevention and prosecution of incitement to hatred and violence.
But the Fava report, which we spent a long time discussing this morning, indicates what can go badly wrong if we are not extremely careful.
We have to avoid simplistic analysis.
We have to avoid the assumption that every political or religious fundamentalist is a terrorist - that is simply not true, and I think it is important that we bear that in mind.
I know lots of fundamentalist Catholics who would be appalled at the idea that anybody would commit a terrorist act in their name.
I would appeal for deeper analysis than we are currently getting, and caution about the language we are using.
I would argue that, if we are going to be successful, we have to deal with inequalities on our continent, but also inequalities globally as well.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against global manifestations of terrorism is a decisive test of democratic Europe's capacity to act.
In order to pre-empt and prevent brutal acts of terrorism, the special services must be able to make use of the most effective preventive and repressive methods, and this is unthinkable without international cooperation.
The report by Mr Fava contains a lot of criticism of the United States, but we must realise that we need even closer cooperation between the European Union and the USA as compared with that to date, that it is necessary for the USA and Europe to take united common action against the ideological causes of terrorism, and that we need a closer exchange of information, based on mutual trust.
The European Parliament and the members of the national parliaments of the Member States also need to be involved in a more focused and professional way in the drafting and implementation of the general strategy on terrorism, and active cooperation between the Member States' services must be fostered.
In carrying out parliamentary supervision, we must ensure greater professionalism and political responsibility, especially when monitoring the lawfulness of the methods used in counter-terrorism measures.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Firstly, I would like to welcome Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo's efforts to tackle an issue which is complex and which is often subject to debates that have more to do with party politics than the fundamental issues.
But above all I would like to thank him for showing great sensitivity towards at least three of the issues that our group considers to be important.
The first has also been mentioned by the Commissioner, and relates to the problem of the definition.
The first significant problem facing us is the fact that it will be difficult for the European Union to combat terrorism in a consistent and credible fashion unless we have a definition.
Although it is true that there are many, shall we say, differing opinions on this matter, we would like to make a concrete proposal, and that is to work on the basis of the proposal which was presented and approved within the United Nations on the proposal of the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in turn on the proposal of the High-Level Group.
We therefore already have certain significant proposals on the table on which to base our work.
The second element of concern to us, of course, relates to the fact that the supposed fight against terrorism is often used to justify wars, massacres and torture.
We saw that this morning when we discussed the Fava report, and elsewhere.
That is what cannot be allowed to happen.
We therefore also applaud, welcome and support the proposal to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity within the context of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, so that that Court can deal with them as well.
Finally, another issue that we believe to be important is that, with regard to the existence of anti-terrorist lists, which have often proven to be counterproductive for certain peace processes in the world, it is also necessary to bear in mind that the current situation, on the one hand, sometimes leads to arbitrary detentions, and on the other, it hinders the efforts being made by the European Union in situations such as the Middle East, Sri Lanka, etc. Therefore, the issue of anti-terrorist lists should also at least be revised and studied, on the basis of what has been approved by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, I have to say, Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, that your speech was markedly better than your report, a certain amount of material in which was, I am aware, whispered in your ear, and it is regrettable that the Committee on Development's opinion was not also adopted.
Terrorism, of any kind, is utterly unacceptable, but it is unfortunate that the report provides us with no concrete definition of what terrorism is, although it always talks in terms of 'international terrorism'.
There exists the widest possible variety of groups, which, for the most diverse reasons, believe that they have to commit terrorist acts.
We have to consider each of them individually and establish just why they come to the erroneous conclusion that terrorist acts are necessary.
It also appears to me that whole subjects have been left out completely - state-sponsored terrorism, for example.
What about France's past attack on the Greenpeace ship?
As a number of Members have already said, we have to address the causes of terrorism.
At the moment, the Western states are engaged in a war on terror - in Afghanistan and Iraq - that is proving to be completely counter-productive, for while this war is being waged, terrorism is on the increase rather than declining.
We read in the report that measures are to be made more stringent in all manner of ways, and that fundamental rights are to be more and more eroded, and it is for that reason that we cannot endorse it.
We have therefore submitted a minority report on the subject.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the rapporteur is absolutely right to mention the medium of the high-speed and global Internet as being part of the phenomenon of international terrorism, but he does so in a paradoxical fashion.
While paragraph 12 appeals to the European Union to fight the misuse of the Internet for terrorist purposes, in paragraph 17, the rapporteur highlights the scope the Internet offers to trace, and thus resist, this self-same evil.
At the moment, the growing number of Islamic terror websites are already demanding our urgent attention, for these form the virtual recruitment and training grounds of young Jihadists in Europe.
Allow me to quote the European intelligence service: 'these days, it is possible to become a terrorist simply by the information on the Internet'.
Indeed, no more than a simple mouse-click is enough.
This terrifying reality demands an intensive and cohesive European approach, and, mark my words, both internally and externally.
Hence my request to the Commission and Council to provide this House with more factual information, given the intense threat emanating from terrorist websites, of which it is estimated that there are already some 4 500 Internet pages, in an attempt to trace them and indeed, to fight them in an effective manner and at European level.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, when this House discusses the fight against terrorism, there is the risk of us promptly falling back on politically correct commonplaces which hamper effective policy, or even make it impossible.
As the report rightly suggests, international terrorism currently represents the biggest threat to peace and stability in open societies, and the most direct threat to freedom, security and human dignity.
International terrorism has declared war on the whole of the western world, and that includes Europe.
It is therefore of the utmost importance for us to clearly identify this threat.
When I read in recital A of the report words such as 'international terrorism and the associated ideology', then I fear that we are going the wrong way.
Terrorism is not an ideology in itself, and neither is it a goal in itself.
As the chairman of the Arab television station al-Arabiya asserted a few years ago, it is a painful reality that these days, although not all Muslims are terrorists, all terrorists are Muslim.
It is a witticism which, like all witticisms, contains a grain of truth.
It is fashionable in Europe to say that we do not want a Clash of Civilisations, but whether we like it or not, this Clash of Civilisations is in full swing.
We must continue to fight poverty, and, of course, give our support, but we should not be naÃ¯ve in thinking that this will also fully address terrorism.
The perpetrators of the attacks in New York, London and Madrid were not poor; quite on the contrary, they were middle-class and highly educated.
It would therefore be in the EU's interest to introduce democratic ideas, including the free expression of opinion, into the Islamic world.
What should really be established over there on a big scale is a kind of Radio Freedom.
Is this a plea to stigmatise all Muslims?
Not at all.
What is important, though, is that within Islam, such things as self-criticism and introspection should be promoted.
