We aim to make it easier to create the right business environment.
The Competitiveness Council will meet before the Spring Summit in March in order to do the groundwork on items relating to entrepreneurship and competitiveness.
The emphasis will be on promoting innovative ways to speed up the application of the European small business charter and evaluate the policies applied and on an in-depth discussion of the Green Paper on entrepreneurship.
Research, technology, knowledge and education are proving to be key factors in competitiveness, development and quality of life nowadays.
Investment in research and technology could be encouraged by adopting a Community patent and developing research into cutting edge technologies, which could also include defence research.
Along the same lines, we hope to guarantee an information society for all, by using open standards, making networks and services interoperable and ensuring the eEurope programme has adequate funding.
More and more Union policies are taking account of the need to develop education systems which respond to the potential of the new economy.
Using new communication and information technologies and lifelong learning as basic springboards for upgrading the education system, by which I mean typical, atypical and vocational training, training for special groups and teacher training, are an important priority in this sector.
Another item which I should like to add to this list and which is currently the subject of debate, is the re-use of public records.
As I am sure you know, the Council has yet to reach political agreement here.
Nonetheless, we are sure that we shall make satisfactory progress on this item during the first half of the year if we keep up our efforts and that we shall be able to put this item to bed with Parliament's help.
We are keen to receive Parliament's opinion on this.
Another major issue is employment and social cohesion.
The reform of the European Employment Strategy is a very important issue for the presidency.
The Spring Summit will address the overall orientation of this strategy, the final objective being to adopt the strategy at the Thessalonika Summit.
We believe that the social pillar of the Lisbon process is every bit as important as economic reform.
Our priority is to streamline the Employment Strategy.
However, we also need to step up our efforts to create more and better jobs, to reinforce and streamline active employment policies and to encourage entrepreneurship.
This is even more important in the current macroeconomic climate.
The equal participation of women in the labour market, increasing the percentage of women in work, striking a balance between flexibility and job security, integrating immigrants and reducing regional disparities in employment and unemployment, especially through action in isolated regions, are all on our agenda.
As far as modernising economic policy and employment policies is concerned, we support the need for autonomy, coordination and complementarity between the two processes, with employment issues being dealt with mainly by the Employment and Social Affairs Council and economic policy by ECOFIN.
The presidency believes this will make policies more coherent and efficient and increase employment.
We shall also be working to ensure the Social Summit held in the run-up to the Spring Summit is a success and to improve the standard of its work and its output.
We are being called on to oil the wheels of the Union's legislative machine by pushing agreements through on a series of issues, including working conditions for temporary workers, extending Regulation No 1408/1971 to third country nationals, setting up the Tripartite Social Summit and the European health insurance card.
In the third area, sustainable development, we shall be focusing on revising the Union's strategy on sustainable development at the Spring Summit in 2003 on the basis of the outcome of the World Summit in Johannesburg.
This is our chance to show the world the Union's role in protecting the environment and adopt policies that combine development with environmental protection and quality of life.
The Spring Summit will give us a chance to set out our basic strategic approach to balanced sustainable development and set specific targets that will act as an incentive to further progress.
We shall be working to achieve the objective of sustainable development by revising the European Union's sustainable development strategy, by ensuring economic development does not plunder natural resources and cause ecological damage and by applying the outcomes of the Johannesburg Summit.
Priority will be given to the ten-year framework programmes for sustainable production and consumption, that is, clean technologies, raw material and energy savings, initiatives on and the procedure for mainstreaming the environmental dimension in international and Community policies and actions, implementing the action plan to remove obstacles to the development of environmental technologies and developing a global strategy on chemicals.
I should like to point out, again on the subject of sustainable development, that priority will be given in the shipping sector to examining safety at sea, mainly in connection with preventing maritime pollution following the disaster involving the Prestige, where we shall be endeavouring to keep to the timetable for examining this legislative proposal.
We shall also be examining the proposal for a directive on access to port services at second reading.
Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to close my statement by assuring you that we shall be making every effort during the Greek Presidency both to confirm that we have confidence in and intend to abide by the Lisbon strategy and to streamline the process, especially in the current economic climate, with enlargement imminent and ten new Member States waiting to join.
My statement has covered the basic points and actions relating to Lisbon process issues and the spring Council.
The presidency is looking forward to fruitful dialogue with Parliament and we hope that, by working constructively with the European Parliament and the Commission, we shall help create a more productive, more competitive and more socially just Europe.
I should like to take the opportunity to welcome to the diplomatic tribune this morning the chairman and his deputies of the delegation of the Russian National Assembly to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee who are here for a Bureau meeting.
I welcome Mr Vladimir Lukin and his colleagues.
.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, ladies and gentlemen, one month ago I presented our Spring Report to you and, today, I am here to listen and to discuss the main points in the report.
This strategy is already bringing positive results, but we are still not harnessing the Union's full potential in terms of growth and innovation.
Of course, this phase of the economic cycle is not helping us, as Mr Yiannitsis said, nor is the current international political situation.
On top of the endogenous causes of Europe's economic slowdown are the uncertainties and fears associated with the risk of a conflict and the difficulty of ascertaining the timeframes and consequences.
This continues to have a considerable impact on the overall strategies and individual decisions of enterprises and investors.
There is a prevailing sense of insecurity.
Clearly, this situation will continue until we are in a new phase that offers brighter prospects, which is vital for new business and investment strategies.
The issues we are discussing today are of the utmost importance for Europe's future and for the type of Union we want to leave future generations, but the Iraq crisis is, of course, uppermost in our minds.
I am still convinced that war is not inevitable and I continue to hope it can be avoided
by applying strict, stringent controls to the Iraqi dictatorship and, at the same time, maintaining and strengthening the international alliance against terrorism.
At this time, we must all strive to find common ground so Europe's diplomats can take action.
No one can predict the consequences of a conflict.
Military intervention, even under the United Nations - the only legitimate framework for any action to counter threats to world peace and security - must remain a last resort, to be used only after all other options have been found to be impracticable.
If war breaks out, it must mean that all political options have been exhausted.
This crisis highlights the contradiction between the need for joint action from Europe, which is the basis for the work of the Convention, and the total lack of a European common policy. This is a problem which affects us all directly.
Yet if Europe fails to pull together, all the individual States will disappear from the world scene.
Unless Europe speaks with a single voice, it will be impossible to continue working closely with the United States on an ongoing basis while retaining our dignity.
And unless Europe and the United States work together, it will be impossible to preserve world peace and stability.
It is the behaviour people see in times of crisis that they remember and take as a model, an example for the future.
At such times, trust is won or lost.
What is at stake is our determination to make Europe an influential leading player on the world stage with its own values and traditions, its interests and its vision of the world.
Today, both the old and the new Member States need to show and apply that determination, committing themselves to the common cause in the knowledge that they are helping to create a political player that will keep faith with its allies and be mindful of its responsibilities and role in the world.
In the current international context, which is by no means favourable to economic recovery, we need to show greater political will and coherence if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives and fulfil the pledges we gave at EU summits in practical terms.
Indeed, I am convinced that the Lisbon Strategy is the best way, even in the current circumstances, to bring our citizens greater prosperity and greater social cohesion.
It is also the only strategy that can bring a strong recovery and ensure these benefits are sustainable for future generations.
It is my - and the Commission's - fundamental task to continue, steadfastly and tenaciously, to give more impetus to the implementation of our strategy.
I wrote to the Heads of State and Government to this effect about three months ago, drawing attention to certain points I consider necessary for the success of the forthcoming Spring Council.
I know I can rely on the Greek Presidency's backing in this, as was clear from what you said just now, Minister.
The gap between political objectives and legislation I referred to a year ago has now been narrowed to a certain extent, but only to a certain extent.
Progress has been made in energy, financial services, the Single Sky and research.
Nevertheless, more political determination is needed to get things moving on the Community patent, which has now become a symbol of the Union's ability - or inability - to achieve its goals.
We must also achieve satisfactory agreements on the Directives on take-over bids, the prospectus and pension funds.
In addition, we need to review the European Employment Strategy.
In this regard, the Commission welcomes the proposal put forward by a number of countries for a task force of high-level experts to assist it in its work.
At the initiative of Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whom I would like to thank heartily for taking this on, the task force will be set up as soon as possible.
Above all, however, we must bridge the gap between Community legislation adopted and its implementation at national level.
The number of decisions adopted but not yet transposed into national law is still too large - and, quite frankly, it is actually increasing - in the field of reforms connected with the Single Market, employment and social protection.
Ladies and gentlemen, in view of these considerations, my message to you today, the message which, in the light of today's debate, I intend to deliver to the Spring Council, is this: Europe can still succeed.
Europe can meet the challenge of modernisation and innovation and it can show that the European economic and social model is a model example for the world.
Those objectives, however, cannot be met without far-reaching changes in our societies. Far-reaching changes that call for political decisions, a shared outlook and rules.
Let us not delude ourselves that market mechanisms or the pride of researchers and scientists suffice to meet the challenge of modernisation: what are needed are decisions we agree on and a common will.
Each year's Spring Council is also a time to look at the economic strategy, what we call the governance of Economic and Monetary Union.
Our fellow citizens need to understand the nature of our project and how our monitoring and decision-making system functions, how it uses all the instruments available to us today, in particular the Broad Guidelines for Economic Policies, the Employment Strategy and the Internal Market Strategy.
We need to explain that these instruments, together with the Stability and Growth Pact, form a coherent and effective whole.
This is the aim of our recent proposals for a new interpretation of the criteria for applying the Stability Pact. This interpretation pays more attention to the different economic situation of each country and the need to finance the reforms planned under the Lisbon Strategy.
Lastly I feel it is important today to stress our action in the field of education, research and innovation as well.
This calls for governments to reform their regulatory and tax frameworks to eliminate the obstacles to establishing and developing enterprises.
The Commission will do its part: to this end, we have just adopted an action plan to simplify and update the Community acquis, making it clearer and more precise.
Encouraging changes in the way research is organised and opening it up is the basic aim of the European Research Area.
Exploiting the advantages that a shared vision - a genuine common research culture - can bring in universities and enterprises is vital to this end.
Over and above the economic aspects, we must not, indeed, neglect the social impact, particularly in terms of jobs created, participation and cohesion, that a coherent education and research strategy can yield.
Our national education systems may differ widely but they are all faced with clear challenges, and these can only be met if we tackle them together.
Thus, the work programme on the matter up to 2010 needs to be implemented quickly and coherently to make our education systems more effective and more coordinated.
That means we must invest better and invest more in research and education.
In this regard, we cannot put off establishing major scientific centres of excellence at European level any longer if we want to make Europe an absolute world leader in research.
This is a line we have been exploring for many months and I believe that it is now time to proceed with it and place it on the table, for if we cannot attract the best brains on the planet we will certainly not be able to put the Lisbon Strategy into effect. According to the Lisbon Strategy, we have to be world leaders.
In order to be world leaders, we have to have the best brains in the world. We will only be able to attract the best brains in the world if we have major research centres which are the best in the world.
It is a simple, ambitious strategy, which the Commission is going to propose not least because I believe that, without it, we will have no chance of achieving the goals we ourselves have set.
If we genuinely, seriously want to lay the foundations for a knowledge-based society, we must, lastly, and this is my last point, take the target literally from now on and invest 3% of GDP in research. This too is a goal we ourselves set.
If, however, we look at the budgets of the various Member States, we see that, this year, there has been a shift away rather than towards the figure of 3%.
Therefore, either we change the goals or we must endeavour to pursue them consistently.
This is the goal and there is no getting away from it: we said 3%, and 3% means 3%. There is no leeway.
Lastly, it is not just a matter of spending more but of spending better, as regards both research and education.
I would point out that we cannot afford to let one young person out of five abandon their studies without obtaining a qualification. These are human resources which are a drain on our society.
This means we must rethink the way we prepare our young people for the labour market and the world of industry, which are growing tougher by the day.
Unless we take these practical steps, we will not be able to make up for the lost time we regret.
Building a knowledge-based society is the only way to become a world leader.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we have of course listened with enormous interest to the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, and, if I may summarise, it was concerned with two issues.
Firstly, how to restore confidence in the Lisbon strategy and how to improve the efficiency of its implementation.
Mr President, that is at the very heart of the matter.
I also think that now is a good time to make this analysis, because the realisation of the Lisbon objectives is under very great strain.
In addition, the circumstances have become much more difficult, the economic climate is unfavourable, uncertainties have increased and, as the President of the Commission rightly says, entrepreneurship is extraordinarily difficult at this time.
My group therefore welcomes the evaluation report from the Commission.
The report offers insight into the achievements of the Member States over the last couple of years with regard to implementing the Lisbon objectives.
I must say, however, that the picture is disconcerting.
We see extraordinarily sluggish implementation by the Member States and vast disparities in implementation.
That also means that the credibility of the Council with regard to the implementation of Lisbon has taken a tremendous blow.
You were not wrong when you said that it is necessary to restore confidence.
Confidence can only be restored, however, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if we put an end to the fine words and magnificent plans and actually concentrate on implementation.
Therein lies the main problem.
And so we say in our resolution: it is time for the Council and the Commission to come up with a roadmap: a roadmap setting out precisely what tangible aims have to be achieved over which period of time; stating that the Council imposes an obligation to make an effort to actually do that, that EU legislation will be implemented and that this is then very carefully maintained, and that there is a coherent, consistent division of tasks between the European Council and the relevant national ministers, because that is generally lacking.

The Lisbon document raises a large number of issues, some of which do, but most of which do not, fall within the jurisdiction of the European Union, and for these we have the fine term 'open coordination'.
It would be good, however, if we could have much more clear-cut agreement on how to proceed with this open coordination.
As my group sees it, the emphasis would have to be placed on cooperation, on the exchange of best practices, on benchmarking, and also on respecting the role of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament.
Lisbon is not a one-man show involving only the European Council, particularly if one were to now lay its achievements on the table.
Mr President, the economic and budgetary reform process indicated by the Ecofin Council must be continued.
We must then have the courage to take daring decisions.
Then we must also get the debate on the revision of the pension system under way.
We would call for the three-pillar system to be looked at, under which, of course, the solidarity of the state is maintained, along with the solidarity on the part of trade and industry, and of course individual responsibility.
A three-pillar system may, in future, put us in a better position to tackle the problem of an ageing population.
It is true that a large number of obstacles would then have to be removed.
If we argue in favour of more entrepreneurship, we make it possible to achieve that aim of a 25% reduction.
Let us then get down to enacting the European Charter for SMEs, too.
Let us also ensure that something is done about the obstacles to the recognition of educational qualifications.
If we say 3% R&D, where is the timetable enabling us to ensure that that 3% can be achieved by 2010?
It is lacking, so it must be put in place.
We have been discussing patents for such a long time now.
The intellectual elite, says the President of the Commission, must not leave.
Indeed so, but how long will it be before a European patent finally appears?
The credibility of the Council rests on this, and at some stage we must take up a position on it.
It should not be the case that it is constantly being blocked by a number of the national ministers.
Mr President, the knowledge-based economy is key.
However, we no longer have any inkling that a significant part of software development, and all the research in the field of the knowledge-based economy, is currently on its way over to Japan because we in Europe have been consistently unable to establish the 3G sector.
We are already three years behind Japan and, by the time we do bring it in, we will be five years behind.
That is disastrous in a sector like this.
I am therefore making an urgent plea to the Council: do not go on discussing the French proposal to give another six or nine billion back to one operator, but instead give some thought to devising a programme that will enable you to actually make 3G a reality in Europe.
We need it.
To sum up, what is important is not fine words, but deeds, and sending out a strong signal that the Council must actually get down to the business of implementation.

What is important is getting a roadmap, so that we can see, in practical terms, who is going to do what and when.
What is important is having a good working relationship between the different parts of the Council, and between the European Council and the relevant national ministers, because otherwise we will keep muddling along, and then the intellectual elite really will go to the United States and Europe will remain on the sidelines.
Our Europe does not deserve that.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has always been successful when it has been ambitious.
The euro was one of those ambitions, which is providing increasing benefits for citizens.
After thirteen months in actual physical existence, the euro has become the equal of the dollar, and is already the second reserve currency in the world.
Since the European Central Bank has been managing monetary policy, the rate of inflation in the euro zone has remained lower than the American and British rates of inflation.
Long term interest rates are at an historic low in Europe and lower than in the United States.
By pointing out these facts, I am standing against the prevailing euro-scepticism and against the tendency for self-punishment among many of our colleagues.
It is true that Europe has problems: growth has slowed down, some large Member States have mounting deficits and unemployment is rising again.
However, which region in the world does not have problems?
We are told that Europe is suffering as a result of its lack of flexibility and structural deficiencies due to social overprotection.
We are given the example of an American economy which is reportedly more productive and which, thanks to a more flexible labour market, is said to create more jobs.
So what do we see?
American unemployment is higher than in the vast majority of European Member States.
What is more, the American unemployment rate does not count the two million Americans of working age who are in prison.
However there is something more important: productivity per hour is greater in Europe than in the United States, which is evidence of greater efficiency of production and services in Europe.
This efficiency is reflected in international trade, in which the Union is selling nearly twice the volume of American exports.
The United States are accumulating other deficits.
Currently, if the federal budget deficit were evaluated according to the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, it would be between 5% and 6% of the United States GDP.
The reason that I am pointing out these figures is not in order to gloat about them, as the United States are an essential driving force in the world economy.
Europe could take over, as long as it equips itself with the resources to support its ambitions.
The Lisbon Strategy is an ambition that will incite action, but the Member States will have to finally get behind implementing this joint strategy defined in Lisbon and Gothenburg.
The Commission should ensure that all the Member States keep to this strategy as a whole, and not only to a few structural reforms, which are necessary but not sufficient to create the most competitive knowledge and 'well-being' based society in the world.
In this context, Europe needs to rethink its investment strategy.
In 1970, Europe used 4.2% of its GDP for public investments.
Now we have dropped that figure to 2.3%.
I am of the opinion that stability is essential for fighting inflation and public deficits.
It also helps towards defending the purchasing power of the poorest in our societies.
However, in order to have greater growth, we need to invest in infrastructures, research and the knowledge-based society.
We also need to distinguish between investment expenditure and operation expenditure.
Mr President, I will conclude by saying that I have tried to give an optimistic message.
However, if war were necessary, we would all have to take another look.
One of the first victims of this war will certainly be the Stability and Growth Pact, unless Europe refuses to sacrifice growth and employment on the altar of the gods of war.
We therefore need to work to prevent this war in order to preserve growth and employment.
Mr Goebbels, I am sure the logic of that is commendable.
Let me remind colleagues that this afternoon we have a two-hour debate on war and peace issues.
Mr President, I congratulate the President-in-Office on his speech and wish him well with his agenda.
Mr Prodi has outlined the scale of the challenges we face and the measures that are needed; yet it seems to me that if the Union's backbone were as strong as its wishbone this debate might not be necessary.
The list of unresolved economic reform issues on the agenda for the Spring Council makes depressingly familiar reading.
A year ago, ahead of the Barcelona European Council, which one government dubbed the 'make or break summit' for economic reform, the Union was deadlocked over fundamental issues such as the Community Patent, the Take-over Bids Directive and the Pensions Directive.
Ministers were at sixes and sevens over the Stability Pact, having failed to issue early warnings to Germany and Portugal.
Resolving these issues was proclaimed to be the foremost objective of the heads of state and government.
So how much progress have we made, one year on?
On the Community Patent, which Mr Prodi mentioned - no progress.
The best gloss that you can put on the new Take-over Bids Directive is that it is 'a work in progress'.
Far from improving the situation, the Pensions Directive could actually represent a step backwards if adopted in the form currently advocated by Parliament's rapporteur.
And Germany and Portugal have since been joined by France in the rogues' gallery of countries which are falling foul of the Stability Pact.
In the midst of this litany of failure, in step Messrs Blair, Chirac and SchrÃ¶der with another depressing example of letterbox diplomacy.
After highlighting Europe's divisions on Iraq with the 'gang of 8' letter, the UK's Prime Minister has now formed a terrible trio of leaders with Mr Chirac and Mr SchrÃ¶der, who presume to tell other leaders how to reform their economies while blocking economic progress themselves.
To hear a clarion call for economic reform from a British Prime Minister whose continued indecision over joining the euro is hitting jobs, growth and investment, is more than a little galling.
For the President of France to put his name to a letter calling for the rapid completion of the internal market, when France tops the charts for failure to implement single market legislation, is little short of breathtaking.
And to be lectured on the need for Europe to reform labour markets and increase employment by a Chancellor who has presided over record levels of unemployment in Germany, really takes the biscuit.
Perhaps a little humility from those three leaders is called for when it comes to economic reform.
We are in the third year of the ten-year Lisbon plan to improve competitiveness.
The truth is that progress has been disappointing.
The keys to higher employment levels and sustainable growth lie in sound public finances, a dynamic private sector, the completion of the single market, a real European research area and incentives for work, skill and innovation.
My group would emphasise in particular the importance of completing the financial services action plan, fostering entrepreneurship and promoting flexibility and adaptability in the labour market.
We must also increase the participation of women, immigrants, older workers and disabled people in the labour market, and adapt tax and benefit systems to make work pay.
These are the challenges we face and we have only seven years left it we are to achieve our goal of making Europe the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world.
Instead of setting new bold targets, the heads of state and government should get on with the job of closing the existing 'delivery gap' between their words and their actions.
Mr President, we are a long way off from fulfilling the euphoric proclamations of the Lisbon Summit of March 2000 on full employment and on making the Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
The slowdown in economic growth, the relocation and closure of companies accompanied by further redundancies, higher employment and increased social difficulties demonstrate the danger of the approach that has been pursued. This approach involves speeding up liberalisation and privatisation, the insistence on the primacy of monetary policies and of competition, the deregulation of the labour market and of labour legislation and making these more flexible.
These factors clearly demonstrate the need for a sea-change in the neo-liberal guidelines and policies currently practised, which will not happen as a result of the proposals that have been presented to us.
The Commission acknowledges, however, that the lack of up-to-date data still hampers the detailed study of what is happening in the field of poverty and social exclusion. Furthermore, little progress has been made in preventing early school leaving and in reducing gender inequality and the guidelines that have been presented, specifically in the field of social security, structural reforms of the labour market of work based on making work more flexible and more precarious and on wage moderation, and for pursuing the process of liberalisation in an increasing number of sectors, tend to aggravate the current situation.
By accentuating the unilateral approach to the liberalisation and greater flexibility of the goods, services, capital and labour force markets, ignoring economic and social cohesion, the Commission and the Council are contributing to increasingly significant social problems and to hampering economic recovery.
Consequently, as we highlighted in the resolution tabled by my group, it is crucial that the objectives of full employment, the harmonisation of social conditions in order to achieve progress, economic and social cohesion and development are defined as priorities for the Spring Summit.
Social and employment policies cannot remain subordinated to strict compliance with the criteria of nominal convergence and make it urgent to redefine the mandate and powers of the European Central Bank.
Sustainable development with a view to achieving social and ecological conversion must be founded on a thorough overhaul of the irrational criteria of the stability pact, given the diversity of the economic and social situation of the various countries.
It also requires a more equitable distribution of wealth, an overhaul of social protection systems in a way that demonstrates solidarity, and requires public and social investment, particularly in education, research and in the knowledge-based economy.
Consequently, as demanded by workers and citizens almost everywhere, including in Portugal last weekend, for example, at the impressive demonstration in Lisbon, it is time to heed the calls of the citizens and the workers.
Mr President, and I should add, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the Spring Summit, and Lisbon, about strategies for economic, social and environmental renewal.
In fact, I have barely heard mention of those last two words.
The question, therefore, is whether Lisbon is on the right track that is the question in the Commission notice and whether we, the EU, are still on the right track, and are travelling at the right speed.
As far as the right track is concerned, I think that the report is based on a number of presuppositions - in regard to which I should like to delve a little deeper than Mr van Velzen and a number of analyses that are incorrect.
I think that what we are dealing with is not a new economy but a cyclical one, and we have to take account of this.
I think that we are also over-emphasising the knowledge-based economy, as we also need jobs at the bottom of the labour market - but I do not hear anyone talking about this.
We are overestimating the potential of liberalisation and underestimating the Member States' capacity to implement directives and legislation.
We are not seeking the causes of the failure to implement them.
Is the EU still on the right track, and travelling at the right speed?
I think that Mr van Velzen puts it well, and several people have mentioned it.
The answer is no.
Let us look at employment: there are too few new jobs.
With our twelve million, we can consider ourselves well off, but these jobs are not the result of our policies alone.
The number of women, older people and people with disabilities in employment is too low.
The path to better jobs is still long, and we have done far too little in the way of the modernisation of the organisation of work.
I hope, therefore, that the review of the employment strategy that we are now going to work on and the improvement of the social agenda will bring about an adjustment in that field.
If we look at the environment, we see that nothing has come of the horizontal integration in this policy.
I am saying it simply but in the strongest terms.
I have also just said that little progress has been made in the transport sector, and likewise in energy policy, in agricultural policy and in the field of public health.
Who is discussing energy tax reforms?
And so on, and so on.
If we look at the general approach, too, talking of Kyoto or Johannesburg, we see very little progress.
However, we need better indicators, et cetera.
I have already said it: the policy is too one-sided with regard to knowledge and innovation.
As an engineer, I am all for the intellectual elite, but we should also look at other developments.
We need other jobs, too, and that means that we also have to think of the bottom end of the labour market, that we have to tackle the informal economy, and so on.
The streamlining of economic and social policy is very important, but that means that we have to draw conclusions both for the Stability and Growth Pact and for the orientation of the broad economic guidelines towards social and environmental policy.
We must continue with Lisbon, but incorporating great adjustments, not only in the Member States, who have all kinds of things to implement, but also strategic adjustments and adjustments to its content.
In my opinion, we need a thorough evaluation of what we are doing.
Mr President, I welcome the positive and pragmatic contributions made this morning by the Greek Presidency and by the Commission President, Mr Prodi.
I welcome the fact that every spring EU leaders meet to review what is known as the Lisbon Process, which is designed to ensure that the European Union becomes the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.
Over the coming weeks, there will be many ministerial meetings to put in place serious preparatory work before EU leaders meet on 21 March 2003.
The European Union has a lot of work to do, as recent data presently points towards slow economic development within the Union.
Growth rates for the last quarter of 2002 range between 0.1% and 0.4% of GDP growth within the European Union.
Unemployment within the Union stands at 8.5%.
I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency is focusing on the need to create more and better jobs within the European Union.
It is clear that the spring European Council meeting will put labour market reforms at the top of its agenda.
We must all be conscious of the need to improve the workings of the European employment strategy.
The Greek Government is right to guarantee that the social partners in Europe will be involved intrinsically in the process of labour market reform.
I have always supported social partnership, which is based on the sensible principle of involving trade union and employer groups in key economic and social reform policy issues.
The Greek Presidency is working towards the implementation of the Green Paper on entrepreneurship.
This will focus on eliminating red tape which hampers the day-to-day activities of the 19 million small and medium-sized companies in Europe. It will also entail enactment of the European Charter for small enterprises.
We must improve access for small companies to know-how and to finance, and we must simplify our regulatory environment.
If the European Union is to become the leading knowledge-based economy in the world, then we must take full advantage of all new information technologies.
We must guarantee universal access to new telecom services for all the citizens of the Union and we must put in place adequate training and educational programmes for all users.
The implementation of the EU initiative and the adoption of a Community-wide patent system are certainly concrete measures that must be supported.
The Greek Government is rightly pushing all the Member States to put in place innovative structures which will fully guarantee the payment of future pension policies.
Fortunately, as a society, we are living longer and that is why our governments must plan for the demographic changes for the future.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the EU Summit is to meet 'His Imperial Highness' Giscard d'Estaing, who is in the process of preparing a draft democratic constitution behind closed doors in a Praesidium in which four of Parliament's seven political groups are not represented.
We have sent a complaint to President Giscard d'Estaing and asked to be given the right of access to the documents being used in the course of the Praesidium's work. We have still not received a reply.
President Giscard d'Estaing has refused another request to scrutinise documentation on the grounds that EU rules on transparency do not apply to him.
I should like to call upon the Presidency to inform him politely but firmly that the Praesidium too is funded by EU taxpayers and must of course act in accordance with the judgments of the Court of Justice and the principle of transparency, which now appears in Article 255 of the Treaty.
There is no exemption for President Giscard d'Estaing and no legal base for representatives of the Commission, Parliament and the Council being able to depart from the principle of transparency unless they are provided with a special legal base by the regulation on transparency or decline to make a document available after making a practical assessment of it.
In the case of every single document in the Praesidium's possession, President Giscard d'Estaing must weigh up its significance in the negotiations against the public's interest in knowing about it and, like everyone else in the EU, he must ensure that the principle of equality is practised.
The situation must not arise in which three political groups have documents from the Praesidium available to them that are not available to the other four groups, or in which Convention documents circulate among foreign ministry interns that have not also been made available to members of the Convention.
We demand equality - neither more, nor less.
The word 'constitution' appears 32 times in the first 16 articles.
It must now be clear even to those least quick on the uptake that a constitution, and not merely a constitutional treaty, is being worked on.
I should like to call for the Praesidium to be reconstituted and made more representative of EU citizens.
All the political groups should be represented.
Women, who constitute half the electorate, cannot be satisfied with two places; the 13 candidate countries cannot be satisfied with one observer; and there cannot continue to be no representatives of that half of the electorate who voted no in the referendums on the EU held in the few countries that allow people to vote.
Thank you, Mr President, even though there is not very much to say thank you for.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to return to the Spring Summit.
The final Lisbon Objective - to make the European economy the most competitive knowledge-based economy in ten years - appeared to many, right from the start, to be an optimistic, consolatory slogan.
In actual fact, it seems increasingly less consolatory seeing as, three years later, very little headway has been made towards attaining that objective.
The European economy is still at the starting-post, the necessary reforms are postponed or watered-down at each summit and the hopes of unemployed Europeans of finding work thanks to growth are still closely associated with the revival of the economy of that driving force: the United States.
During the Spring Summit, the Heads of State and Government will probably confirm their commitment to the Lisbon Objectives, even though as things stand, we cannot be sure of this.
A letter addressed to the Greek Presidency is already doing the rounds, reaffirming the need and desire to revitalise the European economy through ambitious structural reforms.
Good - very good, we will say - but we Radicals nevertheless believe that instead of setting or reintroducing impressive objectives, we should do useful and fair things right now: welfare systems are in urgent need of immediate reform, and for many States constitute, in addition to a serious injustice for future generations, a real time bomb for the sustainability of public finances; we need to liberalise the markets in key sectors such as energy, transport, postal services and the professions; we need to create a truly integrated European financial market; there must be drastic cuts in the burdens weighing down, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses in Europe - tax burdens and bureaucratic burdens in terms of employment regulations - and which are one of the reasons for which a substantial number of European entrepreneurs and microentrepreneurs - I am referring mainly, but not exclusively, to Italy - are driven into the underground economy, a type of economy which evades regulation, which evades legality precisely because of the excessive burdens which are imposed.
This is what should be done, if we want to avoid fooling ourselves with slogans, with magic formulae - formulae put to much use in this Chamber - such as 'European social model' or 'social market economy'.
We would do well to ask ourselves whether these models are, today, really capable of protecting society's most vulnerable, society's 'outsiders'.
We now move to the 'Catch the Eye' procedure.
Colleagues, I remind you that you have two minutes' speaking time.
If you stick to your time we can maximise the number of participants.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his excellent and encouraging remarks and the determination to make Lisbon happen.
Lisbon is certainly very much about competitiveness.
It is very much about jobs. Jobs will create greater prosperity and, therefore, in turn more social cohesion.
Yesterday I clashed briefly with Commissioner Diamantopoulou at Question Time on the atypical workers directive.
I do not wish to revisit the various points made there, except to say that I would like to clear up a misunderstanding which is relevant to this debate.
I mentioned that Birmingham City Council - a socialist-run council, one of the largest employers of temporary workers in the UK - has decided to reduce in number the thousands of temporary workers it employs.
And I mean 'decided to reduce' already, as a direct result of the proposed atypical workers directive.
The suggestion from the Commissioner, possibly because of the interpretation, was that this was to do with the costs of insurance.
It was directly linked to the costs of extra pay for the temporary workers and, moreover, the costs of the extra red tape involved in employing temporary workers.
As a result of that, thousands of workers will lose their jobs.
If that happens just in one council, it can happen throughout the European Union.
I am asking the presidency to ensure that the whole Commission accepts the importance of competitiveness in generating jobs, and the need therefore to promote competitiveness and not labour market inflexibility based on out-of-date dogma.
Mr President, I welcome the remarks of President Prodi with regard to the current political tensions in the world and his emphasis on the role of the United Nations in resolving those tensions.
I also wish the current Presidency-in-Office well at the extraordinary summit next Monday.
I hope that it can establish a common position for the European Union in the present very fraught situation.
I want to put it to the Commission and the Council that one of the most important things we can do at the summit is insist that Member States comply with the agreements they make in the Council.
By this I mean both the targets they agree to under the Lisbon Process and the implementation of those targets because there is a clear gap in the implementation process.
I should like to re-emphasise a point made by a number of Members.
The Lisbon Process is not simply a liberalisation process - important as that is.
The whole idea of the Lisbon Process was to have a coordinated and well-balanced social and economic approach to modernising the European social model.
If we are to retain the uniqueness of the European Union, then we must ensure that social equity is not sacrificed in pursuit of the goal of liberalisation and competitiveness.
That is also essential - not just from the point of view of social justice but also for creating a more productive Union.
We have to ensure that those who are engaged in production feel it is worthwhile for them and for their children.
Therefore, the crucial role of public services has to be defended.
At the summit, the Commission and the Council have to seek to guarantee that services of general interest are enabled to grow and develop and are protected - and I use that word cautiously - from the ravages of the free market.
My final point is that we must set targets for youth employment, in particular for disadvantaged youth.
They are the long-term unemployed of tomorrow.
Mr President, implementation of Internal Market legislation at national level is an absolute prerequisite for achieving the Lisbon objectives.
The increase in the implementation deficit is causing EU markets to splinter and is eroding the benefits of the Internal Market.
Unless the directives on telecommunications, for example, are implemented in the Member States, that sector's development will be become more disharmonious than ever.
In order to maintain our competitiveness it is vital that we increase resources for research and training.
We will not succeed in the future with just bulk products and a poorly trained workforce.
Tax on earnings and employers' indirect costs must be cut to boost employment in Europe and to make it easier for SMEs and growth companies in particular to employ staff.
Lower taxation would, for its own part, stimulate European entrepreneurship, one of the pillars of competitiveness.
Let taxation in future fall within the competence of the Member States.
I would also encourage Member States to lighten the tax burden in parallel with the Lisbon objectives so that they take account of fair and positive tax competition.
The EU's task in this area will be to compile comparable data and propagate best practices.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the European Commission for their lists of good intentions, which I am sure they will do everything to implement.
Personally, I would like to concentrate on employment and on the objective of full employment which I think should be the prime, if not sole objective of the European Union, as all other objectives are only consequences of it.
This applies to equality between men and women, the progress of social harmonisation, maintaining and developing public services, establishing sustainable development, etc.
Full employment requires that the Stability and Growth Pact be reviewed, made more flexible and improved, that social partners be respected and listened to, that companies that make redundancies solely in order to make a profit be penalised, in particular when they have had public subsidies, that the European Council makes a major commitment and the research efforts be increased.
Ladies and gentlemen, whatever some people think, the old liberal recipes have failed.
Not enough jobs are being created, the Lisbon objectives have not been achieved and enlargement could aggravate the situation for the Fifteen and also for the ten new Member States that are soon going to join us.
So yes, we need to make full employment almost the sole objective of the Union.
I sincerely believe that it is vital for our future, which is why I wanted to say it again here, this morning, seriously and forcefully.
Mr President, the commitments entered into in 2000 for what is known as the Lisbon process were very ambitions, but they did of course constitute a heavy responsibility for the Heads of Government, and three years on we can see that this was all talk and that, up to now, it has not been transformed into any action to speak of.
It is very ironic, however, to state that the European Union is going to be the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 and then do absolutely nothing dynamic about living up to this.
In so doing, the European Union makes itself look ridiculous and the Council is not meeting its responsibilities.
The most important reason is that we, as a Union, tolerate the failure of the Member States to honour the commitments they have entered into.
Over recent years, it has emerged that France, for example, does not, in general, want to have anything to do with the commitments it entered into in 2000.
For example, the monopoly of the largest energy supplier remains in place, and, what is more, that subsidised energy is being exported to those Member States who have indeed opened up their borders.
In so doing, we have achieved the opposite of what we intended.
The countries that have carried out liberalisation are being punished for their good behaviour.
We have to see to it that countries honour the commitments they have entered into.
This means commitments that are honoured instead of more targets.
If we do not want to let the Lisbon process become a gigantic flop, definite action will have to be taken, and the Commission will have to draw up a clear timetable stating how the aims are to be achieved, setting end dates so that the Member States can be called to account on their responsibilities.
The emphasis will have to be placed on financial soundness, on full liberalisation of the services sector, the creation of a knowledge-based economy by investment in research and development, and radical simplification of the regulatory environment.
This means less detailed legislation and more framework legislation, so that people are not hampered in their activities by unnecessary red tape.
It is not just the Lisbon process but the credibility of the whole Union that is at stake.
Finally, I was struck by the speech by Mr Bouwman on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but I should like to add one thing to it.
He says that jobs should be created at the bottom of the market, and not only for the intellectual elite, and I agree with that, but we have to realise that one is a precondition for the other, and for this we need a competitive Europe.
Mr President, I will begin by responding to the comment from Mr Bushill-Matthews.
Firstly, Birmingham City Council is a Labour council, not a socialist council.
More importantly, his comment raises many questions about the current employment practices of councils within the UK.
A lot of the information we have received, for example from the low pay unit, indicates that many of the people working through agencies at the moment are poorly paid, poorly protected and very badly served.
We need to look at this clearly.
For example, the school where I used to work has now brought back in-house its cleaning staff because it can pay them more and it works out cheaper than employing them through an agency.
So there is a win-win situation.
But the question I particularly want to raise with the Council and Commission this morning is linked to the issue of sustainable development, which is an overarching and not just an additional concept, and the place of GÃ¶teborg and not just Lisbon within this whole process.
Since Johannesburg, private companies have been seen as a means of delivering government policy.
There is a need to think again about corporate social responsibility and a strong legal framework for this when examining how companies behave in emerging democracies or countries with repressive regimes, often backed by governments through export credit guarantees.
We need to ask them to look at this and assess whether the present 'free for all' really encourages sustainability, democracy and openness in many of the regimes and countries within which they are operating.
President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our debate on preparation for the Spring European Council is taking place in a tense international context.
President Prodi said this in anticipation of the debate that we will have this afternoon on the situation in Iraq.
The geopolitical context of the European Council meeting will not only be present in our minds, but also very evident in the data and economic forecasts from our Member States.
A climate of international tension is always damaging to the world economy and is one of the major results expected by the terrorist organisations behind that tension.
The Council meeting will focus on evaluating the measures that have been implemented in order to achieve the Lisbon objective, which consists of making the European Union the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
In particular it will involve evaluating the efforts made by the Member States and by the European Union in education, training and also research and development.
We are all aware that the results so far do not match up to the Lisbon objectives, but how can we be surprised at this when the governments of most of our countries have no other choice than to remedy the negligence and lack of foresight of their socialist predecessors who, far from making the necessary efforts when there was an opportunity for growth, have spread public resources thinly, sprinkling them between state handout programmes with no future?
The Brussels European Council will therefore be a useful opportunity for our countries to reconsider the Lisbon objectives by adapting them to the economic and social reality of our public finances and resituating them in the international context.
I would like to conclude by encouraging President Prodi for his initiative in presenting a plan to simplify European legislation, of no less than 90 000 pages.
This initiative is more than welcome in order to make life easier for business and therefore to increase the competitiveness of the Union.
This plan aims to reduce the acquis communautaire to some 25 000 pages between now and 2005 and simplify the language in draft legislation.
I do not think that anyone will complain about that.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, what makes the forthcoming Spring Summit so crucial in terms of political psychology is the fact that the times in which we live are not at all rosy.
The message from this summit must be one of confidence, because Europe's economy and hence growth and employment, will not be got moving if such confidence in the EU Member States' political leadership is not created or, where it exists, improved.
I do think, however, that it is not just confidence in governments that matters, but that it is also significant that European business is at last affirming its responsibility for contributing towards growth, investment, and employment.
The state alone cannot create the jobs that Europe needs in order to really develop its productivity and also in order to become the region of the world best able to face the future.
So it is to the Greek Presidency of the Council that I am appealing for a continued campaign against unfair fiscal competition and for us to be enabled at last to blockade all the tax havens and not let matters rest with the first breakthrough we achieve on the fiscal package, so that everyone can help put the Member States in a better position as regards the receipts on which their ability to make investments depends.
It is at this point that I would like, again, to appeal to the private business sector to step up private investment.
Not only is there too little public investment, but the private sector also invests too little, and it is only partnership between the two that will enable Europe to evade the self-fulfilling prophecy that our weak growth - or, in certain states, stagflation - will be followed by recession, which is something Europe can do without.
It is because our periods of growth are far too weak that this appeal is addressed to the Greek Presidency of the Council, along with the appeal to the Commission and the Council for improved cooperation between the institutions.
The European Parliament, as co-legislator, is prompt in doing its work, and it would be a good thing if the Council could keep up with us.
Mr President, the Greek President-in-Office gave us a seductive list of all the things he was working on.
It would make a great change - and I say this to him with due humility - if Presidents of the Economic Council would come here with a shortlist of things they were actually going to deliver.
One hundred priorities on a list means there are no priorities at all!
I want to echo what Mrs Randzio-Plath just said.
It would be refreshing - in fact essential - for the Economic Summit, when it meets on 21 March, to set down what its real priorities are.
I would suggest - and I think all colleagues would agree with this - your priorities are to inject confidence and dynamism and a sense that the Prime Ministers of the European Union are determined to create a dynamic single market in which we will create jobs and accelerate economic growth.
If we do not get investors behind that, President-in-Office, how are we to deliver all the other promises on your long list?
That is what we must do.
It would also be refreshing - and, as you said, innovative - to find ways to activate the European Charter for small enterprises.
It would not take much innovation to talk about it for once and actually implement it.
It has taken three years of inaction to demonstrate that making business start-ups easier and cheaper across the Union - something the Prime Minister is committed to doing - simply has not happened.
Again, I echo what Members have said: it is about time the Member State governments started to deliver on their promises on the patent, completing the internal market, clearing their transposition deficit and moving forward on the internal market for services.
President-in-Office, we are witnessing an absurd situation where a simple mutual recognition measure of sales promotion is blocked in your Council.
Show us the message, take away the clutter, get down to business and priorities, come back here and then we will feel you have delivered something.
Let us have an end to the laundry list economic summit!
Mr President, I think that the elements that some of my colleagues have described as puns and shams actually reflect a delicate point: the fact that the aim of this Spring Summit is to coordinate three policies, economic, social and sustainable development, whereas the Treaties do not provide the legal bases to enable us to act in these three areas at once.
It is therefore clear that our proposals look like pious hopes or we appear to be reaffirming our will while we know that we do not have the tools to achieve it.
Therefore, underlying our debates and the Spring Summit that is being prepared, there is a fundamental challenge involving reforming the Treaties with a view to the new Constitution for the European Union.
I think that if we want to arrive at a structured concept by determining how these three elements can form a sound cycle of development in Europe, we would be well advised to look more closely at what is happening in the services of general interest sector.
If there is a triangle, services of general interest are the barycentre of it.
Let us think about that and look at how our European policies are operating today.
President-in-Office of the Council, we will not achieve any results by trying, on the one hand, to speed up the construction of the internal market, with all that it involves in terms of opening up to competition and, ultimately, privatisation, and by seeking, on the other hand, to maintain the balance by arguing that it will be done in the interests of the public, of social cohesion, etc. We have a duty to evaluate what has been done, and that will help us to think about how economic activity, which is supposed to fulfil fundamental rights and ensure social and territorial cohesion, can or should be considered and integrated into the new Treaties.
Where is the evaluation?
Where is the framework directive for services of general interest?
Where are our proposals to strengthen Article 16 of the Treaty, particularly regarding the resources and tasks of these services of general interest?
I think that if we are capable of moving forward in our discussion, without being dogmatic, looking at what is happening and what it would be appropriate to do, our ideas will begin to take shape.
You know, brains are indeed precious, but what counts above all is collective intelligence, and that is what we especially have among users, employees and operators, just like among elected representatives who are reminded every day of the cost of the closure of public services in their countries.
Frankly, I think that this is a very important indicator that we need to use and take advantage of for the years to come.
Mr President, the executive difficulties, together with the potential of the Lisbon Strategy, lie principally in its comprehensive, integrated nature.
Despite some timid progress, the basic idea of integrating economic, social and environmental policies has not seen any significant, coherent progress at either Member State or Community level.
If we totally accept the view that social and environmental quality is not incidental, but an element of growth and an essential factor of competitiveness, then I believe that the open cooperation method must be strengthened.
I therefore applaud the fact that, in the Convention, the possibility of granting it constitutional status seems to be gaining support.
Experience teaches us that objectives as ambitious as those involved in the concept of sustainable development cannot be attained without a strong, common lead from all social and institutional quarters.
Regarding environmental policies in particular, without the adoption of plans and incentives at all levels, it is hard to imagine that more eco-compatible production and consumption models will really take off, models to which we are also committed under the Johannesburg Summit conclusions.
We therefore need to ensure that all interested parties are persuaded to adopt innovative and responsible practices, by including them in medium and long-term outlooks.
In this connection, I consider it a grave limitation that Parliament has not yet managed to formulate organisational and procedural methods in order to monitor, appraise and guide sustainable development policies in a truly effective - that is, multidisciplinary - way.
It is right to call for Parliament's effective participation in the formulation of the broad guidelines to be guaranteed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, but we too must make better preparations to achieve our goal.
Mr President, I am sure that it is clear to everyone that the Lisbon process is not yet finished.
I think that there are two reasons for this.
The first is to do with Lisbon itself.
Back then, we took - as we, particularly, do now - as our starting point scenarios based on excessively high growth rates.
I think that too many people think that growth is something that you can simply write in a book and it just happens.
It does not.
Instead, as Mr van Velzen pointed out, you then have to take hundreds of measures to promote this growth, and that cannot be done by means of rhetoric alone.
Secondly, of course, all kinds of promises were made, and they have not been kept.
This has also been pointed out enough times.
What, however, can we do about it now?
One of the things you spoke about, Mr Prodi, was the takeover bids directive.
That is one example that I would like to give.
There is a great deal of talk about employment effects.
In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have been looking into the probable employment effects of this takeover bids directive.
They are negative.
The Commission itself did not look into that.
I would also like to see some more employment impact assessment, therefore, not only in the field of social measures - which is logical - but also with regard to other measures, in particular financial measures.
Things often do not turn out as one would think.
Another point I would draw attention to is the figures.
In the Commission's answer to a question I asked, it admitted that the European growth figures cannot be compared favourably with those for the United States, presumably because the US growth figures should always be taken with a pinch of salt.
It makes sense to me that we not only look at the US or China, but that we at all events use good figures and not go by incorrect data.
Finally, a good deal has been said about cooperation in the field of universities.
I think that that is very important.
I think that a lot more can be done without us encroaching on the sovereignty of the Member States in this respect.
I should like to put one question to the Presidency, however.
How is it possible, if we are busy working on the universities, that, in Greece, the state universities still enjoy a monopoly, so that thousands of Greek students are studying in the USA and not in other European countries?
Can an end not be put to this?
I know that this is a Greek responsibility, but perhaps some thought could be given to it during your Presidency.
Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, Mr Prodi, spurred on by today's debate in Parliament and the vote on the Commission's position on the WTO, I would ask the Greek Presidency: how should we deal with the Mediterranean products disaster given the desire for the gradual dismantling of aid and support for agricultural produce?
The desire to end support and to promote the free market is certainly positive, but how can we pursue this objective gradually, taking into account on the one hand, the needs of developing countries, and on the other, the needs of Mediterranean countries which would surely suffer severe, inestimable damage, owing to sudden and excessive liberalisation and the withdrawal of support?
This is a subject which I think the Presidency of a Mediterranean country should address, and should be of particular importance to it, not least because 2010 is not far off and the free market area is an appointment we cannot miss, but one for which we are making inadequate preparations.
We should initiate a major debate and large awareness campaign throughout the Union on this subject.
A final remark on the European research area, which greatly concerns me: our economy is indissolubly linked to our ability to intensify research, but many small-sized, very small businesses remain outside the Sixth Framework Programme, not because the Programme itself requires it, but because they cannot manage to take advantage of this opportunity by themselves.
I would call for an incentive to be considered for small-sized business combinations, especially in circumstances where there is little inclination to plan and make arrangements together.
I should like to thank President Prodi for again emphasising research and education, as is his wont, and their importance within the Lisbon process.
I should also like to congratulate him for raising the problem of war with Iraq, which is clouding the atmosphere and will have a direct impact on the political and economic future of Europe.
We started out with great expectations of the Lisbon process.
However, in education, research, lifelong learning and training, it does not appear to be delivering the goods.
3% in research was an important target and the Commission deserves our praise for managing to push it through, but we come at it as if our hands were tied behind our back and we fail to make the necessary progress every year.
We talk a great deal about training, but the private sector only invests 2.3% in training and progress with investments in lifelong learning, school-leavers and immigrant groups does not, unfortunately, give us cause for optimism.
All this is taking place in a climate which discourages university researchers and teachers because decisions are not followed up with the practical policies needed.
Education and training are not, unfortunately, at the top of the agenda, not even the Lisbon agenda.
But we still believe they must remain at the heart of the policies, as they were formulated when the Lisbon process was first designed.
Sustainable development and the environment are just as important as the economy and social performance.
The Spring Summit must therefore pay just as much attention to these, and not spend hours on the economy, minutes on social aspects and only seconds on environmental policy.
The European Commission should prepare a sustainability report each year, and the joint resolution requests that the European Commission do just that.
One example is fuel cell cars: the car of the future.
Citizens of the United States and Japan are already driving them: they are already available; but not in Europe.
We are lagging behind in this field.
The widespread use of fuel cell cars, powered by biomass, will also mean that wars over oil will be a thing of the past.
Environment, social aspects and economy are each of equal importance.
It is a great shame that by no means all Heads of Government have taken this to heart.
Mr President, we are living not only in a knowledge-based economy but also in a post-Kyoto carbon economy.
Those who are able to produce goods whilst producing the least emissions will be the winners in this new economy.
They will therefore be able to gain advantages in terms of employment and in economic and environmental terms.
I therefore think it is extremely important that the European Union should have developed an emissions-trading system that will enable us to lower emissions in industry and in the energy sector, which accounts for fifty thousand companies and for 46% of carbon dioxide emissions.
This is particularly important because it will lower the financial cost to Europe of complying with Kyoto by 35%.
We cannot, however, resolve Kyoto merely through industry and energy.
The Commission needs to come up with initiatives for the transport, farming and energy sectors.
Despite the fact, however, that we in Europe are living in a carbon economy, we are still dependent on Russia's agreement for the Kyoto protocol to enter into force.
We also know that the United States are currently waging a campaign in Russia against the Kyoto protocol.
I would ask the Council and the Commission, what measures are being worked on at European level to ensure that we can convince our Russian friends to ratify the Kyoto protocol?
It is crucial that the protocol enters into force so that European businesses can accept the forthcoming measures, some of which are more difficult, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Europe.
Mr President, I would like to concentrate on research and the creation of the European research area, both through the framework programme and through coordination of national policies.
A 3% target for investment in research was set in Barcelona, but it is beginning to look like my New Year's resolution - to eat less and take more exercise - in that it has not been kept and really needs a bit more effort!
I attended an interesting benchmarking conference in Greece on research and technology.
Let me tell you about some of the areas where people looked in detail at the performance of different Member States.
Regarding women in science for example, countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy are turning out excellent women scientists and engineers, but other countries are doing very badly.
When it comes to persuading young people to enter science and engineering, Nordic countries are doing well, as they do in a lot of categories.
Others are doing poorly.
This is a crisis across Europe.
In terms of linking research with regional policy, again Finland is doing well, and Ireland exceptionally well but other countries are not.
Representing Cambridge, I am pleased that some prestigious Cambridge institutions are now looking to South Yorkshire as a suitable location for research infrastructure.
Some countries do well in clustering.
The more we do of this comparison and the more we learn the lessons of the comparison, the more likely we are to keep our New Year's resolution.
I will try harder on mine if Member States try harder on theirs!
Mr President, clearly the crisis currently plaguing the European Union and the capitalist system as a whole will not be remedied with the measures proposed for the spring Council.
If anything, they will make it worse.
The USA appears to be determined, with the direct or indirect connivance of the European Union, to go through with its threat of war; against Iraq today, tomorrow against who knows?
The objective is to redistribute the markets and control energy resources as part of the USA's master plan to rule the world.
However hard the communications policy of the European Union and the governments of the Member States tries to nourish vain hopes for the future, the working classes feel the brunt of the system and its anti-worker, anti-grass roots measures on a daily basis.
Even the European Union and other international economic organisations admit that their liberal policies have been a total failure.
Underlying stagnation and falling production and development can no longer be turned around by stability pacts.
It is fast becoming apparent that the much trumpeted social policy of the European Union, as it reduces labour costs and curtails or abolishes the workers' rights, is not fostering development and is not resolving the crisis inherent in the capitalist system, even on its own terms.
The failure to achieve the Lisbon and Stockholm targets on employment proves how right we were when we said that they were designed, not to deal with unemployment, but to step up the attack on workers' rights and grant big business new privileges.
The reason for insisting on privatisation and liberalisation, even in sectors such as health and education, and for handing over insurance funds to big business is so that it can increase its profits even during a recession.
The only way forward is to galvanise the workers at both national and international level into a bigger, more massive and more dynamic anti-monopoly, anti-imperialist movement and so create a new force field that will get the economy out of the doldrums and pave the way for another, diametrically opposed policy for our people.
Mr President, the fact that my seat is directly opposite yours has not helped me to attract your attention from the start, but never mind.
The European Union is in need of structural reform, as we have heard, and reform of the labour market is a structural reform that will be included in the Spring Summit, preceded by Thessaloniki.
However, Mr President, the labour market and welfare systems are two sides of the same coin: if one goes well - the labour market - then so does the other - welfare systems - given that the labour market finances welfare systems and vice versa: if the labour market does not go well, then neither do welfare systems, and Commissioner Solbes starts to have problems.
If, on the other hand, the labour market changes - owing to either regulatory reasons or market reasons, or both - then the welfare systems must also change, because they must reflect the changes occurring in the labour market.
This is why, Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, we also need to launch a strategy for welfare systems, similar to the one we applied, some years back, to the labour market under the Luxembourg Process: national plans, consensus on common objectives, transparency, the so-called three pillars, what was not yet called open coordination but which is now referred to in this way, and so on. We have to synchronise the two systems, we have to synchronise the two reforms, we have to synchronise the labour market and welfare systems.
Therefore, open coordination, obligations and evaluation of the Stability Pact are all aspects that must be clearly defined and quantified at the Spring Summit, if we want to meet the Lisbon Objectives.
I say to colleagues who have indeed caught my eye, but who are getting anxious about my catching their eye, that it is simply a question of sequencing.
I hope to be able to call everyone who has indicated their wish to speak.
Mr President, it was agreed when the Lisbon strategy was being decided that the EU could not become the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy unless there was sufficient investment in human resources.
That is why the decision to place skills and innovation in the frontline of the strategy at the Spring Summit is a welcome one indeed.
The Commission communication is urging Member States to increase investment in skills and innovation over the next twelve months.
This is a good start, but there has to be long-term investment in training.
A solid skills base will not be built in a year.
Public expenditure for training and education has remained virtually unchanged in all Member States in recent years.
With an ageing population and as the need for labour grows we must view training and education, not just as a necessary evil, but as an investment in the future.
Societies which try to make use of the whole nation's resources, based on a policy of equality, achieve great things.
Public services alone are not enough in making use of resources: the public sector must also do its share, especially by offering its employees the opportunity to receive training alongside their work.
Training is the most important factor when it comes to employing people.
The share of the population that works has increased in the last ten years. Since 1996, for example, 12 million jobs have been created.
Most of these have been in sectors that require further or higher education.
Education and training policy is the responsibility of the Member States, but we can enhance it though cooperation at EU level.
The ministers for education have agreed on some common targets for education and training systems. By 2010 the number of those who leave school early should be halved and the proportion of those receiving vocational education and training among 25-64 year olds should be increased to 80%.
The imbalance between men and women in the areas of mathematics, technology and science must be corrected.
Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, Mr Prodi, I have been unable to sleep for several nights; by not sleeping I cannot dream and this makes it difficult for me to give the explanations of vote which I normally give in this Chamber.
Therefore, I turn to you for reassurance, in particular President Prodi, not just because he has a persuasive, calm, reassuring, almost paternal voice, but also and above all, because of the statements made so far.
Why am I worried?
Because many pensioners are worried and cannot sleep either.
They know, as I do, that the Presidents-in-Office of the Council try to balance the accounts, for economic reasons, in any way they can, even by cutting expenditure intended for pensioners.
Pensioners agree with having accounts that balance - and what well-balanced accounts they are - but some of them only have their pension to live off.
The approximate number of people living exclusively off a pension does not exceed one hundred million in Europe, without taking into account the candidate countries, and they say: 'We are all for balancing the accounts, but why not cut expenditure other than that intended for pensions?'
In some States, for example in Italy, there are laws, adopted by previous governments but still in force under the current government, according to which a 99% disabled person who has worked for a few years is given a pension of EUR 30 a month and widows of young men who have died are given pensions of EUR 18.
Can we be reassured - and therefore sleep peacefully - that cuts will be made, as is only right, but that this will be done wisely?
Mr Fatuzzo, I am very sorry to hear that you cannot sleep at night.
However, I recall from listening carefully to your explanations of vote yesterday that you seemed to have slept the night before because you were communing with Pantalone and other characters on the flight to Strasbourg.
Mr President, quite a lot of criticisms have been made of the Lisbon Process.
I also think it right that it should be examined critically.
At the same time, we must not underestimate the fact that it has done quite a bit of good.
If, today, we look at how we are coping with the present recession in comparison with the one we experienced at the beginning of the nineties, there is a big difference.
We have low growth, and unemployment has certainly stopped falling, but we are coping much better than we did in the nineties.
Might it be that economic coordination and monetary policy are playing a role?
That is what I, in any case, believe.
At the same time, I believe that the Lisbon Process must be reformed.
The process needs to be better coordinated. It needs to hang together properly, and more focus on implementation is required.
In this connection, it is important for us to see these three parts of the process as being of equal value.
It is also important that there should be balance in the Lisbon Process.
I come from Sweden, a country that is used to implementing structural measures.
We are in favour of an open economy, competition and structural reforms, but we are also in favour of a high social standard, that is to say social systems that provide security and the target of full employment.
If the Lisbon Process does not strike a balance between the structural measures, the employment strategy and sustainable social systems, it will fall apart and fail.
It is therefore important that this balance be maintained.
In conclusion, I want to say something about sustainable development.
This affects the whole area.
It has to do with development that is sustainable economically and with sustainable social systems, especially sustainable pensions systems, that is to say ones that are sustainable both from economic and social points of view, so that they are fair.
Sustainable development has to do with the environment too, however.
The strategic solution in this connection is investment, for if we get investment under way in the new technology, by which I mean the cleanest technology, we shall also improve the environment throughout Europe, at the same time as increasing growth and creating more jobs.
Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that I am a little disappointed, because I expected to see evidence that the European Union had genuinely taken sustainable development on board, but that is still not the case.
In Gothenburg, however, the Union had taken a big step in that direction by announcing its desire to measure sustainable development through the Spring Council meetings.
Having heard your speeches, I am forced to admit that once again, this Spring Council meeting will not achieve that objective.
Sustainable development is not part of the European plan, a chapter among others, as it was portrayed.
Sustainable development implies a new approach to all our European policies, which would involve social and environmental issues as well as the economy.
My question is as follows: have you analysed the Union's policies in the light of these new criteria and, in particular, environmental criteria?
We would like to know how environmental and social issues are reflected in your proposals.
What are the consequences of an economy that we want to be the most competitive?
Even more redundancies?
Even more damage to the environment?
We are aware today of the financial cost of that social and environmental damage.
So please, do not make this Spring Summit just another summit, but an innovative one.
The European Union will only get out of the current crisis if it changes its policies as the people expect, and only a socially and environmentally sustainable development plan will be capable of restoring the impetus, optimism and confidence that appear to be severely lacking in both the Council and the Commission.
If the Union, our European Union, does not respond to the current challenges, both at international level - I am obviously thinking of the issue of Iraq, on which Europe is unacceptably divided - and at the level of European citizens, who are asking for more Europe, a better Europe, then who will be able to?
Mr President, everyone talks about everything, and no one - or almost no one - sets a limit upon the number of tasks.
Most Members add further dimensions.
More and more tasks and policy areas are given priority.
In the end, almost nothing is given priority and, instead, there is just a long repetition of politically correct words and phrases, while Europe all but stands still.
Instead, there is a need to focus on bringing about the internal market; to put pressure on the Member States to implement EC legislation and remove the obstacles to this; to reduce taxes for companies and make rigid labour markets more flexible; and to have done with large numbers of tasks and rules that are unnecessary for promoting growth.
There is a need to focus upon education, research, development, competition and small businesses.
At the same time, more stringent monitoring of state subsidies is required, as well as a review of the rules governing regional aid.
Confidence in the European business climate is undermined by short-sighted financial aid that is hostile to development, causes distortion and hampers competition.
Who will dare, or want, to invest if, by doing so, there is a danger of seeing the whole basis of their enterprise swept away because a similar factory is being set up with EU subsidies in a neighbouring country?
These matters must be reviewed, the number of tasks selectively reduced, and action taken.
We do not need any more fine-sounding declarations.
They are nice to listen to, but it is action that is now required.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too get the feeling that sustainability, in the context of preparations for this year's Spring Summit, is seen only as an appendix to general policy development.
This is indeed regrettable, as - or so I believe -the future development of our society is to a very large degree dependent on how we manage to fashion the elements of our lives in an ecological way that will also be able to enable future generations to live decently.
In so far as that is the case, we need to step up our efforts in the area of sustainable development; it is here that I address my remarks particularly to the Council, as we in this House, as well as the Commission, have specified in precise terms what shape sustainable development should take.
President Prodi, when the Gothenburg Summit was in preparation, laid out before this Parliament very clear indicators and objectives for sustainable development, and these I can wholeheartedly endorse.
What I believe hampers our discussion is the Council's failure to take these objectives on board, so that, whilst we are drawing up projected goals for many policy areas, sustainable development is not one of them.
This means that it is not possible for us to impose any binding obligations, nor can we monitor what is done.
I do not at this point want to draw up a long wish list, as one does at Christmas, but we have to focus our considerations on one or two core elements, and in that respect, strategy for dealing with climate change is certainly one important area, and transport another.
What matters is that there should be binding targets, which the Member States have to achieve.
I might add that this encourages renewed investment and creates jobs.
Let me remind you only of the way in which the promotion of forms of energy such as wind energy has created tens of thousands of jobs in the European Union.
What we need, then, is definite goals, goals that we must achieve, rather than only - as Winston Churchill put it - planning great things but taking small steps!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the letter sent to you by the prime ministers of Europe's big three economies, Mr Chirac, Mr Blair and Mr SchrÃ¶der, makes the spring Council far more important than a merely routine Council following the standard procedure.
It makes it a symbol of the unity of Europe, at a time when this unity is being severely tested; perhaps even a symbol of hope.
This letter is commendably realistic because it puts the emphasis where it is needed: on industry which, apart from the fact that it generates 25% of total European domestic product, also employs 45 million people; at a time when there is a great deal of talk about services, knowledge and so on, it is worth remembering that the economy has a far more material and palpable basis.
It also puts the question of public utility services on the right footing.
These services are a necessary basis and a necessary infrastructure for the economy and they must be maintained in the European way, not in ways which could lead to their being broken up, as is the case in certain sectors in the United States.
Then there is the whole issue of modernising the markets and not tying companies down in more red tape.
That is quite right.
And of course, one issue which is extremely important when it comes to unifying the markets is the unification of the financial markets.
From this point of view, 2003 is a milestone in the Lisbon programme.
We also need to complete the legislation unifying the transport markets; perhaps the Commission could tell us if it is optimistic about at least keeping to this deadline.
The prime ministers also emphasise the need for high levels of employment.
It is worth remembering that Lisbon talks of full employment, not high levels of employment, and we should stick to our original ambition.
Then, of course, there is the question of investments.
Where the money is going to come from now that the stock exchanges are falling is a question which needs to be addressed and I hope, Mr President, that the skills of the Greek Government, which has a very distinguished economic staff, will create the optimistic climate without which confidence will crumble and the economy - and hence the Lisbon process - will not progress.
This optimism is sorely needed.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have all stressed how especially important the Spring Summit is in view of flagging growth, the internal market not yet being complete and the Lisbon objectives becoming ever more nebulous and people having less and less confidence in them.
I see the Lisbon strategy as being Europe's response to globalisation.
The Lisbon strategy is our regulatory framework, because it links the market to social responsibility and the sustainability of the environment, which is how this regulatory model distinguishes us from the United States and from other continents.
What is known as the eco-social market economy is the European regulatory model.
We must stop apportioning blame.
We must make it clear where responsibilities lie - who is responsible for meeting what target and by when.
We need definite targets rather than woolly statements.
In which areas do we want to be Number One and by what date?
Who has to achieve what subsidiary goal and by when so that the jointly determined European objectives might be fulfilled?
What the Spring Summit should do is specify how the Lisbon objectives are to be broken down country by country, and have these objectives incorporated in every statement made by governments and every labour convention entered into by them.
There is no contradiction between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strategy; on the contrary, without the Pact, the Lisbon strategy could not be fulfilled.
This means that we have to keep on ensuring that the internal market becomes a true internal market and that sufficient account is taken of small and medium-sized businesses' potential as the foundation of Europe's economic structure and a source of new employment.
That brings to a close the 'Catch the Eye' part of this debate.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the European Commission, the Lisbon strategy, the vital tool needed to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, is perhaps more topical today than ever before.
The social repercussions of possible military intervention in Iraq and its impact on the European economy are giving great cause for concern.
Just what is it within the Union that ties it to outside developments?
According to the snapshot presented by the Commission, things are not so rosy when it comes to the open method of coordination between the Member States at all levels within the Union.
For example, there has been too little progress towards the objective of sustainable economic development, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion which we set in 2000.
Some Member States have completely failed to meet targets for employment and competitiveness, with the result that the word now is that we shall not achieve the target set by the Union in the Lisbon strategy.
We therefore need to review what has been done and examine everything left on the to-do list, especially in the Member States which have fallen short.
Again on the subject of sustainable development, we need to plug the gap between the announcements we make and the legislative tools we provide for protecting the environment and public health and we need to mainstream the environmental dimension in all Union policies.
With pressure from both the Lisbon process and the process of reviewing the Union Treaties and, of course, globalisation, we urgently need to apply sustainable development within the context of European integration.
However, what I want to focus on and highlight once again is this: I think, no I believe that the European Union is lagging behind in science and technology, especially biotechnology.
Without scientific and technological progress and innovation we shall be unable to meet the challenges - the nutritional, medical, environmental and socio-economic challenges.
Science and technology are the key to dealing with the major problems that beset human society.
This has always been a basic element in the history of man and it still is today.
Scientific, technological and related research, education and training are therefore non-negotiable.
And in my opinion, Mr President-in-Office, you should take decisive action to promote research in science and technology, as the President of the Commission said, because it will, I think, turn out to be the most important tool in achieving the Lisbon policy, strategy and programme.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am indeed very well aware of the backdrop against which the Greek Presidency of the Council is obliged to make preparations for the Spring Summit.
What makes it certainly the most difficult Spring Summit since Lisbon, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is the global economic situation and the prospect of an imminent war, which we hope yet to be able to prevent.
In a situation such as this, a great deal of responsibility rests upon your shoulders, but there is only one mistake you can make, a very serious one, and that would be if you were to allow your courage to fail you - the courage to, for once, push to one side the declarations prepared by the many bureaucracies; the courage to distance yourself to some degree from the anaemic statements, all couched in the same language; the courage to engage in real discussion among yourselves of the real conditions under which the people of the European Union live.
We know from former Presidents of the Council that finding the courage to break with ritual is perhaps the hardest thing of all.
It is not simple.
Let me give two reasons why I think it essential that you summon up the courage to do this.
What we learn from an unvarnished depiction of the situation is that investment, both private and public, in Europe is at a low point.
We have to take especial note of the fact that public-sector investment is collapsing in those economies on which a major part of our economic development depends.
This is where ritual invocation of the Stability and Growth Pact is not enough.
When will we at last affirm our belief in the golden rule and put fresh wind and impetus behind increased investment in Europe?
I, for one, want to hear no more from Members of this House who ritually affirm the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises without at the same time stressing the link with public investment.
This question demands an answer, and soon.
You are in a position to do this, and you can get it done.
There is a second aspect that seems to me to be of great importance.
Wonderful papers are produced on active ageing.
I know about the demographic situation, and about how important it is to keep people active as they get older, but if you ask the European public, what you come up against is the great difficulty you have in persuading someone who has worked in a factory for forty years, perhaps working shifts, to carry on doing that job.
You will find it even more difficult to convince a businessman that this worker has to keep on working longer, and, in particular, even more difficult than that when people out there know that these papers are written by people who reckon on going in their fifties or early fifties with a golden handshake.
If you really want to do something, do some work on health programmes in the workplace, do something about enabling people to have an early-retirement part-time pension, and then, above all, ask yourself how it is that nearly 20% of our young people still end up on the labour market without proper training?
These people are the future of Europe, and we force them into unemployment.
This is an urgent problem, and I do not find anything like enough about it in our papers.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said during this debate and it is obviously difficult at this point to add anything new.
I will therefore insist on the aspects which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party considers to be most important in this preparation for the Spring Summit.
Firstly, on assessing the results so far since Lisbon, we observe that, rather than making progress - at least in relative terms - we have moved backwards.
If we compare the levels of productivity in the European Union and in the United States we see that the European Union comes out worse.
We believe that this is because we have not been able to make sufficient progress on a framework favourable to business initiative for investment.
This is because, despite the declarations made at the successive Councils in Lisbon, Gothenburg and Barcelona, there has not been adequate action on the part of the Member States, which have committed themselves to making a series of reforms, of which the really important ones are reforms to make the labour market more flexible, to promote an environment more favourable for the creation of companies, at a time when growth forecasts within the European Union are low.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are key, but it has been demonstrated that the bureaucratic obstacles to creating a new business are infinitely greater in the European Union than in the United States.
This is not a favourable environment either for the creation of companies or for small and medium-sized businesses or, above all, for those companies which are taking a new direction by applying new technologies.
Therefore, the twin objective of creating companies and applying and developing new technologies has also been significantly delayed and clearly, despite the successive commitments and solemn declarations, which were repeated in Barcelona, on the process of liberalisation of sectors which are still protected, in energy and telecommunications we see once again that they have not been fulfilled.
I therefore hope that rather than making great declarations, the Brussels Summit will fulfil its commitments.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is, I think, obvious - and here I disagree with many of my honourable friends - that, if nothing else, the Lisbon process, the Lisbon strategy, is not a total failure.
At worst, it has not made any headway.
Clearly, it is developing and progressing too slowly.
The recession which has hit the economy, especially the sectors of the new economy on which we have - to put it one way - somewhat over-optimistically pinned our hopes for the Lisbon strategy, cannot be left out of the equation.
As far as sustainable development is concerned, there has been a huge delay.
We should already be fully monitoring and developing the outcomes of Johannesburg.
I think that both the word and the town have been forgotten.
Then there is the letter from the three leaders, which a previous speaker quite rightly referred to and which really does upset the balance which the Lisbon strategy tries to strike.
This letter calls for reform, but reform in the wrong direction.
The letter ditches the term full employment and talks of high levels of employment.
It says - and this is outrageous, Mr President-in-Office and I should like you to respond to this - that we need to prevent new restrictions on companies and that, whenever the Commission proposes new policies, we need to listen to the opinion of companies and the business world first.
I have nothing against consultation, but what will you do about the legislation on chemicals?
What will you do about the new legislation on environmental responsibility?
In one sense, these laws are restrictions which come within the context of sustainable development and so on.
Will they too be left out of the equation?
I think an answer is required.
If not now, then during the discussions at summit level.
In all events, a clear answer is required.
Obviously the war, or rather, let us not deceive ourselves, the invasion of Iraq may exacerbate all this and does, of course, make it hard to get down to brass tacks and discuss the follow-on strategy for Lisbon.
However, a number of questions need answering, Mr President.
Have you thought about re-tabling a general reduction in working times in order to create more jobs?
About funding the development of the so-called third sector?
About updating the ideas in the White Paper, which was when we last thought about this in a specific, integrated manner in the European Union, for example on trans-European networks and tax changes, in order to shift taxes off employment and on to the use of natural resources.
Have you thought about re-tabling all this in the light of the failures so far?
Or has all this now been forgotten?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the tone of this discussion is too pessimistic.
I think that now, of all times, we need to testify in strong support of the value of the European model, not only as a market, but especially as a model for well-being, sustainability, development, and the prosperity which is tied up with well-being.
That is why we have made a conscious decision to support integration in place of confrontation, unity in diversity, and world development in place of dominance.
And so we have brought about the upcoming enlargement of the Union, but, at the same time, we are confronted with the growth of unemployment.
At this time, therefore, we need leadership from the Commission, the Council, Parliament, the EU institutions and the Member States.
Member States, regions, local authorities and heads of businesses alike fail to deliver the goods, however.
They all sit on top of their heaps of gold, exercising caution and not doing what needs to be done in order to combat this unemployment.
Believe me, if we carry out enlargement of Europe with unemployment still hanging over our heads, we will be heading for an utter fiasco.
You talk of research - we have failed to bring about a real European policy for this.
Our doctores honoris causa still come to our universities to collect their honorary doctorates, before returning to the USA to work in very high-performance laboratories.
Why are we doing so little; why are so many countries lagging behind in terms of research?
If sustainable development is to be possible, each country must do more than it is currently doing, and together we must do more than we are currently doing.
For we must admit that when times were good - times are not so good now, but we must turn the tide - we did actually see, to our regret, that regions with high unemployment also remained regions of high unemployment when they were part of the Union.
On top of that there is also cyclical unemployment.

At the same time, we can see that, across the board, there are still semi- and unskilled workers who are out of work, still too few women in the labour force, too few people in work, and businesses that systematically show their staff the door when they reach 52; and there are still too many countries that endorse this behaviour and even give government money for it.
Have we not been fobbed off in that regard with nice summits and fine words for long enough now?
I hope that now, some action will be the result.
That was very difficult.
Ladies and gentlemen in the galleries, I warmly welcome you to Parliament, but I must firmly ask you not to attempt to join in the debates or to applaud.
Mr President, Europe has two raisons d'Ãªtre: peace and prosperity.
It is seriously weakened on both counts, to say the least.
Peace has been compromised by the unbelievable violation of the Treaties by Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Denmark, signatories of the Maastricht Treaty, and I doubt that the summit called on Monday by the Greek Presidency will change very much.
In reality, European policy amounts to very little and even that is very weak.
There is not more new Europe than old Europe.
There is quite simply no Europe at all.
As far as prosperity is concerned, which is more the subject of this debate, the reason that Union policy is half what it could be is an antiquated monetary policy that was put together for an old Europe.
The Malthusian policy of the European Central Bank, which has been reiterated enough in this House, is the main cause of European stagnation and, soon, recession.
So, Mr Prodi and the Greek President-in-Office, if you hold a Spring Summit, make it worthy of its name!
Bring the European economy out of the monetary winter that it has been plunged into by the policy of the European Central Bank.
The proof is the very report that you published on the competitiveness of European countries after the Lisbon Summit.
Which are the three countries that come out best, the three countries on the podium?
Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, precisely the countries that did not adopt the euro.
They are doing better in terms of unemployment, inflation, debt and competitiveness, than the countries that adopted the euro.
So spot the mistake!
And now that you are pleased with yourselves - I heard Mr Goebbels this morning rejoicing that the euro is finally picking up - that the euro is beating the dollar, the long-held dream, be aware that the more the euro goes up, the more European growth will decline.
Your ego will be flattered, but the result will be seventeen thousand more unemployed each month, as happened again in France last month.
In its report to the European Council on 21 March, the Commission invited the Member States to step up their efforts to comply with the objective that they set in Lisbon in Spring 2000: creating the most competitive and dynamic economy within ten years.
This call is welcome, because today we look more like an old Europe falling into a depression.
In reaction to this, the Commission and the Council have just presented some interesting action plans, particularly for the European research area, which should enable us to attract the best brains in the world and also to keep them, I would like to add, through a taxation system designed not to dissuade them from staying.
However, the main responsibilities lie with the Member States, and the European Union needs to help them better in several areas.
For example, firstly, we need to ensure that standard European rules do not make the existing rules more inflexible.
On paper, standardisation leads to savings in terms of information and transactions, but in practice, it also leads to many costs because a standard rule is liable not to be suited to anyone.
That is undoubtedly what is happening with the euro.
Let us not repeat this type of error too much.
In particular, let us preserve flexibility and truly open economic and social co-ordination, in other words not covertly proposing standard solutions to everyone.
Secondly, we need to stop the Convention moving towards a super-State, which would be cumbersome and restrictive.
In particular, we need to entirely reject the European tax that is looming, which would further increase our compulsory contributions, either straight away or later on.
Thirdly, the European Union must help the Member States to only take in immigration that is useful on the labour market.
Influxes of immigrants of every category are weighing too heavily on our public finances and on the workings of our societies.
Yes, we need to help the poorest people more, but we need to do it where they are, and in our mutual interest.
In this respect, the Commission needs to radically change its policy, as I said yesterday when discussing the TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ report.
Fourthly, the Union must defend our interests more forcefully on the international scene.
We are tired of seeing that the Commission is again going to offer the WTO, with the agreement of the Council, a 36% reduction in our agricultural customs duties, destroying the Community preference a little more.
On the contrary, if we want to gently reduce budgetary support, at the same time we need to strengthen the Community preference.
The Member States need to make greater efforts for reform, that is true, but the Union needs to support them and not make their task more difficult.
Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can see what great expectations are placed in you at a time when Europe is in a really difficult economic situation, and I am therefore glad to be able to invite the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Yiannitsis, to address us.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
I am looking in the direction of Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission.
I had been told that you would not be speaking today.
Is that still the case, or do you want to say something after all, Mr President?
Just a brief thank you because Mr Yiannitsis has already replied in such a thorough manner and we are in complete agreement.
I would just like to emphasise the tone of this debate which has been, I would say, characterised by considerable pessimism.
It is clear that this is not the best of times, in both political and economic terms.
Nevertheless, we have a doctrine and rules which all of us here have endorsed.
I can assure you that if we persevere in forging ahead with this doctrine, with these rules, we will not fail to see results.
We have created the largest, and I would say, potentially the most efficient market structure in the world.
We have established rules, and know where we want to go; progress, obviously, is slow because this entails transfers of power and transfers of competence which are always difficult to carry out.
Some States are pushing ahead, others are dragging their heels, but remember that it is our duty - the duty of Parliament and the Commission - to lead everyone back to the course that must be followed and the journey that must be completed.
And you will see that results will not fail to arrive soon.
Thank you, President Prodi, for your encouraging and optimistic message.
We all hope that what you expect will indeed come to pass.
I notify the House that I have received six motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, Chile is a republic which has modified its pension system with measured, appropriate and positive steps concerning workers saving for their pensions through pension funds.
Despite the whole world's incredulity at the Republic of Chile's initiative, the outcome is positive: the finances of the Chilean pension system have been put in order, to such an extent that I propose that the European States should also study this system closely and consider whether it is appropriate to follow its example.
. (FR) This text invites MEPs to give their blessing to an economic agreement between the European Union and the Chilean State.
Once again, commercial concerns are being portrayed as acts of generosity.
We profess that the new association agreement will breath new life into relations between Europe and Latin America at a time when the region is experiencing serious problems.
However, it was precisely the actions of the European company predators that brought Argentina to its knees, and people are trying to make us believe that identical economic exchanges will have beneficial results!
There is no reason to doubt that those exchanges will be profitable for the big investors of Europe.
But for the Chilean population?
A few major wealthy Chilean families will continue to become richer, such as those who have made their fortune from wine.
But making those few people richer will not in any way benefit the general population.
The agreement also proposes the benefit of cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
As we are talking about a country where one of the major criminals of recent history, Pinochet, is enjoying a peaceful existence with the general indifference of the major authorities, that is another reason to reject this draft recommendation!
.
(DE) I am glad that the European Community has succeeded in concluding an association agreement with Chile.
It is particularly important in the wine sector to establish clear rules on such important areas as the recognition of designations of origin and production methods.
Among other things, the agreement includes a comprehensive list of all European designations of origin to be protected in Chile as soon as the agreement enters into force.
This is a significant achievement in view of the fact that, for example, no sparkling wine will be allowed to be sold in Chile under the name of 'champagne', even if the true origin is stated or if 'mÃ©thode champenoise' appears on the label instead of 'Champagne'.
The agreement also prevents trademarks from circumventing the law on designations of origin, so that, for example, the trademark 'Moselle' will lapse at the end of a five-year transitional period for export purposes, as the wine contained in the bottle is not from the Moselle region and the consumer could thereby be deceived.
I do, however, regret the fact that various traditional European terms such as 'Chateau', 'Clos' or Grand Cru' will continue to be permitted in Chile and will, indeed, be legalised internationally.
Such designations could give consumers the wrong idea about the wine's true origin, all the more so as the words are French rather than Spanish.
(Statement of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Yesterday, in the course of the debate, the arguments put forward by Mr Mayol i Raynal and Mrs McKenna persuaded me not to endorse the report by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra in the end.
It is not only about a neutral agreement with Chile, a country where the same language is spoken as in Spain and which deserves support after shaking off dictatorship.
It seems to be yet another fisheries agreement in disguise.
In addition, the present Chilean government is taking little account of the minority which is descended from the indigenous American Indian population, and, as a result of opposition from its Senate, Chile will not for the time being be ratifying the Statute of the International Criminal Court in the Hague.
Under those circumstances, I think that an agreement of this kind is premature, to say the very least.
. (PT) I agree with this report because I feel that it makes a valuable contribution to improving the effectiveness of the decisions adopted in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), to whose Convention the European Union is a contracting party.
The rapporteur's suggestions make the process of documenting catches of this type of fish more rigorous, thereby further enabling us in situ to meet the objectives proposed by the Conservation Commission, by detailing the responsibilities of fishing-vessel captains as regards their declarations concerning fishing areas, quantities caught, the nature of the products in question and information regarding their vessel.
This measure will in fact provide a response to the considerable increase in declared amounts of catches landed outside the Convention zone, but which are thought to be the result of illegal fishing practised in the zone covered by the agreement.
This measure, combined with others already adopted by the Commission such as setting catch limits for Dissostichus spp. in waters covered by the Convention, the mandatory use of an on-board satellite-linked vessel monitoring system (VMS), inspections in ports in which catches are landed and transhipped, and the issue by the flag state of licences or authorisations in respect of Dissostichus spp. fishing, encourages closer monitoring of the fight against the scourge that is the unregulated and undeclared illegal fishing of these species, which have considerable commercial value.
.
(PT) I support this report - basically a technical document - which, in conjunction with the proposal for a Council regulation introducing a Community system of statistical documentation for bluefin tuna, swordfish and bigeye tuna, is the next logical step following the adoption of various programmes, by Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs) in which the European Union participates, to combat illegal, unregulated and undeclared fishing operations for these species of fish.
I am referring to the decisions taken within the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).
Apart from this somewhat involved reason, I agree with the report because I believe that it represents a step closer to achieving greater transparency in this market, contributing to the greatest possible rigour and helping to ensure more effective monitoring of illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing.
Achieving this objective is all the more important because, according to FAO estimates, 30% of fish landed come from such sources, which has disastrous results for the Union and specifically leads to horrendous falls in fish prices.
. (PT) The eEurope programme forms part of the key aim of the Lisbon Strategy and of promoting the opportunities created by the new information and communication technologies (ICT), or what is known as the 'new' economy.
This joint debate on the information society, of which this report is one component, seeks to give a new boost to this 'new' economy, pursuing the idea of a new model and that the ICTs are a type of panacea for economic growth, for job creation and for increasing productivity.
Furthermore, the concept of innovation and the new technologies create new problems, specifically the commercialisation of knowledge and the creation of a two-fold exclusion/marginalisation, in particular for society's most disadvantaged groups and for the regions that are geographically most remote or which have specific problems.
The digital divide will therefore be between those who have and those who do not have access to the benefits provided by the new technologies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, which find it difficult to take full advantage of the new opportunities, because of shortcomings in investment and qualifications, despite greater pressure of competition.
This attempt to provide a new boost, to be decided on at the Spring Council and which has come about in response to the failure of this model, proves that there is no such thing as a new or old economy; there is only economic rationality.
. (PT) I have supported this report, which is closely linked to the Paasilinna and Van Velzen reports, and I welcome the results of the soundings carried out by the European Commission amongst European economic actors and the follow-up given to these soundings.
In fact, material and political investment in the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is becoming an increasing priority.
This investment should encompass society as a whole and I am therefore pleased to see that the European Commission is now adopting a method for assessing and consulting all stakeholders and is launching practical actions to encourage the widespread use of the new technologies, in particular by small and medium-sized enterprises.
I also believe that the Council's request to the Member States to formulate and develop EU standards and codes of conduct for practical application in encouraging the establishment of open e-marketplaces, secure e-business solutions, e-signatures and electronic payment systems is extremely important.
It is becoming increasingly clear to everyone how the widespread use of the new ICTs depends entirely on the degree of confidence stakeholders have towards the security of their transactions and their interoperability. It is therefore crucial to look more closely at this sensitive field and to invest in it more appropriately.
Mr President, on behalf of our group, I wish to make a declaration of vote on the Caveri report. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regrets the fact that, eight years after Austria's accession to the European Union, no solution satisfactory to all parties - on economic as much as on ecological grounds - has yet been found to the problem of goods transport through the Austrian Alps.
In the hope of a speedy solution and of greater planning security, acknowledging the positive efforts of the Danish and Greek Council presidencies, we call upon the Council to act upon the mandate of the Laeken and Copenhagen European Councils by promptly presenting a Common Position that will speed up the decision-making process involved in the joint enactment by the Council and Parliament of a solution accepted by all the parties involved.
I wish to thank the interpreters for their excellent translation of what was far from being a straightforward text.
Mr President, whilst I otherwise hold Mr Caveri in high esteem, I wish to make it known that I have voted against his report.
I believe that it would, in this case, have been better for Parliament to have taken the Danish compromise into account and not gone beyond it.
It is not, in my view, very helpful to tie oneself down to a new line.
I trust that the Council will again do as Mr Poettering, the leader of our group, has just suggested, and get to work on finding a common solution.
The fact of the matter is that even the rule on category 4 HGVs is not entirely without its problematic aspects, as it means that the environment in the affected areas will be subjected to new nuisances.
We have to provide help here as a matter of urgency, and there needs to be greater understanding of this area, which is such a sensitive one.
Mr President, while I was on the aeroplane taking me from Bergamo to Strasbourg, I was reading this report in order to decide how to vote, and I read that the ecopoint system is being extended.
I fell asleep again and in my dream, I saw Austria winning the football world cup in 2006.
Why?
Because it had the most points.
So points are helpful to Austria!
Points which mean it will win the football world championship in 2006, if my dream comes true - and I think it is also the Austrians' dream - but also points in the Caveri report which will enable Austria's citizens to have less pollution, even if the problem has, however, not yet been resolved.
This is why I voted for the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to inform the House that my group and I have rejected the report, and explain why we have done so.
As I said yesterday, Austria does not want to keep its ecopoint system for ever; what we want is a fair and sustainable solution to Europe's transport problems.
For as long as such a thing is not in sight - and, above all else, for as long as the new transport infrastructure directive is not adopted - the transit issue needs to be dealt with by acceptable transitional rules.
It is for this reason that we have not approved today's Caveri report.
We have supported Amendments Nos 19, 20 and 21, as they call for the retention of the ecopoint system and an upper limit for the number of journeys by HGVs until such time as a sustainable solution to the problems of the whole of the Alpine region enters into force.
I see the failure to even vote on Amendment No 18, which is based on the Danish compromise, as sending a very poor message to the people of Austria.
. In the plenary debate on this issue, which took place yesterday, I gave as my opinion that any kind of redistributing road-transport capacity throughout Austria has to be distrusted.
The reason is the heavy pressure of road transport companies in Germany and Italy on Austria to accept heavy trucks which are not allowed to enter neighbouring Switzerland to cross the Alp mountains.
Nevertheless, I announced on behalf of my GUE/NGL Group that a majority of us should accept the proposal for the year 2004 only, because it continues to limit transport.
After I had given my contribution to the debate, the Austrian representatives of all different parties and the Group of the Greens/EFA introduced one very strong argument not only to amend the Caveri-proposals but to reject them as a whole.
This argument is that they become a part of a system to phase out the actual restrictions within a few years.
They have convinced me finally.
As a defender of environment and national self-determination I cannot accept what is happening now, although I respect the contribution of Mr Caveri to find a solution which will be more or less equal to the situation in other parts of the Alps.
So I cannot vote in favour of the Caveri report.
. (PT) We have voted today for a solution intended to establish a degree of balance, which is always hard to achieve in these cases, between protecting the environment and complying with the principle of the free movement of goods, allowing the free movement between 2004 and 2006 of the least polluting lorries and indirectly encouraging these forms of transport to be replaced.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism was right to frame the Austrian problem in a broader, European context, which applies to all Alpine regions, laying down a uniform approach, which also respects the environment in other strategic Alpine hubs.
This was a difficult compromise to reach, and is the outcome of lengthy negotiations within the committee. Consequently, it has both the advantages and the disadvantages of all compromises.
In this context, it is a compromise that is acceptable as a transition towards a definitive situation.
This is why I have voted in favour of the report.
Mr President, Mr Van Velzen has presented us with the Commission's proposal for a directive on the commercial exploitation of public sector documents , chiefly those of the European Parliament.
In that case, I thought, explanations of vote can also be used for commercial exploitation, and I still think so.
Therefore firstly, I cannot fail to vote for this report, in the hope, secondly, that I too will manage to commercially exploit the explanations of vote over these five years at the European Parliament.
Naturally, the profits, if there are any, will go to pensioners who will certainly not snub extremely modest support from the European Parliament, even in this form.
. (FR) We are not going to vote against people having access to public sector information.
However, although they are in favour of transparency, the European institutions are in favour of public sector documents being used by commercial companies to make a private profit.
That is not transparency, it is information to benefit some and misinformation for others.
Transparency alone could, in this area, be useful for the whole population, and would force large companies to make their accounts available to all.
Thus, when companies were preparing to make redundancies, workers and the populations of the regions concerned would be able to see that the profits of the companies in question or otherwise the personal wealth of their shareholders would enable the threatened jobs to be maintained and that as a result the redundancies were not justified.
. (PT) The current situation of publicly accessible re-use of public-sector information varies enormously from Member State to Member State, both in terms of conditions and also of the costs of this re-use.
This field needs to be simplified: everything related to basic information - concerning the democratic rule of law - should be made available free of charge, and other information should be made available at a marginal cost, except in what is known as the 'cultural' sector, for obvious reasons of intellectual and artistic copyright.
This is not a simple issue and divides the supporters of a certain degree of freedom of decision-making in this field by the Member States and their public services from those who advocate a single harmonised market being imposed on these States for the dissemination and re-use of their information.
I have abstained because I am sensitive to these problems, to which I would add the current state of discussions on this matter in my own country.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of the report on the eEurope 2002 action plan.
These reports formalise the principles laid down at successive European Councils for 'an information society for all'.
The current potential for telematic transfer and access provided by the Internet, forces us to march in step with progress.
The same applies to consolidating democracy and the principles of the rule of law.
I agree with the rapporteur when he suggests that public authorities should act as a driving force in developing new content services, encouraging the re-use of the information they have and making marginal charges for this.
The profusion of information held by States should be accessible to everyone, with the proper safeguards for information that is of strategic importance or in the national interest and in line with the rules of the prevailing culture.
This directive does not seek to harmonise the Member States' systems, or access criteria that vary from country to country with regard to information that is universally accessible and information that is not.
This matter should remain within the sphere of each Member State because it is dependent on the specific context of that country.
What seems obvious to even the simplest mind, however, is that we must promote the sharing of information at European level and the establishment of conditions of access to this information as well as rules on charging.
Mr President, this report expresses an opinion on the entry and residence of third country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities.
At the airport, I met some beautiful retired ladies and some retired men who were still youthful, who said to me: 'Why is it that you at the European Parliament only concern yourselves with the movement and residence of workers and citizens in general?
Are you not going to do something for pensioners as well?
We too would like to travel throughout Europe, even if we are from third countries and are not workers, just pensioners.
Will there be a directive in the future which will facilitate the entry into the European Union and movement and residence therein of pensioners too?'
'I am sure there will', I replied.
Therefore, in the meantime, I voted for this report too.
My British Labour colleagues and I have voted in favour of the TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ report, as we support the aim of providing legal channels of entry for those seeking work in the European Union.
The UK, however, has chosen not to opt into this report, in line with its position on maintaining control over admissions.
Nevertheless, Labour Members have actively participated in deliberations on the report, both with a view to establishing a fair set of rights and obligations for third country nationals across the EU, and also with a view to a possible UK opt-in in the future.
For this reason, we have opposed certain provisions that will cause specific problems in the UK.
In particular, I refer to Amendments Nos 2, 55, 27 and 17, which we voted against.
We are mindful that this report comes under the consultation procedure and, although Parliament's opinion is an essential part of the legislative process, these are issues that will ultimately be decided by the Council.
We in the Moderate delegation to the European Parliament are well disposed towards the Commission's proposal, which is a step towards a common EU immigration policy.
Our working principle in relation to labour migration is that someone who has been offered a job should also be able to obtain a work permit.
Furthermore, we believe that authorities are never better placed than employers themselves to know who is best suited for a particular post.
It is important that third-country nationals issued with work permits be able to guarantee they can support themselves during the period that they are resident in the Community.
Because we think it only fair to retain a high level of subsidiarity in immigration policy, we are very keen that the Member States should be able to have rules more generous than those prescribed in the directive.
For reasons of subsidiarity, we have also voted in favour of giving the Member States scope to establish quotas and ceilings where labour migration is concerned.
. (FR) I have already said in the debate that the Commission's proposal on the harmonisation of work permits for nationals from third countries violates subsidiarity and would pass up to Brussels the powers that are essential to the Member States in order to regulate their respective labour markets.
More specifically, such centralisation would cause several problems.
It would make a system that needs to remain flexible and easily adaptable to the local needs of each Member State more rigid.
It would place the Member States in the position of constantly having to defend themselves, as demonstrated by the provision of Article 29, paragraph 4 of the draft directive, which I quoted in the debate, which states that refusals of work permits must be justified.
Finally, it would open the door to a series of other harmonisations, which the European Parliament is well aware of, as with its amendments it has raised its bid for a softer approach.
There was evidence of this from the rapporteur himself when he asked, at the start of his explanatory statement, for an end to the policy of halting immigration that has been largely practised so far.
Such statements at least clarify the hidden intentions of the text.
We condemn this policy, which involves centralisation in order to disarm us further, and we obviously voted against it.
- (DA) The June Movement has, as far as possible, voted in favour of the highest minimum requirements, but voted against whenever there has been a risk of undermining the Danish tax-funded welfare model with its social and civil liberties for all.
We have abstained from voting in this vote because of the above-mentioned conflict.
The rapporteur does not hide the fact that her main preoccupation, when she talks about the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment, is that they should satisfy what she calls 'the needs of the labour market'.
She is thus concerned, as is the Commission, with supplying capitalist undertakings with the labour that they need - something that used to be known as slave trading.
We did not vote against this report, because some of the proposed amendments would make things a little easier for immigrant workers, but we reject the spirit in which this action is being taken.
When the report proposes more flexibility compared with the Commission's report, it is because the rigid regulations contained in the latter, in particular the fact that it is impossible for illegal workers to legalise their situation, or the requirement for stable employment for a sufficiently long period to enable a work permit to be obtained, turn out to be an added burden compared with what the bosses themselves want.
As for the question of illegal immigrants being able to regularise their situation, a question timidly addressed by the report, we reiterate the need for the immediate and unconditional regularisation of the situation of all those who live and work within the territory of the European Union.
- (FR) From the limiting of the administrative or legislative restrictions imposed on would-be immigrants when they arrive on European territory to the extension and simplification of the residence conditions for non-Community nationals in Europe, via the expanded definition of 'family member' or the possibility of collective visas being issued at the border, the list of incentives to take up a career as an immigrant featured in the three reports presented to us yesterday morning is a long one.
Yet in addition to this philosophy of destroying even further our national identities and economies, we must bear in mind the fact that the worst is yet to come.
By May 2004, issues involving asylum, immigration and freedom of movement will no longer be decided by a unanimous vote in the Council, but by a qualified majority together with the European Parliament under the codecision procedure.
In future, therefore, as a result of this reform announced in the Treaty of Amsterdam, nation states will no longer be able to control their influxes of immigrants and their immigration policies.
Other states will be able to decide for them, and compel them to take measures which are contrary to their own national interests.
As a result, without any reaction from European peoples and leaders, we shall see the voluntary wrecking of all the nations of Europe, who will have become totally dependent on Europe's suicidal immigration policy.
- (DA) We have today voted in favour of Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­'s report (A5-0010/2003) on the entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities.
The proposal contains quite a few constructive elements for improving and simplifying application procedures, as well as for ensuring uniform rights for the persons concerned.
We are, however, aware of the fact that this area has to do with circumstances covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position.
. (PT) The directive proposed by the European Commission on which we have voted today aims to harmonise Member State legislation on third-country nationals with regard to migration for the purpose of employment.
It therefore proposes that common definitions, criteria and procedures should be established for the entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities.
The rapporteur states that 'there is no doubt that ? halting immigration must be superseded' on the basis, on the one hand of the 'Treaty of Amsterdam, which confers competence on the Community in the areas of asylum and immigration', and on the other, on what she calls 'actual necessity'.
I beg to disagree and wish to draw your attention to the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market delivered by Mr Wuermeling, which reminds us, and in my opinion quite rightly so, that the Tampere European Council of October 1999 actually called only for an 'approximation' of national legislation in this area, but not for national rules to be replaced by EU rules.
Furthermore, Community harmonisation is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity because rules in this area do not in themselves prove any need for harmonisation. The different rules spring from different needs and traditions in the Member States.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Europe is becoming less and less open to refugees who have had to leave their countries because their lives and freedom were threatened.
Even those who have become well-established are being deported after years of residence because they are not recognised as refugees, and run the risk of being in serious trouble again when they return to their country of origin.
On the other hand, there is an ever-increasing need for people pursuing occupations in which there are shortages in Europe.
Examples are nursing staff from South Africa, the Philippines and South America, and highly trained chemists, physicists and mathematicians from India.
Those people are not naturalised in Europe and are badly needed in their country of origin, which, despite the low standard of living, has often made a considerable contribution to funding their training.
This proposal extends the permits of those people we, in Europe, consider necessary.
Instead, we should be looking a bit more at those who have already become established here, and who hope to be able to stay.
Apart from that, it should not be the case that only the most highly trained people have the right to stay, because that only increases the negative brain-drain effect in their countries of origin.
. (PT) The philosophy of Community immigration policy is quite clear in the proposal for a directive we are currently examining: we will continue to receive immigrants from third countries only if and when these serve the economic interests of the European Union.
Consequently, the proposed conditions of entry and residence for third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment are so restrictive and tough that very few candidates for immigration will be able to meet them.
Such an approach is all the more unacceptable because it is backed by a Community budget that is cutting funds intended for developing countries, because in Monterrey, the EU produced nothing more than a grotesque commitment to allocate only 0.39% of its GDP to public development aid until 2006 - instead of the 0.7% set internationally a considerable time ago; because the policies established at the WTO are not benefiting the poorest countries.
This has led to the gap between the richest and poorest countries growing, to encompass a further 100 million poor people.
It is true that the European Union cannot receive all of the world's poor onto its territory.
On the other hand, this cannot be its response to the problems of poverty in the world and to the racist and xenophobic discourse that has recently been flourishing in some Member States, in total contrast to the humanist values that should be guiding it.
. (PT) I fully subscribe to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's interpretation of Article 63(3)(a) of the EC Treaty presented in the opinion appended to this report.
I believe that by seeking to harmonise all regulatory material concerning immigration for the purpose of employment, the Commission's proposal far exceeds any possible grammatical, logical, systematic or teleological interpretation of these rules, in flagrant breach of the principle of subsidiarity.
Similarly, both the Commission proposal and this report claim that the need for legislation to be harmonised - which would justify this interpretation that goes beyond the Treaties but which contravenes these same Treaties - is based on certain factors, which are invoked, despite the fact that no real evidence for them is presented.
In fact, it is impractical 'to take account of the European Union's labour needs'. I believe that the differences between national legislation are quite acceptable and not damaging; any attempt to artificially standardise this field will be counterproductive and I think that the way in which it is blithely claimed that access will be opened both to external borders and to intra-Community movement is dangerous, because this overlooks the fact that the lack of security is one of the issues of greatest concern to the Union's citizens.
I therefore voted against the report.
It is clear both from the debate and from most of the motions for resolutions that the idea is to draw parallels between Porto Alegre and the economic forum in Davos, on the grounds that both are looking for a better method of global governance.
The facts of the matter are very different.
Although some people tried to play it down and others tried to gear it towards system management or turn it into a meaningless debating club, the movement against capitalist globalisation raised its voice loud and clear against the imperialist war and global social injustice in Porto Alegre.
This movement did not come out of nowhere; it is linked to the struggle by the workers and the working classes and it draws on their experience and messages.
It does not by any stretch of the imagination qualify as cross-class collaboration, as the Social Democrats would have us believe, on the grounds that the basic socialist/capitalist divide no longer exists.
Nor can it confine itself to defending the rights of the developing world, now that the plutocracy has its sights set more firmly than ever on people in the developed world.
The galloping escalation in the divisions within capitalist society will inevitably result in further radicalisation of the grass-roots masses, who are and always will be the force behind social change.
I voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by the Left, which was in line with the social movement and against unbridled globalisation.
Our resolution was rejected - but only just - in favour of a Liberal-Conservative text which goes against the demands of those people who demonstrated at Porto Alegre and Davos.
Our European Parliament has once again confirmed that the majority of its Members are on the Right.
We should not forget this when we come to prepare for the European elections of June 2004!
. (EL) The spread of illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and epidemics in the developing world has taken on genocidal proportions.
Unfortunately, the international community is still addressing this issue with one eye on the interests of the big pharmaceutical multinationals.
The European Union has recently taken a number of positive initiatives within the World Trade Organisation to allow underdeveloped countries to use so-called generic drugs to treat these all-out attacks on the health of their people.
The European Parliament's resolution is an acceptable contribution in this direction.
I voted against the European Parliament's resolution on the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations, for two reasons.
Firstly, the resolution approves the general action of the Commission, which has agreed to undertake worldwide negotiations on the agricultural sector, with the prospect of accelerated liberalisation, even though the content of the reform of the European CAP will not be decided on until later.
In other words, the Commission is trying to force our hand.
Secondly, the negotiating offer submitted by the Commission on behalf of the European Union proposes that export subsidies should be reduced (which is acceptable given the harm that they can cause to poorer countries), but also that there should be an average reduction of 36% in our protection against imports.
In other words, we would be dismantling Community preference just that little bit more.
What we should be doing, in fact, is to establish a general principle of regional preference, in which each country or group of countries has the right to preserve its agricultural model.
In order to do this, we would have to remove agriculture from the WTO rules.
Once again, the Commission is manoeuvring us, and one can only deplore the approval expressed by the French Government at the General Affairs Council on 27 January.
.
(PT) The Commission's proposals on the WTO negotiations on agriculture, which were given unanimous approval by the Council, are a further step towards a substantial liberalisation of farm trade, which maintains the current model, based on promoting exports and insists on the idea that liberalising trade will help developing countries. This overlooks the fact that this approach accentuates food dependency and specialisation based on monoculture for export dominated by the developed countries' food multinationals.
Instead of further liberalisations, these proposals should take account of the injustices of the international trade system and call for the right to food sovereignty and security to be recognised, in other words, the right of all peoples to define their own agricultural and food policies. They should also advocate the right of all countries to ban the trade in GMOs.
The proposal exceeds the framework of Agenda 2000, which had already made excessive concessions to the detriment of small and medium-sized family holdings.
Hence our opposition to any agricultural negotiations within the WTO, which has been giving a further boost to the concentration, intensification and verticalisation of production and in this way, to the elimination of thousands of small and medium-sized holdings, in particular in Portugal.
It should be noted that from the outset this proposal makes the interim review of the CAP a precondition, which demonstrates the hypocrisy of some delegations within the Council.
The European Union's proposal for the WTO negotiations is not compatible with the objectives of the CAP.
Admittedly the joint resolution reminds the negotiators of certain essential points on which they must not make any concessions, so as to protect individual countries' freedom of choice, whether it is a matter of guaranteeing their independence regarding supply or of determining their own agricultural models.
We do not, however, support it, firstly because the opinion of the European Parliament is no longer relevant once the Council has taken its decision and secondly because the resolution does not question the basis of that decision.
How could we maintain farming activities over all the territories involved and protect designations of origin, while at the same time reducing support and opening up more borders, when we have no positive sign that our partners are ready to accept the proposed compensations and limits.
Bringing world prices closer together, below the level of production costs, will offer no prospects, either to the countries of the South or to those of the North.
It is already possible to see that the current proposal, even though it is presented to us with no assessment of its consequences, will compel the European Union to adopt the principle of the decoupling of aid.
Mr President, item 66 of the document on European transport policy seeks to improve road safety.
That is all well and good, very good, but when will we manage to beat the fog?
In other words, when will we succeed in seeing through the fog and having fewer road accidents?
Today, thanks to the progress of technology, we can even see in the dark, with special infrared glasses.
Why do we not spend Europe's money on better research so that, at last, all motorists have fog glasses?
Let us spend our money on this research too, which I am sure will yield positive results, making our roads safer and giving us a European transport policy which is truly the envy of the whole world.
Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report.
In my own country, the issue of the White Paper on Transport is a matter for vigorous debate.
The White Paper on European transport policy points in the right direction, towards the opening-up of the railway market, the revision of the guidelines and of the TENs, and towards taking enlargement - which is almost upon us - into account in the area of transport.
One of the White Paper's proposals is of enormous importance in view of something currently under discussion - the extension of the Austrian ecopoint system.
A proposal for a framework directive to lay down the principles on which charges for the use of the infrastructure were to be imposed on all cross-border carriers was to have been presented as recently as 2002, yet, even today, we wait in vain for this directive on transport infrastructure costs, which is intended to at last facilitate a cross-subsidy, along Swiss lines, for the benefit of environmentally friendly means of transport and to pave the way for the transfer of traffic from road to rail.
Such a transport infrastructure costs directive will be a criterion against which our credibility and the much-invoked European transport policy can be judged.
We need it urgently!
Mr President, the White Paper on transport is undoubtedly an achievement for which we must thank Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, because, for the first time, she has not just laid down market rules, but has proposed to us a proactive strategy in favour of a transport policy that promotes sustainable mobility and favours methods of transport which are non-polluting.
We welcome the fact that our proposals for a European loan to finance trans-European networks, which are currently at a standstill in the Council, have been included.
