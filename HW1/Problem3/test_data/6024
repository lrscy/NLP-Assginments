Madam President, we first need to question the reason why an own-initiative report was proposed, for we have noticed that this method is spreading to many areas.
In Lisbon, it was recommended to apply this method to the information society, research and innovation, company policy, education and training, social inclusion, economic policy, migration policy, etc. However, we have noticed that Parliament's input and control are very restricted.
There is a great lack of transparency in the decision-making process and in the reasons why some elements of the method are, or are not, being used.
This is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to carry out a thorough analysis of the way in which things are being done, which has resulted in a report containing the suggestion that, if the Commission wished to start an open method of coordination, this should require the permission not only of the Council but also of Parliament.
Moreover, the Commission must indicate the components of the method it wants to use.
These components are common targets, common indicators, guidelines, common indicators, a summary report, national reports and recommendations.
These are the conventional components that are used either wholly or in part.
Parliament must give an opinion on the guidelines, the summary report and the recommendations, and the social partners must be consulted on matters relating to social policy and labour.
Finally, the Commission is also asked to draw up a study on the method's effectiveness and on the linking of money from the Structural Funds with the recommendations that have been put to the Member States.
To organise this in a structured manner and to prevent the open method of coordination from being developed in one area or another without Parliament's knowledge, input or codecision, it is necessary to enshrine the general mechanism and Parliament's codecision right in the constitution.
The question is, however, whether we will succeed in doing so?
Judging from the texts drawn up to date by the Convention's Presidency, I notice that we have met with partial success.
For example, it is stipulated that the open method of coordination is applied to economic policy and to employment policy and that - this is an improvement on the current texts - it can be applied to social policy.
It is also stipulated that Parliament must be consulted or informed of the guidelines and recommendations.
Needless to say, this is a step, albeit a small one, in the right direction.
It is in any case more than what was deemed possible at one stage on the basis of the discussions in the Convention.
However, it remains a drop in the ocean.
Parliamentary powers and possibilities for control remain restricted.
Those who are opposed to this method and labour under the illusion that if we do not mention it in the Convention, it will not be used, are, of course, mistaken.
Nobody can stop this method from going ahead.
A simple Council decision without any input from Parliament therefore leads to the method being used in one area or another.
I will illustrate this with migration policy.
If the ministers involved in migration decide to apply the method - also because, for example, they are unable to lay down legislation in this area - the open method of coordination will be applied to migration policy.
Our problem is not so much the fact that it is being applied, but the fact that Parliament has no, or very little, involvement in it.
This is why we said in the committee: fine, let us then, in the Convention, adopt an article clearly stating that it is obviously not prohibited to apply the open method of coordination but if it is, that it should be done in consultation with Parliament.
This was, in fact, the meaning of the article.
We have thus seen that some progress has been made in the Convention, that we have achieved what we wanted to some extent.
However, it is imperfect and incomplete compared to what it should be.
I would reiterate my two key comments: I fear that, on the one hand, the open method of coordination could result in no legislation being laid down and, on the other, that some of the national powers may possibly be removed if the open method of coordination is applied.
There is, in fact, only one solution in both cases, which is: to allow Parliament the right of codecision.
It is precisely the opposition to the open method of coordination that has led to this not being achieved satisfactorily.
I can only say that this is regrettable.
I think that we have drawn up a sound report and I would thank all the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for they have made a marvellous contribution to this report.
Madam President, Commissioner, an ambitious objective was set in Lisbon in spring 2000 that Europe should develop into the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy in 10 years' time.
There were a number of concrete aims associated with the conclusions reached at the summit relating to education, especially training in information technology.
In addition to IT training, the Lisbon process emphasises the importance of lifelong learning.
We on the European Parliament's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are pleased that education is now higher up on the Union agenda.
We need jointly set objectives and indicators and joint action.
The new jobs that are being created mainly demand special skills.
Mastery of IT is nowadays required in most professions.
It is also one of today's areas of civic education, which, if neglected, makes life difficult for people and exposes them to exclusion.
Education is not only a key to inclusion on the part of our citizens, but also a basic prerequisite for our societies to succeed.
It is good that the EU Education Ministers have been able to agree together on concrete aims for education and training and that the Bologna and Bruges processes, aimed at the recognition of qualifications, are under way.
In the opinion of the Committee on Culture, in addition to education and lifelong learning, open coordination is also needed in other areas that come under the job description of the Committee, that is, in policy on youth, the media, culture and sport.
Increased cooperation will boost the functionality of the Internal Market as well as our citizens' prosperity and degree of inclusion.
That way we will create the right conditions for social unity, steady development and belief in the future.
The introduction of open coordination in the field of education has, despite its worthwhile objectives, nevertheless meant problems.
It has increased the power of civil servants and pushed aside both the European Parliament and national parliaments in the way it acquires information and exerts influence.
This cannot continue.
In the resolution it is drafting, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is calling for a clearer and greater role for the European Parliament.
That is necessary for the process to have democratic authority.
The committee is also stressing that the open coordination method must not be allowed to become like other legislative procedures but at the same time a closed procedure which will undermine the legislative aims laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.
In its resolution the committee invites the Council and the Commission to hold talks with the European Parliament in order to establish an interinstitutional agreement on the open coordination method.
The agreement should contain rules on the choice of policy areas to be included in the open coordination method and a process for applying them in a way that is consistent.
The European Parliament must be able to participate in decision-making fully and on equal terms.
In the view of the committee thinks the interinstitutional agreement should contain rules concerning the European Parliament's participation in drawing up aims and indicators.
At the same time we must agree on access to documents, participation in meetings, monitoring progress and the dissemination of information.
What is most important, however, is that open coordination should become a Community process.
It should be decided on by the European Convention, now on the home straight, and at a future Intergovernmental Conference.
Running parallel with the aims of the Committee on Culture is the report by Mrs Smet on open coordination in the field of employment and social affairs, which is being discussed today.
It is good that two of Parliament's committees are playing an active role in the creation of a parliamentary dimension for open coordination, something we obviously need in Europe.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Smet on the exceptional analysis in her report of the open coordination procedure and on the topicality of the debate, given that, as we know, this issue is also being discussed in the Convention.
There are two essential categories of issues.
Those which concern the democratic legalisation of the procedure and those which concern its efficiency.
As far as democratic legalisation of the procedure is concerned, our experience to date is that only in the field of employment is there a legal basis in the Treaty.
It is therefore an open procedure, which is applied with very specific rules defined in the Treaty and Parliament plays a role in this procedure.
It could be much stronger, but it has a role and its opinion is necessary and respected.
However, as Mrs Smet quite rightly said, no legal basis has been used for the other applications of the open coordination procedure.
They have been based on agreements by the Council of Ministers.
Consequently, the role of Parliament is still reduced, even though I must say that both on the issue of combating poverty - where we have an application of the procedure - and on the application of the procedure to pensions, an important effort has been made for us to cooperate with, consult and inform Parliament.
In future, this procedure will certainly play an important role.
We see that it is beginning to appear in numerous individual policies.
The problems of the participation of Parliament, and hence its democratic legalisation, have not only their European but also their national dimension.
In the evaluation we carried out, we saw that, in numerous countries, the national parliaments not only do not participate but also are hardly even told of the targets, commitments and method of implementation of the joint action plans.
I believe, therefore, that with the discussion taking place in the Convention, it is very important for there to be an article covering the open cooperation procedure, determining the role of Parliament and, as the Commission has proposed, for there to be a special reference to the application of this procedure to social protection, where there are various problems, given that many of these competences in the social sector are national.
Now as far as the area of efficiency is concerned, I would agree with the report that a national and European evaluation of the results plays a very important role in year-on-year improvements.
Our first experience is the evaluation of the European strategy, of the application of the procedure in the area of employment carried out in 2002, while we shall have the evaluation of the application in the field of pensions in 2006.
A second element relating to efficiency is if there will be financing of the application of the procedure.
We must say here that, so far, there is experience concerning financing of the strategy for employment by the social fund and financing of specific guidelines, mainly those directed at human resources, and we believe that, for the area of enlargement in particular, for the new countries which will be called on to participate in the implementation of the procedure, but with reduced resources, the social fund can play a very important part.
Finally, I should like to refer to the observation in the report that mainstreaming the gender dimension in all Community policies can also play a very important role in the application of the open coordination procedure, given that this is where individual targets which might concern equality of the two sexes are always identified.
Madam President, I would just like to speak about the part for which Mrs Diamantopoulou is not responsible, namely culture, youth, education, media and sport.
But I think you are also representing Mrs Reding here.
Before the report was even planned by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we had already made an enquiry to this effect, but then - for whatever reason - it was delayed for months.
So at last we are getting together to debate this issue, and together we should try to make the best of it.
We realise that these coordination procedures exist, and as a European politician I would actually be pleased if some people - people in positions of responsibility, politicians - would coordinate their activities.
These people, however, are precisely the people who are usually trying to deny us our authority.
They coordinate their activities in areas where they do not want to grant us any responsibility at all: in the field of culture and education.
They are suddenly coordinating in these areas without being accountable to us. This strikes us as rather suspect.
The problem is that we are being treated like NGOs in this area.
We are not NGOs, however, but elected representatives, and we ought to know what exactly is being negotiated in our name behind the scenes.
Moreover, it is not only the Council that is content with this; the Commission too, unfortunately, is very pleased about it.
You see, in this way it has managed to oust an awkward player from the field.
The Council and the Commission have joined forces here - which could even be a good thing, but I would like to use Machiavelli's words here and say, 'Not every end justifies the means'.
For this reason, I believe that we have to be very cautious in this case, and that we should expect to be included.
It has now transpired that what has developed is an intergovernmental method.
And once something like this has got under way, is it very difficult to stop it again.
Although we now know that the Convention, which has little to say about coordination, declared its opposition to the open variety of it, we also know that all national presidents should coordinate with each other, where the need arises, even in instances not necessarily covered by the Treaty.
We really need to be careful, however, not to let ourselves be excluded.
From the point of view of culture and education, I can actually say that it is really hypocritical that we are not allowed to be active in precisely those areas where we would be happy to be involved.
Then, in a roundabout fashion, in the context of this open method of coordination, we have the same things that we would be happy to do, but we are not included.
This is simply unacceptable, and we must fight against it.
We should recall that an intergovernmental method may not be introduced indirectly.
We should see to it - including by means of today's debate - that this existing intergovernmental method, in other words open coordination, is converted into a Community method.
If heads of governments or individual ministers recognise something to be right and necessary and important, then this too should be converted to the Community method, so that we, as elected representatives of our peoples, can participate.
I ask that this be taken into account and thank all those who were involved.
Madam President, I do not think I need to go over the ground already covered by Mrs Pack.
I am here to illustrate an oral question tabled by Mr Rocard on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, who is unable to be here this evening to illustrate it himself.
The oral question refers to points which have already been illustrated by both Mrs Iivari and Mrs Pack, in other words the fact that we in the Committee on Culture have often realised that many of the measures debated subsequently by the Council are developed according to a coordination method from which we are excluded.
We have been faced with measures which have already been adopted, on which we were only able to express an opinion after the event, despite the coordination method, which it would be extremely useful actually to apply to Parliament too.
With this question, we are asking the Commission, firstly, whether it can provide any guarantee that the measures the Council adopts in future using the coordination method will be notified to Parliament and the Parliamentary committees in good time for them to be able to examine them and express opinions, and secondly, to specify - despite the fact that, in this situation, everything seems to depend on the Convention now - whether it has any proposals to make regarding the wider application of the open coordination method with a view to avoiding Parliament being excluded.
The Members who have spoken before me have already covered all these points fully. We would now like to raise them once again in this oral question as specific questions to which we await a response from the Commission.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this report, although our group is also left with quite a few questions on this topic.
I recently attended a large pensions conference where open coordination was warmly welcomed in the area of pensions.
There are a number of issues, for example in the areas of pensions, employment, asylum, immigration - to which some reference has already been made - which require a solution at European level, and where, in most cases, a legal basis is lacking.
The open method of coordination was a godsend.
Despite this, there are also people - including some in my group - who are opposed to the open method of coordination.
They are mainly against it on account of the problem cited by Mrs Smet, namely the lack of democratic legitimacy.
A number of speakers have echoed this.
If we pursue the open method of coordination - of which I am in favour, as also, in fact, is my group - a number of points should be addressed.
These have to do with democratic legitimacy.
Both the national parliaments and the European Parliament will need to be involved.
It is unacceptable for Parliament to be consulted only if it is considered opportune to do so.
Parliament will need to be consulted systematically.
Mrs Smet's report also dealt with another aspect that I should like to bring to your attention.
The big players in this field are, in fact, people in closed, high-level committees who work out virtually every detail and who then submit their ideas to the Council.
I think that this does not benefit public involvement.
Citizens feel represented by their Members of Parliament.
They want to be able to talk to Members of Parliament about things that are happening or arrangements that are being made and over which, at a given time, they lose any sense of control.
So, no matter how sound the system could be in itself, this democratic control will need to be in place.
Another point that has already been mentioned is the issue of indicators.
If we want to compare the facts in a number of areas of policy, the facts will need to be comparable.
Very clear indicators will therefore need to be put in place which can be measured exactly if a comparison is to be drawn between the Member States.
To cut a long story short, I welcome Mrs Smet's report being discussed at this time.
In my opinion, we should ask the Commission to come to an agreement with the Member States to the effect that, if this open method of coordination is maintained in future, at least a number of basic conditions will have to be met.
Madam President, I am pleased that Mrs Smet has prepared this report and am very much in agreement with her concerning many aspects of it.
I am very well disposed towards the open coordination method.
I am, however, also a little concerned that it is often regarded as a sort of soft legislation and poor man's alternative to ordinary legislation, or as something that should only be used in emergencies.
I think in precisely the opposite terms.
I think that legislation must be applied when there are no other options and when authority, strength and discipline are genuinely needed.
A number of public tasks can, however, successfully be carried out other than by using laws, discipline, compulsion and the whip hand.
The open coordination method is a modern form of project administration.
It is used for the public sector when it is aiming for change, development and ongoing renewal and when it needs to be able to change its methods of working to keep pace with accumulating experience.
It is perhaps no coincidence that the open coordination method has grown out of those societies that are run as market economies, in which the public sector must be as flexible and efficient as the market at its best.
I therefore find it pathetic to hear representatives of the right-of-centre parties say that they do not want this flexible and efficient market tool but, instead, an old-fashioned bureaucratic, controlling and law-governed form of government in the public sector.
That is something I find odd.
I think that the open coordination method should be written into the constitution so that - and I think this is important - it is generally accepted.
I am, however, extremely concerned that it is to be incorporated with prescriptions as to how it is to operate, which methods it is to use and which processes it is to comprise etc.
That is what happens with a traditional legal text but, in this case, it would be a question of putting strict parameters around a method that ought to be adaptable, flexible and versatile and putting a straightjacket on it. It would then be nothing like so effective.
I support the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on that point.
I have also myself tabled an amendment that, to my great surprise, went and got voted down by the committee.
I am now tabling it again.
It is about the fact that the open coordination method is also a cooperation, and not only a coordination, method.
It cannot be based upon sanctions and penalties.
In common with other free social relations, it must be based upon trust and respect.
We cannot therefore make use of naming and shaming and worst practices.
What we need are best practices.
That is where the focus must be. Otherwise, this method and its possibilities will be spoiled.
It is different from the legislation method, and it would therefore be quite wrong if, inspired by ancient legal tradition, there was considered to be a need for disciplining, penalising and singling out those who are disobedient.
This method is quite different.
I should like to see this method promoted.
That is how it has come to be used in a number of European societies.
It is not so widespread everywhere, but it is usual in the Scandinavian countries I myself come from, where it plays an extremely progressive role.
It is also more prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
It is not, however, to be found in certain other countries which have much more traditional administration systems.
I believe that we must move towards this open, democratic and modern cooperation method.
I particularly wish to emphasise the word 'democratic' - democratic being what the method in fact is, albeit in a way not involving legal and judicial control.
Madam President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and very incisive explanatory statement, and welcome the Commissioner's statement this evening.
As we have heard, the open method of coordination is now being used in a wide variety of areas.
At times it appears to be addictive, as that list gets longer and longer.
There is an obvious need for a common approach and to edge very cautiously towards agreement, for example in the field of immigration and its close links to employment and social inclusion.
However, as Members have said, this is certainly not a publicly-owned process and at times it has a very questionable democratic legitimacy, because it can appear to be almost a creeping backdoor assumption of competences by the European Union, and not sufficiently open and in the public domain.
There are interesting imbalances within it.
I thoroughly concur with the Commissioner: when the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been on delegations to various Member States and met its partner committees or European Affairs Committees in the national parliaments and asked them about their involvement in the national action plans - on employment or social inclusion, for example - it has received blank looks, because they have never heard of it: it is not something in which their government has involved them.
One British minister admitted that the trade unions and the Confederation of British Industry in the UK had more influence on the national action plans on employment than the British Parliament, which had never ever discussed them - although that situation is now changing, since the new Committee on Works and Pensions came into being - what an exciting name that is.
We certainly need a framework for the open method of coordination which is clear, is democratically controlled by this Parliament, national parliaments and sub-national parliaments - which in some Member States are those with responsibility for particular issues.
We get that clarity by the process currently being established, so that people have an idea of what to expect and where the points of intervention might then be for relevant NGOs, etc.
The Constitution is probably the best place for this information in terms of public access and awareness.
Our group is not convinced that an interinstitutional agreement is sufficiently known to and understood by the public.
There are issues about the timescales of consultation which our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has certainly suffered from.
Therefore, we need to build into this method time for real consultation, not just here in Parliament but also for NGOs to exercise their own internal democracy in making their contributions as well.
Madam President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for their involvement in the debate this evening.
Picking up from what some of the other Members have said, each of us recognises the benefits of the open method of coordination.
As we have recognised and experienced ourselves, it can lead to better opportunities for the creation of frameworks in which actions can be taken, without the strict rigidity of legislation or regulation.
The other institutions should recognise and realise that Parliament is very responsible in arriving at its opinion when it is given time to be consulted.
One of the most important issues we need to stress here tonight is that this Parliament has the ability, the innovation and indeed the skill to meet deadlines.
However, merely throwing it to Parliament when there is no time available to put a reasoned and responsible viewpoint forward is a bigger insult to Parliament than not consulting it at all.
If we consider the question of the guidelines which we discussed this week, we see the difficulties and problems that were created, simply because we were not given the information in time.
We should not be seen as an enemy of the Council and the Commission, nor as a subservient body, but as a willing and equal partner to them.
With regard to the question of whether an institutional agreement or an article in a proposed treaty or Constitution is the best place for this, I personally have not made up my mind on that point.
However, I am inclined to favour an interinstitutional agreement as the best way forward, probably because it offers flexibility for us to alter and change in the future.
But for us to agree to that, and for our representatives in the Convention to go along that line would require some faith from our point of view that we would be given more powers and consulted on a wider basis by the Commission and the Council when they look at these issues in the future.
Before I conclude, the question of consultation with national parliaments is one that we continually stress here in Parliament. That is because we recognise that parliaments, by their very nature, are the true democratic representatives of the peoples of the Member States of the European Union.
Parliaments therefore have a right to be consulted and not to be bypassed over issues that impact directly on the lives of people within the European Union.
It is essential that national parliaments be part of this method and, indeed, if we look at the draft Constitution which we have before us, there is a requirement with regard to legislation being transmitted to national parliaments.
It is quite possible also that in an open method of coordination, the national parliaments would also have transmitted to them the proposals which are coming before this Parliament and other institutions.
In conclusion, I will be supporting Mrs Smet's report on the basis that the procedure does not seek to harmonise policies or converge policies, but facilitates compatibility, facilitates flexibility and encourages dissemination of best practices and exchanges of ideas.
Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur warmly for the report.
I believe it to be important for two reasons.
First of all, based on the experience that we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have gathered, the rapporteur has drawn up a very practical assessment of what has happened in the different open methods of coordination.
Secondly, it is also important because she offers solutions.
In her intervention a moment ago, she herself indicated the dangers which the method entails.
Mrs Jensen and Mr Schmid have tabled amendments which put these dangers into extra sharp focus.
If we were to follow their solutions, particularly those of Mr Schmid, it would mean we would be maintaining bureaucratic mills full of civil servants talking among themselves and organising cosy conferences, where something may occasionally get done, but where no real results will ever be achieved - and if they were, they would remain behind closed doors.
The good thing about the open coordination process as we know it now is that the facts and figures will now at least be on the table.
As you know, the process started with a decision taken by Heads of State and Government, who decided at a given time to produce honest figures on employment.
This was an extremely important achievement at the time.
Nobody produced honest figures with regard to employment.
Those figures are important.
The question is then, of course, to what extent the common targets can be further pursued.
There are risks.
The risks are two-pronged, as Mrs Smet mentioned earlier.
There are thus the bureaucratic mills, on the one hand, where nothing happens and which are, from the citizens' point of view, a waste of time.
On the other hand, there is the risk that coordination will be taken to extremes.
This is mainly a fear in Germany, which is understandable, if you know the situation in Germany, where certain powers are delegated to the federal states.
Culture and education fall within the remit of the federal states in Germany.
Member States will then start pooling this power.
Then what?
Numerus clausi will then be agreed upon as if Germany were one country.
This is, of course, not federalism, but exactly the opposite.
It is, therefore, understandable that German MEPs, in particular, have problems and are concerned that this method, via the backdoor, would lead to a horrible kind of harmonisation which involves neither this Parliament nor the citizens.
This is very understandable.
So it is particularly pleasing, in my view, that this report offers a solution.
The solution is that this Parliament is to give its authorisation not for applying the method but whether a method is put in place in a certain area.
I am certain that, if we take the area of culture as an example, something like this can only achieved if Parliament plays its part in such coordination.
This is of key importance and this is why this authorisation is so important.
This is why I am, at present, strongly opposed to Mrs Jensen's proposal, which would prevent us from making any progress.
For four years now, we have been trying to conclude an interinstitutional agreement, without success, as the Council says that it is not provided for in the Treaty.
A change is therefore to be made to the Treaty.
Mrs Smet has submitted a request to this effect and this is why I believe that we should all give our unqualified support to the solution presented in this report.
Madam President, I would like to begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Smet on her truly remarkable report, the principal virtue of which is its timeliness.
The open coordination method has become the general rule on the basis of our experience of the Luxembourg process and of the possibilities opened up by Articles 126 and 128 of the Treaty; it is a timely process, because this generalisation has also allowed many issues to be raised in Parliament - in relation to insufficiencies and gaps which have repeatedly been condemned and which should be resolved - and because the Convention is about to produce a constitutional Treaty, offering Parliament a great opportunity to make its voice heard.
It is therefore a timely project and a highly topical initiative, because the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference are going to offer us the opportunity to overcome these difficulties, which, as other Members have pointed out, relate to certain fundamental visible deficiencies, the lack of openness - despite being called an open method - and also the inefficient coordination.
We therefore have an excellent opportunity and Mrs Smet's initiative offers us an excellent reason to continue working.
Secondly, Mrs Smet has done great work, a great report, into which she has incorporated the best ideas emerging from the debates we have held in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We socialist Members of course feel very comfortable with this report; although you and I, Mrs Smet, are very far apart physically and ideologically, we are in fact very close on this issue since you are truly dealing with and resolving our group's main concerns.
You establish a balance between all the institutions, you spell out the role of the Commission and give Parliament a central role, thereby overcoming the significant democratic deficit we have observed.
You open up channels for transparency, in order to incorporate all the players - national and regional parliaments, NGOs, social actors - which we value highly.
You call for an institutionalisation of the Treaty - which we believe to be essential - you define the scope in order to prevent this method from replacing or encroaching on areas in which there are Community instruments of a legislative nature - I believe you do this very well - and, finally, you guarantee that assessment work is carried out so that the method may be effective.
We socialist Members, Madam President, are therefore going to give this report our fullest support and we hope that it will assist in European integration and help to provide European problems with a European solution, even going somewhat further than mere intergovernmentalism.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on their successful and fruitful open coordination!
Open coordination - it sounds like a really modern logo.
Coordinating political activities and political strategies requires a great deal of logic, and we are not always used to this in the work of politics.
It is really very welcome!
I had a few problems at home, trying to explain this open coordination to the Austrian public.
We do not yet have a tradition of this in the way the Scandinavian countries do, for example.
The first question people asked me at home was 'And what role does Parliament play in it?'
I had to explain to them everything I have heard here this evening, and everything we hear over and over again in the committees.
'Of course', the citizens said, 'not just out of respect for you as a Member of Parliament, and not only as a right that a Member of Parliament must assert for herself and on behalf of the population: we demand democratic legitimisation of this wonderful opportunity!'
Now, as to whether open coordination is indeed such a wonderful opportunity, as I have said, I have no experience to date; I am not yet a fan.
Neither am I sure that conversion to the Community method is really the recipe for solving matters.
I believe that we must look more closely at the details, which means that the three institutions must sit down at the table.
This does not mean an act of mercy towards the European Parliament, but open, fair negotiations among the three institutions.
It is all about the details: how is Parliament to be involved?
How are we to have access to documents?
What rules should we put in place?
If we really do make good progress in this regard, I may yet become a fan of open coordination.
In the field of culture, media, sport, education and youth, it would also be a possible step towards a kind of European cultural policy, but please do not misunderstand: I am in no way referring to harmonisation of national cultural policy, but rather to effective coordination of common policies in order to achieve common goals together.
Because, as we all know, we are simply not strong enough on our own - particularly in these sensitive areas.
This is the reason for my request, and I cannot repeat it often enough.
I believe that Parliament came close to speaking with one voice here. This is what is expected of Europe in many areas.
Let the Commission consider us a partner and coordinate with us - openly!
Madam President, since the European Council of Lisbon in March 2000, the Member States have agreed that the open coordination method should be extended as an instrument from employment to other areas.
Best practice should be disseminated, and quantitative and qualitative indicators laid down; European directives should be implemented in national and regional policy, while of course observing the principle of subsidiarity, and put into practice in national action plans.
So far, so good.
But if one begins to get the impression that it is about levelling down, or if it comes to setting social policy standards without a proper legal basis for doing so, or if there is perhaps an attempt to dictate to Member States and to sideline national regulations, then the OCM is not acceptable in its present form.
It is certainly possible and sensible to strengthen cooperation among the Member States in policy areas where the European Union has only limited power.
It must, however, be geared towards improving the exchange of information and experience.
When applying the OCM, meanwhile, the competence boundaries set out in the Treaties must be taken into consideration.
Many fellow Members have already voiced their criticism on a number of serious issues.
This instrument can only be complementary, and by no means represents an alternative, to important legislative measures.
At the same time, the European Parliament may not be ignored any more than national parliaments.
On this point too, I agree with the previous speakers.
We in the European Parliament often see ourselves being put under pressure of time.
For example, when the European Commission consults us on the annual Guidelines on the European Employment Strategy, but sends us the reports so late - I had to go through this myself at the beginning of the year - that thorough, professional consultation suffers as a result.
The OCM is formulated by national experts, who are doubtless top-notch, but they develop the content of the OCM without legitimisation by Parliament.
The European Parliament is the only Community institution capable of exercising control over these political processes, including the OCM.
I support the demand of Mrs Smet that national parliaments too should be given due influence, and we must not forget the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Regional Policy, and the social partners, who must likewise be consulted.
What is more, they must be consulted from the outset. Despite all the important points made in this report, despite the planned request to the Commission to first of all draw up a study, and despite the call for a broad-ranging debate on the effectiveness of the OCM, I still have serious reservations about a method that takes this form and is based on these principles.
Madam President, the specific fundamental assumption of the oral question tabled by Mr Rocard is whether the open method of coordination should be applied to all fields of activity covered by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and not only to those fields that are directly linked to the Lisbon strategy, that is, education and lifelong learning.
In fact, the reason for deciding on these areas is absolutely identical to that which applies to the two that I have just mentioned.
This was also covered by the willingness expressed by the Lisbon Council to extend open coordination to other areas.
Since this is the case, it would be desirable also to apply the policy of open coordination, to which the European Parliament is fully committed, to the areas of culture, youth, the media and sport.
There are de facto practices that, incidentally, could legitimise this course of action.
This is the only way in which Parliament will be able to deliver an opinion, on a solid basis and on time, thereby usefully contributing to finding better solutions, with greater democratic legitimacy, before the Council considers any relevant initiative, to ensure that national and regional policies can also implement European policy guidelines.
Nor can we understand how Parliament can merely be a passive spectator in this and in other matters.
If this procedure has already proved to be relevant and necessary in a Union of 15 Member States, it will be all the more relevant and necessary in a Union of 25.
European policies that create European added value must also be discussed by the direct representatives of the European peoples.
We therefore need an interinstitutional agreement that provides for Parliamentary intervention in order to ensure that not only rules but also policies are established coherently, based on objectives and having indicators, entailing access to documentation and participation in steering meetings and in meetings for studying the progress made, providing information on the reports and best practices, in a process that develops the open method of coordination as the Community method.
Parliament should, therefore, be able to act in a timely and relevant manner before the Council takes its decisions.
The Commission should formulate proposals to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in the method adopted in Lisbon.
It is in this context that the oral question tabled by Mr Rocard, Chairman of the Committee on Culture, becomes most relevant.
Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome this discussion enormously.
I also thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, because had it not been for this initiative on the part of Mrs Smet, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport would probably not be in the situation at all where our enquiry is being debated at least in this Parliament.
Mrs Pack pointed out that the Committee on Culture has been waiting for months for our questions - just the questions - relating to applying coordination in the field of culture, education, youth, the media and sport to be dealt with here at all.
This makes it abundantly clear that something is not right with the system.
The debate this evening is an opportunity to lay the issues on the table, and I hope that we will also come to some conclusions.
The method of open coordination can certainly make an important contribution to helping us meet the public's expectations, and to improve coordination in important areas of policy where we do not want harmonisation.
In my experience, however, this process will not gain public approval if it is not a democratic process.
And to date it has not been democratic; it has been intergovernmental.
This is why it is up to us to do something about it.
If we believe efficiency to be contradictory to democracy, or flexibility or transparency contradictory to the responsible involvement of Parliament, then this - in my opinion - is indeed a sad reflection on our own shortcomings.
This is why I hope that this debate and report can help to ensure that we finish our homework within a few weeks after the conclusion of the Convention, and that this House - and especially the two committees concerned - can respond to these questions.
Madam President, I cannot support the report as a matter of principle.
The objective of the so-called open method of coordination is to have a legislative effect in various areas of policy, and there is no proper legal basis for this in the EU Treaty.
This means that the Council and the Commission can create competences at the European level at will without having the legitimacy to do so.
This does nothing for legal clarity or for legal truth, and it certainly does nothing to gain public acceptance.
I also know, however, that coordination in various areas is already possible, definitely necessary and perfectly sensible.
We can always learn from others.
But turning this legal, voluntary coordination into a set of quasi-legislative instruments and conferring on it, moreover, the power to apply sanctions, makes European actions completely incomprehensible.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of which I too am a member, knows exactly how sensitive and varied are the traditions in individual Member States; the fact that it is precisely this committee that is approving this presumptuous acquisition of competences by the back door, as it were, in an own-initiative report, is, I think, much to be regretted.
We have always promoted a clear delimitation of competences for Europe and respect for competences in the nations and regions, which demand these things, and open coordination amounts to a slap in the face for them.
Furthermore, I could not celebrate the involvement of Parliament in this method as a great achievement, because it would not actually change anything about it.
Indeed, I believe it would make matters even worse, because it would give a veneer of democracy to this method, which in no way corresponds to the principles of the rule of law.
Thank you, Mrs Stauner.
At the close of this debate I have received a draft resolution on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the report (A5-0150/2003) by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a framework for the promotion of employee financial participation [COM(2002) 364 - C5-0527/2002 - 2002/2243(INI)].
Madam President, Commissioner, the own-initiative report before us by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs relates to the Commission communication on a framework for promoting employee financial participation, in other words, employee participation in profits and productive capital.
The communication is intended to kick-start studies and research projects on the opportunities and risks involved in a policy of a broad distribution of assets.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the setting up of a working group of independent experts to present proposals to overcome the various problems relating to employee participation.
The focus in this context is on transnational obstacles in enterprises operating across national borders concerning different levels of taxation for participants.
A detail: my report proposes that, in the case of share options, tax should only be payable when the shares acquired by way of option conversion are successfully sold.
This would make sense especially if employees, and not only top-level management, are to be given stock purchase rights.
The primary concern of the Commission communication is to strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy in accordance with the Lisbon strategy decisions.
The Commission proposed a productivity-related wage policy as far back as the Delors White Paper on Employment.
Restraint in terms of cash wage increases, it suggested, would lead to higher profits and thus to investment, in other words to the creation of jobs.
The opinion of our committee is that it is not enough to say thank you to employees for their modesty and understanding; instead, on the basis of voluntary schemes, they should have a share in the profits and investments that would not have been possible without their restraint.
We support and complement the general principles developed by the Commission: first of all, schemes must be voluntary, in other words, both employers and employees must agree to them.
Second, all employees must be included in the participation scheme.
This means that part-time employees - often women - must not be excluded, in other words, there must be no discrimination against women.
Wherever possible, unreasonable risks should be avoided, especially in the case of employees of small and medium-sized enterprises.
They face a double risk in the event of insolvency, namely that they could lose both their job and the value of their shares.
The Commission has clearly set out its proposals for profit and equity participation in larger enterprises in particular, especially in public limited companies.
Here, we could learn from the experience of other countries, especially countries that are models of participatory schemes, such as Britain and France.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs recommends that more consideration should be given to the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises, and that participatory schemes which are also feasible for small and medium enterprises should be promoted at national level.
The Committees on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on Economic and Monetary Affairs and on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have given important answers to the many questions relating to profit and equity participation.
They have presented their opinions very well, and I thank them for this.
Special thanks also goes to the Commission for its valuable suggestions.
The consultations in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were very constructive, for which, thanks once again to all the parliamentary groups and to all the shadow rapporteurs.
Here, to conclude, is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on one or two burning issues: first, because employees with equity participation are more motivated, an increase in productivity is likely.
This leads to lower unit costs, which increases the volume of sales, with the resulting possibility of creating more jobs.
The broad spread of ownership also increases willingness to invest, because fairer distribution of wealth stabilises the structure of society.
Second: we need an enterprise law that coordinates co-ownership and cooperation.
The new enterprise law must ensure that employees are no longer outsiders, but members of the enterprise.
In 'Quadragesimos Annos' this is formulated as follows: the work-contract should be developed to become a partnership-contract.
Through ownership and participation, employees become co-workers and co-workers become sharers in ownership and management.
The goal is to make employees economic citizens with equal rights.
Let us embark on the path towards this goal.
It is in this spirit that I call upon you to approve the present report.
Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Menrad and all the Members who helped draft this report and highlighted the need for this debate on employee financial participation at European level to be restarted.
I shall start by saying that I think it is very important that both the Commission and Parliament agree that there are huge differences between the institutional frameworks in the Member States and thus it is not possible for us to talk about the need to harmonise legislation and practices between the states in the field we are examining today.
It is important that we evaluate the experience of countries in which this model has been used and where it has been proven, in accordance with the studies which we have at our disposal, that it increases the productivity and competitiveness of companies, and use this experience in order to give this practice added European value.
I agree with the opinion expressed in the report that the Commission can encourage the older as well as the new Member States which do not have this legislative framework, so that they proceed to a fiscal framework and to an employee financial participation framework, based mainly, as I said, on the results which we have from countries in which it is applied.
Within this framework, I am delighted to say that the Commission welcomes the setting up of the group of independent experts, which has already started work and will report to us in October and which is currently examining the obstacles faced by companies that wish to apply the employee participation system but have companies in more than one country, which is basically a serious obstacle to large companies operating at European level.
I would highlight the need, to which Mr Menrad also refers, for national practices and national legislation to follow a series of principles, the most important of which is the need to minimise the financial risks to employees.
The report concludes with specific proposals calling on the Commission to conduct a comparative performance analysis between countries and models, to undertake studies on the forms of participation which are most suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises, where the problems are different, and to proceed to draft a paper on trade union and management aspects, attaching, of course, special importance to the issue of gender equality.
I should like to assure you with regard to all the foregoing that the Commission will promote all these proposals to the greatest possible extent and to say that, as we speak, the Commission is already drafting a study on precisely this subject, in cooperation with the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, together with a framework of comparative evaluation indicators.
Once this study is completed, the Commission will come back and submit a new report and this report will be within the framework of the actions to which we committed in the Commission communication for 2000-2004.
Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for insisting on having a debate on this issue because it is indeed a very important subject.
May I also thank the Secretariat for scheduling this debate, yet again, at such a late hour, even though it means that some of us who started in this House at breakfast time have already been here for over 13 hours.
I must confess that I am again in contravention of the EU Working Time Directive and, as a good European, I should not break European law.
I am sure I would be in the Commission's bad books by so doing.
I hope I will be forgiven, at least on this one occasion.
Having said that, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the spirit in which he has approached this complicated subject and the way in which he has embraced amendments from all sides, certainly including some of my own.
I would make just one tiny criticism - which I hope he will not take as nit-picking, as we say in the UK - but it is a compliment to him, rather than a criticism.
I felt that his original version of one of the recitals was better than the compromise.
Recital D stated 'whereas it is neither necessary nor desirable and practicable to harmonise the rules for financial participation schemes, as this would impede the flexibility of Member States' policies'.
That was absolutely spot on.
But, as he knows, there was a compromise with the PSE Group that stated 'as yet neither necessary nor desirable and practicable to harmonise fully'.
That was perhaps a mistake, because there is no need whatsoever to harmonise policies in this respect.
We are exactly on the right lines as we are.
But that is a very small point.
I am very much in sympathy with the thrust of his report.
Personally I will be supporting his report wholeheartedly and I shall be encouraging all my colleagues to do the same.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the financial participation of employees in companies is a matter of intense debate.
Recent events relating to the collapse of various companies that had systems of employee participation in capital demonstrate the potential risks linked to this system.
The case of Enron and others like it show how crucial it is to study the consequences of applying existing systems, to look more closely at the various alternatives for participation, whether they are associated with pension plans or linked to participation in capital, profits or share options.
Previous experiences not only warn us of the risks but also raise many doubts about the incentive that employee participation schemes might provide for job creation and about the dangers of these being used in order to get around labour legislation and to call into question workers' rights, specifically in the field of pay, work organisation and hours, equal opportunities for men and women and maternity and paternity rights.
We must all bear in mind the increasing volatility of the financial markets.
Applying the private profit approach to the financial resources of national pension systems and, to some extent, the salaries and savings of employees, which is what the financial participation of employees entails, means increasing the risk of financial crises and the socio-economic consequences of these, as the rapporteur in fact states: it means putting employees at a dual risk because in the event of the company's bankruptcy they will lose both their job and the value of their shares.
There are obviously various types of financial participation that could generate management schemes.
The discussion is not, however, about the 'how' but more about the basic 'aim' of the proposal.
We cannot allow it to be used to interfere in the process of setting salaries and to exert pressure for making the labour market more flexible.
Our fellow Member Mr Menrad has sought to establish some rules, specifically on collective bargaining, arguing that pay increases should not be conducted at the same time as negotiations on financial participation or even that employee participation must be an additional element and must not replace the normal salary or other pay components such as pension schemes.
The option of signing up to participation schemes must clearly always be voluntary and never lead to discrimination between employees or call into question other forms of participation in company life, particularly in the field of union activity.
Madam President, I believe that the promotion of employee financial participation is very important both for company employees and for the development of companies.
Perhaps greater participation and, thus, also a greater acceptance of responsibility can even help make companies more successful and profitable and so contribute to increased employment and increased access to capital.
Some people even maintain that the development of various types of financial participation systems could be a possible way of achieving increased growth and faster compliance with the Lisbon strategy objectives.
That would be a mercy worth quietly asking for, since the Lisbon objectives appear more and more to be taking on the character of illusions.
Whatever the case may be, profit-sharing systems of various kinds can in any event create good incentives for employees, give rise to greater enthusiasm for the job in hand and strengthen the link between company and employees.
To that extent, we are in agreement, Mr Menrad.
When it comes to these aspects of the content of the report, I think that Mr Menrad has done some quite excellent work and carried out a good analysis of the problems that, in spite of everything, are involved in this issue.
I do not however share the view that this is something that should be decided or debated at EU level.
The rapporteur has himself written in the report that it is unnecessary to harmonise the provisions for financial participation systems and that it is neither desirable nor practicable to do so, either, because it would impede the flexibility of Member States' policies.
I agree with that.
Subsequently, Mr Menrad says, however, that a European framework is needed for the promotion of employee financial participation through the coordination of agreements on general principles, social security issues and fiscal aspects.
Why, though?
The coordination of models and conditions would benefit neither companies nor employees.
I therefore see no reason why any of the EU institutions should have any dealings with this issue, with its host of specific requirements and considerations of which it will be necessary also to take account.
Companies' profit-sharing systems are the concern of companies and their employees, and it is therefore with them that this issue should reside.
The Moderate delegation will therefore vote against the report, for someone must take a different view.
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Menrad for what is essentially a sound and conclusive report.
Once again, you have shown yourself to be a worthy champion of employees' interests.
Is this a theme for the European Union?
It certainly is!
The reason is that employee participation has an absolutely innovative character, both on the company and the employee side.
That is the approach, and that is the new philosophy, which we must adopt if we want to pursue the Lisbon objectives.
That is what I would say to the previous speaker.
Of course it is important to distinguish between specific things as Mr Menrad himself has done.
We are assuming that these are clear capital shareholdings which cannot supplement the existing wage and salaries systems.
They must be dealt with separately, and that is a factor.
We are assuming, and this has already been expounded upon, that the participation sector or participation in the industrial sector will therefore become far stronger.
It has a psychological effect.
It has an effect on the company.
It is innovative, and holds promise for the future.
That is how it has been presented.
Yet what age are we living in?
That now applies to the Commission as well.
The task is to integrate these specific models of employee participation into a specific network for the present day, in other words, to encourage employees to take an interest in obtaining shareholdings in companies.
What is the reality in Europe?
We have recessional and deflationary trends, characterised by the Commission's growing pressure to make savings.
As a result, pensions and social systems are being cut, and this does not make employees more willing to acquire shares in the corporate sector.
That is the problem.
In other words, if we want to make policies for the European Union, we should get down to brass tacks: we should create systems which are equipped with appropriate flanking measures so that everything can come together to form a creative whole.
That is actually what we want. This cannot be the case as long there are quite different economic tendencies on the one side from our own, with our ideas, on the other.
Employee participation must not be just a theory.
Employee participation in the Lisbon sense means more than that!
Thank you, Mr Ettl.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0167/2003) by Mrs Fraisse, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women and sport [2002/2280(INI)].
Madam President, Commissioner, I am happy to be able to present my report to you this evening, although, as you can testify, the House is now looking a little empty. The issue of women and sport pertains to both my Parliamentary responsibilities.
It relates to both the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. It is an own-initiative report, which in essence deals with a fundamental element of our democracy.
Sport has formed part of the basis of the development of democracy since ancient times.
I am also happy that this report has been completed under the Greek Presidency.
I would like to give you a brief outline of the different contextual elements of this own-initiative report, as I set out to do.
Firstly, we need to acknowledge that there is a huge disparity between the situation of men and women and between boys and girls on the issue of sport and access to sport, whether pursued at a high level or as a leisure activity.
It is essential to recognise this disparity.
Secondly, sport is and remains a means of self-fulfilment at all stages of life. The issue of equality of opportunity comes into play here.
Thirdly, as there is the disparity I mentioned, we need to take account of an issue that poses some difficulties. If we want to ensure equality between young girls and young boys, between men and women and amongst teenagers and young adults, we need to take account of the disparities and differences between men and women when it comes to sporting performance.
Some people have told me that they think this has been taken on board already.
I note that both the army and the police have had to arrange for different competitive and performance-related tests for men and women.
This is an attempt to establish equality between different body types to ensure men and women have equal opportunities.
I have tried to explain this idea in recital M of my report in particular.
It is difficult to achieve a situation of equality or equilibrium, however you want to put it, when we have two different starting points.
In my opinion, these are the three contextual elements which form the basis of the report.
I would remind you that a report on women and sport was presented to Parliament thirteen years ago.
I had hoped to be a pioneer, but I am not. I must recognise that others have highlighted this problem before me, and I am delighted about this.
There are three main contexts in which equality of opportunity and self-fulfilment are an issue, namely sport in schools, sport as a leisure activity and top-level sport.
It is perhaps in this regard that I set out to be innovative in relation to the previous report.
All three areas must be taken into account in the development of sport.
School is a place for setting standards and for teaching girls and boys together. It is a place for opening horizons rather than slamming the door on future opportunities.
All the professionals have told me that school plays a key role in women's access to sport.
Sport as a leisure activity is a luxury for some people, for some women I should say.
You need to have the time, the means and the opportunity to access sport in order to pursue it as a leisure activity.
There are far fewer sports facilities for young girls, teenagers, young women and women than there are for young boys and men.
There is a great disparity in that pursuing a sport as a leisure activity is a luxury for women who have to deal with the demands of both work and a family.
I wanted to stress this point.
As for top-level sport, we first need to understand the issues involved.
It is sometimes difficult to get up-to-date with what is happening in women's sport at the highest level.
The media do not always cover the issues as they could or as they should or as we would wish them to.
Furthermore, we must not overlook the specific health problems encountered by some top sportswomen.
There are disorders and hormone problems which can later lead to reproductive problems or premature ageing.
All the professionals have stressed these health problems to me.
As one sociologist put it, sport does not equate to health, contrary to the received wisdom.
Lastly, everyone is agreed on the need to ensure that women have a greater role in decision-making.
This is also a key element.
Lastly, I would like to explain that I have recently undertaken a good deal of work with the different political groups.
I would like to thank them for being so willing to contribute.
I would also like to thank the Greek Presidency for organising a meeting on women and sport, held in Thessaloniki on 8 March, which I attended.
Thanks are also due to the Presidency for including my proposal to create a 'Women and Sport' unit in its declaration at the end of this meeting.
Further, I would like to thank the International Olympic Committee and the European Women and Sport network, which have been very cooperative.
The last idea that I would like to put forward stems from what I heard from all the parties involved, professionals included. They asked me to stand up for mixed participation in sport.
This is the way forward.
This report is entitled 'Women and Sport' but its objective is mixed participation. We want men and women, girls and boys to be involved in what is and should remain a pleasurable activity for both genders.
Madam President, I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Fraisse because her report is interesting but also has huge difficulties, if you think that, on the one hand, it directly concerns million of citizens in the European Union and, on the other hand, it is an issue for which there are very few competences and very little experience at European level.
As far as the report is concerned, I should like to start with the analysis relating to the Community value of sport.
I believe that Mrs Fraisse quite rightly demonstrates the importance of sport as an important weapon against discrimination.
That is why both in the European Commission and in the plan for 2003, which is the year against discrimination, the dimension of sport as a means of combating discrimination is very intensely promoted, and in 2004, which is the year of sport, the plan being drawn up takes account of the issue of discrimination.
I should like to refer more specifically, because of course I must say that I absolutely agree with the spirit of the analysis to which she herself referred just now, and comment on certain calls which directly concern the institutions.
The first is that, as you know, the Convention has already answered the question of sport and the Treaty; it is clear - and no one disputes - that sport, with its social and educational dimension, like culture and education, are seen as support activities at European Union level, something which no Member State has contested.
Thus we know the limits within which we can move institutionally.
There is your proposal to create a 'women and sport' unit.
I think that, at the present stage, it is difficult to determine the specific remit of such a unit, when there is this practical difficulty of determining competences at European level.
As far as available studies and material are concerned, there is an important bibliography from the Council of Europe which, we believe, has been used from time to time and suffices for us to base positive action on it, and I believe that, in 2004 in particular, we shall have the possibility of progressing further and promoting the dimension of women's sport.
Of course, we cannot sit by and do nothing while we wait for a new article in the Treaty.
There is a margin and I think that we can progress further by improving information for sports associations and increasing awareness of the possibilities within the framework of existing Community programmes, for which there is minimal to no demand from sports-related associations and programmes.
We might refer to the ?QUAL programme or we might refer to the research programmes, for which no such proposals have yet been formulated, or even to the DAPHNE programme, if we think about the dimension of sexual harassment in sport, which is not at all negligible.
Consequently, I would say that I agree and we shall proceed to fully support actions to encourage sports associations to use Community programmes, but I would be more cautious on issues relating to new studies or new administrative structures, at least until we have a clearer definition of activities.
It is clear that the European Commission is obliged in any proposals it makes to respect the legislative action of the Member States, on the one hand, and to take account of the autonomy of sports associations, on the other.
However, one sure way of increasing the interest of the Member States and the sports associations is to promote sport for women as a means against discrimination.
I have taken note of this in your position and would stress that sport and sports policies can clearly be used as a means of combating it.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the connection between women and sport has a long tradition in history, dating back to the first games in ancient Greece, it was only in 1928 that the decision was taken to allow women to participate in the Olympic Games.
Women's participation in sport has steadily increased since then, even though it could and should develop more quickly today.
This report focuses on women's participation in the three core areas of sport: sport in schools, sports for leisure, and competitive sport, although there are no proposals to create sporting opportunities exclusively for women in any of these areas.
The principles of gender mainstreaming should apply in sport as elsewhere.
Equality in sport is, in my view, the most important aspect of this report.
The goal of equal opportunities for school, amateur and professional sport is above all a way of improving women's integration at all these levels.
On the other hand, the importance of women's role must be recognised in sport too.
Women remain under-represented in sports administration and decision-making.
Why is it mainly men who are involved in club and association structures, even though more and more women are becoming members?
In top-level sport, this discrepancy is becoming increasingly apparent.
Here, women are not represented in the decision-making bodies in a way that is commensurate with their achievements in professional sport.
On the contrary, women are in a far more difficult position in top-level sport, especially as regards the health of women athletes.
The Community must take action here, and it must do so in cooperation with the various organisations involved in competitive sport.
It is also important, however, to consider the principle of subsidiarity.
I share the view that it is unnecessary for the Commission to establish a 'women and sport' unit, as is proposed.
There is also no budget line which could fund such a unit, and that is why I will reject Article 5 in tomorrow's vote.
I would also ask you to reject Article 32, which proposes that when the 'Television without Frontiers' Directive is amended, it should stipulate that the Member States must broadcast women's sport competitions.
There is no Europe-wide mandatory list governing the broadcasting of sporting events.
The individual Member States may, if they wish, draw up their own national lists of major sporting events which attract major public interest.
In my view, establishing such an obligation would result in over-regulation, which is not something that we as a group want to see.
That is why we will not vote in favour of Article 32 tomorrow.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fraisse very warmly on her excellent report.
We too endorse most of the report, and we will vote in favour of it as a whole tomorrow.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we have a long way to go towards reaching a situation in which women regularly undertake a physical activity.
Sport is of fundamental importance to our society. It is an all-embracing means of increasing understanding that transcends barriers of language, nationality, religion and colour.
As the Olympic Games of 2004 draw nearer, sport is a wonderful means of promoting peace in the world.
Participating in sport is like being a member of a big family. Consequently, women should never be excluded and their interests should never be sidelined.
We must take both horizontal and vertical action to promote equality of access to sport for women. In other words, we must develop sport for women and girls at all levels.
We must develop sport in schools, sport as a leisure activity and sport at a competitive level. We also think it is important to target all groups of women and especially those who are less able to access sport because of their lifestyle or their status.
Sport in schools involves more than just learning sports.
It involves developing the role young people will play in society in future.
Given the reticence of those young girls who drop out of sport, it is also essential to ensure young girls are more enthusiastic about doing sport.
Sport is therefore about achieving emancipation and autonomy.
As for sport as a leisure activity, it is clear that for many women, sport is an optional extra, that can only be considered after work, children, housework and family leisure activities.
We are only too aware of the consequences this has on women's health.
In addition, our sports facilities do not always allow young women and women to participate in sport at a convenient time. Services such as childcare are not always available.
Lastly, sport is also a profession and a means of earning a living.
Sports authorities and top sportspeople must therefore respect the current rules on the free movement of people and the provision of services.
Women are in a minority in top-level sport and they are role models for young people.
In order to encourage young girls to participate in sport, these sportswomen need to be in the public eye. In television programmes for example, they should not be relegated to second place, only appearing after other items.
Being involved in sport at the highest level entails many significant physical changes that have an impact on the health and future life of participants.
It is important to undertake specific studies on the effects of top-level sport on the health of women.
Specific physical training should also be provided for women.
Lastly, it is important that women are represented in all sports regardless of the level or reason for pursuing a particular sport.
It is also essential to allow women to act as referees and umpires and to ensure both genders are represented on medical and selection committees.
Our initiative should allow women to participate in a sporting activity on a regular basis, and gives special consideration to the case of disabled women, and also to the case of older women. Sport is of course an excellent means of self-development and rehabilitation.
It also promotes the social integration of people of all ages, solidarity and allows people to exceed their expectations.
Sport must be promoted.
It will enhance our society and ensure the well-being of all. I would therefore like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fraisse and the Commission for the interest they have shown in this issue.
Madam President, it was the struggle pursued by some women and the pressure they exerted that forced the International Olympic Committee in 1928 finally to allow women to take part in the Olympic Games as athletes but still only in a few events.
It was only in 1964, for example, that the women's 800 metres was introduced.
It was the pressure exerted by female athletes and trainers, their irreverence and their fighting that wrung the odd concession from highly misogynistic sports organisations.
They started off developments to which we are now paying tribute in the debate on this report, which I support, produced at the initiative of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, whom I congratulate on her excellent work and whom I thank for having included the proposals that I tabled.
We know that there are enormous differences in the situation of women in sport in the European Union, specifically between the countries of northern and southern Europe, although the average for women (only 16%) and girls (only 37%) claiming regularly to practice a physical and sporting activity is extremely low.
An aspect I would therefore emphasise as being particularly important is the report's call for women's sport to be recognised as an expression of the right to equality and the freedom of all women to take control of their bodies and participate in sports publicly, regardless of nationality, age, disability, sexual orientation or religion.
This means that the Member States and the European Union must adopt the measures necessary to guarantee women and men equal access to sporting activities at all levels and at all stages of life, regardless of social background, particularly in the case of the mentally or physically disabled, who should be encouraged to take part in sport and physical activity, as the report states.
I also welcome the fact that the Commissioner has also referred to this European Year of the Disabled.
I hope that it extends beyond this year.
Hence also the importance of using the various legal and financial instruments to promote and support women's sport.
Greater emphasis must also be placed on physical and sports education, on creating better conditions for female athletes and on ensuring equal rights in all areas of high-level sports, including decision-making and establishing conditions for active social reintegration at the end of the sports careers of female athletes.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, including those of you with observer status, if you are awake. As I did not start working in Parliament until April, the same time as the observer Members, I would like to mention them.
I feel I am still a little like an observer.
I now have the honour to speak in plenary for the first time, and I am happy that a subject has come my way that I feel is very personal to me, having acquired the kind of energy and invigoration that comes from a lifetime of sport.
Perhaps that is the reason why we are still all in good shape here.
I am pleased to be able to say that the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, has incorporated, if not quite all, then very many of the amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in our committee debate.
With these amendments our group has attempted to highlight the same matter that the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, has included to some degree in her report.
Women's sport is associated with a problem that is also familiar in the political and economic sphere: participation in decision-making.
Real action on equality is needed to solve it.
We should remember that sport does not just mean competitive sport, peak performance or world records.
Sport and exercise for most people are ways of achieving a healthy, balanced life in a society that is ever more demanding and hectic.
This is an aspect that we wish to highlight more emphatically in the report.
Exercise and sport promote vitality, in both individual and team events.
There are also a number of other matters whose importance I now wish to stress, having been given the floor.
It would be very important were opportunities to participate in sport to be were stepped up for people other than those who enjoy perfect health.
Sport is also a very effective, mentally therapeutic and socially beneficial way of improving the quality of life of sick and disabled people and helping them to cope in everyday life.
Those who cannot walk using their own legs can ride, borrowing the legs of the horse, as it were.
That is sport.
Another important point to take into consideration, I think, is that ageing women and men should also be given the very same opportunities to take exercise and practise sport as the young and agile.
Similarly, the beneficial effect of sport and its ability to rehabilitate cannot be stressed too much at this point.
These two very important issues have now been added to the report.
I would have nevertheless liked to have it emphasised rather more strongly how sport is the most wonderful way of integrating migrants, women and children, into a new society.
Despite everything, we are very pleased with the report and we are only asking for a few separate votes on some points.
I hope special attention will be given to the fact that sport as a subject for study in school should not be judged using the same indicators as for intellectual disciplines such as foreign languages and mathematics.
I would also hope the reference to sport as an individual's fundamental right will be omitted from the report.
I am of the opinion that sport is the right of all people, but I believe the concept 'fundamental right' would suffer inflation in this context.
The report should also leave out the list naming those countries that did not send mixed teams to the last Olympic Games, although it is important to appeal to all countries to send mixed teams.
If this report gets through the parliamentary debate in tomorrow's vote, as I hope it does, I will nevertheless be a little sceptical about what the Commission and the Member States will do about this matter.
For that reason it would also be very important if we could have a follow-up to the report, and I now appeal to the Commissioner responsible and ask if we could have a follow-up report on the recommendations contained in this report before the current parliamentary terms ends in 2004.
I would like to thank Mrs Fraisse for this report and for her passionate defence of this issue as a whole.
Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report, Mrs Fraisse, for all her efforts.
Ladies and gentlemen, times have changed a lot.
Just imagine, in 1912, when the legendary Pierre de Coubertin was asked about the possibility of organising Olympic games for women he replied as follows: 'This is impracticable, lacking in interest, anti-aesthetic and incorrect.
The conception of the Olympic games must be based on the following formula: the solemn periodic manifestation of male sport based on internationalism, on loyalty as a means, on arts as a background and the applause of women as a recompense'.
One hundred years is not so long ago.
We women did not then participate in the Olympic games, but now we make up more than 40% of participants.
And if we bear in mind that there are continents for which participation is extremely low, I believe that we have truly made great progress.
However, as a person who has dedicated 20 years of their life to sport, first as an amateur and then as a professional, I believe there are two fronts on which we still have an awful lot to do and a very long way to travel.
The first is the media.
In Spain we have sports newspapers, which only cover sports, and they are some of the most widely read newspapers in our country - even more than the national newspapers - and they hardly dedicate 4% of their content to women's sport, and what is more, the content relating to women's sport often consists of news of a sentimental nature or on the postures or clothing of our sportswomen.
This is not just a Spanish problem. In France, the daily L'Ãquipe dedicates a maximum of 5% of its news to women's sport.
It is therefore a problem which affects the whole of the European Union.
The second front consists of sporting bodies.
In the world of politics, we often complain that women's participation is too low; nevertheless, I must point out that women's participation in politics is light years ahead of their participation in sporting bodies.
In view of such a dramatic situation, in 1996 the International Olympic Committee decided that, by the end of 2000, 10% of all posts in all decision-making structures should be reserved for women, including in the international federations and bodies belonging to the Olympic movement, with a view to raising this quota to 20% by 2005.
These are ridiculously low quotas, but what makes the situation even more serious is that these quotas are not being achieved.
Ladies and gentlemen, at the closing of the First Conference on Women and Sport, in October 1996 in Lausanne, Juan Antonio Samaranch stated that the twenty-first century should be the new era for women's participation in the world of sport.
Amongst all of us, men and women, we must do everything we can to make this statement by Juan Antonio Samaranch a reality.
Madam President, I should like to start by thanking and warmly congratulating Mrs Fraisse on her initiative to mobilise and increase the awareness of the European Parliament and all the competent agencies on the very serious issue of the relationship between sport and women.
This report is particularly important and valuable in the run up to the 2004 Olympic Games and we hope that the proposals which it contains will be taken into serious account by the Athens 2004 organising committee.
However, I should also like to warmly congratulate the Commissioner, who has responded directly and positively to the report's proposals.
Indeed, Commissioner, sport can be a very pro-active way of combating discrimination against women and, more importantly, of combating the under-representation of women, and I think that measures should be taken in this direction in order to increase the number of women in leading positions at all levels of sports activities, to support the personal and professional development of women in the field of sport, the organisation and administration of sport and training and the organisation of sporting events at all levels.
Mechanisms need to be created which ensure that young women will have a say in the development of policies and programmes which concern them.
The media need to be encouraged to positively reflect and adequately cover the breadth, depth, quality and benefits of women and girls working in sport; and, finally, support is needed to achieve the standards of equality between the sexes laid down by the International Olympic Committee in 1998 and the practical application of everything included in the Thessaloniki declaration, which closed the work of a large international conference held within the framework of the Greek Presidency.
As we approach the 2004 Olympic Games, let us make the idea of women's participation an important message from these games.
Let the Olympic Games become a real celebration of humanity which will promote the values to which women attach particular importance, the values of peace, democracy, equality, respect for differences, dialogue between cultures, the creative coexistence of people and the resolution of differences by peaceful means.
Madam President, the European Parliament and the Council have designated 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport.
That in itself is sufficient reason for an own-initiative report describing access to the practice of sport as a fundamental right, which it is quite right to do.
Sport from a young age is character-building and fosters self-confidence, and for women, that always means emancipation.
Sport tests and overcomes personal limits, not only for the individual woman but also in the team, where together, results can be achieved which amount to far more than just the individual performances.
What is more, sport teaches people how to treat others more considerately and how to involve those with a disability: an important contribution to social integration.
This makes it all the more incomprehensible when women are denied access to sport for social or cultural reasons.
I recall the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996.
At that time, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats here in this House, I objected to the discrimination by Muslim states that had prohibited women from taking part because they had refused to comply with one specific rule.
They wanted to take off their headscarves and the clothing which impeded them while running.
They were prevented from doing so at that time.
I hope, Mrs Karamanou, that there will be no repetition of this in Athens.
As I am sure you know, at that time the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats abstained in the vote in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
The main reason was that as long as we have no powers at European level, no new administration could be established in the Commission.
Mrs Diamantopoulou pointed out that European funding could, however, be mobilised, for example from EQUAL or DAPHNE or research programmes.
Some of the points raised were really pedantic, for example when it was claimed that opening hours at sports facilities were not in line with women's interests.
We cannot make such sweeping generalisations.
Quite a lot has happened.
Mrs Zissener has pointed out that we cannot force the television channels to broadcast women's sporting events.
However, this will be regulated by the market.
I come from the media sector, and we have clearly witnessed the positive developments taking place for women here.
Women are certainly not under-represented in the media now.
In advertising, they have become well-established role models - such as the many female personalities from athletics, skiing, tennis or swimming - which is very gratifying.
Quite rightly, they have broken down the barriers to an increasing number of sports, even women's football, which I think is a very attractive sport.
There is just one sport of which I am not a fan, and that is women's boxing.
Otherwise, however, major advances have been made, and that is extremely positive.
There is one point on which I am sure we all agree: now that some of the amendments we proposed are acceptable from the Group of the European People's Party's perspective and could also be included in tomorrow's vote, we agree that wherever discrimination occurs, it must not only be identified but above all vigorously combated.
Sport is undoubtedly a key area in this respect.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Fraisse.
I also agree with her that - as with everything we do - it is up to us women ourselves to improve the situation of women in sport.
We must be pro-active and take the initiative here.
It is also up to us to point out that due to the small but significant difference, namely the physical difference, gross differences in salary, substantial differences in the level of support, differences in media reporting, and the different degree to which women are involved in decision-making are all realities.
That means that equality must be demanded in sport as well.
That also means, for example, that in order to underline the role of gender budgeting, which is currently being dealt with by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we must review the resources available to clubs, associations and schools from an equality perspective for once.
How are resources allocated between male and female competitions?
How high is the expenditure on training for women and men, and what about the prize money or competition prizes?
The gender aspect should be underlined in the training of trainers and teachers, and it is a must, it is absolutely essential, to demand leadership positions for women.
We have already heard from our fellow Member that in international organisations in particular, virtually no progress has been made in terms of increasing women's role.
I think, therefore, that the coming year - the European Year of Education through Sport - offers an opportunity to address these issues.
We should raise awareness among project applicants to ensure that they also submit projects for women, and we should also urge the Commission to focus especially on these projects when making the selection, in order to send out a signal and set the right course.
It is also necessary to promote new occupations, namely those that are still typically regarded as male professions, such as judges and officials, technical staff and medical staff - all these are areas where action is needed.
I would also like to say something about sport in schools.
I do not share the view that we should give precedence to subjects such as mathematics, geography and foreign languages rather than sport.
This has already been happening for a long time.
Whenever savings have to be made, sport is always the first thing to go.
Sport and the arts are always dropped first. This is, in my view, a very bad thing.
We are doing it again in Austria at present: we are currently cutting the school timetable by two hours, and sport is one of the things to go.
This is unacceptable, for sport does not only have an educational and social value, it is also important for health, and we should not deprive our children and young people of this.
I would like to finish by making one further point, if I may.
I realise that I am over-running, but I would like to make this point to you.
We have been talking about the media, and we cannot force them into reporting.
That is true, but we do need to emphasise the importance of reporting in a serious-minded way.
For example, when the City Marathon took place in January, Austrian Broadcasting (ORF) played 'You Sexy Thing' as the female winner approached the finishing line.
The camera zoomed in on the relevant parts of the women's bodies.
This is completely inappropriate in serious sports reporting.
This type of discrimination against women still occurs, with the focus being not on their performance but merely on their gender and their bodies.
This is something we need to protest about.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the Swedish golf star, Annika SÃ¶renstam, wanted to compete with the men in the American professional tournament, the male golf world got the jitters.
A number of male golfers reacted with suspicion and antipathy, and others rejected the idea outright.
The men wondered what was to happen now.
Perhaps she was better than some of them.
The reaction encountered by Annika SÃ¶renstam when she wanted to measure her ability against the men is symptomatic of many men's attitudes to women and sport.
Not that I believe that men in general actively conspire against women in sport, although there are some who do so.
What is done through thoughtlessness and prejudice has the same effect, however.
Women are discriminated against in sport.
That is something that emerges very clearly from Mrs Fraisse's, in my view, quite excellent report.
Women obtain fewer resources and shorter training periods and are quite often treated unfairly by sponsors.
Moreover, it is often men who call the shots in sport.
To this should be added precisely what many others have already said, namely that the media devote more space to men than to women.
I am president of a sports association: the JÃ€rnvÃ€gen Handball Club in Hallsberg.
It is a club with a fair degree of equality in terms of its membership, with approximately as many girls and women as boys and men.
We have worked single-mindedly to create equal opportunities for girls and boys.
I will not say that we have succeeded fully, but we have made a fair bit of progress.
A lot still remains to be done, and we have to make an effort in our handball club.
All other sports associations must also make an effort and single-mindedly work for an environment of equality in sport.
Sport is significant in many ways.
It is almost always beneficial and healthy for those who practise it.
It creates opportunities for social contact and for being together and helps people flourish.
Through sport, we can combat drugs and exclusion and give people room to grow and develop, but everyone - girls as well as boys, women as well as men - must have the same opportunities.
The European Parliament cannot remove all the causes of the lack of equality in sport, any more than we can remove such causes in other areas of society.
We can, however, be clear about what we want, and we can encourage ourselves, the Member States, sports associations, the media and those who participate in sport always to think in terms of equality and equal conditions for women and men.
The Member States can be tougher in the action they take.
There can be a halt to subsidies paid to associations that do not fulfil objectives in terms of equality.
Sponsors can exercise pressure on clubs.
If they do not practise equality, they do not receive any money.
There must, therefore, be the will to bring about equality in sport.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
Let us make use of that will to bring about equality in European sport.
Thank you, Mr Karlsson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
. (SV) For many years, I have worked assiduously in Parliament for a Statute for Members and genuinely want it to be possible for such a Statute to enter into force before the next term of office.
I note that, unfortunately, the majority of the European Parliament deliberately put the draft Statute into a form that, for understandable reasons, can hardly be approved by the Council.
As the Commission observed in its opinion, the provisions concerning Members' immunity exceed what it is possible to approve in this context.
It would be tragic if the Statute were only to enter into force once a new constitutional treaty had entered into force - probably not until 2009 as far as Parliament is concerned.
At the same time, an option was approved whereby new Member States might subsequently, during two terms of office, apply other rules.
Parliament did not convince the surrounding world that it in actual fact wanted to help bring about a situation in which travel costs would in future be reimbursed on the basis of actual costs.
In the vote, Parliament ruled out a state of affairs in which national taxation would be an option for countries that wanted this.
If the Statute is to become a reality, Parliament must be prepared to negotiate concerning the final outcome.
By voting 'no', I wish clearly to express the fact that Parliament is divided and that Parliament's leaders should negotiate concerning the final outcome.
In response to the Prestige disaster, the Commission announced a raft of measures designed to minimise the risk of future accidents involving ships such as the Erika and the Prestige.
The Commission is proposing three fundamental changes: the introduction of a law stipulating that crude oil and its heavy fractions be transported only in double hull oil tankers; the rapid withdrawal from service of single hull oil tankers; and more widespread application of the special oil tanker inspection scheme (the programme for assessing the seaworthiness of ships). The latter aims to assess the structural soundness of single hull tankers more than 15 years old.
For that reason, I give my unequivocal support to this proposal for a Regulation, which I believe is extremely positive. It promises to guarantee greater safety for maritime traffic, tighter control over the transport of hydrocarbons and more effective protection of the marine environment.
These are measures which I have supported for some time.
This matter is of the utmost interest not just for a Member State such as Portugal (which has an immensely long coastline and includes extremely vulnerable island territories, including the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores), but for the whole of the European Union as well.
Breast cancer
The next item is the report (A5-0159/2003) by Mrs JÃ¶ns, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on breast cancer in the European Union [2002/2279(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to tell you that 15 national presidents from the European Breast Cancer Coalition, Europa Donna, are following this debate in the public gallery.
Breast cancer affects all of us.
In the European Union, someone is diagnosed with it every two and a half minutes.
Every year, 216 000 women suffer from this disease and 79 000 women still die from it even though 90% of all cases can be cured if they are diagnosed and properly treated at an early stage.
For the most part, these women die when they have their most important responsibilities in society.
Breast cancer is still the most frequent cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 55.
Every year, though, 25 000 women could be saved if all Member States were to offer proper preventive care, that is to say, screening in accordance with the European Guidelines for Mammography Screening.
They would provide women with a guarantee that their radiologist carries out only breast X-ray examinations and that he reads about 5 000 mammograph screenings a year, which enables him to evaluate them with an experienced eye.
It is completely unacceptable that, eleven years after the EU guidelines were submitted, only eight Member States offer national mammography screening programmes.
In countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, 90% of all women aged between 50 and 69 already participate in screening programmes, but in my own country of Germany, barely 2% of women in this age group are offered screening.
This despite the fact that, according to the World Health Organisation, it can be proved that mammography screening reduces mortality by an unbelievable 35%.
Even the best early detection is of no use however if subsequent treatment is inadequate, or downright wrong.
The report therefore calls on Member States to establish a network of multidisciplinary breast centres to cover the entire population of the EU, with one centre for every 330 000 inhabitants. These centres should be certified by an independent body and subject to regular review.
The entire medical team of doctors and nurses should specialise in both benign and malignant breast disease and there should be multidisciplinary case conferences to discuss each case.
It is particularly important that the surgeons should perform only breast operations, and that the centre should perform a minimum of 150 primary breast cancer operations per year, because expert knowledge comes only through experience.
These breast centres are extremely important because it has been shown that women who are treated in them have a higher chance of being cured.
Rates of survival in Sweden, for example, which has both nation-wide screening and breast centres, are 16% higher than in Austria, where neither of these exist.
In fact, only Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom have breast centres that cover the entire country.
It is precisely because of these disparities in the mortality and survival rates that we must develop a common European strategy in the fight against breast cancer.
We have to get the right information quicker and get better at exchanging experience. We have to introduce a system of benchmarking and be guided by best practice.
This is the only way to save the lives of more women and, at the same time, help to reduce the cost of health care.
And I am convinced that it is the only way to exert positive pressure on countries that lag behind.
The same is also true of national cancer registers, which are a fundamental prerequisite for reliable data, and which exist only in half of the Member States.
Our request to governments to create, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in the breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU is not unrealistic.
It can be achieved if the political will exists and if the medical profession supports us.
The United Kingdom has been exemplary in showing us how.
In this regard, I would ask the Commission to join us in taking stock of the situation in 2006.
We know that the Commission is on our side.
This was made clear once more with the proposal for a Council recommendation on cancer prevention.
It is only if the proposals made in this report are rapidly implemented that every woman in Europe - irrespective of place of residence, social status and education - will soon have the same optimum screening for, and treatment of, cancer.
Mr President, this is not the first time Mrs JÃ¶ns has brought as serious a matter as combating breast cancer into the limelight in a very specific and efficient manner and it is important and proves yet again that the commitment and systematic work of one person can set policies in motion.
Thus, I should like personally to congratulate Mrs JÃ¶ns both on the quality of her report and on her continuous commitment to this very important issue.
The fight against breast cancer is a public health priority.
A number of figures were quoted.
I think it is important to repeat them so that we understand the size of the problem.
220,000 new cases a year, 75,000 women who die from this disease.
However, according to estimates and studies, the lives of 25,000 women a year could have been saved if proper screening practices were applied to all women in the European Union.
Prevention, therefore, proper screening, saves lives and that is also the report's message.
In her report, Mrs JÃ¶ns examines both best practices in connection with cancer screening and best practices and effective experience in connection with treatment for and care of breast cancer.
It is important to say that many of the elements and proposals formulated emanate from the various actions undertaken by the Commission between the years 1987 and 2002 within the framework of three successive 'Europe Against Cancer' programmes.
These programmes, together with the new programme in the field of public health illustrate the Commission's commitment to combating this major illness.
One important element of policies at European level, therefore, is the inventory we have today and the knowledge we have about what is happening in the Member States, so that we can choose the best and most efficient practices and so that the Member States themselves can identify their own weaknesses.
The second important element of policies and choices is the proposal for a recommendation, which essentially also illustrates the Commission's commitment.
The proposal for a recommendation on cancer screening issued on 5 May.
The objective of this proposal is to formulate recommendations for the implementation of mass screening programmes on a proper scientific basis.
This recommendation has already been submitted to the Council of Ministers for Health, which was held on Monday this week.
What does it contain?
Essentially it contains a proposal for measures which aim to correlate screening practices with the results obtained in the various Member States.
This means that there must now be quantitative targets from the Member States concerning the rate of reduction in the death rate from cancer.
The Commission's proposal for a recommendation is a general framework which, of course, cannot have the binding force of legislation, given that we all know that these are issues that come under the jurisdiction of the Member States.
However, this proposal for a recommendation makes provision for the submission of a report on the implementation of cancer screening programmes on the basis of the statistics provided by the Member States by the end of the third year after the date of their approval, and this report will constitute the basis for evaluating and analysing any further action.
In addition to the proposal for a recommendation which, as I said, was the second basic element of the European Union's policy after the inventory of the existing situation, the third important element is the action programmes.
The Commission has undertaken a major action which relates to the public health programme for the years 2000-2008.
These programmes make use of the results and achievements of previous programmes, including the programme against cancer, and the relevant networks.
And here I should like to welcome to the gallery the representatives of the networks, the chairmen of the organisations fighting breast cancer, and say that, in our experience also, it is clear that the role of these organisations, the commitment of volunteers, the commitment of civil society, plays a very important role and we see that, in numerous countries, there have been essential improvements and changes to the situation in the field of breast cancer due to the operation of these networks.
Of course, some of them are also pan-European in range.
In 2004, the Commission is due to submit a final report to the European Parliament and the Council on the success of this 'Europe Against Cancer' programme.
This programme, the public health programme, includes exchanges of information and best practices between the Member States.
Essentially, it is about reinforcing cooperation between states so that each can learn from the other.
This is in keeping with paragraph 13 of Mrs JÃ¶ns' report and, of course, it recognises and supports the need for common strategies and actions in sectors such as research and technical equipment and technological development, which is also in keeping with paragraph 6 of the report.
The Commission is currently evaluating the numerous proposals for plans submitted for funding in 2003.
In conjunction with the priorities of the programme of work for 2003, the services will take account in the final choice of the priorities set out in the report and, of course, we shall take serious account of all the recommendations formulated.
As far as the proposal for a conference on the outcome of the 'Europe Against Cancer' programme is concerned, I think that it should be discussed with the next presidencies.
I should like to express a slight hesitation as to the possibility of its being organised within the framework of the Italian Presidency, given that there is not much time, but of course we can try and find the best possible time.
Finally, allow me to inform you that the Commission intends to create a health information portal on the Internet.
This portal will be a source of information on public health in the European Union; its content will cover a wealth of topics and it will be a single point of access for citizens, patients, doctors, experts, the competent authorities and the networks.
We believe that this portal will be an important tool in everyone's hands for exchanging experiences and promoting policies.
Mr President, I should like to close by thanking Mrs JÃ¶ns on behalf of Mr Byrne, who was prevented from coming by very important commitments, for her particular contribution to the implementation of our common objective and to congratulate her warmly.
Mr President, every family, every household in the European Union has at some time or other come into contact with cancer, a terrible disease that you can never get rid of, even though you may recover from it.
That the European Union is not only active in the field of cancer prevention and the detection of this terrible disease, but also creates the opportunities to cure cancer through the research programme there are EUR 400 million available for this research programme must be heartening for the European citizen.
That is also the reason why Mrs JÃ¶ns and I, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and together with all its members, have worked together consummately to ensure that the report of our rapporteur, Mrs JÃ¶ns, now before you can really be seamlessly supported by our group.
Together we have followed a path that we think is the best for everyone who has to face, will have to face or has had to face the problem.
There are great differences in Europe.
I am proud of my own country: our screening programme is perfect, but that does not mean that there is nothing now to be done there.
There are differences in the sense that the breast cancer problem is greater for women in the Northern European countries, at least it occurs more, and that in other countries - and I am looking at the accession countries here too - it occurs less but the chance of a cure also differs very widely across the European Union.
That means that what was started in the 1990s with the breast screening programmes now requires further completion, and that is why we stand together.
I shall be making a further remark about this directly.
I am asking the Commission for attention to be given to other programmes, other forms of cancer that are also very curable and to which I feel we have really devoted too little attention to date.
One example is cervical cancer, which you can detect very early using the HPV test and for which we as the European Union should be exerting rather more pressure on the Member States to be rather more active in this regard too, because if it is detected then in most cases it can be cured.
The same goes for prostate cancer.
Same problem.
Let there be rather more attention given to them too in the new programmes.
What we have done is look to see whether the Commission's guidelines and programmes are adequate, where, in order to arrive at solutions, we can really only advise the Member States.
A number of points have, I think, been highlighted.
First of all I would mention screening, apart from which, however, it is also of the utmost importance that women, when the existence of breast cancer is suspected, should be taken care of very quickly.
I have to say that in my country we make the occasional gaffe in this regard.
Prompt detection therefore, but prompt treatment also.
That is of the utmost importance and I ask you too, Commissioner, to devote attention to it.
Another situation we must avoid is one in which, whenever cancer is detected, any small hospital can then take action.
Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary tackling of the problem leads to the best chances of cure and I think that every woman in the European Union has a right to this.
Mr President, we have waited a long time for this debate, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs JÃ¶ns, for all her work on this issue.
It often takes one person to drive an issue forward and to obtain a result and if it were not for Mrs JÃ¶ns and all her hard work, we would probably not be sitting here today debating this issue.
Breast cancer is one of the greatest health problems facing Scotland and the EU as a whole.
It is the most common form of cancer amongst women in Scotland and the second leading cause of death in all women.
The disease affects one in nine women and claims 13 000 lives in the UK every year.
Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 55.
These are quite chilling statistics, so what can we do to help prevent breast cancer in the first place?
And if diagnosed, how can we ensure that women get the best possible treatment?
Firstly, as the rapporteur recognises, screening has to be a priority.
Although treatment in Scotland and the UK is better than in most Member States, with specialist nurses and the promotion of breast care centres, it is still the case that, unlike with smear testing, women only start being screened automatically at the age of 50.
The Scottish breast-screening programme currently invites eligible women aged 50-64 every three years.
This is a good start, but we know there is always more that can be done.
I would like to see more women screened at an early age across the EU and in the applicant states, and although women who have a history of breast cancer in their family are more aware of the risks, and start screening earlier, there is more we can do to push Member States to promote earlier and better diagnosis.
Recent studies show that, with improved screening of young and middle-aged women, mortality rates could be reduced by about one quarter.
Secondly, on prevention: interestingly the report mentions that the increase in breast cancer has been worldwide since the end of the Second World War.
Part of the reason is better diagnosis and also people understanding about genetics and family history, but our environment, lifestyle, habits and general quality of life may be related.
That is why research is so important, as are other directives promoted by the EU: for example, the new chemicals directive which is about to work its way through the parliamentary process and may be another way to try and minimise the risks that we as EU citizens face in our daily lives; the same applies to our work in dioxins and the eHealth communication.
Thirdly, we need to make sure that organisations like Europa Donna which have done so much work across Europe on the issue of breast cancer awareness are given the support they deserve.
Women in the EU diagnosed with breast cancer need to understand the treatment options available to them.
It is important that patients have access to useful information about breast cancer and support systems.
Finally, the importance of information and awareness runs through this report; this is our goal and we should all be aiming for this.
Mr President, I should also like to warmly congratulate Mrs JÃ¶ns on this report.
My group spoke very appreciatively of it, despite the fact that a number of Members feel that some parts go too far in the direction of subsidiarity and for this reason abstained from the vote in committee.
All the members of my group regard the report, as such, as being of high quality.
I think that that is very important.
I also have appreciation for the Commissioner and her vision of how things should proceed with this report.
She has said that it is important to gather and to record knowledge.
This view I share entirely.
Member States will themselves certainly become better acquainted with their own weaknesses if they look across the border at others.
That is by no means a luxury.
If we look at the report closely, we see that there is a 60% greater chance of developing breast cancer in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe.
We really must learn from that.
Why is this so?
If we look at the growth in the number of women with breast cancer, again there are significant differences.
In the European Union, for example, the number of women with breast cancer is showing the greatest growth in my own country.
There must be reasons for this that we can find.
In the report we read for example that women from urban areas are more prone to breast cancer than women from rural areas.
A lot of research is therefore needed to see what factors really do have an impact on breast cancer.
Is it actually true that the effect of using oestrogens is to increase the risk of breast cancer rather than to reduce it?
The answers to many of these questions remain unsatisfactory and I think that it is excellent that where we can all learn from research we do it collectively at a European level.
This is after all the most useful way of spending the money.
I also greatly appreciate the volunteers and the voluntary organisations that have done much to improve the quality of the treatment.
Personally I am a great advocate of treatment in breast centres.
Not only because of the greater chance of survival there, but also because of the total approach to the problem that women face.
For women it is after all in some cases a violation of their body.
A violation of the way in which they feel they lead their life as a woman.
For a long time little attention was paid to this and we looked too much at the technical side of the disease.
Mr President, I think it extremely important that we should continue with what the Commissioner has proposed.
I also appreciate that she will be bringing forward a plan to provide information about cancer in general on the Internet.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has also made a number of important points.
I therefore hope that we shall soon see all this in place and that the conference that has been requested will also be organised quickly.
Mr President, Commissioner, on my last visit to the gynaecologist she told me that the risk in Belgium has risen from one woman in 10 to one woman in eight.
These are frightening statistics and I think that the drama of discovering breast cancer in a woman is still a major trauma for herself and her family, even though this cancer can often be cured if discovered early on.
One in eight, though, is too high a risk and in Belgium we are in fourth place behind the Netherlands, Denmark and France.
We must also take into account that there are unacceptably large differences in the chances of survival, depending on whether you live in one country or another.
Early detection, diagnosis and treatment and aftercare help thousands of women to survive, but these chances of survival vary from 81% in France to 58% in Poland and Slovakia.
That must make us think.
The quality of the research must therefore be reliable and in this regard it concerns me that only eight countries are considering doing a general screening test.
There are discussions about this.
In Belgium they are baulking at the idea, on the one hand, because of the cost, but on the other I am sure that there is great pressure from the medical world to keep it to individual medical investigations by your own doctor.
It would be good to examine the results of these different approaches critically in the light of what you, Commissioner, called cooperation in connection with knowledge gathering.
There is a common European strategy, but there is a need to do more than prevention alone.
I think that we need to do more research into the causes.
Various fellow Members, Mrs Boogerd among them, have pointed out that there are still many unresearched areas.
In particular I should like to bring Mrs JÃ¶ns's recommendation in paragraph 11 to your attention and ask you to discuss it with your fellow Commissioner Mr Busquin, because the consequence of the patenting of genes could be that this monopoly unnecessarily stands in the way of breast cancer research.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs JÃ¶ns, on her report, which is rich in content and promises very good results, and I know what I am saying because I am head of a breast centre in Italy.
I fully endorse all the calls to the Member States to achieve a rate of voluntary participation in breast screening programmes by women of over 70%, a level which no country has yet reached.
I consider to be important the call to promote and disseminate in the Member States technical and care training initiatives and initiatives to provide patients suffering from breast cancer with psychological support, and to promote at Community level training and specialisation courses which - and this is my addition - are underwritten by university institutions, second level Masters degrees.
These courses could even be financed out of the training funds.
I can support the call to create European registers on tumours as soon as possible so that reliable, comparable data is, at last, available throughout the European Union on tumour growth in general.
It is right to call upon the Member States to use resources from the Structural Funds to fund the creation of infrastructure in the health sector.
I fully endorse the rapporteur's call for health insurance for, inter alia, aesthetic aids such as bra prostheses, wigs and whatever else a patient needs to restore their appearance as closely as possible to how is was before the illness.
In many states, reimbursement is not provided for these aids.
There are, however, a number of points which give cause for concern.
I would like to point out first of all that a point is missing from the report produced by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities which is essential if that committee is to be able to claim the title 'Equal Opportunities'.
The rapporteur has made no reference to cancer in men.
I regret to say that this type of cancer affects men too: basically, one man per 100 000 people between the ages of 58 and 63 develops breast cancer.
I would add that the prognosis for men is more unfavourable than for women precisely because men are not subject to screening and the cancer is diagnosed late.
I wonder whether it would not be appropriate for the committee to grant men at least the same right to information as is accorded to women.
Male cancer accounts for 1% of all breast tumours and I realise that its incidence is not economically significant enough to think about providing specific screening.
I do, however, believe that an awareness campaign directed at the male population would be appropriate so that men can have the same chance as women of having their lives prolonged and their quality of life increased by early diagnosis.
Young men are the most likely to develop breast cancer because of the wide use of female hormones and metabolisers, which spark off gynaecomastia which often goes untreated.
The second point on which I would like to focus concerns item 7(g) of the report in question.
I feel that informing patients that they can exercise the right to lodge complaints against doctors for malpractice is unnecessary, in that this right is already laid down in the European Charter of Patients' Rights, and that it is dangerous, for it could jeopardise the relationship of trust between doctors and patients on which studies and research have shown that half the success of treatment depends.
I feel it would make more sense for these kinds of controls on the appropriateness of the quality of treatment to be carried out by dedicated institutions such as, for example, the European board for monitoring centres of excellence - specialist breast units.
Mr President, Commissioner, in 2000, more than 216 000 women contracted breast cancer in the European Union and more than 79 000 women died because of it.
Breast cancer is the most common cause of death among women between the ages of 35 and 55.
Cancer rates differ substantially from one country to another in the European Union: they are higher in the northern European countries and lower in the southern countries, such as Greece and Spain.
Lithuania and Latvia also have low rates.
In all countries, the rate is rising every year.
Economic, environmental and even cultural factors have a large impact on these figures and breast cancer primarily affects women in higher social classes.
The European guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer, which is the most effective means of achieving good results and a high chance of survival, are only recommendations and are not binding from a legal point of view.
States draw up their own prevention and treatment plans, and these differ significantly from one State to another.
In some countries, the programmes are regional, and there are still some Member States where early detection programmes do not even reach all women within the high-risk age bracket.
This report, which is timely and very well written, aims to raise awareness throughout the European Union of this problem, which mainly affects women.
Its publication has been a wise move on the part of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Every woman should have access to high-quality screening for, treatment of and aftercare in the event of breast cancer.
As a result, we must do away with the disparities that currently exist among the Member States, whose survival rates vary by up to 16%.
The most effective means, at this stage, of treating the cancer is still early diagnosis.
The Community programme 'Europe Against Cancer' has been very effective and an excellent example, and we should therefore follow the same path in the future.
Early detection, with programmes to ensure regular screening of women aged over 50, must be established in all of the Member States and the accession countries.
The collaboration and increased awareness of women are of enormous importance: self-examination is an extremely useful tool, although mammography screening is the most effective technique for the early detection of the cancer.
The fight against breast cancer must be a health policy priority and the Member States must draw up effective health policies and strategies to ensure better early detection, diagnosis and treatment.
The report is very comprehensive, detailed and precise, and I congratulate Mrs JÃ¶ns on her willingness to accept suggestions and amendments that have improved the text.
Mr President, before my speaking time starts, I would just like to clarify that Mrs Stihler spoke as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and would like to thank the House for the support given to Mrs JÃ¶ns's report.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities calls in the report for the fight against breast cancer to become a health policy priority for the EU.
High-quality screening, diagnosis, treatment and aftercare for breast cancer must form an integrated whole and be provided in Member States.
With the Commission's support, this can be done by 2008 in accordance with our proposal.
In Europe, a woman dies of breast cancer every 20 minutes.
In Germany, every year 46 000 women suffer from this disease and 19 000 die from it.
Breast cancer affects women at the height of their professional and family responsibilities.
In women between the ages of 35 and 55, breast cancer is still the most common cause of death.
On behalf of my group, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs JÃ¶ns.
Her work has a very positive influence, not only because of her own victory over breast cancer, but also because she is fighting for all women in the European Union to receive the best possible treatment.
Our aims are high-quality national screening and the establishment of breast centres.
The relevant guidelines have already been developed by the European Society for Mastology, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Europa Donna.
Now it is a question of transposing them quickly.
The multidisciplinary breast centres shall bring together radiologists, oncologists, pathologists, psychologists and surgeons, who will consult with the patient on the best method of treatment for her.
In Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands a nation-wide screening programme has led to a 30% reduction in the mortality rate.
We have now been allocated EUR 400 million in the sixth framework programme of research.
At the earliest possible opportunity, national cancer registers should be set up so that we may finally have informative data about the possible influence of risk factors like tobacco, diet, life-style and environment on the development of cancer.
This is particularly important with regard to breast cancer.
We do of course clash with other interest groups.
In my native state of Bavaria, for example, we are taking a different path because X-raying is going to be left to general practitioners.
It is only in accordance with the EU guidelines, however, that optimal treatment can be attained.
Only when the attending physician reads at least 5 000 mammograph screenings per year does he acquire enough training and experience to recognise breast cancer when it is between five and seven millimetres.
Those who do not support this are concerned only with the interests of their professional groups and not with our goal of saving thousands of women's lives.
Every seventh or eighth woman will be affected.
We can count through each row here and see how many of us that will be.
Mr President, I would like to extend a greeting, like you, to those of our male colleagues who are in the Chamber because, as Mr Mussa said, the disease in question does indeed affect men as well.
When it affects us, it affects our spouses, families and children.
Moreover, the psychological climate surrounding this disease is not without impact on the lives of those around us.
Although, as the rapporteur stresses, it is difficult to compare the available data in the absence of uniform standards, they do show that breast cancer incidence fluctuates from one country of the European Union to another.
As already mentioned, then, the disease is one of the main causes of death for women between the ages of 35 and 55, which is why it is essential to define early detection and overall care of patients as European priorities.
That is what Mrs JÃ¶ns' report makes clear to us.
It recommends the implementation of detection campaigns carried out in multidisciplinary clinics (this is very, very important), providing medical care if necessary, of course, but also psychological and social care, delivered before and after treatment by highly-trained staff. This can sometimes be another great asset in treating the illness.
In France, a cancer steering committee published a report in January 2003, which has very recently allowed the President of the Republic to draw up a national plan for an anti-cancer campaign. The French report bears remarkable similarities to your own, in terms both of its findings and the objectives it proposes.
Taking into account the physical and psychological stress caused by breast cancer treatments, and in order to ensure the best possible quality of life for women, it is essential to act pre-emptively, through suitable information and prevention policies, to encourage women of all ages to undergo regular screening.
For this reason, we can only agree that there is a need to coordinate national policies, pursue the development of European mammography guidelines, intensify research, review the problem of gene patenting by the European Patents Office and establish registers other than the national ones currently in existence.
Mrs JÃ¶ns' report, as adopted by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, seems to respond to these objectives.
That is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has decided to vote for the motion, for I have to say that it shows a certain amount of courage. Furthermore, since we are lucky enough to have a woman Commissioner here today, and since we know that the fifth framework programme has set aside EUR 400 million, why not make cancer a major priority in Europe from 2004, Commissioner?
That would be a proactive response to Mrs JÃ¶ns' call for a conference.
Mr President, I too should like to warmly congratulate Mrs JÃ¶ns on her very important contribution towards raising the awareness of the institutions of the European Union about the burning issue of breast cancer, not only by drafting this excellent report, but also by organising the relevant exhibition at the European Parliament and by organising a public debate at which leading scientists from all over Europe participated, in the presence also of the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne.
We realised at the public hearing, with sadness, disappointment and surprise, that very little money is available for research into diseases which afflict women particularly frequently, such as osteoporosis, the consequences of the menopause and breast cancer, the subject of today's debate.
In other words, we found that more funds are available for diseases which mainly afflict men, and I say this for the benefit of my male colleagues, rather than for the benefit of the diseases which hit women; in other words, when it comes to combating diseases and health problems, there is also gender discrimination.
And I should also like to ask the European Commission to look as this, because, as the data which the Commissioner and other honourable Members referred to show, one in eight women is afflicted by this serious disease, which mainly afflicts women between the ages of 35 and 55.
We, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, are asking and calling for more research into the causes, for early diagnosis, for preventive measures and for treatment, once the disease has manifested itself.
Of course, we recognise the efforts being made by the European Commission and I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for all the positive messages you have given us today about the promotion of measures and programmes with specific targets and, most importantly, for the fact that there will be an evaluation of the results and you will take account of the proposals formulated in Mrs JÃ¶ns' report in the recommendation which you are planning for the Member States and, finally, for the fact that you will take advantage of the opportunities afforded us by new technologies, especially the Internet.
Thank you very much for these positive measures you have announced.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by thanking the Commissioner for her words, which demonstrate the Commission's commitment to addressing this serious public health problem together with the Member States, which have competence in the field of health.
The number of breast cancer cases has increased at a terrifying rate in the European Union.
By way of example, I wish to draw attention to the fact that in Portugal, breast cancer is the main cause of death amongst women over 45 years of age.
3 500 new cases are diagnosed every year in my country, and every day five women die from this disease.
Both a real political will and practical measures to improve this situation do exist, however.
I therefore thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on her excellent report, which alerts us to the many worrying aspects of this specific type of cancer, both in Europe and throughout the world and urges us all to act urgently and make the fight against cancer one of the fundamental priorities of health policy in the European Union.
The challenge we face is drastically to reduce breast cancer mortality rates in Europe, but also to eliminate disparities between Member States where the quality of health care is concerned and, consequently, women's chances of survival.
We must therefore act at different levels:
firstly, prevention and screening.
Awareness-raising campaigns must be promoted, to show that early diagnosis of the disease increases the probability that it can be cured.
Member States must offer screenings at two-year intervals for women between the ages of 50 and 69 years, as recommended, in fact, in the European Guidelines for Mammography Screening;
secondly: diagnosis.
All Member States must ensure that women are informed of the results of a mammography within five working days and wait no more than four weeks following diagnosis before treatment begins;
thirdly: treatment and follow-up.
Women suffering from breast cancer must be treated by multidisciplinary teams that have received and continue to receive appropriate professional training.
To help patients to get through the treatment phase as painlessly as possible, they must be given access to psychological support, physiotherapy and social services.
After treatment, the stage of medical and emotional aftercare is crucial.
Lastly, I wish to end on a hopeful note and say that we will one day be able to defeat and eradicate this disease.
Let us therefore make the best use not only of the EUR 400 million provided for cancer research by the sixth framework programme of research, but also of the new action programme in the field of public health (2003-2008), to develop innovative initiatives and projects.
Commissioner, the subject under discussion today is difficult, even painful, not just for women but often for entire families as well.
Indeed, the statistics just quoted - one women in ten is or will suffer from this disease - show that it is the most frequent cause of death for women aged between 35 and 55, and that we might have been able to prevent the deaths of 75 000 women per year if we had set up a much earlier prevention programme.
Therefore, this scourge cannot but become one of our most important targets over the next few years.
I am keen, then, to thank Mrs JÃ¶ns for her report and, above all, for the perseverance she has shown as well as the quality of the work she has produced.
It is essential, then, to promote and encourage preventive screening methods, to inform women and aim prevention campaigns at them.
However, my practical experience in this sector suggests to me that there are other obstacles, sometimes socioeconomic and often cultural.
We know that early diagnosis is still the best method of improving prognosis and treatment, and that early detection will make breast cancer easier to cure and less traumatic for the patient.
Subsequently, it is important to help women suffering from the disease.
That being the case, networks of multidisciplinary treatment centres offering women medical care and psychological and social advice are utterly fundamental to the plan.
Finally, I would point out that today's debate cannot be closed.
The fight against breast cancer must be part of a large-scale programme and continue to be a subject of research.
That is why I feel that it should indeed be linked with the Sixth Framework Programme for research and the EUR 400 million dedicated to cancer research.
It seems to me that the report on breast implants, approved in February of this year, is a positive and high-quality contribution to this aspect of women's health.
Furthermore, the proposed Commission recommendation to the Member States for better cancer detection will provide an opportunity to continue the debate on this subject, which is so important for women, and, I would add, for society as a whole.
Mr President, Commissioner, the own-initiative report on breast cancer by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is a balanced, well-considered one.
For that my special thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Karin JÃ¶ns.
The report gives key importance to quality standards and best practice, which Community health policy can help evaluate and which can be extended throughout all the Member States.
At present there are enormous disparities in the quality of treatment for breast cancer patients between Member States and regions.
Regrettably, this is directly reflected in the chances of survival of women with breast cancer, which is directly affected by the disparity in access to screening, diagnosis and treatment.
According to recent statistics from the World Health Organisation, approximately 80 000 women die from breast cancer in the Union every year.
It is the most frequent cancer in women and the most frequent cause of death in middle-aged women in the EU.
We could predict that the rise in the standard of living for women in the new Member States and the candidate countries and changes in lifestyle there will make the figures look even worse.
There is an urgent need to create a network of national cancer registers to cover the entire enlarged Europe so as to obtain conclusive and comparable data as a basis for research.
At present such a register only exists in seven Member States of the Union, in addition to my own country, and so not even half the citizens of the Union are covered.
It is to be hoped that the Commission will target Community resources in particular at more effective research into the causes of breast cancer and forms of treatment as well as methods for assessing the effectiveness of treatment.
In addition to the socio-economic and lifestyle factors the genotype is an important risk factor in breast cancer.
To date, two defective genes have been identified as causing breast cancer.
