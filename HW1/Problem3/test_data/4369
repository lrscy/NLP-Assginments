Moreover, the possibility of keeping import tariffs on 3% of the products that are currently protected will enable the United States, for example, to reinforce the tariff protection on as many as 420 products, and it is very easy to imagine that the products safeguarded will include those very products that are of the greatest importance to the poorest countries.
That is not to mention the review of the TRIPS agreements which, aside from all the rhetoric, will make it even more difficult for all those countries in the south of the world to gain access to medicines.
In conclusion, I believe that the report neither highlights those aspects nor points out that the WTO in fact represents an unfulfilled promise of an essential form of multilateralism designed to distribute wealth more effectively.
Â Â  Mr President, I share Mr Papastamkosâ concern that the Doha round has so far been dominated by agriculture.
That is why the EU has come away virtually empty-handed from the negotiations on designations and services.
It is because the EU must prioritise progress in these areas that I am delighted with the amendment in which the rapporteur calls on the Commission to draft an alternative action plan in case the negotiations fail.
This bears witness to more realism than simply insisting on the round ending in 2006.
A second element which I would like to highlight in this otherwise sound report is the role of China.
Europe needs to give attention not only to the protection of intellectual property and to dealing with illegal state support, but also to access to the Chinese market.
I am therefore delighted to learn of the increased cooperation between the EU and the United States which has resulted in a common complaint about the imports of car components into China.
This is yet another illustration that the Commission must continue to give priority to a better implementation of the WTO rules by China.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, everyone in this Chamber is in favour of free trade; no one wants to re-create the Albania of Enver Hoxhaâs time.
We are therefore all in favour of multilateral rules, but which rules, and to benefit whom?
We are told that free trade benefits employment and growth.
Yet, have the rules applied to trade until now made nations wealthy?
Here is the answer: in Mexico, 94 free trade agreements have been signed and they have not brought about prosperity; in Ecuador, the indigenous people of the Andes are against the free trade agreement; currently, in France, three million secondary school students are demonstrating because there are no jobs; and, where I live, the wine growers are poverty-stricken, people are committing suicide and yet there is free trade.
The observation demonstrating that the current free trade rules do not lead to economic prosperity indicates two possibilities.
The first possibility is that free trade is the secular name for Christianity, whereby the wine growers of Europe, the small farmers and the workers must climb onto the Cross in order to atone for their worldly sins.
In that case, let us continue and, in exchange for our concessions, Brazil and India will not open up their markets, and the Anglo-Saxon world will not recognise our intellectual property rights in relation to our agricultural designations.
Thus, Commissioner, we are persevering on the poverty path which, after ten rounds of GATT and WTO negotiations, has done nothing for Africa.
The other possibility is that, finally, we stop making mistakes and follow the path of subscribing not to the archaic technique of reducing or abolishing customs duties, but to the modern technique of deducting customs duties.
We will make the technological leap by inventing deductible customs duties because, in the form of tax credits that are offered to exporting countries and that can be used in the importing country, we shall have customs duties that ensure economic neutrality, and we shall resolve the tragedies brought about by globalisation.
Tell MrÂ Mandelson that his role is not that of following in the footsteps of David Ricardo, but of having John Maynard Keynesâ capacity for invention.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the remarkable job done by my friend, MrÂ Papastamkos, the former Greek Minister for Economic Affairs, in terms of piecing the facts together and finding a compromise, and I should like, Commissioner, to ask you to pass on my thanks to Mr Mandelson for all the work he has done.
The greatest success of the Hong Kong Conference was the fact that it was not a failure.
The stage that we are now at is crucial for the Earthâs balance.
I have two proposals and one remark to make.
Firstly, as regards the suspension of export subsidies in 2013, I should like to return to the proposal to set up an independent audit of all forms of tangible and intangible aid, and this so as to put a stop to the hypocrisy governing this matter.
Furthermore, we must place emphasis on important planning efforts, enabling quantitative and qualitative assessments to be made of the economic and social impact in Europe, in terms, for instance, of employment in the context of these negotiations.
Some of our important economic sectors, such as the agri-foodstuff industries, are very vulnerable in these negotiations, and the least we can do is to provide them with information.
Lastly, we need to tackle the issue of the link between international trade, wealth and poverty because it is vital that economies â particularly those in the West â which create their wealth by adhering to market principles, help implement real mechanisms for eradicating poverty in the world.
If we, as democrats, do not do so, then we will pay a very high price in political terms, not least by witnessing a rise in extremism.
There are Members in our European Parliament who believe that international trade creates poverty and not wealth.
As far as we, in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are concerned, we believe that the opposite is true.
In the past, the world dealt with its great upheavals by means of wars, and, today, military wars have been replaced by economic wars, with two differences: instead of people dying, we have people out of work, and we do not know who the enemy is.
In this affair, and faced with the rise in national self-interest which, at the end of the day, is only the sum of individualsâ self-interest, the European Union has a great deal at stake.
During the debates on our European Constitution, we had explained that we needed a more political Europe in order to exist in a world that is becoming more complex by the day.
If our fellow citizens do have any doubts about the usefulness of the European Union in this global trial of strength, then this will be yet another blow to our great European project.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like, first of all, to take my turn in congratulating our rapporteur and to say, following your presentation and the one that Mr Lamy, on behalf of the WTO, came here to make before the Committee on International Trade a few days ago, that we can see that, after Hong Kong, London and Rio, the Doha Round remains in abeyance and that it is even in jeopardy.
Admittedly, the round is making progress, but it is not keeping pace with the clock counting down to the moment when the US administrationâs negotiating mandate will expire and, unlike in the case of the previous rounds, we do not have the opportunity on this occasion to extend the debates by two or three years, unless we jeopardise the entire multilateral structure.
I believe that, if we are enthusiastic about this multilateral framework, we now need to call on each of the parties to make one final effort.
After the computer simulations in London, and after the spring-like beginnings or preliminaries in Rio, it is now time to act.
In particular, industrialised countries, Europe and the United States must make decisions and commitments and they must make the necessary gestures, because this round is a development round.
Admittedly, the G20 countries - the emerging countries - will themselves also have to make a number of concessions in the area of industrial tariffs, but we know that there will be less than full reciprocity.
We cannot demand that they jeopardise a number of fragile economic sectors or industrial or service sectors that are still not necessarily ready to be opened up to international competition.
I therefore believe that, despite everything, this round deserves to be concluded and I perhaps differ in that regard from some of my friends, such as MrÂ Agnoletto, who was pointing out its inadequacies a short while ago.
There are certainly inadequacies, and the European Unionâs energy must be focused on making sure that the commitments made to promote development are respected.
Yet, there is also the question of the abolition of export subsidies.
The implementation of this process must start before 2013 and, above all, it must be accompanied by a commitment and monitoring mechanism that guarantees that the other industrialised countries, and not just the European Union, move in the direction of abolishing all export subsidies.
Developing countries will, all the same, have greater access to the market of wealthy countries for their agricultural produce, and the list of sensitive goods must be reduced.
The least developed countries must be able to access the market free from duties and quotas, but a proportion of the 3% of tariff lines that will enable some countries, such as Japan or Australia, to avoid making this effort must be abolished; the TRIPs agreements on access to medications must be amended; and provision must be made for a development package including trade aid that must not be substituted for the aid already provided for in the context of the official development aid earmarked for the Millennium Development Goals.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
For ten years now, the WTO has been overseeing the complex business of international trade.
The quantity and quality of this trade is growing at an exponential rate.
It is therefore becoming crucial to develop a strong, uniform regulatory framework that guarantees transparency and eliminates inequalities.
The multilateral system is the only form of negotiation that is likely to guarantee a balanced approach among all the members.
I therefore hope that Europe can defend this position within the new negotiations and work hard to conclude the agreements by the end of 2006, since a further failure would weaken the entire system and give rise to serious consequences, especially for developing countries.
It is these countries, in particular, that we need to defend, and the industrialised countriesâ renunciation of export subsidies is a major step in this direction.
Naturally, if an initiative of this kind is to have positive results, it must be duly supported and retabled by the other members of the WTO.
For the sake of the development of the least developed countries, it is also important to ensure that the liberalisation of other sectors, such as services, does not cause irreparable harm to the economic and social structure of those countries and, in particular, that the delivery of public services is not subject to the competition rules and commercial pressure of companies from the North.
Lastly, however, I urge the Commission to ensure that our production is protected, especially in those sectors in which the burden of counterfeiting and illegal importation is becoming intolerable for thousands of industries.
The Commission must insist that the rules in force are strictly applied against these activities.
Â Â  Mr President, Africa accounts for less than 2% of world trade, and yet, the development round remains stuck on inadequate concessions.
The US lags behind in terms of the agricultural reform act; the EU is unforthcoming about further restrictions of car-sensitive products and the restriction of âblueâ services, and the G20 remain behind in terms of the reduction of the industrial tariffs.
Africa and the least developed countries are at risk of being at the receiving end of this.
They deserve the permanent right to protect their own agriculture, because the livelihoods of seven in ten people in those countries depend on this sector, and they deserve liberal access to the growth markets of the EU, the US and the G20.
Two weeks ago, Pascal Lamy, the WTOâs Secretary-General, did not mince his words when he said that unless we persevere in Geneva at the end of this month, the round will end in failure.
This would cost Europe economic growth and jobs, and Africa would lose out in terms of economic development and would fail to achieve the Millennium Objectives in the areas of basic education and health care.
So let us combine Europeâs and Africaâs interests; I would urge Commissioner Mandelson to go as far as he can with scrapping and restricting agricultural subsidies, and to support the Europe of the 21st century and not to turn Africa and our citizens into prisoners of past choices!
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work.
Although a great deal of progress is yet to be made in the negotiations, at least people are still talking, which is a blessing in itself.
I should like to make three points which, to my mind, will remain of critical importance in the coming weeks and months.
First of all, there is the need to involve the poorest countries.
Many delegations, in respect of the poorest countries that stand to gain the most from this round, find it difficult to remain involved in the negotiations at an expert level.
Secondly, it is these developing countries in particular that must benefit from world trade.
After all, it is not for nothing that we talk about the Doha âdevelopmentâ rounds.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission and the EU Member States to translate this fine principle, one that has been referred to in many speeches, into action both during and after the negotiations.
Finally, there is the liberalisation of trade in services.
The way in which those negotiations are being conducted is changing, and I regard that as a dangerous development.
In my view, abandoning the bottom-up approach cannot be reconciled with the idea of a development round and the report could have been more hard-hitting on that point.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall make just three short comments.
Firstly, I would like to thank you for this debate, which I found very constructive and balanced and indeed very interesting.
Thank you for not shooting the messenger!
I will indeed make sure that everything that has been said tonight is immediately forwarded to Mr Mandelson, who will also appreciate, I believe, that I did not go into depth on all the details of this Doha Round.
I would also like to comment on the overall process.
As you will understand, this is being regularly reported and discussed in the Commission.
As several Members asked, what happens if Doha fails and what should we then say about the overall process?
It is true that this process is not easy, but it is not blocked either, and we are still committed to concluding the round by the end of the year and to the principle of the single undertaking.
As has been mentioned, we have proposed real cuts in agricultural tariffs, but they must be matched by real cuts in industrial tariffs and services liberalisation.
We have a few weeks left before the end of April and we will continue to discuss with our partners, step by step, so as to agree on the arrangements within the deadline that we set ourselves in Hong Kong.
I would also like to say a few words about MEPsâ participation in the next WTO meeting, because I think this is very important to all of you.
As far as I understand it, the April meeting of the WTO is likely to be a General Council meeting in charge of negotiating procedures; it is not a ministerial as such, so it is not the same set-up and therefore the Commission does not foresee a fully-fledged official EU delegation such as that which we usually send to ministerial meetings like Hong Kong.
If the INTA Committee here in Parliament sends MEPs to Geneva during that meeting, the Commissioner will be ready to meet them and provide a debriefing as usual.
The Commission delegation in Geneva will also provide the support we usually offer to MEPs on the ground when they are on official business abroad.
That is what we can say for today about MEPsâ participation.
Again I thank you for the discussion and I will make sure that your views are immediately forwarded to Mr Mandelson and to the Commission as a whole.
Â Â  Mr President, I have one short question concerning the point the Commissioner just raised, that the April meeting will be a general Council meeting.
According to the information I have received, the general Council meeting might be changed â if it is successful â to a ministerial meeting.
In that case, the usual practice is that we have politicians available.
Could you please evaluate with your fellow Commissioners, and with Commissioner Mandelson, how you would like to proceed in such a case.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Mandelson would have to be here to give you the latest information.
If the decision or format is changed, then we will also have to ensure that the provision â when it comes to the participation of MEPs â is changed thereafter in accordance with that.
We welcome the participation of Members of the European Parliament, which has always been very helpful and would, again, provide openness and good support.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  Yesterday during the one-minute speeches, certain Members referred to the situation of a political group and I said that I would be able to respond to your concern today.
I can inform you that I have received a letter from MrÂ Bonde and Mr Farage, co-chairmen of the Independence and Democracy Group, in which they ask me to withdraw the Presidencyâs announcement of 15Â March on the restructuring of that political group.
Accordingly, in response to the request of the co-chairmen of that Group, that statement from the Presidency is withdrawn and declared null and void and the composition of the Independence and Democracy Group remains exactly as it was before 15 March 2006.
On the basis of this composition, which remains the same as before the Presidencyâs statement, the leadership of the group will schedule the meetings it considers appropriate in order to continue working within that group.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, of which I am the chairman, to inform you that, yesterday evening, a large majority, 14 votes to 9, of the committee voted against the Council request for urgent procedure on the proposal tabled by our colleague MrÂ Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on the regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco.
This is because, were we to agree to this request, it would amount to signing a blank document regarding this agreement, at a time when the discussions within our committee are far from complete, as shown by the liveliness of yesterday's debates, and at a time when the Committee on Development, which has a particular interest in this type of agreement, has not yet issued its opinion.
We are, of course, aware of the importance of this agreement both for the Moroccan Government and for European fishermen themselves.
That is why we propose to deal with this matter under an accelerated procedure that will allow us, following further discussions at the next meeting of the committee on 18 and 19Â April, to vote on the report in committee on 2Â May, and thus to submit it to Parliament during the following plenary session in May.
As far as we are aware, the initial payments should not be made until the end of June.
We therefore do not think that this final period of reflection, which we consider to be necessary within Parliament, will cause any major difficulties.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am in favour of this being treated as an urgent matter.
It really is necessary for the Spanish fishermen, and in their interests, that they should be able to fish with effect from the beginning of the season on 1 May.
They have for years now had no opportunity to go about their fishing business, and a delay would not essentially change anything whatever about the current ratification process or the content of the treaties.
Â Â  Mr President, my political group is opposed to the Councilâs request to apply the urgent procedure until Parliament is provided with the information that is essential in order to guarantee that this fisheries agreement is the appropriate legal framework for the Community fleet to be able to carry out its fishing activities normally.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am speaking pursuant to Rule 134(3), as rapporteur for this report, to inform the House that the rapporteur is against the urgent procedure.
I am against because, this being such a delicate issue, which has not been entirely concluded, involving an agreement which is still subject to substantial alterations by both sides, we cannot deny the competent committee, the Committee on Fisheries, its rightful report, debate and vote.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any shocks in the application of this agreement in the future, as has happened in the past.
We want to provide the fisheries sector with guarantees of legal certainty, that what has been agreed will be fully implemented and that this agreement is viable.
The Committee on Development has already given its opinion and we shall take its report into account.
The Committee on Fisheries has not done so yet.
With the compromise that I proposed yesterday to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, which that committee has approved, my intention is not to delay the report but to speed it up so that it may be available in this House in May and so that we can conclude this issue under ideal conditions, since the first deadline for the first financial compensation ends on 30 June.
We shall be on time and, in light of what Mr Kindermann has said, I would point out that for many of the species that are included in the agreement a biological rest period begins this month and next month, and they will not therefore be affected.
For these reasons, we are asking that our committee work during the remaining time so that we can bring a report from the competent committee to the House.
This is why we are rejecting the urgent procedure today.
(1)
Â Â  . MrÂ President, yesterday the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously agreed to support the Commission request for urgent procedure on exceptional market support measures for eggs and poultry.
In view of the major crisis currently facing the avian sector in a number of Member States, we think it is vital to reach a decision quickly, and, by adopting urgent procedure, the European Parliament will be in a position to express an opinion on the Commission's proposal.
It will thus demonstrate that it is able to react quickly to respond to the expectations of the citizens.
The Commission submitted the request for urgent procedure at the end of last week, and we will respond on Thursday.
I think that this is a good example for our citizens in terms of our response to a major crisis.
(2)
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the report by Magda KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the Employment Policies of the Member States [COM(2006)0032 C6-0047/2006 2006/0010(CNS)] (A6-0086/2006), and
- the report by JosÃ© Manuel GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the situation of the European economy: preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 [2006/2047(INI)] (A6-0077/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the heart of the new growth and employment policy with which we seek to move the Lisbon agenda forward, are the integrated economic guidelines; they are integrated because they reflect the recognition that we cannot satisfactorily perform the task of bringing Europe more growth and more jobs if we fail to make the close connection between macro-economic, micro-economic and employment goals.
The economic guidelines form the framework within which the Member States and the Community institutions put together their respective plans for the implementation of the strategy for growth and jobs.
It was during the past year that the Commission first presented them, and I am grateful to your House for giving them such close attention, for they will be a guide â not only during this year but also thereafter â to what we are considering doing and to the basis on which we will be doing it.
The fact is that the growth and employment strategy, which we have been trying to implement for something like a year, is a completely new kind of process.
It is not yet altogether straightforward to pass final judgment on the elements of this new process, but one thing can be said today, albeit with a great deal of caution, and that is that the Member States have in their national reform programmes, basically allowed themselves to be guided by the priorities set out in the integrated economic guidelines, as has the Commission with its proposal for a Community action programme.
It is important that I should point out that the growth and employment strategy is based on a three-year cycle. What that means is that there is no intention that the guidelines should be amended from one year to another.
They may well, though, be adapted to take account of changed realities and the insights that we gain from experience, and that will, of course be necessary, but we do not, at present, see any reason why these guidelines should be amended for 2006; they are still a sound basis for the dialogues in which the Commission is currently engaged with the Member States, the object of which is to get the national reform programmes actually up and running.
As for the individual pillars of this strategy, my fellow-Commissioners Mr Almunia and Mr Å pidla will have something more to say about its macro-economic and employment aspects.
I would like, briefly, to discuss its micro-economic dimension and highlight the significant advances that have been made in this respect in some areas, particularly as regards the key issue for Europeâs economic future, namely the transition to a knowledge-based society and its becoming an economy founded on innovation, research and development.
It was for that reason that we were so insistent on imposing quantitative targets for research and development.
You will be aware that this was an area in which the national reform programmes produced rather disappointing results, for they would, on average, have brought us up to 2.2% by 2010 instead of the desired 3%.
In the few weeks this year in which we have been able to address this issue, we have, however, been able to get the Member States to commit significantly more.
If they stick to them, we will be able to achieve 2.6% by 2010, which is an improvement, but â and I have to make this clear â it is not enough, and so the Commission will continue to bring pressure to bear on them.
The European Council, held the week before last and which you will be discussing tomorrow, also discussed, and came to conclusions on, important aspects of the strategyâs implementation; I would refer you in particular to the Council resolutions on the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses, on improving the lawmaking process and on energy policy.
From time to time, the question is discussed â in connection with the guidelines â of whether the Commission, when assessing the national reform plans in future, should or should not hand down recommendations specific to the countries in question.
We refrained from doing so in the first round for a reason that we regarded as important, namely the fact that we did not know what the national reform programmes would look like, but I would like to point out that the Commission does, self-evidently, retain the option of including country-specific recommendations in future progress reports and that this is an option of which we will avail ourselves as and when necessary.
At present, though, it strikes me that the most important thing is that we should all work together on making the broader European public aware of the fact that we do actually have a common strategy for growth and job creation, of the priorities that we share, and of the fact that we are working together to deliver on them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree with the assessment that Vice-President Verheugen has just made on the way in which we are implementing the revised Lisbon Strategy that we implemented last year.
On reading Mr GarcÃ­a-Margalloâs report on the European economy and the broad economic policy guidelines, I note a considerable degree of agreement, and we also noted this agreement within the Commission, with the same objectives and the same process towards achieving them, at the last European Council.
I believe that this fundamental agreement amongst the three European institutions is crucial to the credibility of the process, the acceptance of the objectives of this strategy by all economic and social actors, and not just the European and national institutions, and is one of the conditions â which I believe to be essential â for achieving greater growth and employment in the European Union.
With regard to macroeconomic issues, I would like to refer to three points.
Firstly, it is clear that, as we have said on many occasions, and I believe that we agree with Parliamentâs opinion, it was important to achieve greater synchronisation amongst the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, in order to achieve more growth and more employment, and the application of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Over the last year, this has been achieved.
There is more coordination and a better relationship between them and I believe that we are achieving very positive results in practice.
The European economy is making better progress today towards fiscal consolidation than it was a year ago, as one of the necessary conditions for more solid growth and growth that is capable of generating employment.
The confidence of the economic actors is improving, the results of activity suggest that 2006 is going to offer better results than in 2005 and the perspectives opening up for the future are also positive.
Secondly, I entirely agree with what MrÂ GarcÃ­a-Margalloâs report says with regard to the importance of paying more attention to the sustainability of public finances and, in particular, with regard to how to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population.
A few weeks ago, the Commission and the Economic Policy Committee, which is made up of all of the Member States, published a report on the economic and budgetary consequences of the ageing of the population.
These consequences are significant, but that report also notes that, by acting on time and carrying out reforms, such as those included in many national Lisbon Strategy programmes and those which the different Member States are promoting by means of their initiatives, in particular Commissioner Å pidlaâs initiatives in the demographic field, results can be seen, and there are now European countries that are in a better position today than five years ago to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population.
In October, the Commission is going to publish a report on this issue, which I hope will also be debated and monitored in Parliament.
A final point.
I am very pleased that, as well as a general analysis of the European economy and of the role of the Lisbon Strategy and of the different instruments included in the broad economic policy guidelines for the economy of twenty-five, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margalloâs report makes a particular reference to the challenges and needs of the eurozone, in which the twelve countries that share the single currency, the euro, need mechanisms for coordination and special attention in order to obtain the best possible results from the economic and monetary union.
We would like to thank Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo for pointing this out in this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs, on behalf of the Commission for the excellent report that has been presented by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
This report is constructive in two ways: it adds to the underlying body of knowledge and it ought to speed up adoption by the Council, in comparison with previous years.
At the spring session of the European Council it was stated that the Union would be capable of creating 2Â million jobs per year.
Yet job creation and cuts in unemployment will not happen unless we take advantage of the current economic growth to continue with the necessary reforms.
The session provided confirmation that the integrated guidelines remain valid, at the same time setting out which priorities would be attracting greater emphasis.
I am delighted that the parliamentary committee is advocating a similar approach and that it has not agreed to any excessive changes to the underlying principles of employment policy.
We are amenable to changes in the points of justification, but by the same token we want to stick with the original wording of the text itself.
Last year the Lisbon Strategy was redefined in respect of the integrated set of basic principles behind employment policy and the guidelines for economic policy.
The Strategy has a tri-annual nature, in the interests of creating a clear and stable political framework for the bodies entrusted with its implementation.
A study carried out by the Commission into the first of the national reform programmes has uncovered specific shortcomings in respect of Member State implementation, although these do not undermine the validity of the basic principles.
It would therefore be inappropriate to give the impression that we wish to change the direction or content of the policies at this point.
The text proposed by the Commission deliberately left open the possibility of supplementing the points of justification with specific political priorities.
It therefore clearly goes along with Parliamentâs desire to include in the points of justification some elements of an economic and social nature which require particular attention, especially where they accord with the conclusions of the latest spring session of the European Council.
The session placed an emphasis on the need to increase employment especially among young people, women, older people and people with health problems, legitimate migrants and minorities.
In the case of young people there was confirmation of the goal of reducing by 10% the numbers of those not finishing school, and offering every young person employment, work experience or further education within six months of leaving school by 2007 and within four months by 2010, as set out in the current main principles.
In the case of older workers the emphasis was on the need to introduce an integrated strategy based on quality jobs and specialist training.
Concerning equal opportunities for men and women, the spring session of the European Council adopted the European Pact for Gender Equality, and the Council also adopted the Commission proposal to launch a wide-ranging debate which should lead to the adoption of common principles in the area of flexibility and security (âflexsecurityâ) by the end of 2007.
The aim of this discussion with the Member States and social partners is to reduce the segmentation of the labour market and to strike the right balance between flexibility and security.
I would also like to say how delighted I am that the Commission proposal to set up a European globalisation adjustment fund was favourably received at the spring summit.
This bears witness to the desire to make more effective use of Community funds in support of European employment strategy, and in accordance with the wishes of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . â European citizens do not like the political code words used by the experts.
Unfortunately, the âLisbon processâ is starting to become a code phrase too, even though it represents our common future.
If the Member States of the Union are competitive, we will have more and better jobs.
If more people find jobs, poverty will be reduced.
Also, this would provide more resources for the reform of social systems, and to enable us to preserve our environment for our grandchildren.
I would like to strongly emphasise that work that is not accompanied by and founded on social security cannot produce significant economic results.
And if this is true, which it is, then we can welcome the decision of the Council and Commission, that Member States should assess the implementation of the Directives on employment and economic development in integrated Directives, evaluating the two issues in connection with one another.
We can see that the picture has become richer, especially through the fact that the European Commission has now assessed the action plans of 25 Member States.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has acknowledged and accepted that on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreements, Parliament will not change the guidelines annually â and I believe that this will also serve the interests of the Member States â and it will only change them in the event of any problems arising on the employment market of the European Union.
At the same time, in the specifications of political aims â contained in the preamble â we considered it important to include in the parliamentary document the lessons learned from the first report prepared after the ten new Member States joined the European Union.
The committee agreed, almost unanimously, that Parliament should participate more actively in the verification of the implementation of the guidelines.
In this respect, we will contact the competent Commission official.
In my report I wished to complement the presentation of the Commission in respect of three important matters of principle; my colleagues, the members of the committee, have made a significant contribution to insure that these are presented clearly and comprehensively.
Primarily, we emphatically call attention to the improvement of the labour market opportunities of social groups with various disadvantages.
And, as mentioned by the Commissioners, this is also a precondition of further economic growth.
A huge reserve for increasing labour resources is firstly to increase the activity of women, secondly, to maintain the ageing or aged workforce on the labour market or to encourage their return, and thirdly, to help young people find jobs and enter the labour market.
However, we believe that the elimination of the disadvantages that keep away a part of the people from the labour market today is at least as important.
We also call attention to the anomaly that workers coming from third countries may have a more favourable position on the European labour market than citizens of new Member States.
We will have the opportunity to discuss this problem in connection with the ry report, but I would already like to say, on the basis of the news we have recently heard, that we welcome the Netherlands to the âclub of the 6â (as the seventh country, from 2007).
And finally, thirdly, we believe that without a long-term financial perspective it is not possible to provide adequate resources to Member States for the tasks that are specified as fundamental goals in the integrated guidelines either.
Polite words are fashionable here, but this is not politeness or force of habit: I would like to say a sincere thank you to my colleagues â irrespective of their party affiliation â and to the representatives of the various political groups for their help and contribution, and separately to Ana Mato Adrover, the co-rapporteur of the report.
There is hope that the phrase âunity through diversityâ will not be a slogan only, but also an opportunity.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioners, the discussion of the broad economic policy guidelines has given us many headaches in previous years.
In order to make sure the headache is not so severe this year, I shall restrict myself to three questions: why has Parliament decided to produce a report despite the fact that the Commission has chosen to ratify the previous reports?
What can we do to ensure that our reports are heard?
And thirdly, what is it that we want the Commission to hear?
Firstly, why a report?
Because previous reports contained masses of recommendations that the Commission has not taken into account.
Secondly, because, since we discussed the previous report, new factors have arisen: the relative failure of the European Constitution, a new financial perspective, some first interest rate rises, three candidates seeking to join the eurozone, and the Doha Round, which continues the Hong Kong trade talks.
Secondly, because there are certain factors that we have taken up in other reports, but which have become more important over time.
Commissioner Almunia referred to the ageing of the population and we should also talk about the consequences of immigration, the consequences of Chinese imports, once the quantitative restrictions have come to an end, about world imbalances, essentially in relation to the United States, and finally the energy crisis.
What can we do in order to be heard?
This report has been drawn up in a spirit of consensus, which has obliged many of us to give way on our particular points of view, and I would like in particular to thank all of the representatives of the other parliamentary groups for doing so.
If we want to be heard, the first thing I must point out here is that previously we have not been heard.
This report begins with a kind of catalogue of grievances, a list of recommendations that we have made and that the Commission has not taken up.
We asked for a transposition of directives, which has not happened, a reduction of deficits â Commissioner Almunia has pointed out that 12 of the 25 Member States are currently in a situation of excessive deficit â a communication on globalisation in order to make clear to the public the opportunities and challenges it presents â and if this communication had been produced, it would have spared us a few headaches â and we also called for the application of the charters on small and medium-sized businesses, something which has not been done.
Secondly, this report deals with what we might call institutional issues, whether of a constitutional nature or not.
During this period of active reflection â which is neither a reflection nor active â we are dealing with those questions which were left over from the Convention and which have not been answered: what are the Unionâs objectives and competences?
What are the responsibilities of the European Central Bank, while respecting its independence at all times?
What should we do in order to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact?
What are the legal bases for modifying taxation in the Union and in the Member States?
There is one explicit recommendation that I would ask the Commission to take particular note of: this Parliament will not approve any directive by means of the Lamfalussy procedure if the problem of call-back is not resolved by 2008, ultimately the international representation of the eurozone.
The Vice-President of the Commission has referred to coordinating the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines within a single document: it is true, but they are still subject to different information and consultation procedures which make them difficult to understand.
Furthermore, it is necessary to incorporate other documents in order to ensure that it is not fragmentary.
With regard to taxation in an institutional sense, we call upon the Commission to respond to what the High Court of Justice has said: a uniform definition of tax residence, as an extension of citizenship, the principle of non-discrimination and a convention on double taxation.
With regard to coordination, I was pleased with Commissioner Almuniaâs kind words: it is true that we have to coordinate more, we must make a precise diagnosis, draw up a correct cure, an analysis of what has happened and define the role of the Eurogroup.
In the field of macroeconomic policy, we do not go into the issue of interest rates, we do not express our opinion.
We do say that we have to do everything possible to ensure that prices do not rise and interest stays low.
We refer to public debt, in terms used by the Commissioner: less interest, less repayments, means more spending on ageing, more Lisbon.
With regard to the business climate, we call for serious reflection. The United States are ahead of us.
144 of the worldâs top companies are from the European Union, while in the case of the United States, that figure stands at 206.
Small and medium-sized businesses double their employment in the first two years, something that does not happen in Europe.
We are calling for positive discrimination to be applied in favour of small and medium-sized businesses, with particular reference to the funding of risk capital.
In the field of taxation, to put it in simple terms, we ask that Home State Taxation be used for companies in application of the principle of place of origin with regard to VAT.
I have nothing to say with regard to human capital.
My colleague has expressed this very well.
In the field of investment: trans-European networks.
It would take twenty years to finish them.
Energy, R+D+I, more market, more competition, more competitiveness.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by stressing the good work and wonderful cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs, and I would like to congratulate her on her efforts and the report she has presented.
As we know, scarcely a year ago, the employment guidelines were approved, and it was my honour to be rapporteur on that occasion.
Those guidelines established the general approach to employment and the priorities for the next three years, and their purpose was to make an effective contribution to employment growth, the productivity of the economy and, of course, strengthening social inclusion and cohesion.
These guidelines, which were debated jointly with the economic policy guidelines, which this year have been presented brilliantly by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, have been taken up and translated into concrete objectives in the national reform plans, approved scarcely six months ago by the Member States.
Both through common sense â they were approved scarcely a year ago and they are for three years â and as a result of the content of the guidelines themselves, we have simply updated them.
Of what has this updating consisted?
Three broad areas.
Firstly, we have taken up the priority issues that have been highlighted at the big European summits held this year: firstly, investment in research, development and innovation and the spread of information technologies, an aspect which is furthest from achieving the Lisbon objectives; secondly, genuine and effective equality of opportunities, which our group has always advocated, and which includes the incorporation of women, permanent positions for them and their promotion in the workplace and, of course, equal pay; and, thirdly, we strongly advocate stable employment, and I say this because the majority of work that is being created is precarious.
In my country, for example, 52% of all work created over the last two years has been temporary work, and that is unacceptable.
Secondly, we have repeated certain fundamental issues which have not been adequately dealt with by the Commission.
In the fight against accidents in the workplace we advocated a broad agreement at European level, which we believe to be essential, since in Spain, for example, 990 people lost their lives in 2005, and also help for the victims of domestic violence in finding work.
Finally, since we are now updating them, we want this Parliament to be able to monitor the employment guidelines and compliance with them by the Member States.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, Commissioner Almunia, Commissioner Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that the European single market presents us with our great opportunity, a great opportunity for us, with our 450 million people or thereabouts, to find our own way through globalisation, a way that must be marked by economic prosperity and sound finances, while also producing results that are real to ordinary people.
What we have to discuss â and this debate is fundamental to our doing so â is whether we have equipped ourselves with all the instruments we will need on this voyage, and whether we are making the right use of the instruments we have in order to give this internal market the right framework and influence the processes of economic development in the long term.
Let me make two observations which go beyond todayâs debate and these reports.
We will not succeed in this objective if we do not succeed â and soon â in putting the European Union on an independent and accountable financial footing, nor will we succeed in it if we do not succeed in talking about taboo subjects, including the need for a common fiscal policy in this European Union of ours.
The reason I say this is that, in the economic situation in which we find ourselves, there is no longer any justification for taboos of any kind.
Anyone who brings fresh air into this debate has my backing, for, if we consider the economic situation, we simply cannot afford to carry on letting debates be ritualistic and keeping fresh air out of this House and out of our debates.
In 2005, our economic development lagged behind what it had been in 2004; our unemployment rate is still alarmingly high at around nine per cent, and long-term unemployment in particular is again on the rise.
I am very glad to hear Commissioner Almunia say â and he has my backing for saying it â that there are indications of the economy developing in the right direction, but I have to tell him that there is no guarantee that the European Union will be able to fuel its own recovery.
That is why we have to talk about what needs to be put on the agenda.
When will we in the European Union at last introduce a common investment policy?
That is the most urgent thing we have to do.
When will we start investing, as a Community, in research and development?
In the last ten years, we have managed to increase that investment from 1.8% to 1.9%.
When will we start on better and longer-term investment in education, with a coordinated strategy in the Member States?
When will we start making use of the great potential of energy efficiency?
That is where the key to the next technological revolution is to be found, so let us set to work!
Where, in this field, are the Member States investing money?
Where is Europe-wide discussion of it being guided?
Looking at the transport sector, we sometimes feel that we actually ought to rewrite Delorsâ White Paper in view of the many transposition deficits in this area, and if we were to face up to them and invest more, we could make progress.
Childcare is one of the core issues.
If we invest more in childcare, we get higher birthrates and more people â women in particular â into the workplace; that much is demonstrated by statistics.
We support all those who want to make advances in this area.
I urge you, once and for all, to put cooperation with this House on a proper institutional footing, and then we will no longer need â and I thank Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo for pointing this out â to spend our time merely writing own-initiative reports, but discussions in this House will be on a different and stable basis.
Â Â  . Some time ago scientists established that there is no miracle drug which can help create jobs, solve all employment problems and encourage competitiveness, but rather there is a multitude of factors and we must simply find a good combination of these.
The problem is that this combination of factors differs from country to country and must take into account peculiarities of the national economy.
On the evidence of the unsuccessful experience of the International Monetary Fund in attempting to create a single universal model, it is doubtful whether we should try to create an economic strategy model on a European scale.
I believe that we must stress three basic points.
First of all, we ought to agree with Mr Garcia-Margallo's view that we must consolidate all economic policy documents; there are too many of them and they are repetitive.
Secondly, we must outline a mechanism of interaction between national and European level economic strategies.
And thirdly, this can be achieved by determining clear and concrete priorities which complement each other.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen said that the right place for the employment policy guidelines is at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy, and in that he was right.
The employment policy guidelines now not only serve as the formal basis for the national employment plans, but also make their influence felt on the shape and development of national labour markets, and so it is not a matter of indifference that the Council should simply walk off with the fourth pillar of the European employment policy, equality of opportunity for women in the labour market.
Women are hit much harder by unemployment than are men; it is they, still, who do most of the part-time jobs.
They still earn 15% less than men for comparable work, and they have fewer opportunities for promotion.
They still find it much harder to get back into the labour market, especially where there is no universal, freely accessible and all-day childcare.
Gender mainstreaming still needs to be backed up by pro-active measures to promote the interests of women, and so I really am very grateful to Mrs KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs for making it possible for us to agree on a compromise, at any rate in the recitals, in order to incorporate into the guidelines measurable indicators for the promotion of equality of opportunity.
I would also like to draw your attention to a second amendment.
We want Guideline No 22 to be deleted.
We believe that wages should be determined by the parties to a collective agreement, and must be kept out of political resolutions.
I cannot but note, to my considerable disquiet, that there seems to be in this House a tacit agreement between the two main groups to the effect that, in future, governmental policy decisions, in the shape of national employment plans, should ensure that overall wages trends be brought into line with the rise of productivity in the economic cycle.
I had thought that the planned economy with which we were familiar in the former East Germany had been banished from Europe once and for all, until I realised that the guidelines determine the support to be given by the European Social Fund.
It would be inconsistent for the ESF to determine wages; that is something that the two sides of industry are quite capable of doing, and should be left to them.
Â Â  . â The bulk of the integrated guidelines for employment growth contain the main barriers to an effective employment policy that prioritises the creation of high-quality jobs with rights, social and territorial cohesion, and peopleâs well-being.
This is, first of all, because priority is attached to ensuring economic stability, to enlarging and deepening the internal market, to opening up the markets and promoting competition, and to creating a more business-friendly environment.
All of which is music to the ears of the large economic and financial groups, and to the overlords of international trade who, enjoying the fruits of exploiting cheap labour from third countries, prefer the enormous returns from relocating production to maintaining and developing jobs with rights in EU Member States.
What is more, the guidelines for employment are much too vague, as they omit key areas, such as the need to increase female involvement in the labour market, and to ensure high-quality jobs with rights.
This would help to combat the kind of salary- and career-related discrimination that women continue to fall victim to, and would not lead to the precarious, poorly-paid work that we see today.
It is also crucial to boost regional economies, to promote micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and to create jobs in regions where there are high levels of unemployment.
Families must also be supported, both in terms of rearranging and reducing working hours, without any loss of rights, and in terms of investing in public services to support the family, as this would help to create jobs better suited to local and regional needs.
Greater public investment is therefore urgently required in health, housing and guaranteed access to free, high-quality education and training.
We have therefore tabled a proposal to attach these guidelines to the proposals submitted, as we believe it is vital to include them in the guidelines for employment.
Â Â  . Mr President, the broad economic policy guidelines are vital in providing a coherent framework for guiding Member States towards achieving the Lisbon Goals.
The challenge for Ireland and Europe will be to implement the agreed guidelines via the national reform programmes.
It is of utmost importance that Europe gains economic stability.
However, I absolutely reject all sections of this report that call for support for the Commissionâs common consolidated corporate tax base.
The setting of a common base is intrinsically linked to a harmonised rate.
Member States need to be realistic in recognising that the introduction of a common tax base is simply the thin edge of the wedge towards tax harmonisation.
It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State.
The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies, rather the EUâs competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies.
Competition can actually have a harmonising effect.
I believe that tax competition harmonises opportunities within the EU and it enables small countries on the periphery of the Union to compete.
Finally, overall I welcome the role of state aid in supporting the Lisbon objectives.
However, I would like to stress that state aid rules should not be used to block Ireland or any other Member State from competing against non-EU countries for important foreign direct investment.
Europe needs flexibility to move forward and meet the challenges of globalisation.
Europe needs to reform its economies, and all countries should do that.
Â Â  . Mr President, the report on employment policies is over-laden with key phrases, the tone for which is set very early on: legislation, EC monitors and enforcement.
Then we have got the special importance of younger and older workers; then the EU without barriers â remove them, it says â with clear and measurable priorities; review the guidelines every three years, but Parliament must be more active between times; examine Member Statesâ national reform programmes.
Well, let us do that. The French took a 35-hour working week, not a 48-hour week.
But when the Working Time Directive was given flesh last year, many of their workers protested at EU interference.
Port workers protested earlier this year at more EU interference.
French cities are now under siege due to new youth employment policies.
Who is going to tell MrÂ Chirac or Mr de Villepin that they are wrong, they are not conforming to guidelines?
Of course you will not.
The French will govern themselves, as all of us should do, as grown-up democracies.
But most sinister of all in this report is Guideline 19: continual review of incentives and disincentives resulting from the tax and benefits systems.
Already a colleague has spoken this morning of a single fiscal policy.
Is this the start of EU harmonisation of tax policy across the Union â something they said would never happen?
Ladies and gentlemen, your tax systems are under threat.
You have been warned!
Â Â  The reports under discussion today finally provide a clear picture of the gloomy state of the EU economy and correctly identify the causes thereof: poor regulation, a lack of structural and social reforms and a lack of flexibility within the economy.
We also have insufficient entrepreneurial dynamism, weak labour markets, sluggish productivity growth, lack of investment, lack of innovation and bad systems of education.
Here we are calling for the entrepreneurial spirit to be encouraged, for a reduction in labour costs and for improved standards of teaching in mathematics and natural sciences.
The description is very succinct, but very hypocritical.
This Parliament could take concrete steps towards productivity, flexibility and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit, and really â not just formally â liberalising the services market, instead of surrendering in a cowardly manner to the demonstrators in the nearby area.
I am afraid that todayâs reports will come to nothing, as long as national governments behave in the same sort of populistic and hypocritical way as this Parliament, rather than confronting difficult truths and taking uncomfortable measures for survival.
Â Â  â Mr President, at a time when the phenomenon of globalisation has ultimately determined many of the aspects of the economic and social systems of all our countries, we must be aware that every obstacle to the freedom of movement of persons, goods, capital and services is a major obstacle to competitiveness, growth and job creation.
The notion that the interests of a particular country can be protected by restricting freedom of movement within the EU is pie in the sky.
This kind of attitude may work as a short term panacea but will never properly solve the challenges facing the EU.
In order for Europe to gain a firmer foothold in an increasingly globalised world, it needs, first and foremost, to press ahead with liberalising the markets.
As we know, the demographic situation on the European continent and the phenomenon of globalisation make it imperative that we carry out a range of reforms to the social and economic models of many EU Member States.
The higher the economic growth in Europe, the easier it will be to carry out these reforms, but in order for that growth to emerge, the internal market must be functioning completely.
While Europe grows at rates of 1, 2 or even 3%, it is very difficult to implement these reforms, which are so vital for peace and social stability in the EU.
I therefore wish to highlight the fact that the completion of the internal market of course contains an economic component, but there is a further crucial element, and that is social policy.
This is yet another reason why I support the Commissionâs efforts thus far in this area.
I should like to make one final remark about the free movement of workers.
By putting up certain types of barrier to the free movement of workers, some Member States are actually in the preposterous situation of helping workers from third countries to gain access to jobs ahead of those from new EU Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, MrsÂ KovÃ¡cs, for a very constructive piece of work.
We in Parliament have, of course, come out in favour of the Guidelines being long-term three-year cycles and of their being integrated.
Once suitably long-term, integrated Guidelines are in place, it is incredibly important for us to examine the National Reform Programmes.
It is important for the Commission to do this, but it is also important for Parliament to be involved in examining and following up the National Reform Programmes.
Commissioner Almunia said that the economic prospects are better now.
That is true, but the employment situation in Europe is anything but encouraging.
It is entirely possible that it can be improved, but allow me to discuss three areas that are extremely worrying.
Firstly, there is the question of youth unemployment.
This is of very great concern because, if young people leave education only to be immediately unemployed â and in the long term, at that â it is incredibly difficult to get them back into the labour market subsequently.
I do not believe in the French model or believe, as a number of other parties expressly do, that employment is boosted by making one particular group or another less secure.
Employment is stimulated through proactive industrial and labour market policies.
Where the older labour force is concerned, we have the dilemma that people are leaving the EU labour market far too early nowadays.
Older workers need to be able to develop their skills to a higher degree, but we also need to increase health and safety in workplaces.
I turn, finally, to gender equality, which must permeate everything.
I welcome the Gender Equality Pact which is now, or will in time be, part of the Lisbon process.
It is especially important that child care and other areas be developed so that it is possible for men and women alike both to work and to have an up-and-running family life.
These are aspects that I should like you to include.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Unionâs main problem is high unemployment.
If we are to get our 20 million unemployed back to earning their own living, a change of policy is needed, and in practice rather than in theory.
The guidelines constitute the main instrument for coordinating the economic policies of the Member States in the effective manner that is required, but, in practice, progress so far has been regrettably unsatisfactory.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore calls for renewed efforts; what we expect to see from the Member States is sounder budget policies, real structural reforms on the labour market and in health and pensions, and markedly more investment in education and research.
At the European level, we call for the creation of a single tax base for the taxation of businesses, improvements in the VAT systems, for the adoption of the 14th companies directive, which will make it easier for companies to put themselves on an international footing; for further reductions in subsidies, the introduction of a Community patent and the consistent opening-up of the markets.
Only when we have put our houses in order in this way will we be able think about introducing EU-wide taxes, which is what Mr Bullmann is calling for.
Only if there is real change in policy will Europe be able to face the great challenges in an effective way.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to MrsÂ KovÃ¡cs for her report.
The rapporteur has considered some fundamental issues relating to employment, which at the current time â a time of obsession over economic growth â are often overlooked, and these include the issues of equal opportunity for men and women, access to employment for young and old people, health and safety at work and freedom of movement for workers throughout the Union.
On the basis of experience from the Czech Republic and conversations with colleagues, and also looking at the current situation in France, I know that the issue of first jobs for graduates, for example, is often one of the most challenging.
Despite the fact that there have been efforts at a solution on the part of the European Commission, the recommendations and instruments of the European Commission have so far had little effect, due in part to patchy implementation by the Member States, as the rapporteur has stated.
It is precisely this area that should be occupying most of our attention, together with age discrimination on the labour market.
Equality of opportunity between men and women on the labour market is unquestionably an important issue.
We know from the statistics that even though women constitute a growing segment of society, this trend is not reflected in their share of employment.
What is more striking still is the proportion of women in leading positions.
We must call on all Member States to apply anti-discrimination laws scrupulously and without delay, in order that this pattern may be reversed.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for having drawn attention in the report to restrictions on the free movement of labour within the European Union internal market.
Unfortunately, the most recent enlargement of the European Union was perceived within the internal market as a threat, instead of a new opportunity.
The mythical Polish plumber, who in real life would be welcome, but is difficult to find, clearly illustrates the fears which after enlargement now hold sway in the European Union internal market.
We see a negative attitude towards all four market freedoms, and not just the free movement of labour.
It is therefore a pity that the report provides no assessment of the draft Services Directive as watered down by this Parliament, which in the variant put forward by the Commission was supposed in the coming years to become the main stimulus for the labour market in the European Union.
Similarly, the report did not assess the negative repercussions for employment of restrictions on the free movement of capital. These include those restrictions adopted by this Parliament at last monthâs part-session in Strasbourg.
I am referring to the report entitled âRestructuring and employmentâ and particularly the report entitled âRelocation in the context of regional developmentâ.
The main of both reports is the creation of restrictions preventing businesses from freely relocating within the European Union internal market.
This is a time of untapped opportunities for boosting the European Union labour market.
The development and strengthening of the European Unionâs internal market is the most effective tool in preparing the Member Statesâ labour market for increasing global competition.
Therefore, we ought to look at the basic approach of the Member Statesâ employment policies in close connection with the goal of developing the potential of the European Union internal market.
Â Â  It was in 2003 that Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil wrote his previous report on the economic guidelines and now, three years down the line, judging from the place which the environment occupies in economic policy, it seems that cooperation by means of the open-coordination method has failed to make the necessary impact.
It was decided at the Stockholm Summit that the attempt should be made to incorporate environmental policy and social policy into the economic policy guidelines, with the aim of establishing a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union.
Since, in my view, the environmental aspects of economic policy get a raw deal, I would call for the inclusion in the economic policy guidelines of clear and specific environmental objectives, in addition to references to the importance of the environment.
There should also be targets with regard to energy consumption and CO2 emission reductions.
Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with a responsible use of natural resources, and that is why I will support Mr Lipietzâs amendments.
Â Â  â Mr President, the task of those in this House, such as myself, who are both MEPs and authors, must surely be, in an avant-garde and constructive way, to use criticism as a way of waking up the great â who must, being thus awakened â respond to our criticisms in a practical way.
I see that Mr Karas is next on the list to speak; well, Othmar, here comes an easy ball for you.
The effect of what is happening now is that the EU mainstream rubs its eyes and says, âyes, we really do have a problemâ, but I ask you to think forward to the move after this one.
The Prognos study is an impressive demonstration of the fact that we will not, of course, achieve full employment in the next couple of decades.
On the contrary, we will be moving towards what one of the journalists on the calls the âdisposable Americanâ, or, to put it in our terms, the âdisposable Europeanâ.
It is to that that we will have to find solutions.
We have an enormous problem with the loss of the services that have provided jobs to replace the industrial jobs that are no longer there.
This is where we need to move ahead, this is where we need approaches that are good for more than just today.
Indeed so: one core issue, one potential starting point, is the reallocation of all these millions and billions that are still hidden away in the EUâs budget and being wasted on pointless things.
I am thinking, for example, of the way in which the most-subsidised sector of agriculture in France is the production of rice.
We also have a chance, in the current absence of a finalised Financial Perspective, to make more improvements here and of accomplishing even now what you will otherwise do only after another five or ten years, when it will, again, be almost too late.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Almunia, Commissioner Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, why do we need economic policy guidelines?
We need them because we do not have a common economic policy, and the reason why we do not have a common economic policy is that the instruments for a pro-active economic policy are in the hands of the Member States â research policy, fiscal policy, education policy, to name but three areas.
Since our last report, conditions have in many respects become more acute.
It is becoming more and more apparent to us that the European Unionâs potential for growth is not being exploited to the full, that we are insufficiently prepared for demographic change, and that we have not yet made full use of the opportunities that globalisation is presenting to our continent.
What the energy crisis and high unemployment show is that our problems are not only home-made, but that they also originate from structural and global causes, and that it is these that we must address in a pro-active manner.
We want codecision for this European Parliament in all matters touching upon the single market, for in all of them we need more Europe in cooperation with the Member States than currently exists in reality.
This report, therefore, constitutes our demand for the transposition of all the internal market directives, inconsistent implementation of which distorts competition and costs us growth and jobs.
We demand budget consolidation measures on the part of the states with excessive deficits, for failure to repair our social security and pensions systems will bar us from participation in global competition.
I would also like to urge that the SMEsâ Charter be implemented in full.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this meeting is obviously important, because the debate on the guidelines provides the means to implement the Lisbon Strategy.
It is also the occasion for coordination of the economic policies of the Member States.
Here in Parliament, we have supported integrating the employment policy guidelines into the broad economic policy guidelines.
I think that, in terms of intellectual consistency, that was the right approach, provided that they do not lose substance, and in particular provided that the powers of this Parliament are also harmonised.
I support the rapporteur's proposals in this respect.
Against the background of the broad economic policy guidelines, we find ourselves faced with a paradox: while the Central Bank has just increased interest rates by a percentage point in quick succession, while rising oil prices are seriously compromising the conditions for economic recovery within the European Union, and while the conditions for the recovery of domestic demand are widely underestimated by various representatives at EU level, these broad guidelines are not shifting.
It seems to us that, from this point of view, we need to do more together with regard to at least one point: I am referring to investment strategy.
My group has tabled an amendment in this connection, which I hope will be adopted by plenary.
It emphasises the need, if we are really going to implement the Lisbon Strategy, to draw up, at EU level, the investment plans that we need in order to support the policies that will enable us to confront the challenges facing us in terms of knowledge, training and employment.
I should like to conclude by emphasising the issue of taxation, which underpins our entire economic system.
I hope that the whole of the Commission, and the Council too, will echo this and will support Commissioner KovÃ¡cs' efforts on this subject.
Â Â  âChanges in the world economy, globalisation processes and their effects on the competitiveness of economic blocs and companies in branches of state economies â these are new challenges for the European Union, which is increasingly losing its competitiveness, and is not ready for the challenges of globalisation.
The EU is losing the competition war to the USA, China and India.
The EU should prepare for the challenges of globalisation by reforming itself from within.
We failed to adopt the Constitution, the financial perspective is deadlocked and less funds are being allocated to the trans-European Networks.
Without a common energy policy, the supply of energy resources, which form the basis of an economy's competitiveness, is threatened, as is security.
With the admission of the new candidates, Slovenia and Lithuania, the enlargement of the Euro zone would be one of the actions and decisions which would stimulate economic growth.
I would like to mention two important factors for increasing the EU's competitiveness â investment in information and innovations and the accelerated creation of a common energy policy.
These are inter-dependent factors â innovations allow leaders to emerge, while in this sector â energy, which determines competitiveness, innovations allow the creation of new sources of energy and the rational and economical use of existing ones.
While negotiations on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 are still under way, we ought to reconsider the funding priorities and increase the funding of science, research and the trans-European Networks.
On the subject of the competitiveness of the EU economy, I would like to mention one of the EU's most successful projects â the introduction of the common currency, the Euro, in 12 Member States.
With the enlargement of the Euro zone approaching, we can also see certain shortcomings: the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact are not being adhered to, there is considerable state debt and at various stages almost all of the Euro zone members have failed to satisfy the price stability index.
The experience of five years demonstrates the need to improve the Maastricht criteria themselves.
However, fundamentally, the Euro zone was and still is a political project, which has shown its use and it must go on to a new stage of enlargement.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if we were asked to identify a key word relating to European employment policy, it would have to be flexibility.
Employment law of this nature that is flexible regarding both the place of employment and the hours worked encourages women to be active in the labour market.
For women, motherhood represents an enormous challenge in their working lives.
Flexibility also makes it possible for the youngest and oldest workers to join the labour force and obtain employment, which is currently a major problem.
Not everyone in Europe is in favour of such flexibility, as is obvious from events taking place on the streets of Paris.
The only action we can therefore take at European level is to scale down harmonisation in this area, so as to achieve flexibility in at least some countries and areas of the European Union.
If we were asked to identify a key word relating to economic policy it would have to be competition along with tax competition.
Contrary to statements in the report, competition is not detrimental to the financing of public needs.
The opposite is actually the case, as increased receipts have been recorded by the national budgets of countries that recently radically reformed their tax systems, notably by reducing corporate taxes.
Tax competition in countries such as Ireland or Slovakia also contributes to increasing the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, thus improving our competitiveness at global level.
Consequently, tax competition does not threaten Europe in any way.
It actually represents a tremendous opportunity.
I fear, however, that it may be one of the few real opportunities open to us, if not the only one.
Â Â  â Mr President, we need 40 million jobs in Europe.
In Greece alone, we need one million.
Can we promise them?
We cannot promise them.
Europe cannot safeguard these jobs.
10% of the active population will live below the poverty line.
They will live on unemployment benefits.
We have no energy of our own.
Gas from Russia, oil from the Middle East; energy which will constantly increase in price as a result of excess demand from China and India.
We have a very strong currency which prohibits exports; look at the exports the cheap dollar is giving the United States of America.
With the very tight Maastricht indicators, the indicators prosper and the people suffer.
That is the reality.
Chinese products are constantly flooding the market and will flood it more and more.
You cannot find as much as a doll which is manufactured in a European factory.
Even they are Chinese.
The factories of Europe are going to third countries and wages of course are going with them.
Farmers are suffering.
Cotton and tobacco in Greece have been secured in warehouses.
We need to change the rota; otherwise European citizens will not be able to survive.
Â Â  In my statement IÂ would like to take up several ideas from the resolution on the report into the energy sector, and I intend to do so in the context of the broader economic policy goals for 2006.
These ideas get to the heart of the issue without indulging in vain laments over the economic slowdown in Europe.
Miracles simply do not happen, and therefore IÂ agree that an in-depth analysis of the structural reform policies of the past decade is necessary.
This should clarify the causes of persistently slow growth rates and unsatisfactory productivity.
Also important is the call for what is known as âsmart growth strategyâ.
This strategy should consolidate the different approaches to EU economic policy into a consistent strategy.
The goal is to strengthen the European Unionâs potential with regard to a new generation of products and production methods by harnessing information and communication technologies.
I also support the call for EU Member States to promote private investment.
The shift of public and private capital expenditure towards investments that generally increase economic performance and productivity will also be important.
However, it will be necessary to pursue and apply this approach also within the context of EU fund disbursements, as the saying applies that the areas most in need of attention are often those closest to home.
Â Â  â First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ GarcÃ­a-Margallo, for a balanced report that is very much to the point.
As the report frequently reiterates, one of the serious problems facing the European Union at present is the fact that most Member States underestimate the need for far-reaching structural reform.
Paradoxically, some Member States have tried to address the loss of competitiveness that is a natural consequence of rejecting such reform by implementing new measures to protect their markets, which only makes the problem worse.
We must again concede that the internal market is not fully functional and does not enable the free movement of labour or the free provision of services.
The consequences of this approach are markedly negative.
Companies have been relocating their operations to areas with cheaper labour or, alternatively, have been outsourcing them, which has also caused job contraction.
In macroeconomic terms, one major result of such a policy is slow growth and, given the unchanged structure of public finances, a deteriorating general government deficit, frequently exceeding the limits imposed under the Stability and Growth Pact.
If we take into consideration the low volumes of investment in research, technological development and innovation, and if we add the high energy dependence of most Member States, we can hardly expect a significant increase in the competitiveness of the European economy vis-Ã -vis major global players such as the USA and China.
We must respond quickly to these challenges by putting in place a fully functional internal market, operating without any discrimination and unhampered by unnecessary regulation.
The harmonisation of European legislation must advance rather than hinder the competitive environment.
Efforts to harmonise corporate income tax provide unfortunate examples of such hindrance.
In order to increase the internal competitiveness of Member States, and hence of the entire EU, the subsidiarity principle must become aÂ significant component of all Commission initiatives.
In this respect, I also welcome the action programme on state aid reform that puts conditions in place for more investment into research, technological development and innovation, aiming to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises.
By the same token, we should praise the Green Paper on a European strategy for a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Employment Strategy, properly and pragmatically carried out by Member States, has the capacity to fulfil the employment goals set up within the framework of the Lisbon employment targets.
It should indeed reflect a wide anti-discrimination policy, the promotion of gender equality providing a tool for tackling the gender gaps in the labour market.
The European Employment Strategy must be regarded not only as a tool for attracting more people to the labour market; it should also present a favourable and open opportunity to join the labour market for those who have particularly limited access to employment, such as older women, single parents and ethnic minorities.
It must be admitted that the challenge of Europeâs ageing society can only be tackled with the increased participation of those special groups in the labour market, as Commissioner Å pidla said.
All kinds of obstacles must be eliminated.
We are striving for more and better jobs, having declared 2006 the European Year of Workersâ Mobility.
For Europeâs workforce, mobility provides for new skills, new experiences, flexibility and a capacity to adapt to the different working conditions and constantly changing market needs.
Mobility is a value contributing to the benefit of the whole European economy.
That is an urgent need that must be recognised by some Member States which still maintain barriers to the new EU countriesâ workforce.
Finally, I think that the EES has the potential to become the strategy to move towards full employment, making work a real option for all, increasing the quality and productivity of work, and anticipating and managing change, highlighting a more cohesive society of equal opportunities for anyone striving to promote diversity and non-discrimination.
My Hungarian colleague, MrsÂ KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ©Â KovÃ¡cs, has prepared an outstanding report of great value and I propose that her recommendations be adopted.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, as I take the floor in this debate, I should like to point out that some of the recommendations to Member States contained in the reports will not be beneficial to economic growth and employment in the European Union.
I shall comment on just a few of them.
Firstly, countering tax competition and the suggestion of harmonising solutions concerning income tax payable by legal entities in a situation when reducing income tax rates has an obvious impact on the acceleration of economic growth.
Secondly, countering relocation which is an objective economic process involving an effort to reduce manufacturing costs and thus improve the competitiveness of businesses in the global economy.
Thirdly, introducing additional regulations concerning economic and social processes when what is actually required is a drastic reduction of such measures.
Lastly, despite the positive experiences of countries such as Great Britain and Ireland following the opening up of their labour markets, the labour markets in the largest countries of the European Union remain closed to workers from the new Member States.
This is in fact one of the reasons why the European Union is developing much more slowly than the United States, and why the old Member States of the Union are developing more slowly than the new ones.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work.
It appears, however, that the report fails to focus appropriately on the most difficult area of the economy, the one that consumes most Union resources, requires protection and is inadequately exploited in economic terms. I refer to the agricultural sector in its broadest sense.
The most substantial payments benefit magnates, whilst small farms are going out of business and the amount of uncultivated land is increasing along with the number of people who have lost their jobs and all hope for the future.
The enormous potential of the sector remains unexploited, although sound policies could enable it to make a positive contribution to the development of the wider economy.
The programme of activities aimed at developing industrial crops is not ambitious enough, and the research and implementation programme fails to provide the necessary backing for swift progress.
We are lagging behind countries whose economies are efficient in this regard.
The issue merits broad debate and calls for swift and effective action to be taken in the course of 2006.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like initially to reflect on two points.
The first of these is that it is those European economies that are most open to globalisation that now have the best economic development.
The second is that it is those countries that have the most flexible labour markets that also have the best development in terms of new jobs.
It is in the light of this that I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ GarcÃ­a-MargalloÂ yÂ Marfil, for the work he has done, because it is the changes and policy direction proposed in his report that constitute the approach that can provide more jobs and greater prosperity.
The crucial question is that of whether all this will lead to changes and of whether policy will be changed at European and Member State level.
A Swedish politician once said that âif things are allowed to go on operating as they have done in the past, things will proceed unchangedâ.
We now have more than 20Â million unemployed.
That is an economic issue, but it is also to the very highest degree a social issue.
There is no issue more important for social protection than the growth of new jobs.
In this area, the Commission has a number of tasks with which it must get to grips.
Firstly, it must implement those directives that open the way to greater competition.
Secondly, it must take action to open the door to more enterprise, and that brings the whole of competition policy into focus.
New enterprise does not only mean the growth of small companies. It also means the ability to establish new cross-border companies in Europe that can be âglobal championsâ.
The Commission must assume responsibility for doing these things, but the Member States also have a responsibility to implement those reforms that will give rise to new enterprise.
Finally, we must ensure that we obtain more flexible labour markets in Europe. If we do not do so, we shall be excluding millions of people from the labour market and from social protection.
Those who are in favour of social protection and economic development are also in favour of more flexible labour markets.
I am happy to say all this to those on the Social Democratic side, for it is reforms that provide security.
Â Â  Mr President, todayâs debate concerns the future of the European Union.
Europeâs economies are developing slowly, we have high unemployment and our public finances are in crisis.
The situation has remained unchanged for a number of years and may result in Europe losing its leading role in the world.
Major structural reform is needed, together with a change of economic policy.
The broad economic policy guidelines put forward by the Commission correctly identify the essential action required.
This includes creating more flexible labour markets and a business-friendly environment, in addition to supporting education, training and research.
The Commission has been advocating all this for years, however, to no great avail.
I would remind the House that the reasons for the weakness of European economies are well known. So too is the nature of the action required to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs.
Unfortunately, politicians in the Member States are reluctant to take the necessary measures for fear of losing popularity or because of short-sighted political calculations or even sheer ignorance at times.
Europe is actually suffering from a crisis of political leadership.
Todayâs debate ought to be directed principally towards the governments of Member States and the political circles supporting them.
It should aim to send out alarm signals to the effect that if essential reforms are not undertaken, Europe is likely to stagnate and fall behind.
The economic and social progress it has achieved will also be threatened.
A politicianâs brief is actually to resolve specific problems, not to be subservient to popularity polls and the votersâ whims.
We are relying on politicians in the Member States to undertake the relevant reforms and persuade their citizens that they are indeed necessary.
I urge the Commission to take strong and decisive action in this regard.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am of course glad to be able to speak for something like the period of time that I was originally allocated to me.
Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for the hard work he has put in on this topic.
The report spells out once more the fact that the European Union presents the people of Europe, in the face of globalisation, with an opportunity to find a fair compromise between economic conditions on the one hand and social conditions on the other.
The problem is, though, that this has completely passed the people of Europe by.
The 20 million unemployed and the hundreds of millions of people who fear for their jobs attribute their circumstances more to the European Union than to globalisation.
The others, whose jobs are kept safe by the European Union and by the work of the Commission and of this House, are completely unaware of that fact and attribute it to the national governments.

I want to say how much I am in agreement with MrÂ Rosati: It would indeed be much to be desired, when considering these important issues, for the Council, which alone is competent to act on many of these issues in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, to apply itself with greater earnestness to this matter and if the debates in this House were not to be in the hands only of its own Members and the Members of the Commission, and, while it is indeed the case that the Commission does have an important function to perform in ensuring that the measures already adopted at Council level are actually implemented by the Member States, we must nevertheless be honest, for â as we shall probably see later on when considering the Åry report â what matters at the end of the day is that the Member States should keep to what they themselves once decided.

That is why it is very good that the Commission has indicated â indeed, Commissioner Å pidla has been saying so to the German media â that bringing greater flexibility to the labour markets is the only way we in Europe can provide our people with more work, and that this, being a means whereby work is created, must not be a source of anxiety. That, in fact, is what we all want.
I therefore strongly encourage you to spell it out to the Member States with greater emphasis that the decisions taken by the Council need, at last, to be put into effect.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by saying that I am more optimistic than some previous speakers, because I believe that the reports we have today and this debate are going to be useful and offer a further opportunity to promote the European employment strategy and the Lisbon process.
At the end of the day, this is our only hope: the only hope for Europe to work in a coordinated fashion in the direction embarked upon last year of enriching the economic and social vision with new guidelines which fall within this framework of integration.
Commissioner Verheugen said that we need this strategy to be visible.
This is one of our deficits, as is our credibility deficit as well, as Commissioner Almunia said.
We need those jobs, as Commissioner Å pidla said.
In the very short space of time available to me, therefore, I would like to ask you to read these two reports by Parliament.
They are horizontal reports, with which the enormous majority of Members of this Parliament identify, and which I believe reflect great forward-thinking and a great effort to achieve unity.
Read what these reports say and demonstrate the leadership that Europe needs today.
The Commissionâs people must be active, in order to oblige the governments to apply this European employment strategy.
Please be consistent, look at our amendments.
Look at Amendment 2, for example.
We need the European legislation that we already have to be applied, since it makes work between the Member States much more consistent.
Read our Amendment 5 as well.
In this European year of mobility, take steps to remove the obstacles to the mobility of European workers.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendations drawn up by Mr Garcia-Margallo, whom I wish to congratulate, have come at the right moment to turn around the EUâs economic situation.
All that remains is for those recommendations to be heeded.
As things stand, we should be speaking of deepening, rather than reviewing, the Lisbon Strategy, given that what we are now seeing â and have been since the outset â is increased economic growth and more jobs, both of which help to sustain the social models in the long term, and foster adequate social cohesion in the short term.
In spite of recent progress, the key issues remain untouched.
Unemployment is at an intolerable level and overall economic growth is insufficient to reverse this trend.
Consequently, greater integration and better coordination of economic policies is required, and the work of the institutions forming the emerging economic government of the Union must be developed.
The Council decided to support the Commission in drawing up a common European energy policy.
Although this was an interesting decision, it still falls short of what is required.
The Unionâs energy dependency is unsustainable.
Oil imports currently account for 2.3% of Union GDP, which is two and a half times the budget earmarked for all European policies.
By 2030, that dependency may prove overwhelming, especially in the oil sector (94% of foreign dependency).
The simple agreements between Member States promoted by the Council are therefore inadequate.
Increased competition is a necessary prerequisite to the creation of a common energy policy.
A common regulation will, above all, require huge investment if existing networks are to be improved and if genuine progress is to be made once again in the area of alternative energy and energy saving.
All of this is vital to increasing competitiveness and sustainable development.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate has shown just how much distance we have covered together, but it has also shown that the new growth and employment strategy is increasingly understood and that there is increasing pressure to take seriously and to realise the priorities we have set.
The Commission has listened very carefully, and we will pay very careful attention to what the groups and the speakers have told us, and will, in future debates, endeavour to take on board your Houseâs wishes and suggestions.
Let me conclude by reiterating, and very clearly, that the reason why growth and employment are priorities for the years ahead of us is that without more growth and the creation of more jobs, we will be unable to realise our great and far-reaching political goals.
We will not be able to maintain a high environmental standard, we will not be able to maintain high social standards, and we will not be able to maintain a high standard of living if we do not have strong economic foundations that can bear their weight, and that is why we say that growth and jobs are our number one task.
The guidelines, which we have been discussing today, are among the essential means whereby we ensure that we in Europe are able, perhaps, to make a virtue of necessity.
Our inability to have a common economic policy is of course a defect, but it can become a virtue if we can agree on a new kind of cooperation of the kind that we have developed in the shape of the Partnership for Growth and Jobs.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  In recent years the EU has been facing serious economic problems: the Unionâs growth is below its potential when compared to the US or to emerging countries such as China or India.
The European economy suffers from a lower demographic growth, employment rate and productivity.
Europe must foresee long-term strategies and sufficient resources to invest in its future.
The strategies were designed in order to address these problems but the situation is getting worse.
There are various reasons for this situation: a lack of appropriate infrastructure, insufficient private and public investments, delays in the development of innovative technologies and inappropriate vocational training and education.
Europe needs a clear vision for a more competitive economy.
To be in line with the employment and growth objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, structural changes are required: support for R[amp]D, encouragement of private and public investments, development of innovative actions for sectors such as biotechnologies, sustainable energies and ICTs.
Besides the structural changes and the development of innovative sectors, environmental protection and the quality of products must remain, within the framework of global economy, a genuine European specificity.
Finally, it is paramount to foster related education and vocational training in order to meet the requirements and challenges of economic development.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0069/2006) by MrÂ Åry, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets [2006/2036(INI)].
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, but I am accustomed to report presentations where the rapporteur speaks first and only then does the Commissioner provide a response.
If you have decided to change this practice, however, then I am of course ready to begin.
I would like to begin, ladies and gentlemen, by thanking Mr Åry for an excellent report on a topic that constitutes one of the pillars of European integration.
The aim of the transitional measures set out in the Accession Treaty is to enable Member States to work gradually towards achieving, as quickly as possible, the one irrevocable aim of providing all migrant workers from Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 with open access to employment in all Member States.
This is one of the basic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.
As stated in the Accession Treaty, the Commission has assessed the operation of these transitional measures in respect of the initial two-year stage, in order to assist Member States in deciding either to retain the transitional measures or to abandon them.
On the basis of the statistical data for 2004 and in some cases also for 2005, and also following consultations with the individual participants, the Commission has produced some specific conclusions relating to the first stage of the transitional period.
The number of workers registered since accession is generally very low, seldom reaching 1% of the active population of the host country.
In addition, it seems that the influx of workers from the new Member States has had a basically positive effect.
This is because enlargement has contributed to bringing black economy workers from EU-8 states out of the area of illegality.
Accession has also led to a reduction in labour shortages and to improved economic results in Europe.
The countries that did not introduce restrictions after May 2004 have recorded stronger economic growth, lower levels of unemployment and higher levels of employment.
The workers who have been granted legal access to a labour market have experienced little difficulty in joining the market.
It is, of course, only the Member States that can decide whether or not to apply the transitional measures, but the Commission may challenge the Member States to evaluate objectively the advantages and disadvantages of the measures.
In reality, it is the second stage that is the actual transitional stage, which will bring us, wholly or at least in part, to the objective of freedom of movement for workers.
In this spirit, the Member States implementing restrictions on the basis of the Accession Treaty must not treat nationals from EU-8 states who are already legally residing on their territory in a more restrictive way than nationals from third countries who are long-term residents, as reported in the previous plenary session.
A letter explaining this has been sent to interior ministers in order to clarify the legal situation.
Some moments ago the rapporteur mentioned this problem of citizens of third countries, so I hope you will allow me to emphasise once again that in the context of the directives and treaties on accession, it is not permissible to treat citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of an EU Member State in a more favourable way than citizens of EU Member States, that is, if there are restrictions applying to EU citizens, these shall logically apply also to citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of the EU Member State.
For the same reasons the Commission is also monitoring adherence to the provisions that forbid Member States from restricting access to their labour markets for workers from EU-8 states to a greater extent than was the case prior to the signing of the Accession Treaty, that is, prior to 16 April 2003.
The Commission is at the same time backing calls for the Member States to apply the Communityâs legal regulations scrupulously, especially in the area of posted workers.
I acknowledge that we must greatly strengthen statistical monitoring of movements of workers within an EU framework, since there are many hypotheses meriting discussion that are impossible to verify using the existing statistical and analytical resources.
The Commission supports proposals from Parliament for reinforcing social dialogue on both a European and a national level, with the aim of upholding the rights of workers from the new Member States.
The Commission takes an equally favourable view of raising public awareness of freedom of movement for workers and the associated legislation.
The declaration of 2006 as European Year of Workersâ Mobility should contribute to this aim.
Despite the fears expressed over gradual enlargement, freedom of movement for workers has not undermined intrastate labour markets.
The free movement of persons is a basic principle applying to all citizens, and any limitation on it whatsoever can only be temporary and must be expressed strictly within the spirit of the treaties.
Ladies and gentlemen, in my speech I have once or twice used the term ânew Member Statesâ It must be said that the new states of Central Europe have a history almost as long as the states of other parts of Europe, and with the enlargement of the European Union they are now Member States.
Therefore I would like to state that I will not be using the term ânew Member Statesâ again.
Â Â  . Further to the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, the issue of opening up the labour markets, and in connection with this, the operation of the transitional restrictions considered necessary by the twelve old Member States, have been followed with particular attention.
As stipulated in the Accession Treaties, Member States â based on their own experiences with the labour market â will lift these restrictions gradually between 2004 and 2011, and the European Commission and European Parliament will also evaluate the situation, in the light of the experiences of the Member States.
The position of the European institutions carries a political message, and it is primarily meant to clarify, for the over 450 million citizens of the European Union, the pan-European interest in the extremely important issue of the movement of workers.
In other words: what is the interest of the European Union as an important player in world politics and world economy?
This logic of keeping European interests in mind was decisive in the course of the preparation of the report.
The only possible starting point for the evaluation of the current situation was the analysis of the global challenges faced by the European Union at the beginning of the 21st century.
In this respect it is sufficient to refer to the fact that our economic competitors in South-East Asia are speeding up both in the area of industrial production and in that of research, development and innovation.
If we want to increase our competitiveness to keep up with both America and Asia, we must find a solution to the structural tensions in European economies.
The solution is unequivocal: we must increase mobility within the European Union, and we must encourage, with all available means, the creation of a single European labour market, which should be as flexible as possible.
There are, of course, alternative solutions to increasing mobility (we can also talk about speeding up immigration and other similar measures), but the common denominator of such alternatives is that their social cost is immeasurably higher, while their efficiency is much lower.
The road to economic development â in line with the Lisbon Strategy â leads primarily through the increase of mobility and the utilisation of the occupational reserves represented by the inactive population.
This is the only way of preserving the social achievements that are so dear to European citizens, and of which we talk so often.
An important step within the process of increasing mobility is to lift the transitional restrictions affecting new Member States, as soon as possible.
Several Member States already agreed to do this in May 2006, and we can only hope that in the course of the following years â perhaps even before May 2009 â other Member States will follow them, because it is important to emphasise that the legal possibility for the other Member States to make a similar decision is always available.
The fears concerning mass migration have proved to be groundless.
Experiences have unequivocally shown that the presence of workers from new Member States in the old Member States who decided to open their markets fully in 2004 has not caused labour market or economic tensions. On the contrary!
The assessment of both the European Commission and one of the affected governments â the British Government â has proved that the migration of a restricted extent from new Member States has brought economic advantages to the recipient countries.
Therefore, the conclusion is clear: the most advantageous course of action for the European Union and its Member States is for the affected governments to lift the system of transitional measures restricting free employment within the Union, as soon as possible.
We also submitted proposals for compromises with the report.
These were prepared taking into account the special sensitivities of a few Member States concerning this important issue, because, as our experiences have shown, in some Member States the speedy implementation of the free movement of work force is not only hindered by economic difficulties, but often by political, sociopsychological or communication difficulties, too.
The compromise proposals are also examining the issue in view of the pan-European interest, trying to take into account the aspirations and sensitivities of both old and new Member States.
Therefore, we hope that the report, in this form, will receive the widest support during the vote of the Parliament.
Thank you for your attention, and I would like to thank all my colleagues, the political groups and the European Commission for their cooperation.
It is not a coincidence that the content of the introduction given by Mr Å pidla has significantly relieved me of having to present the report in detail.
We mostly think along the same lines, and our experiences are similar.
I trust that this will remain so in the future, too.
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me to start by extending warm congratulations to Mr Åry who has acquitted himself of his tasks in a very conscientious manner and has produced a sound report.
We, in Europe, owe the prosperity that we enjoy to the four freedoms that we have entrenched in the European Union.
The free movement of workers forms an integral part of this.
It now seems to me that fear has dominated the enlargement process in the old Member States and that fear of being elbowed out from the labour market, which is, or was, already under pressure, has led to restrictions in the free movement.
I have always taken the view that decisions should not be taken on the basis of fear and that we would have served our own interests much better had we opened up this labour market from the word go.
This is also evident from the results of the studies carried out in the United Kingdom and Sweden, although it should be noted that, in the United Kingdom, social security is not implemented in the way we would like it to be.
What is this fear about?
People fear being pushed out of the labour market, and in order to prevent this from happening, borders are closed, yet nothing could be further from the truth.
Many arrive in our Member States and graft many hours for little pay.
They are badly housed, set up their own one-man bands and compete with our small and medium-size enterprises.
What should the answer be?
Rather than resort to fear, the answer should be to open up the borders and make sure that proper checks are in place to monitor, not whether minimum wages are paid, but rather whether wages and working conditions as they have been laid down in the collective bargaining agreements are adhered to, and the conditions of safety at work as well.
That is a welcome development in new and old Member States alike.
Â Â  . Mr President, as has been said, 2006 has been declared the European Year of Workersâ Mobility.
On the initiative of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a draft Parliamentary resolution was drawn up, which the Committee approved on 21 March by an overwhelming majority.
For the preparation of the report thanks are due especially to Mr Åry.
The central feature of the resolution is the call to scrap the current transitional measures.
Immediately after approval the amendment proposals began to come in, aimed at removing this prospective message from Parliament.
It is remarkable how every one of the proposals begins with the words âI support the free movement of workers, but âŠâ.
I therefore take the view that Parliament should approve the same version that has been approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I would like to remind you that both employersâ groups and the European Trade Union Confederation are requesting that the transitional measures be scrapped immediately.
I am aware that some governments have not done so, and those that have done deserve our thanks.
In response to the complaints we have heard today in speeches on the poor state of the European Union, I would like to say that neither the American nor the Chinese way should be models for us and that following the major crisis in Asia some years ago many states over there are thinking of developing the sort of structures that some persons here today are seeking to demolish.
It would therefore be a very good thing for us to realise that the path to prosperity leads neither through Chinese-style wage levels nor through the sort of industrial relations that prevail in the United States.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I believe that four fundamental criteria should be borne in mind when considering MrÂ Åryâs report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets.
Firstly, the free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the single market and every European Union citizenâs right.
Recognition of that right requires transitional periods to be lifted at the earliest opportunity.
This does not imply promoting mass movements across the European Union.
A distinction should be made between movements triggered by the need to seek employment and the free movement of persons which is a citizenâs right.
Secondly, the report rightly points out the benefits gained by countries that did not impose transitional periods and opened up their labour markets immediately.
This is in line with the European Commissionâs view.
It would, however, also be appropriate to consider how the free movement of people can either threaten or benefit the countries of origin of the citizens involved.
Thirdly, it is important that Member State citizens should not be discriminated against in favour of third-country nationals on the European Unionâs labour markets.
Of course, this does not imply that we are indifferent to the interests of third-country nationals or that we do not wish to express solidarity with them too.
Finally, the free movement of persons should be deemed a key feature of the European social model.
Bearing in mind that MrÂ Åryâs report and the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs comply with the aforementioned criteria, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote in favour of the report.
We would also like to thank MrÂ Åry for his work.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Group of the Greens is in favour of freedom of movement, and endorses Mr Åryâs even-handed report, for transitional periods, popular though they are with our own people, promise no success.
According to the German newspapers, the government had decided against allowing cheap workers into the country on the grounds that it wanted to protect its own labour market from an influx of cheap migrant labour from the neighbouring countries, but that is a load of nonsense; the transitional periods do not keep the migrant workers out.
They come all the same and work either on the black market or making themselves out to be self-employed.
The transitional rules are forcing people to work outside the law and thereby to become even cheaper labour and the object of brutal exploitation without the protection of labour law, without social security and without the certainty of actually being paid.
Outside the lawâs protection, people have no rights.
There is even greater pressure on wages in vulnerable areas and in the labour markets affected, for wages agreements have no effect on the black market, which operates according to its own rules and cannot be monitored.
Those governments that still hold to transitional periods are encouraging people to work outside of the law and on its fringes, thereby doing much more damage to social cohesion.
If workers are to be enabled to avail themselves of their rights, then their employment needs to be put on a legal footing.
Greater transparency brings with it better monitoring of labour markets.
We must organise the European market in its existing form on the basis of âequal pay for the same work under the same conditions in the same placeâ, thereby giving national and regional wage negotiations added weight and the same social rights to all.
What that means, for the German Government for example, is that it must, without further ado, extend the Posting of Workers Directive to all vulnerable areas, for we know that, in Germany and Austria, the transitional periods for the services sector are dependent on those applicable to freedom of movement.
The only really effective protection against things going wrong on the labour market is pro-active measures to bring it into order.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the lack of freedom of movement for workers from what I shall still call the ânewâ Member States results in many people being forced into unregistered work, intolerable working and living conditions, and into a state of lawlessness.
It also constitutes discrimination, since the free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed under Community law.
As is well known, this is a freedom that has existed for workers since the foundation of the European Community in 1957.
That millions of people within the European Union should, in 2006, have ceased to enjoy that right is intolerable.
In the course of the enlargement process, socially committed people of the Left â such as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, for example â in the European Parliament insisted over and over again on the conditions being created that would enable, on the accession of new Member States, workers to be allowed freedom of movement without detrimental effects on society.
People in both the old and new Member States are meant to benefit from enlargement, but instead we keep coming back to the issue of global competition.
Whilst it was demonstrated, in the Scandinavian countries, that free movement does much to protect existing social standards, the federal government in Germany has extended the transitional periods without giving any indication whatever of what it intends to do with it by way of actually giving workers freedom of movement.
Fundamentally, my group agrees with Mr Åry that we do not actually need any transitional periods at all, but this report is scarcely likely to promote awareness of the need for greater social responsibility on the European labour market.
Our groupâs amendments to this end have so far been largely ineffective.
I want to argue in favour of the freedom of movement being given to all workers living in the EU with immediate effect and of the introduction of social standards and minimum wages that keep people out of poverty.
Combating poverty must become an absolute political priority in the European Union.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, very recently we experienced a bitter disappointment with the free market in services, but now we see that only a few of the governments of the older Member States are prepared to open their markets to workers from the new Member States.
The majority of governments, in continuing to restrict the number of workers from the new Member States, are in fact struggling with more serious problems concerning immigration from non-EU countries.
The partial opening of the labour market, for example, to construction workers, doormen and waiters, as France has proposed, does not testify to a readiness for the European fundamental freedoms. It is, instead, testimony to the low prestige of these professions, since unemployment among French youth is very high.
This selective opening of the professional market, however, to a labour force with low qualifications means that this will be an incentive for many qualified workers to leave the new Member States, to change profession and immediately earn a higher salary.
In the long term, however, this will weaken Europeâs competitiveness.
Finally, I call on those young French people who are protesting, disappointed in their government because of its discriminatory legislation against them, to come to the new Member States and to launch careers there.
We have very low unemployment among young people, and we do not discriminate against them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am astonished that there should be a report on this at all.
I thought the EU was all about the free movement of goods, services and labour.
What do we find?
When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, they did not get parity.
Only three Member States of the previous EU of 15 admitted their workers without restriction: Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
This becomes very odd when you consider that these are three of the most reluctant EU Member States.
Ireland rejected the Nice Treaty the first time and only accepted it later due to impressive gerrymandering in a second referendum.
Sweden only joined the EU after a bare 1% majority in its referendum.
As for the United Kingdom, you know all about us.
None of you exactly welcomed Prime Minister Blair last December, at the end of what you all considered to have been a rotten United Kingdom Presidency.
You were right.
You even threw out his seven-year budget â his precious rescue attempt â with an overwhelming vote on the BÃ¶ge report.
So I am now in the very happy position of saying to you: do as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden have done.
Never mind transitional arrangements; obey your own rules; open your borders; take your share of, say, Polish workers â in the United Kingdom we have 250Â 000 of them, and they are not all plumbers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the latest OECD report reveals that Sweden, Finland and Great Britain are the fastest developing countries in the European Union.
Two of these countries have opened up their labour markets, and it should be noted that Ireland has also done so, and that its GDP has benefited as a result.
The report debunks the myth that an influx of foreign workers would have a destructive impact on the economy of the country in question.
The opposite is actually the case.
We should be resorting to an employment policy of this nature in order to save the Lisbon Strategy.
Each and every one of the Member States must open up its labour market.
Concerns about an avalanche of cheap labour have proved unfounded.
Economic migration is restricted.
I therefore believe that it is essential to lift all barriers that might hinder the free movement of workers across Europe in any way.
Â Â  â Mr President, the enlargement of the EU by the addition of 10 new Member States was something that we wanted for cultural, economic and political reasons; I, as a German MEP, spent years arguing in favour of the project and trying to win people over to it.
Public acceptance was dependent on the Member States having the right to limit the free movement of labour in line with the conditions prevailing on their own labour markets.
It was asserted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the failure of massive migratory flows to manifest themselves meant that the transitional arrangements guaranteed by treaty had to be abolished forthwith.
To that I say that the situation as experienced in such Member States as Germany, Austria or France is quite different.
Wherever markedly higher rates of pay per hour apply, and wherever social security is guaranteed, there you will find migrants, and they need to be controlled, with illicit working and fictive self-employment being prevented.
The effect of continued flows of migrants to countries with high unemployment is neither to create new jobs nor to make businesses more competitive.
Even though this report is only an appeal rather than being legally binding, it could be misused to put certain countries in the dock, to whip up sentiment against them and to mount campaigns calling on consumers to boycott goods from them.
That has indeed, already happened.
Those who try to drive a wedge between the old Member States and the new ones imperil the concept of the EU being more than just a free trade area.
I have helped to put forward some compromise amendments and am grateful to Mr Åry, our rapporteur.
Let there, then, be consideration of the curtailment of the transitional regulations, but let it be done on the basis of detailed analyses of the national labour markets.
Regulations should also be drafted to ensure that workers from the new Member States are not put at a disadvantage vis-Ã -vis those from third countries.
What we need is for decisions to be properly thought out.
Global competition demands of all the EUâs Member States that they create the conditions for it, by, for example, reforming their social security systems.
This sort of posturing does no more than risk leaving our single European project by the roadside.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by MrÂ Åry, whom I would like at this point to congratulate on his work, could turn out to be a real boon for European workers.
The restrictions on the free movement of workers have some harmful effects, including the expansion of illegal work.
Just in the last few months, Polish workers have been discovered in France, living in hovels, malnourished, unpaid and with no care â they had been brought to the country by a German sub-contracting company.
Ironically, these workers were involved in building a law court.
Where is the justice in that?
Such cases are quite unacceptable.
The free movement of workers must form one of the factors for promoting social progress, one of the tools for creating a barrier to social dumping.
The end of the transitional arrangements will force employers to provide their employees with decent living conditions in accordance with social legislation in the host country.
Social protection, decent housing, a decent salary, fair working hours â those are the basic rights that this freedom of movement should provide, and we will ensure that it does so.
We cannot accept a situation where some employers exploit the different nationalities of their employees to reduce their operating costs, in the same way as others play the stock market.
Let us remember that the founding European project aims to unite populations, not to divide them.
If we continue to restrict the free movement of workers, we will only feed the fears of citizens in certain Member States, who are terrified at the idea of being treated as second-class European citizens.
And you are right, Commissioner, we now need to talk in terms of European citizens.
These restrictions must be fully lifted.
It can be done, but the checks need to be strengthened so that the first beneficiaries of this measure do not become its first victims.
Â Â  I welcome your comments on the citizens of third countries and this problem in general.
I congratulate the rapporteur for preparing a very balanced report.
The free movement of labour is not just one of the fundamental rights of the European Union, but is an expression of the solidarity between the old and new countries.
Therefore, I am pleased to see that all of my colleagues show unanimous support for the abolition of the restrictions.
As we react to the challenges of today's global economy, I believe that the abolition of obstacles to the movement of citizens and labour in the European Union's market is one of the main goals of the Lisbon Strategy and one of the factors stimulating economic growth.
With their accumulated human capital, the active workers from the new European Union Member States have the ability to stimulate long-term economic growth.
Moreover, the market may become more effective, as foreign workers usually react more actively to the regional differences of economic opportunities.
Having admitted workers from the new states, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden only benefited.
The aforementioned Member States are noted for rapid economic growth, reduced unemployment and increased employment compared to other states.
In addition, it can be concluded that citizens of the new Member States have complemented, but not replaced citizens of the old Member States in the labour markets of the latter.
Statistical data from European Union Member States indicates that immigration from third countries exceeds the flow of immigration in the heart of the European Union.
We should congratulate and rejoice in the decision of those countries which have decided to open their labour markets to the new European Union countries from May this year.
I would say: shame on the governments of Austria, which is holding the EU Presidency, and Germany, for their phobias, for their inability to discuss this matter with their own citizens.
But of course, the opening of labour markets is the sovereign right of every state.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commissioner and our rapporteur for their work on this issue.
As many have said, equality of treatment is a key principle for European citizens, which should apply to employment conditions and access to services within our Member States across the Union.
However, in a debate where we are talking about third-country nationals, it is crucial that we are also very clear â as the rapporteur has been â that we are not talking about rolling back the hard-won rights of those individuals, but extending the rights to which our new Member States are entitled.
We have heard a number of arguments over the past few months in favour of maintaining transitional periods.
Many of us here do not find them convincing.
We believe that what we are seeing is â as has already been mentioned â evidence of irregular employment and false claims about self-employment.
I am willing to bet that in all our countries we have a number of Member Statesâ citizens in unclear situations.
When the UK introduced its worker registration scheme for nationals of the A8 countries, it found that 40% of the Polish people who registered were already in the UK.
I believe that is evidence that people want to work legally.
We need to encourage them to do that.
We need better information in advance, more effort on inspection and supporting whistle-blowers, and greater clarity about peopleâs rights, so we do not see the exploitation that MrÂ Cottigny has referred to, which threatens to undercut working conditions and exploits individuals.
It is much easier to demand equality of treatment when you have clear rights.
The UK â as has been said â has opened access, with certain shifts on social security.
We have had a range of workers, of all skill levels.
We found no discernible statistical evidence of an increase in social benefit claims.
The economic impact is seen to be modest, and the numbers started slowing towards the end of last year.
The positive experiences of Ireland should encourage other countries which introduced transitional arrangements to lift these restrictions.
Sinn FÃ©in and the trade union movement support the decision not to introduce transitional arrangements in Ireland.
I have signed the written declaration here in Parliament calling for such restrictions to be lifted.
I reiterate that call here today and I welcome Mr Åryâs report in that context.
However, we must go further than this: we cannot ignore the issue of employment conditions and the exploitation of workers.
Even in Ireland, unscrupulous employers have used the lack of free movement of workers in the EU to introduce discrimination as regards salaries and working conditions based on nationality.
We must combat this strongly.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten mentioned the restrictions placed on social security.
We must also combat any discrimination in access to social protection for EU citizens who travel to another Member State to work or to seek work.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by thanking MrÂ Åry, the initiator and author of the report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets.
In its initial version this document already rightly indicated that the impossibility of being legally employed in the majority of the so-called old Member States fosters irregular employment and the exploitation of workers.
MrÂ Åry also appropriately highlights the fact that in certain European Union Member States more restrictions are currently imposed on the movement of workers from the new Member States than was the case when the Treaty on Accession was signed.
He also points out that there are issues concerning preferential treatment for so-called long-term resident third-country nationals to the detriment of Union citizens from the 10Â new Member States.
In addition, the reportâs author clearly states that there have been no negative social or economic consequences for the countries that have already opened up their labour markets.
On the contrary, the reduction of the irregular employment of foreigners has resulted in additional income for national budgets.
MrÂ Åryâs initial draft was also presented to Parliamentâs Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for discussion and a subsequent vote, and the draft was improved considerably by this process.
This is particularly true of paragraphÂ 1.
In the version tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Parliament comes out clearly in support of the citizens and their right to the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties.
I strongly believe that this is the stance the European Parliament must adopt.
The House should make a clear and unequivocal statement defending fundamental rights and freedoms.
It should stand up for the Communityâs interests and for the interests of all European Union citizens, over and above specific national concerns.
That is why I am of the opinion that we should support the text that arose as a result of the debate and vote within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am opposed to second-class EU membership, and, yes, there must be freedom of movement for all workers in the EU, and as soon as possible, but there are reasons why the option was introduced of using the 2+3+2 rule to limit access to national labour markets, and it strikes me as pretty risky to attempt to draw from the experiences of three Member States conclusions that automatically apply to all the others.

I greatly respect Mr Åry, and will say to him quite frankly that I well understand why he, and many other Members of this House, endorses the Commissionâs line, but perhaps I might also say that it was the Czech minister of labour, among others, who announced, as long ago as the end of last year, that even his own country was giving thought to the possibility of making transitional periods for worker mobility applicable to Romania and Bulgaria.
In contrast to the United Kingdom, Sweden and Ireland, Germanyâs unemployment rate is running at 12% rather than a mere 5%.
We have a country with 18% unemployment right on our own doorstep.
I am sure it is understandable that that fact cannot do other than cause many workers to worry about their own jobs, and it is surely only right that a government should try to take that into account, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that Germany has already, in percentage terms, given the most work permits to citizens of the new Member States.
Â Â  â Mr President, a few weeks ago, we, in this House, voted on the services directive, with a majority endorsing a compromise intended to help maintain high social standards, under the slogan of âno social dumpingâ.
It would appear, though, that protection from social dumping is intended to benefit only the select few in Europe, for how else is one to understand the restrictions on the free movement of workers?
Those who bar certain people from the market must know that they can expect, as a quite natural response to their action, the coming into being of illegal markets.
People who live near to a border between states will not be prevented from offering their labour on either side of it, and so, over recent years, whole new categories of workers are putting themselves on the streets, with artisans and building workers offering their services, and this is proving to be a successful game for them; they are much in demand.
People are working under the pretence of being self-employed or, quite simply, illegally, without social security and for less than the minimum wages laid down by law.
How mendacious, then, of people such as the representatives of the German building trade, to demand â or so we read â that the transitional periods be extended!
Why is it that some employersâ representatives want these discriminatory restrictions imposed on the citizens of other Member States?
Is it not, perhaps, that they are thereby enabled to make money from cheap seasonal labour, from the putative self-employed, and from those working in the black market?
Why, too, I wonder, do the national employersâ representatives not campaign with more energy against this sort of exploitation?
Why do they make social security dependent on nationality?
Might it not be that they do so out of the simple desire for mass appeal, since it is only the citizens of their own country who cast votes, so that what matters to them is not the principle itself but their own success on election day?
Three countries so far have opened up their labour markets to the EUâs new Member States, and their experiences of it have been positive.
I call, in this Year of Mobility, on all the others to do likewise by 2007 at the latest.
Shame on all those who do not do so, particularly on my own country, Austria, if it turns out to be one of them!
Â Â  â The free movement of persons and access to labour markets has undoubtedly become a sensitive political issue.
The rapporteur, MrÂ Åry, has handled this topic skilfully, without causing division among the Member States.
In his report, he focuses on the real effects of citizens from the new Member States entering the labour markets of the fifteen old Member States.
He supports the premise that it is not the Member States and their interactions that pose the real problem to European competitiveness, but rather external competitors such as India and China.

The report considers the following facts: firstly, workers from the new Member States nowhere exceed 2% of the host country population; secondly, internal migration within the old Member States is four times greater than internal migration from the new Member States and, thirdly, migration from third countries significantly exceeds total internal migration within the EU.
There is no doubt that, in addition to the German, Austrian and French attitudes to the transitional period, divergent opinions also exist among the new Member States, as the transitional period has gradually become aÂ sensitive political issue there as well.
We adopted the transitional measures during the accession talks, as part of the deal.
As time goes by, however, this has become aÂ sensitive issue in the politics of the old Member States, which are increasingly perceived as discriminatory.
Discussions over the Services Directive have already revealed absurd situations in connection with transitional periods and now, with regard to Directive 109, it also appears that aÂ legal conflict has arisen with the preferential rules clause.
The fears generated by job insecurity and prejudice undoubtedly represent political capital that can be readily used.
Instead of propagating this myth, however, which in fact leads to a political impasse, it should be the responsibility of politicians to tell the truth.
Â Â  I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Csaba Åry, for his excellent work, and would like to thank Commissioner Å pidla for the summarising report which often provokes a dispute, due to differing interests.
Colleagues from certain states are criticising the report, but the majority are finding this objective report very helpful indeed.
When new Member States are fighting for equal rights, this is more than just a simple fight for equal treatment: it protects the interests of the entire European Union.
It is a paradox that it is the new Member States who are pressing for the liberalisation of the labour market, which, just like the liberalisation of services, should be implemented by the European Union anyway, in the interest of its own competitiveness.
We would like to be citizens with equal rights of the European Union.
The opening up of the labour market and the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour; it is the rational decision of the eight old Member States, which would result in favourable effects for all citizens of the European Union.
Our thanks go to the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Portugal and Holland, and we hope that the remaining eight Member States will also consider their position.
I agree with Commissioner Å pidla: it is inadmissible that third-country nationals with five years of legal residence should be in a more favourable position than workers from the ten new Member States in countries that have not opened their labour markets to them.
Â Â  Mr President, when Spain and Portugal entered the European Union â the then European Community â there was an irrational fear about the arrival of Spanish and Portuguese workers on the market.
That was shown to be absurd.
But the same fear nevertheless arose once again with the accession of the new Member States and, unfortunately, despite the fact that in that case, at that time, some of us in the Spanish Parliament opposed it, even the Spanish Government of that time â at the time of accession â agreed to those transitional periods, partly due to pressure from other Member States.
We have now seen that that makes no sense, that that fear is entirely irrational and that we cannot allow one of the fundamental freedoms in the European Union to be pushed to one side for a period of time, for purely populist reasons or through fear of how certain societies may react.
We cannot have first-class and second-class States within the European Union and we must therefore put an end to these transitional periods and open up the borders of the European labour market entirely, turning it into a genuine internal labour market.
I therefore entirely support the Ãry report, which draws attention to this issue and to the situation being faced by the citizens of those States, who in some cases are in an even worse situation than citizens of third countries who are legally resident in the Member States of the European Union.
I congratulate the Spanish Government on having finally decided to agree to the lifting of that transitional period and I hope that, as soon as possible, other States will accept this initiative, in order to create equal conditions for all of the citizens of the European Union, and this House must therefore apply pressure in that direction.

Â Â  I support Mr Åryâs report and all other efforts aimed at enforcing the operation of an internal market in the European Union.
Of course, the efficient operation of the internal market is based upon the free movement of capital, goods, services and workers.
The free movement of capital and goods has been implemented relatively successfully.
We have, however, encountered great difficulties with regard to the free movement of services and workers.
We have planned that the European economy should flourish with the Lisbon Strategy.
We are constantly hearing about the importance of competition and adopting measures against protectionism â but how well is this working in practice?
As far as capital and goods are concerned, some countries are particularly consistent in their advocacy of competition and are even opening their markets to cheap goods from Asia.
But those who constantly lecture us on the importance of competition and the drawbacks of protectionism as regards goods and capital are at the same time closing their service and labour markets.
Is that not protectionism?
2006 has been designated the European Year for Workersâ Mobility and, yet, it is in this very year that some Member States are planning to extend their transitional periods.
So, I ask you, how are we supposed to explain that to the citizens of the European Union?
With a great deal of difficulty.
On the other hand, it is plain to see that all those who have opened up their markets are making progress and their economic development is noteworthy.
Any country which decides to further close its labour market must do so, in my view, on a rational basis and acting as an individual, rather than as part of a bloc of countries.
If we want the European Union to be able to compete successfully with other states, it must fully implement in its internal market the free movement of capital, goods and services as well as the free movement of workers.
Â Â  â Mr President, essentially justified though the desire is that the transitional periods for the free movement of workers â which constitute a barrier to mobility within Europe â be done away with, the superficiality and vagueness of the Commissionâs study do little if anything to make that easier.
To be sure, their abolition could make unregistered work within the labour market more difficult, but it certainly will not cause the regulatory pressure on wages and in the social sphere to disappear.
That would, indeed, become an even bigger problem.
If, then, it proves impossible to enact accompanying measures to protect workers, such as, for example, a substantially improved Posting of Workers Directive along with the machinery to monitor and implement it, the only result will be even greater pressure on the labour markets in Germany and Austria.
I can still find no evidence of usable accompanying measures from the Commission, and it is all very well for you to laugh, Commissioner!
It may well be that the majority in this House will accept the Commissionâs and Mr Åryâs reports, thereby indicating a complete lack of concern about Germanyâs and Austriaâs positions and interests, so: away with the transitional periods!

As a parliamentarian, I have to accept what the majority says â that much is abundantly clear â but, while it may well be all the same to you, the Commissioner for social affairs, that you are thereby further fuelling anti-European sentiment in our countries, it is certainly not a matter of indifference to me!
Â Â  Mr President, of the many subjects we will be voting on this week I believe that this report and this subject are the most important.
The fact that some 30Â speakers from many different parties want to contribute to this debate is confirmation of that.
Many people have already referred to the basic four freedoms of the EU.
Amongst those freedoms, the freedom of movement of people is perhaps the most important.
Half a century ago Jean Monnet said of one of the key missions of the EU: .
That was absolutely right then, it is absolutely right now.
That is what we should be doing: uniting the people.
Mention has been made of the fears of some Member States.
I do not think we should criticise Member States for having those fears: it is understandable.
However, alongside those fears are facts and the facts should put the fears into context.
The fact is that such immigrants who have come from central and eastern Europe into the UK, Sweden and Ireland have not been a drain on the economy, but a benefit to it.
The problem has not been the legal immigration into our countries, but the illegal immigration to other countries that has propelled the growth of the black economy.
The people who are afraid of the problem should be mindful of the fact that this is a much bigger problem than opening up borders at this stage.
I am glad that there are already three further countries â Spain, Portugal and Finland â which have said that they will be removing the barriers.
I should like to ask the Commissioner to use his great personal authority as well as that of the Commission to encourage Finland to maintain this issue as a very high point on its agenda in its forthcoming Presidency and to report back at the end of its Presidency on the progress it has made so that it can inspire others to follow its example.
Meanwhile, I hope that we will all inspire others with a strong vote later this week.
I hope we can say to new Member States âthere are no second-class citizens in Europeâ and to old Member States âit is time to open your borders and open your mindsâ.
Â Â  â The free movement of workers is one of the cornerstones of European cooperation.
The temporary transitional arrangements that a number of countries â including my own, Denmark â have chosen to introduce in relation to Eastern European workers must be cancelled as quickly as is reasonably possible.
The transitional arrangements must not unnecessarily hamper freedom of movement, and we must demonstrate solidarity and openness towards all Europeans.
The rules must therefore be made flexible so that all unnecessary barriers are removed.
However, the transitional rules must only be abolished once we have made sure that people travelling here from Eastern Europe are not being exploited.
The transitional rules in Denmark serve as protection against exploitation and ensure that workers receive the wages provided for by collective agreements.
Eastern European labour is too often exploited by employers who pay wages significantly below the norm and allow their employees to work under miserable conditions.
We have a responsibility to defend workersâ freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right in the EU.
However, it is also our responsibility to defend employeesâ conditions and to guarantee that everyone receives proper wages and enjoys proper working conditions.
The transitional conditions were, and are, an attempt to attend simultaneously to both considerations.
We have no minimum wage in Denmark.
The transitional rules have therefore made it possible to monitor the influx of workers from Eastern Europe so that efforts could be concentrated on those employers who have tried to circumvent the rules governing wages and working conditions.
The time is ripe for slowly phasing out the restrictions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in times of uncertainty, the European Union must return to its basic principles.
We now need to complete the implementation of the four freedoms that form the basis of the internal market.
The free movement of workers still needs to be implemented and, to that end, it is vital to lift the restrictions imposed when the new Member States acceded as soon as possible.
This distrust is misplaced, because we can see that, in the 15 countries where the restrictions have been lifted, there have been no massive influxes.
Surprisingly, only 2% of European citizens work outside their country, whereas a third of Americans live in a state other than the one in which they were born.
The invasion is nothing but a fantasy, and the mobility of workers is a challenge.
MrÂ Åry's report sets the objective of lifting the restrictions by 2009, and I support this objective.
The French Prime Minister has also indicated that France would anticipate this movement by lifting these restrictions in a gradual and controlled manner.
The resolution adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation in December 2005 opens up paths that reconcile the opening up of borders with appropriate protection.
The amendments adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go down this route, in order to ensure that employment law is applied in the Member States, specifically to ensure that Community standards are implemented, in particular those in the posting of workers directive, and in order to look into the creation of a European centre to coordinate the inspection services of the Member States.
By producing standardised statistics on Community migration, we will be able to set up the toolkit for a social Europe within the Union, which will confirm that the free movement of workers must not be synonymous with dumping or the lowest common social denominator, but must be a factor in the economic dynamism that will enable us to iron out pockets of under-employment.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate Mr Åry on producing an excellent report.
I should like to make three brief points, the first of which concerns paragraph 1.
As it came out of committee, it now calls on Member States to abolish the transitional measures in force.
For many that has become the main focus of the report.
I know that the rapporteur has felt pressured to table a compromise saying that Member States should consider abolishing those measures and specifically mentioning the three Member States that did not introduce them in the first place.
Many in my group support the text as it now stands, feeling that we should be against any continuation of transitional measures.
However, in saying that, they are reading it alongside paragraph 14, which says that Member States that continue to use such measures should take all steps to ensure that they do not continue beyond 2009.
My second point concerns equal treatment.
The rapporteur and others here today have made the point forcefully that it is not just a question of making sure that A8 workers have the right to freedom of movement of labour, we have to ensure inspection and enforcement regimes grant them full equal treatment and prevent exploitation in the 15.
There have been serious breaches in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
My final point relates to Directive 2003/109/EC, referred to by the Commissioner.
It grants full access to the Member Statesâ labour markets for long-term resident third-country nationals.
Parliamentâs Legal Service has said this poses no danger of creating a situation where third-country nationals have greater access than A8 citizens.
The Legal Service points out that Article 11 of the Directive says that Member States âmayâ restrict equal treatment for third-country nationals in certain cases.
Saying that Member States âmayâ is not the same as saying they âmustâ or that they âwillâ.
The only way to guarantee equal treatment is to end transitional measures.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the demands made by the Åry report, I am firmly convinced that both the transitional periods and freedom of movement can be maintained by those Member States that think it necessary to do so.
If a country, with an eye to its own labour market and its economy, thinks it needs to continue to regulate access to the labour market, then it is perfectly entitled to do so.
Here too, the ââ rule applies, and neither the Commission nor this House â perhaps not even a majority in the latter â should venture to exert pressure by making appeals to one country or another.
To do so would be, as I see it, to misuse a highly volatile issue to whip up sentiment.
Where this issue is concerned, I find myself unable to put Germany and Austria in the same bracket as Spain and Portugal.
Germany is on the dividing line, and the conditions prevailing in it are quite different from those in the countries of Southern Europe.
There is in this House so much talk of subsidiarity, yet suddenly, where the free movement of workers is concerned, Brussels and Strasbourg claim to know better than those on the ground in Germany or Austria.
A few months ago, in its coalition agreement, the German Government reiterated its commitment to the transitional periods, and it did so not in jest, but on the basis of facts that have to be treated with respect.
My country must continue to regulate access to the labour market for at least the next three years.
What arrangements are to apply to the following two, must then be discussed on the basis of the new situation, and action then taken.
By way of conclusion, let me point out that it was with this very problem in mind that there were great popular misgivings about the eastward enlargement, and yet we were always able to say: âThere is nothing to fear; these issues have been regulated by treaty for five or seven years.â
Â Â  MrÂ President, 1Â May 2004 is a day that I shall always remember.
On that day, I stood, together with DrÂ OttoÂ vonÂ Habsburg, on the border between Slovenia and Austria and took part in a solemn ceremony.
What was being celebrated was the fact that, as Slovenia became a member of the EU, a town that had undergone a post-war division into two parts â one of which came to belong to Austria and the other to Slovenia â was now being reunited.
The symbolism was clear and, standing there, I felt strongly that people did not feel that they were entering something new but felt that they were being reunited with something of which they had always been a part.
That, moreover, is the way things are.
The EUâs ten new Member States are ten old countries of Europe.
It is just that Communism had kidnapped them for 50 years, and now they are finally reunited with us.
In the run-up to this reunification, Swedenâs Social Democrats had painted horrific pictures of how our country would be invaded by foreign workers who would dump our wages and exploit our social benefits.
