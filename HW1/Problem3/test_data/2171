Political leaders in all the European institutions, in the Member States' governments and parliaments, the economic, political and cultural elites in all our Member States - these must now take upon themselves the responsibility of engaging in dialogue with the public.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we unreservedly support the political objectives set out here both by the Council and by the Commission in the persons of President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen, but we must also point out that the European Union is in a very grave situation.
What we have heard indicates that the prospects for the summit now being held in Brussels are not very rosy.
On behalf of our group, I would again like to make very clear that we had always envisaged a timetable according to which negotiations would be concluded by the end of 2002, with the treaties then being signed in March or April and the accessions formalised in 2004, so that the candidate countries would be able to take part in the 2004 European elections.
Now, Commissioner Verheugen has just made reference to Germany and France.
I agree on the importance of these two countries coming to an understanding, but, along with our group, I consider it a serious political error now to attach new conditions to the completion of the negotiations out of the desire for a new financial framework for the post-2006 period and perhaps even sooner.
Mr BÃ¶ge, who is an expert on Budget matters, has confirmed to me, and I would like to point out, that Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that the adjustment of the Financial Perspective, and hence the allocation of the funds that enlargement will require between 2004 and 2006, can be decided on only on a proposal from the Commission and by a qualified majority in the Council as well as an absolute majority of members and three-fifths of the votes cast in Parliament.
This, then, is where Parliament also has a part to play.
I very much hope that an agreement can now successfully be reached in Brussels, as both Mr Haarder and Mr Verheugen have said.
For if no success is forthcoming from Brussels, negotiations will be held up.
I have to say, speaking for my group, that we regard delaying the negotiations in such a way as irresponsible if it means that they cannot be concluded by the end of this year.
That is why the appearance of these new conditions at this juncture is a grave political error.
It would have been possible to discuss them at a much earlier stage.
It would be a tragedy if the candidate countries were to end up losing out because insufficient agreement had been reached within the European Union.
I agree wholeheartedly with what Commissioner Verheugen said about the candidate countries having done their duty over recent years, but it is the fault of certain of our Member States that we in the European Union have failed to do what had to be done.
We would be in breach of the trust placed in us by the candidate countries if we were to fail to come to an agreement in Brussels now.
I call upon all the parties involved to unite in Brussels and make the task of the Danish Council Presidency easier, enabling us to conclude the negotiations in time for Copenhagen.
Reference has been made to public information, and I can emphatically underline what both President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have had to say on the subject.
Commissioner Verheugen, Parliament also needs to hear what is actually being done with the funds that the Commission has allocated to information work, in order to give better information on the use made of these funds to our voters, whom we of course have to take with us along this road.
Mr Haarder also mentioned how Kaliningrad will be a topic of discussion in Brussels.
Whatever the necessity of resolving the problems Russia has with transit - and there is no doubt that Russia has a major interest in this - it is important for us that we make sure that Lithuania does not get the impression that we in the European Union are now making decisions over its head.
On the contrary, Lithuania must be strengthened in its sense of its own sovereignty, and whatever is eventually decided must, of course, be subject to its agreement.
The Schengen criteria must also be adhered to.
It is on this basis, and also in relation to security, that we of course counsel flexibility in resolving matters with Russia.
The issue, however, is not only access to the Kaliningrad region, for beyond it, of course, lies Greater Russia.
There are other problems with borders.
Take, for example, the small amount of cross-border traffic between Poland and the Ukraine or that between Slovakia, Hungary and the Ukraine.
I urge this House to bear in mind the need to, on the one hand, guarantee security, and, on the other, to use flexible solutions to make it possible for people on either side of the border to meet each other.
In Brussels, you will hear a report from ValÃ©ry Giscard D'Estaing, the President of the Convention.
Our group and also our party - the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - is, as we have now confirmed at our congress, quite clear about the timeframe involved.
We want the Convention to produce a result by the end of June 2003, with, after that, a short Intergovernmental Conference, so that, under the Italian Presidency, we may achieve a Treaty of Rome or a constitution of Rome, a basic treaty for the European Union by the end of 2003.
This, therefore, is our call to all the parties involved: let us be ambitious, so that we may, adhering to this timeframe, bring into being the historic project, not only of enlargement, but also of a European constitution within the time allotted us.
This is our collective duty if our European continent is to have a good future.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching the debate on the forthcoming European Council in Brussels with a certain amount of optimism.
The President-in-Office of the Council, the Danish Prime Minister, Mr Rasmusen, when he was kind enough to invite us to the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen, spoke of the three stages of the Danish Presidency.
We knew that the Irish referendum and the elections in various Member States (Sweden, France and Germany) would have to be overcome, and now the second stage is beginning.
We need to clear up a few grey areas in Brussels and reach agreements in order, as Commissioner Verheugen has said, to be able to prepare for the Copenhagen Summit in time.
That is very important.
First of all, I shall address the question that I believe to be the most decisive: we must not only be able to talk about negotiations and money, which is always important, but we must also be able to provide a political impetus and vision for this entire process.
Before a wedding, the pre-nuptial agreement can be significant.
In Hollywood, some film stars sign pre-nuptial agreements over 100 pages long.
It is also important to know which house the couple will live in, and that is the job of the Convention.
Our main problem in the European Union, rather than in the candidate countries, however, is managing to muster political enthusiasm and historic vision.
This is the responsibility of the Commission, the Council, and also our responsibility here in Parliament.
I consider this to be the most decisive factor, and I would say that this is the weakest point at the moment.
We have talked about the budget, which is a summary of our policies.
In my personal experience, in the process of the integration of my country - and also of Portugal - into the European Union, budgetary issues were extremely important and defined the current framework, the 1988 Brussels Summit, the MacSharry reform and the Edinburgh Summit.
I believe we must start with the fact that it is good to have financial perspectives - I was the rapporteur for Parliament when the first financial perspectives were proposed - but these must not be restrictive.
They must be interpreted according to a fundamental political principle: that the budget is adopted annually.
My group believes that we cannot wait until 2006, because there are important questions that need to be resolved.
The first, as President Prodi has said, is that the candidate countries are not net contributors.
This aspect is absolutely fundamental, not only in presentation, but also as a display of solidarity.
Secondly, we need to talk about 80% of the budget.
The Commission has put forward a proposal, which my group considers to be of interest and which we should debate, which does not refer to changing the ceiling of the common agricultural policy, but of making this a possibility in future, and, in particular, of introducing criteria of sustainable development and solidarity, which this policy is lacking.
It is therefore our responsibility to address these problems now, without waiting until 2006.
The same is true of the Structural Funds, which are a sign of economic and social cohesion, not total cohesion, but an important tool for the modernisation of these countries, as they have been for others such as Ireland - the country of origin of the President - Spain - my own country - Portugal, etc.
We must make the effort to consider how we can achieve better agreements that enable us to protect our interests and, at the same time, extend them to the candidate countries.
That is something that cannot be put off until 2006.
We need to address it today, and it is important for agreements to be reached between France and Germany at the Brussels Summit, naturally - it is not good for one country to isolate itself from the rest of the Community - but also between all the current partners.
This is also an extremely important signal.
Lastly, Mr President, in this case we must also talk to the candidate countries knowing that we are on the threshold of a decision that involves a shared destiny in the future.
And we must also make a joint effort in Parliament to be able to adhere to a complex timetable which is an obstacle course we must overcome with a common political will.
Mr President, if the Treaty had been rejected by your countrymen, this week's Council would have been marred by recrimination and disarray.
Due in no small part to your efforts, Ireland's 'yes' vote has put us back on track for Europe to be reunited in 2004.
The decisions that remain will not be easy.
As our esteemed former colleague the President-in-Office has said, decisions involving money rarely are.
But the Heads of State and Government must not allow themselves to flunk this historic opportunity by fighting over how to pay the bill.
My group believes that enlargement can be financed under the financial arrangements agreed in Berlin.
Some shifting between the different headings should be possible, within the overall limits.
The final package must guarantee that new Member States will not be net contributors before 2007.
Otherwise we will feed resentment and face the risk of more cliff-hanger referenda in the aspirant countries.
Inevitably, the major area of disagreement is the common agricultural policy.
While the Liberal Group does not regards CAP reform as a precondition for enlargement, it is clear that significant reform of our farm policies is essential to the success of enlargement and also for other reasons.
I hear that President Chirac expects the United Kingdom to bring its budget rebate into play, while he refuses to countenance reform of his farm policies before 2006.
We support the Commission's proposals to phase in income support to farmers for the new Member States, but we also expect all existing Member States to commit themselves to far-reaching reform of the CAP, as proposed in the mid-term review.
The second major area of concern is the readiness of the applicant states to live within the disciplines of the single market and respect the European Union's values.
We share the concern expressed in the Commission's progress report about corruption in a number of these countries and the need for progress in implementing EU legislation, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs.
That is why it is right that there should be a reinforced monitoring system to ensure that countries fulfil their commitments.
The President of the Commission called for enthusiasm and intelligence.
Commissioner Verheugen's approach has demonstrated the latter, but a touch more enthusiasm in the Council for enlargement and for the new Europe it heralds would not go amiss.
Mr President, the candidate countries have now devoted many years' hard work to adapting themselves to the European Union.
They have the right to expect that the EU does its share of the work and that no obstacle now arises to prevent the ten countries identified by the Commission being admitted into the European Union as planned.
It would be an irony of fate if there were discord in the EU which ended up delaying enlargement.
Our group does not share the opinion that the Treaty of Nice was an absolute condition for enlargement.
Enlargement could have gone ahead all the same, based on the old treaty.
The Treaty of Nice is, above all, about strengthening supranationality and increasing the power of the large countries within the EU system.
In addition, there is a problem with the Treaty of Nice as regards the distribution of power to the new countries.
The Czech Republic and Hungary are in actual fact discriminated against in terms of the number of seats in the European Parliament allocated to them.
It is our opinion that this should be adjusted in the Treaty of Accession.
It has to be said that the negotiations have gone well from the EU's point of view.
The candidate countries have worked hard to take over the acquis.
The important thing now is that they will not only take it over in theory but also in practice, and then not only as regards the internal market but also as regards the environment and social rights for workers.
The question is whether the EU should not also adapt itself to having ten new members.
I believe that more should have been done.
It is our own inability to reform agricultural policy which has given rise to a situation in which the new Member States are actually going to be treated significantly worse than the previous Member States for quite some time.
This is unacceptable.
Any discrimination should be kept to a minimum and should be as short-lived as humanly possible.
In other areas, too, we must be able to revise our own policies so that they are suitable for enlargement.
The Schengen Agreement is one such area: its strict border controls are in danger of becoming a serious obstacle to cooperation for new Member States and for countries which are not in the next wave of enlargement of the European Union.
On the subject of the Kaliningrad area, we wish to see a solution whereby Russian citizens are able to travel between different parts of their country without needing a visa.
On the subject of the labour market, it is our opinion that everyone should be treated equally.
It is crucial that workers' rights are respected in all countries from day one, so that a situation does not arise in which we have social dumping or in which workers from the candidate countries are discriminated against on the labour market.
Therefore, we regret that the Commission has effectively called this into question by means of a legal case in Finland which questions the contention that Finnish agreements apply in Finland from day one.
The important thing now is to avoid enlargement giving rise to an 'A team' and a 'B team' in the European Union.
This would also require the ability on our part to make changes to the Union.
Naturally, the candidate countries also have a choice.
They can vote 'yes', or they can vote 'no'.
If they choose to vote 'no', the alternative is close cooperation with the European Union.
Mr President, an historic process, the opportunity for peace and stability on our continent - words do not come more impressive than these.
I wish a bit of this historical spirit and sense of opportunity would make itself felt at the Brussels Summit, to prevent it from degenerating into the horse-traders' fair that we fear it will become.
There must be a willingness there to solve problems rather than keep putting them off.
The candidate countries' impressive performance will leave the Council with no option but to confirm that ten candidates are ready for membership.
The Member States' lack of solidarity, however, and unwillingness to reform is making living together in an enlarged EU increasingly problematic.
It is thus that we discuss - as if it were the most self-evident thing in the world - how the candidate countries will in future finance the British rebate, even though they are barred from being given one themselves.
In terms of the history of the EU, that is a one-off; previously, all net contributors got a rebate in their first year.
The fifteen EU members benevolently welcomed the proposal by the Commission and the Presidency that they should get one extra year's payment from the Structural Fund.
Why is this so?
It is because the lack of absorption capacity means that the money ends up back in the Fifteen's treasuries.
That is not the solidarity that the EU needs.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance unambiguously reject such a continuation of bank-driven enlargement.
Let me say something about agricultural policy. The disinclination to make reforms in this area stinks to high heaven, and the citizens of the European Union will no longer stand for it.
It is not only because of enlargement that reform is needed; it is in itself overdue, and it is absurd to put it off any longer.
Unconditional direct aid payments as extensive as these have simply outlived their usefulness and an enlarged EU will mean that they will no longer be workable.
We have to make a start on agricultural reform now and work together to develop a fair structure for the twenty-five members that the EU will have in 2007.
The maintenance of privileges must not be allowed to become a new condition for enlargement.
I would like to say something about the Irish yes-vote. The Irish said yes to the Treaty of Nice, thereby removing the greatest obstacle to enlargement, but the reform of the European Union's institutions is still pending.
The Treaty of Nice has not really moved the EU any further on.
It is first necessary to create democracy and improve decision-making, and that is in the Convention's hands.
I therefore want to argue that the Convention's draft treaty absolutely must be capable of being adopted in 2003.
Functionality is not a prior condition for the enlarged EU, but it will be needed.
President Prodi referred to a lack of public approval.
And why is that so?
The EU quite simply lacks transparency and democracy, and that must change!
Mr President, I wish the Danish presidency well in the run-up to the EU Summit this week in Brussels.
Enlargement, being the main subject on the agenda, has been very much at the heart of the referendum campaign on the Nice Treaty in my country.
The other issue - Kaliningrad - is also directly linked to enlargement.
I welcome the measures proposed by the Commission to ease the direct transit of goods and people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia.
All of us have benefited from the in-depth and often intense debate on enlargement that has just taken place in my own country.
The decision taken by the people of Ireland underlines their strong commitment to European integration and enlargement of the European Union.
I welcome the fact that their decision clears the way for the conclusion of the accession negotiations for the first new Member States.
I support what Mr Poettering said.
There must be no new conditions introduced or strings attached at this stage in the negotiation accessions. That would be a recipe for disaster.
The lesson we can all learn from the recent debate during the Irish referendum campaign should not be taken lightly.
I endorse very strongly what President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have said on the need to keep people informed.
The Irish electorate are making it clear that they will not be patronised or taken for granted by the political leaders and governments of the Member States, or by Brussels.
It is frightening to hear President Prodi say that almost 80% of respondents in a recent poll had no idea what was going on.
Mr Haarder said earlier that there is an exciting debate in progress in the Convention.
It may be exciting to insiders, but outside, as he well knows, it is hardly mentioned in the newspapers.
Remember that when we hold a referendum on this in the near future, the issues we will be asked to decide on will be of far greater complexity and importance than those related to Nice.
And we recently had great difficulty reaching a decision on that.
Mr President, ask a leading question, and you get the answers you are looking for.
Ireland has won an emphatic 'yes' to more jobs, to neutrality and enlargement, but there are neither jobs nor neutrality to be had from the Treaty of Nice, and, regardless of whether the Irish had voted 'yes' or 'no', enlargement would have gone ahead anyway, by taking Declaration 20 and moving applicant countries' votes in the Council and seats in Parliament into the accession agreements.
I will vote for this in the House, but future historians have to know that a people was harmed.
Ireland is the most EU-friendly country there is.
It voted 'no'.
Instead of giving other people the chance to express their opinion, the Irish were bullied into voting 'yes' using the fabricated contention that failure to do so would block enlargement.
Up to now I have had nothing but praise for the Danish Council Presidency.
Today, however, I am sorry to say that the Danish President of the Council was party to the deception of the Irish voters.
Would Mr Rasmussen have stopped enlargement following an Irish 'no'?
He would probably have pulled another proposal out of the hat and secured enlargement without the Treaty of Nice.
The best that can be said about the Treaty is that it will only last for a year or two.
Then, a new basis from the Convention of the time will be put to the vote.
The Treaty of Nice is the worst mess to date.
I have published it in consolidated form, but I can by no means recommend the book.
Nice is ill-suited to secure popular support in the applicant countries.
It takes away the countries' right to choose their own Commissioner, in favour of an EU government appointed by majority voting.
Remove the stumbling block now and declare that there will still be a representative of each Member State on the Commission.
The Irish voters by no means declared themselves in favour of losing their Commissioner.
The subject of the Treaty of Nice was scarcely discussed this time and some skill went into ensuring that the Irish did not come to know about Mr Giscard d'Estaing's first draft constitution.
This was presented at a closed meeting last Thursday.
The copies were numbered and were collected in again afterwards.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing has a cure for referendums: if a country votes 'no' the next time, it will be left behind.
Vote 'yes' or disappear.
Countries permitting their population to vote 'no' will no longer be paid any attention.
The EU state comes before the voters.
In Mr Giscard d'Estaing's democracy there is a choice between voting 'yes' and 'yes, please'.
No, thank you, Mr President.
I will not abuse the privileges of the Chair by allowing myself the comment I would like to make, Mr Bonde.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is about to approve the list of the ten candidate countries which, according to the Commission, are ready to join the European Union on 1 January 2004.
There is a problem, however: neither you nor they are ready.
The Commission itself admits that only two out of the ten countries have an economy capable of contending with competition and administrative and legal structures in place capable of enforcing or respecting Community law.
The Commission believes that the others will be ready within 13 months.
This is not sufficient in terms of an analysis or timeframe.
Neither is the European Union ready to welcome these countries, and I am not referring here to the dangerous institutional conjecture by the Convention.
I am talking about the total lack of basic consideration.
Because of a semi-religious taboo surrounding the sacrosanct Community acquis, no one has asked themselves whether a Europe that has 25 Members should do the same things as a Europe of six, nine, twelve or fifteen.
Suddenly, you are prepared to make second-class members of these countries.
No one has wondered about the costs, financial or other, in terms of unemployment and economic and social disruption.
Consider the costs of German reunification, twelve years down the line: the social and economic divide still exists in spite of the West providing financial assistance to the East estimated to be more than EUR 850 billion over this period.
Lastly, the summit in Brussels will also look at beginning accession negotiations with Turkey.
Turkey is a wonderful country, a bridge between Europe and Asia, but it is not a European country, geographically, linguistically or culturally speaking.
Why then, should we now try to make it think it is?
Is it because of blackmail by the Turkish Government over the future of Cyprus, or because of the incredible arrogance of the US Administration which was indignant that its Turkish ally did not feature on the Commission's list of candidate countries?
It is not us who have to bear the consequences of the US Government's Middle East policy.
Very briefly, this Europe which is handing over the interests of nations to oligarchies that have interests so different to our own ?we do not want it for our countries nor do we want it for our counterparts in the East.
They are emerging from the nightmare of Communism.
We must not relinquish their freedom simply for the benefit of a new empire.
Mr President, Ireland's ratification, on Sunday last, of the Treaty of Nice is to be welcomed with open arms since their approval will enable the Union to prepare itself for its historic enlargement, welcoming the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as well as Cyprus and Malta.
The Danish Presidency of the Union recently indicated that, if necessary, it would prolong the summit which is due to take place in Brussels on 24 and 25 October, so that it could complete all the items on a particularly demanding agenda, as President Prodi reiterated earlier.
On Monday last, Commissioner Verheugen expressed regret that France is not adopting a more flexible attitude regarding the possibility of reducing direct aid to farmers, before deciding on the amount of aid to make available to the farmers of the future new members, and he considered that the sudden increase in agricultural expenditure would make the CAP a logical area where money could be saved.
With respect, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I find this view particularly unbalanced.
President Jacques Chirac yesterday called for a solution to be found that is acceptable to everyone for financing the enlargement of the European Union, and for this to be done at the end of a working meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rasmussen.
The French Government believes all planned expenditure in the EU budget must be examined and a limit on this expenditure must be imposed.
By undertaking a thorough review of the financial commitments of all the Member States and by ensuring they are fairly balanced, we will succeed in finding a solution acceptable to all, so that enlargement can be carried out under the best possible circumstances.
I am sure that France is very willing and will shoulder its part of the effort that is required in finding a fair solution as soon as possible.
This could not be achieved, however, by sacrificing a sector of our population, in this case, farmers and the rural community.
The financial contribution that is justifiably anticipated must be divided equally between all the Member States of the European Union.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in 1957, next to the huge Soviet bloc, the Europe of the founding fathers was, in the words of Paul ValÃ©ry 'the little peninsula at the end of Asia'.
Less than 50 years later, the European Union has become the third greatest power in the world in terms of population, rivals the United States in terms of GDP and is the greatest trading power in the world.
The European Union is the only example in history of a power that has grown through the voluntary accession of its neighbours.
This extraordinary example set by Europe must be maintained when the Community is enlarged to encompass a further ten countries.
It is not enough, however, to grow in body; one must grow in mind as well - this European mind that the German philosopher Karl Jaspers characterised as 'the meaning of History, Science and Freedom'.
Let us add solidarity to this list.
We must develop the European spirit and prevent this spirit from being discredited at the forthcoming Brussels Summit by ridiculous displays of haggling and national self-interest, by arguments about who should pay more and who should pay less.
This does not mean that the financial offer to be made to the candidate countries should not be substantial and significant.
Nor does this mean that the future funding of the Union should be of a redistributive nature.
A Union in which so many inequalities remain must concern itself with this issue.
We must not, however, confuse the matter.
President Chirac is mistaken.
The CAP is an unfair, imbalanced and damaging policy from the ecological point of view.
It cannot be compared with cohesion policy, which really is a fair policy and a policy that strengthens Europe's internal unity.
Comparing the two policies is a serious mistake.
Lastly, Mr President, we must consider the case of Turkey: the most basic sense of loyalty obliges the European Union to set a timetable for negotiations with Turkey.
Linguistic, cultural and religious arguments cannot be used to keep Turkey out of the European Community, when this country has been hoping for so many years to achieve this and has made considerable efforts to do so.
This is a question of the EU's loyalty and honesty towards its partners.
Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I just want to look at the problems that will arise for the people of Kaliningrad as a result of transit arrangements, and the solutions that have been proposed for them.
The transit permit, or Kaliningrad passport, as proposed by the Commission, is in my opinion a good solution for both sides.
It would make it easier for the Kaliningrad Russians to travel to their mother country than is the case with normal visas, but it would also safeguard Lithuania's sovereignty.
The option of establishing a train corridor has been put forward.
This idea, however, does not tie in with current reality.
The point is, how many of the present Member States would agree to have a train tearing along through their own country, coming from another country that does not belong to the European Union and whose passengers could not be checked?
Would Belgium, Spain, Italy or France agree to this?
It is good that the Council since yesterday has had a common position on transit arrangements for the people of Kaliningrad.
In examining the way opinion has been formed I have noticed that the further away from Kaliningrad a current Member State is, the more unrealistic the points it has put forward to solve the problem.
This is, frankly speaking, go-it-alone irresponsibility.
Russia's suggestion for visa-free travel between herself and the EU has also, unfortunately, gained the support of some Member States.
It is regrettable to find that people are unable to view the drawbacks or dangers which that would bring realistically.
If we want to start relaxing visa policy radically should we not start with Turkey, which at least has candidate country status?
Visa-free travel is not, however, today's issue.
For that reason, it is rash for just one individual EU country, for example, to promise such a thing, and I seriously fear that merely discussing the issue would harm the favourable attitude the citizens of countries applying to join the Union have towards the EU.
I nevertheless give my wholehearted support to policy with regard to Russia that backs that country's long-term development and makes it possible for visa-free travel to be introduced one day.
Incidentally, I would like to suggest that it might be worth asking the Russians why, as they have renounced Lenin in Leningrad and Stalin in Stalingrad, they still sully a major area of European culture with the name of Mikhail Kalinin.
Immanuel Kant's KÃ¶nigsberg should once again have the honour.
Finally, I should like to raise the matter of the Eurobarometer.
The Commission is quite right to say we must share this information, but 70% of our citizens expect to hear the truth and information from their national governments.
Why do they do nothing?
This is hardly a speech by the opposition, as I am a member of the party in government in Finland.
Mr President, thank you for the statements by the Council and the Commission, and also sincere congratulations and thanks to the Irish people, who removed a great obstacle to enlargement last Saturday.
I am pleased that both President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen concluded their inspired interventions by speaking of information based on the latest Eurobarometer surveys.
Only one in five Europeans feels 'well' or 'very well' informed.
This does not make pleasant reading. Nor does it come as much of a surprise, because we have been aware of the problem for many years.
I have said it before in this House, and I will gladly say it again: EU information and communications policy is in need of improvement.
We must be prepared - as Mr Poettering mentioned - to find the necessary means.
Information forms the basis of understanding and thus of the popular grass-roots support that the EU needs.
The enlargement negotiations have now passed the point of no return and there must be no new demands made.
Admittedly, there is need for a radical reform of agricultural policy, but let us first put all the arrangements in place.
I am pleased with the results from the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg over the last couple of days, and it is particularly good news that agreement has been reached on the fact that none of the new applicant countries can under any circumstances start their membership of the EU as net contributors.
Anything else would have been unreasonable.
I am confident that the Council, headed by the Danish Presidency, will be able to accomplish this great historic task in Copenhagen in December.
Mr President, I am positive that the penultimate step before Copenhagen will be taken in Brussels over the next two days on this exceptional policy, the European Union's policy of admitting ten new members.
This step needs to be taken in a decisive and realistic manner which overcomes any petty perceptions and subsequent moves need to be determined by this step, not the other way round.
I have just two or three comments to make as time is so short.
First, Kaliningrad. Obviously, this problem needs to be resolved, not with a Gordian knot but with a clean sweep, by which I mean a harmonious, rational, functional solution that respects nations and states.
Secondly, the widely discussed issue of the budget.
We must not be mean and tight-fisted and we must not forget that the countries about to join the European Union have manpower in abundance but, unfortunately, limited resources.
However, abundant manpower is what determines development and development is what we need to see.
Thirdly, in connection with other issues which may have prospects or require decisions, the European Union of the 15 or of the 25, or of however many other members there may be, must remain an area of social cohesion, development and democracy.
Clearly, therefore, any solutions to budgetary questions need to be resolved on the basis of these priorities.
In other words, they must be predicated on the need for the European Union to maintain the values which it has already acquired and which must continue to apply, they must be predicated on peoples' priorities and not on petty political perceptions which, in the final analysis, are short-lived and are sometimes to do with antagonism of one sort or another, which gets us nowhere.
Having said which, I am positive that two new steps forward will be taken over the next two days and, as we continue on this course, we at the heart of the European Union, the European Parliament, must generate the political spirit and climate which, unfortunately, tend to be lacking, reducing the debate from a debate on overcoming problems to a mean, tight-fisted debate.
The impending enlargement is one of the most important political events since the initial inception of the European Communities.
This enlargement will heal a rift between Western, Central and Eastern Europe.
This rift came about before the Second World War and was reinforced by an iron curtain and a wall after the Second World War.
The healing of this rift is a jewel in the crown of the present European Union and also of the acceding countries.
They have been adapting their democratic systems, their economies and their legislation since 1989, which has required major efforts.
I therefore lend my wholehearted support to the ten accessions proposed by the Commission.
A crucial debate on the topic of enlargement is taking place in the Dutch Lower House today.
The Dutch Government is in support of enlargement despite the opposition of two coalition partners, namely the Liberals and the Fortuyn group.
I regret this deeply, but there will still be a democratic majority in the Lower House today prior to the accessions, which means that the Netherlands will not necessarily put a spanner in the works.
We may have our Social-Democratic friends to thank for this.
If a number of conditions have not yet been met, however, the acceding countries will be required to make a final effort and, if necessary, introduce safeguards in areas such as food safety, the internal market and justice and home affairs.
Incidentally, I am pleased that Mr Prodi has stated that these safeguards will actually be put in place should this prove really necessary.
It would also be much better if a financial agreement were to be reached, so that there would be more clarity about the financial costs involved in the enlargement, as this is an area which our citizens are particularly concerned about.
It would also be preferable if better agricultural agreements were concluded.
These should not be a pre-condition, but I agree with those fellow MEPs who claim that they are required as a matter of urgency.
I now have a question for Mr Haarder.
Would it perhaps be possible for you to have a frank discussion with our Liberal colleagues in the Netherlands, who are your fellow party members, to ensure that this issue does not complicate matters at this time and that it is not misused in the Dutch elections?
The Netherlands has always been a pro-European country.
The political parties that are trying to turn the Dutch into eurosceptics are taking on a major responsibility.
The enlargement receives the support of both the Christian-Democrats here and the Christian-Democrats in the Netherlands.
I should like to say to Mrs Maij-Weggen that I spoke in terms you would be rather pleased with regarding our Liberal friends at a Liberal congress last week.
Mr President, there is good reason to rejoice that Ireland has now accepted the Treaty of Nice, with its specific declarations on Irish neutrality.
This removed a serious obstacle to enlargement.
Enlargement is a historic occurrence for which, in my opinion, both the Commission and the Danish Presidency have prepared the ground most competently.
The applicant countries have made a tremendous effort to prepare themselves for accession to the EU.
I sense that the remaining problems are clear.
Now, therefore, it is up to the Heads of Government of the 15 countries to show leadership and responsibility in order that the Presidency can in the coming week obtain the required common mandate to conclude the negotiations with the ten applicant countries on the basis of the Commission's January proposal.
No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed.
Agricultural and funding reform should not be tied up directly with enlargement. On the other hand, of course, as we well know, the present and future members of the EU should be able to agree at the Copenhagen Summit in December on at least some of the principles for future agricultural and funding reform, which, as we know, will be necessary from 2006.
It is also important that the outcome of negotiations we are aiming at is fair on the applicant countries, and that we bring about a fair competitive situation, possibly with slightly shorter transitional arrangements in the field of agricultural subsidies, so that referendums in the new Member States can obtain a 'yes' vote.
With regard to the Kaliningrad issue, I also hope that a good enough solution can be found, so that the little enclave does not become a conflict region, but instead a positive player in the Baltic region; a solution which of course fully respects both Lithuania's sovereignty and its desire to become a member of Schengen.
A 'corridor' solution, which brings back memories of earlier solutions to similar problems in Europe, must be avoided at all costs.
We should be able to solve the transit question in a different way, possibly by means of a special passport system.
But I extend my thanks to the Danish Presidency for its competent leadership.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission and Commissioner, the electorate has spoken in France, Germany and latterly also in Ireland.
There are still a few countries in which they need to have their voices heard, which will cause the necessary problems, as there are still questions on this score.
The politicians, however, must now roll up their sleeves as a matter of urgency, not as carpet dealers, as Mrs SchrÃ¶der mentioned, but with the necessary vision and courage.
I should like to ask a specific question with regard to the information which President Prodi mentioned.
In my many dealings with the public, I have noticed that the same questions arise time and again among the people in Flanders and Belgium.
I think that they are entitled to an answer.
There is the answer about the vision, and you can win people over with this.
However, there are other questions that keep being asked in my country.
Will horizontal enlargement not obstruct vertical enlargement?
In other words, will this enlargement not spell the definitive end of our growth towards a community?
Will this be intergovernmentalism's final victory?
This question has been raised in Belgium and has, for example, prompted the Socialist Party - which is, after all, the key government partner at present - to question the meaning of this enlargement.
I should like to ask a second question which people keep asking me - at least people in our regions.
They naturally visit the countries that will be our future partners, and in that sense, Europe is already growing in the hearts and minds of the people, but they notice that those countries are experiencing major problems, abject poverty and problems involving minorities.
We are also experiencing a time of economic decline and a time when the spectre of unemployment is once again looming large in the EU countries themselves.
Then people want an answer to the question whether we will be able to fight the unemployment that is now threatening us.
I am convinced that future enlargement will make this possible.
I do believe, however, that we should not merely present people with a vision and good news; we should also produce specific answers to the questions that are being raised on a daily basis, questions concerning the costs and also, of course, questions that I have raised myself and that will need to be resolved in the Convention.
Mr President, now that Mrs Maij-Weggen has made it clear that the Dutch Christian Democrats are no longer the problem, and now that it is also clear from what you have said that the Liberals are not either, the only people who seem to be left hitching a free ride and imposing special conditions are the German Social Democrats and the German Federal Government.
I think, though, that we ought to make clear that, whatever else we might rightly or wrongly desire, no new conditions for the enlargement of the European Union must be allowed to be imposed.
That has to be made clear and - as you, Commissioner Verheugen, know better than any of us - those things that were neglected when negotiating Agenda 2000 cannot now be put right again a quarter of a year before Copenhagen.
We will have to do that at a later date.
Now that Saturday's events make it possible for us to get back to discussing Nice's critical aspects, it is right and proper that we make it clear that, in structural policy for example, the Convention must accept majority decisions, thus giving us better decision-making structures for the reforms in 2006, and enabling us to implement the necessary reforms at the right point in time.
The actual content of that can of course be prepared by the Commission and in the debates, but here too, we have to do the necessary homework if we are to make progress in 2006.
Let me briefly address the Kaliningrad question, which, I believe, encompasses some of the political issues that remain to be dealt with.
We have to take account both of Lithuania's sovereignty and Russian sensitivities and make clear that big countries cannot ride roughshod over small ones when they engage in negotiations.
Part of our picture of Europe is, after all, that small countries have a value of their own.
It is evident that any solution here has to be practicable and makes allowances for everyone's sensitivities, and I believe that what the Commission has presented and yesterday's decision by the Council of Ministers provide a basis for negotiations, one on which we can proceed.
I take the view that, in today's battle order, the Commission and the Council are indeed doing their best to achieve a result in October.
Allow me a final comment.
Information work and information campaigns will be of great importance, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries.
I hope they will be better organised in the latter than they currently are in the former; in my own country, they involve little more than putting the Federal States' ministers for Europe on display, and have little relevance to the actual work of informing people.
Perhaps, Commissioner Verheugen, we could at some time discuss how we can change this.
Mr President, yesterday's and this morning's meetings and the meeting due to be held in the coming days in Brussels are all trial runs for Copenhagen, aimed at defining the European Union's position before the last sprint to complete negotiations.
The ten countries have made considerable progress since last year and will be ready in 2004.
I believe that the justifications contained in the report will also be included in the report currently being drawn up by Chairman Brok, and that they will not be very different from what has already been said.
I represent a fairly straightforward case - Slovenia - which would actually appear to be pretty representative of other small countries in the sense that, without the hard schooling from Europe, these countries would have been psychologically much, much further away from Europe than they are today.
Economic, administrative and political problems and the desire to respect the Copenhagen criteria have placed Slovenia and other countries among those which have recently tackled the various chapters on reconstruction of the administrations and the economy most vigorously.
Of course, they need to continue to concentrate on restructuring the economy and they need to improve their insolvency legislation, but, at the same time, I would point out that a large number of experts have been drafted in and that some banks which were completely state-owned have become 76% private in the space of a year.
This would appear to be a great achievement.
By agreement with the European negotiators, the country has opted to remain a single region, not least to avoid feeling, after Vienna and Belgrade, that it is under the yoke of yet another foreign power.
There is a possibility that this may change in 2006, depending on national feeling.
The most important thing, however, is to keep the citizens informed, something which has been the subject of much discussion today and which is poorly organised.
I feel that more needs to be done in this respect.
Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the Danish Presidency for its good work.
It does not surprise me at all, but of course there are, and were, Members who doubted the Danish will and ability to carry out enlargement of the EU.
This really has now come to nought.
To listen to Mr Bonde, one wonders if he is not dreaming that he is back in the 'good old days' of the GDR.
Last Monday I was in Bratislava, in Slovakia.
There, it emerged that people felt very unfairly identified as an unreliable candidate country in connection with what had been said during the Dutch Government crisis.
Other countries have also been named.
I would like to say to Mrs Maij-Weggen that there are actually many Dutch liberals who share your opinion, as Mr Cox also quite rightly said.
The last word has not been said on this subject.
In order to reassure people in Bratislava, Warsaw, Riga and Vilnius, I wish to say that the President of the Council and the Commissioners confirm that there is no cause for concern.
There is no information in the country reports to demonstrate that, in general, any countries are in a worse position than others.
As Commissioner Verheugen emphasises, there is nothing today to show that there are any problems in any of the ten countries which cannot be solved.
It is true that there are difficulties, but they are not insurmountable.
I believe that it is extremely important that the Council and the Commission are clear on this subject.
The historical and moral reunification of Europe is irrevocable.
The EU honours its agreements.
We stand our ground.
I quote in Latin, which I once studied: pacta sunt servanda.
Mr President, we are facing a very complex European Council, and I should like to wish the Danish Presidency every success in this.
We owe it to the presidency, the European Union as it stands now, as well as the candidate countries to be able to take some serious decisions.
Crucial decisions will need to be taken within a few months, and in my view it is especially regrettable that we are still finding out that 79% of the people in Europe are claiming to be badly informed.
This is not only regrettable, but also very dangerous, because a huge number of people in Europe - indeed in all the Member States - feel uncertain and unsafe.
This uncertainty and lack of information about enlargement only serves to intensify these negative feelings.
I think it is high time we explained to people that enlargement could be a springboard for a safer Europe, a Europe that gives them greater security, and it is also high time we reassured them that Europe need not become less social, less prosperous or even less democratic as a result.
It is high time we told them that - and started working on that.
This is why, just as our group chairman asked the President of the Commission, I should like the Commission to tell me exactly what its information plan looks like, and I should also like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether it might not be a good idea to discuss this with the government leaders at this important European Council after all?
Large-scale European information campaigns with sizeable advertisements in major newspapers may help to some extent, but the euro campaign has taught us that we should make use of decentralised information methods.
We must involve the governments and civil society in the Member States.
If we do not, people will never be sufficiently informed.
Are there such plans in the pipeline?
Are there plans afoot to quickly set up a campaign in this way?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, taking into consideration the fact that quite a number of governments in Europe have left a great deal to be desired in this area, will you be quizzing your fellow government leaders about this?
Your point is worth emphasising.
The information campaign is not only about public relations.
It must have political conviction behind it.
If there is no political conviction, no message gets through.
In this Parliament we must understand that the time has come for the politicians to repossess the enlargement agenda following the highly complex work carried out by the Commission.
This is the message we must deliver at the summit meeting on Friday.
Mr President, enlargement is not just meant to bring peace, democracy and the rule of law; it is also, of course, meant to help raise the standard of living in the countries that will be joining us.
Economic cooperation ended up being a formula for the European Union's success, and this formula is to be applied more widely to give us stability in the sense of peace - not only external, but also internal and social peace.
Great economic insecurity lies in store for the candidate countries, and we have to get them to understand that we know what difficulties they will face.
For example, we have been able to learn from the Economic and Monetary Committee's delegations what advances have been made, and which have proved difficult, in such areas as, for example, competition policy or the control of aid payments.
This has also had an effect on jobs in the candidate countries and cannot be organised without it running the risk of rejection.
We are, then, well aware of the credit that is due to the candidate countries for their efforts, but it is also evident that they, when they join, must not only be capable of functioning as market economies; they must also be able to stand the pace of competition.
There is still room for improvement in this respect.
I want to give just two examples of this - steelworking and shipbuilding - and propose to mention energy only in passing, even though it is equally important.
That is why the Commission was right to insert safeguard clauses.
I think the candidate countries will also be able to handle these, and we must see to it that these safeguard clauses are inserted in such a way that they do not affect this or that country in an arbitrary way.
I am confident that the process of reform in the candidate countries will continue; indeed, it must continue and be a success, as it is not only the failure to inform the public in the European Union that is an issue here; it is also the lack of information in the candidate countries.
It would be a good thing if we could help to resolve this problem.
Mr President, this enlargement project is to the little country I hail from, Denmark, a matter of national pride.
The criteria for the accession of new Member States were drawn up at the Copenhagen Summit in 1993, and the process is to be concluded at the Copenhagen Summit in December.
It is irrational that this should be a matter of pride for the little nation, but it boosts our self-confidence, and that is of course always good.
The problem is, of course, simply that so many issues are still unresolved.
The Belgian negotiator of the Maastricht Treaty, an economist by profession, has stated that there is a long series of funding problems which have not been solved.
Everyone wants enlargement, he says, but no one wants to pay for it.
Why, for example, should the British keep their rebate while the much poorer candidate countries pay full price?
This is one problem.
Another problem, which has been completely overlooked, and which is under the extremely roomy carpet under which problems are swept, is the question of the reliability of the progress reports.
I cannot find a single instance in these analyses of a sober attitude to the decisive question of the last and crucial Copenhagen criterion, according to which the candidate countries not only have to comply with the acquis communautaire but must also have the administrative, legal and political structure which is a prerequisite for its effective implementation.
A Swedish report last week pointed out that these problems are extremely serious.
Simple mathematics demonstrate that the legal and administrative personnel simply do not have the training.
The whole basis for actually implementing the acquis communautaire is absent.
These problems have not been dealt with, and the question to my Danish friend and former colleague, the Danish Minister for European Affairs, is: what do you intend to do about this badly neglected problem?
Mr President, I welcome the fact that enlargement is proceeding relatively smoothly.
However, when the whole of the EU institutional machinery is focused on the enlargement process, do not forget that there are other European countries with very legitimate cultural and historical links to Europe.
They feel aggrieved that their ambitions for EU membership in the long term are being ignored and decreed unrealistic, particularly by the Commission.
I have in mind particularly Ukraine, which is locked in a political struggle between westernisers and those who wish to see it join a reinvented economic union with Russia and the eastern republics.
As soon as this round of enlargement is over, we must reconsider our policies to other countries in Europe.
I am thinking here of the Balkan states in particular and neighbouring countries such as Ukraine which need anchoring in peace, prosperity and western security.
Since the break-up of the former Soviet Union ten years ago, they have moved some way towards democracy, human rights and good government, although a great deal remains to be done.
If Turkey has been granted candidate status, surely a country like Ukraine has just as much, if not more, of a claim to be a candidate for the European family of nations in an enlarged, wider and looser European Union.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Irish people, as well as the Danish Presidency, which has done a tremendously good job, and the Commission, which has been working on the issue for a long time.
There is of course a large number of problems associated with enlargement.
The opportunities outweigh the problems, however, although obviously we do need to solve the problems.
They should not be allowed to overshadow the opportunities.
It is a question of our children and children's children.
It is a question of creating a Europe of peace and democracy for our children and children's children.
It is a question of a better environment.
Sweden shares a border with many of these countries: we have the Baltic in common, for example.
If we wish to tackle the problems of the Baltic region for the future, we can simply do it together.
It is also a question of workers' rights in countries bordering on ours, so that these countries cannot practise social dumping, and so that they have fairer conditions and stronger trade unions.
All of this is our responsibility.
The President said that we need to have information campaigns.
Of course we do, but this is first and foremost a political responsibility.
Now is the time for us, the politicians, to get out of the conference room and hold a dialogue with the people in our Member States, with a view to convincing them of the importance of enlargement.
I would like to see a change in agricultural policy.
We need a change in structural policy, but this must not be made a condition for enlargement.
It is not the candidate countries' responsibility, but our responsibility - the responsibility of all of us - to make a change in agricultural and structural policy.
A brief word about Kaliningrad. I hope that a solution can be found, particularly so that the people are able to move freely over the borders.
We should not forget another aspect, which is that there is a risk of the gulf between Kaliningrad and Lithuania widening when Lithuania undergoes improved development as a Member State.
This could potentially lead to tensions in the border regions.
It is important, therefore, to make efforts in the social and economic fields for the people in the Kaliningrad area, too.
Mr President, I wish to appeal to the Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers who are congregating in Brussels: that appeal is that they take seriously their responsibility in respect of enlargement.
It is not possible to make everything dependent on everything else, nor is it possible to force through an agricultural reform with enlargement in the offing.
Time must be found for that later on.
It is not possible to be willing to pay more for enlargement and, at one and the same time, to compel others to pay less.
I think it must be clear that the costs of enlargement, within the bounds of reasonable perspectives, should rather be planned to be below the level of Agenda 2000 as set out in Berlin.
We should be looking seriously at proper finance for agriculture, making it possible for there to be stable conditions for farmers by 2006, but we should also be clear in our own minds that not everything has a final solution.
There will be no pre-enlargement agricultural reform without postponing enlargement for ever and a day, and nor can we prejudice future, post-2006, Budget frameworks.
It is with this in mind that I can say that we in the Austrian People's Party, and I as a representative of it, take the line of 100% support for enlargement.
I know that your team in Brussels is empowered to act properly in the interests of the European Community and of Austria.
We hope, of course, that there will be sensitivity for our concerns about transit and support for border regions, but we are all aware that enlargement is a great chance - a chance that must be made use of.
This must be guaranteed in a policy and a procedure that means that the candidates for accession are not forced into a 'do or die' situation, about which we have heard so much.
So I ask you this: how do you intend to go about finding a method whereby, on the one hand, the Brussels Conference is prevented from degenerating into a secretive conclave and, on the other, there is enough space left for negotiations with the candidates for enlargement?
I should like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen, who congratulated us on the fact that the Social-Democrats in the Netherlands are certainly helping our country out of an awkward situation today by not raising any obstacles with regard to Copenhagen or the European Council which is to be held within the next couple of days.
It is important for both the Greens and the Social-Democrats, who are in opposition in the Netherlands, to help the Netherlands move in the right direction.
We are pleased that the European Union is still on schedule concerning enlargement.
Given the years of preparation and the importance of enlargement, we hope that we can complete the process with all ten candidate countries within the next eighteen months.
The frank Commission reports, for which my congratulations, confirm that a few things still need to be resolved.
The European Parliament has also pointed out the weaknesses on several occasions.
Most candidate countries are still lacking in areas such as implementation capacity and the fight against corruption.
The further agreements concluded between the Commission and the acceding countries will therefore need to play an important role in the European Parliament's final assessment.
It is too early to rest on our laurels, but at the same time, the European Union must remain reasonable.
We cannot ask more from the candidates than what we can accomplish ourselves.
All this also applies to Slovakia.
Until 1998, Slovakia lagged behind the other countries, but has since then largely made up the difference - in fact to such an extent that it now has every right, in my view, to feature on the Commission's list.
The rate at which reforms have taken place over the past few years gives me hope that the remaining problems can be resolved quickly.
'Keep at it!' is the message we should like to pass on to the new Slovakian Government.
Fortunately, it was set up promptly after the elections in September and, like the previous government, will be able to work well with the European Union.
I should like to urge this House, but also mainly the Council, to put the Meciar era behind us.
It is over, and it is unfair to keep reminding Slovakia of it.
Mr President, I am concerned for the pensioners of Bulgaria, and not just because I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party and a member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee.
The Bulgarian pensioners fought in the Second World War, they lived under the yoke of communism for very many years, and now that they are old, living on miserly pensions, they hope that their quality of life will improve when they too become part of the European Union in a short while.
I therefore wonder, and I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, whether, seeing as the Stability and Growth Pact too has to be interpreted intelligently and flexibly, is there any hope that the decision of the Community organs to defer Bulgaria's accession to the European Union until 2007 might be reviewed?
And, above all, is there a possibility that the decision to close units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant within the set time frame might be reviewed, allowing Bulgaria to keep them in operation for a little longer in view of the enormous harm their closure will do to the Bulgarian economy?
Lastly, would it be possible to reflect on the need to proceed swiftly with and put more funding into the development of corridor 8, linking Puglia to Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria and terminating in Varna and Burgas?
I was pleased with Mr Prodi's call for more political enthusiasm with regard to enlargement.
I can inform my fellow MEPs that as a member of the Convention on the future of Europe, I have the privilege of already working very closely with our colleagues from the candidate countries and that their commitment and enthusiasm for the European project are a pleasure to behold.
What Mr Gollnisch said, namely that nobody in this Convention has given any thought to what a Union with 25 Member States would need to do, and whether this would be different from 6 or 15 Member States, is incorrect.
I am, however, concerned about another matter.
If we want to make a success of this Union of 25, I do believe that the Convention members should aim a little higher in terms of a strong and democratic Europe with proactive institutions.
It is also very important, in my view - and I am addressing a point made by Mrs Thyssen here - that our enthusiasm for this enlargement and this political European project does not remain confined to European political Ã©lites.
The people must also be involved.
I was therefore particularly pleased with Mr Prodi's call for information campaigns intended for the public at large.
We at our end all do our utmost to explain to the citizens what enlargement is about, but we cannot do this alone.
There are, however, sufficient arguments to suggest that enlargement will offer answers to people's questions rather than raise new problems.
I would therefore like to join those fellow MEPs who ask how the Commission, the Member States and the Heads of Government can help us in our duty to inform.
The issue of monitoring and safeguard clauses are of particular importance as a way of reassuring the public because it demonstrates, Commissioner Verheugen, that we take enlargement seriously.
You spoke about monitoring in the context of police, justice and the internal market.
I would like a guarantee from you that this monitoring procedure and the safeguard clauses also apply to social policy and environmental policy, as these are, after all, very closely connected to the internal market.
It is particularly in these areas that you could offer reassurance to the public, in my view.
Mr President, half the people of Ireland were induced by out-and-out brainwashing and a packet of money into saying 'yes' to the Treaty of Nice, having been given to understand that their 'no' was unacceptable to the so-called defenders of the rights of nations and man.
And, despite all that, the shameless celebrations continue.
The hastily convened summit in Brussels is being called on to contain the differences between the powers that be in the European Union and quell the disappointment of the citizens of the candidate countries, who can now see through the promises made to them by the propagandists of enlargement.
The intense and exorbitantly expensive advertising campaign to sell integration cannot mask the harsh reality, which is that, even in the run-up to enlargement, these countries have given the shirt off their back to the mandarins of the European Union.
It is now becoming clear that not only will certain candidate countries have no net income; they will be funding the budget.
As agricultural spending is cut and subsidies are abolished in order to release funds for imperialist policies, direct farm subsidies will start to fall at something in the order of 25% to 35% per annum, with unpredictably disastrous consequences for farmers in both the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries.
And from what we have heard today from the members of the Council and the Commission, the people of Europe have nothing to gain from enlargement.
The trade deficit of the candidate countries is several times larger than the funds being allocated to them from the Community budget.
Cyprus is another issue altogether.
The Cypriot Government is being coerced in the run-up to integration into accepting solutions which go against the interests of both communities and the Cypriot people in general.
The way in which integration itself is being handled basically legitimises the disgraceful state of partition, never mind its drawbacks for the people of Cyprus.
We, the Communist Party of Greece, oppose all these procedures and we shall stand with all our might shoulder to shoulder with the people fighting for their rights.
I should actually like to congratulate your colleague Mr Pat Cox, President of this Parliament, warmly on his excellent contribution during the European Liberal Democrat Conference recently held in England.
He made every effort to point out to his Dutch fellow party members that their attitude towards enlargement was totally untypical of true Liberals, because we know that the Liberals have always been keystones of European integration, that they are particularly kindly disposed towards extending the international rule of law and have always used this as a basis of their movement on principle.
I am delighted that the bookkeeping obsessions that are currently doing the rounds in the Netherlands in combination with frightening scenarios in those circles have been contradicted in a way which can be described as truly impressive.
I am indebted to him for this.
His words will help ensure that, with the support of Her Majesty's constructive opposition, the Netherlands will certainly not be adopting a conflicting position.
I have to say that the European Parliament, from all manner of quarters, has also done what was necessary in this matter.
I have also listened with great interest to our good friend Mr Berthel Haarder, who spoke about Kaliningrad and said that the interests of the Lithuanians should not be trampled underfoot.
Considering it was a speech made by the Parliament's presidency, I think it was worthy of imitation.
After all, if we set up a joint committee together with the Duma to discuss issues surrounding Kaliningrad, the Lithuanian parliament will also need to be represented in this committee, not with a view to putting Lithuania under any pressure, but so that this representation could clearly protect Lithuania's interests.
The way we view Lithuania and its sovereignty is a litmus test for the way the enlarged Community will deal with small Member States in future.
This is why the speech by Mr Haarder strikes me as particularly important and I should like to thank him for it.
My final comment is about Turkey.
Needless to say, there is still a difficult issue to be addressed there.
I would plead strongly in favour of Turkey being treated in the same way as the other candidate Member States.
This means that, since Turkey is very different from the other candidates in terms of meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen, we have to put another problem to Turkey.
If we apply the same criteria, we would need to treat Turkey in exactly the same way as we have treated Slovakia and any other country in the past.
This may be difficult for the Turks at the moment, but in my view it is of major importance for Turkey to clearly develop in the direction of a democratic constitutional state that functions well as such, and for them to realise that they cannot participate in the game until they have reached that stage.
It should also be a matter of honour for Turkey not to want to take part as a token member, having made half a pledge concerning the constitutional state.
As far as I am concerned, we can look forward to the European Council with confidence.
That brings us to the end of this stage of the proceedings.
We shall now move on to the second round of speakers listed for the political groups.
Mr President, I wish to thank the Danish Presidency, which has guided the process from Copenhagen to Copenhagen not as a national, but as a European goal.
The Danish Presidency has demonstrated clearly that it is Europe's servant, and that it is not pursuing specifically Danish goals.
It is the European goal which is being pursued, and, as usual, it is the small, eager, competent countries which are pursuing it.
No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed.
It has been said time and time again, and our political group obviously shares this view of the matter.
No new conditions.
It is clear that a debate on agricultural and funding reform will follow, but, as so many have said here in the House, these must not get in the way of enlargement.
This is something that must be solved in stages.
We have been discussing the provision of information to our citizens on enlargement. Is it, however, the Commission which is going to do that?
In my opinion, it is all very well for the Commission to supply factual information, but in actual fact it is us, the politicians - our governments and the parties in our countries - who have to solve the problem of information.
I think we have to realise this, because different countries see things in different ways.
Some things are more important in the north, other things in the south, but the common thread must be that we are carrying out enlargement because we wish to have peace in our territory; peace for when our children and children's children grow up.
It is a very simple message, and I think that it is the pivotal element in this connection.
Many issues have been raised along the way, and one which is raised in at least some of the countries is the question of whether widespread corruption exists, which will undermine the fair distribution of EU subsidies.
It is not an insurmountable obstacle, however.
We must of course invite the applicant countries to participate in the existing system of subsidies on an equal footing with the present members.
We should have faith in the applicant countries' governments, too, being minded to do their best to prevent the misuse of common funds.
They are equal members, but if it should be established that there is any corruption or fraud involving EU funds, the Commission should, in a transitional period, step in and take over the administration of subsidies, so that the money is paid out to those for whom it is intended.
We wish for many things, including that the democracy which we are developing, and which is developing all the time, be strengthened by the accession of the new countries.
They bring with them a wide range of highly educated, extremely interesting people, who will enrich immeasurably the territory we are shaping together, and it is precisely their contribution to the creation of a new treaty which is absolutely crucial in ensuring that this takes into account the many cultural and national aspects which should go into building the new Europe.
Mr President, there is a saying in the United Kingdom that you should not 'spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar'.
I think we would all do well to remember that in the coming weeks.
The financial arrangements are going to be difficult to agree and I do not underestimate them, but we must keep a sense of perspective.
The money for the candidate countries up to 2006 represents one thousandth of the GDP of the EU and is 10% of what Germany has spent on its own unification.
The costs are nothing compared to the economic benefits that will flow from enlargement.
The costs are nothing compared to the costs of not enlarging and are nothing compared to the costs of trying to maintain the stability of the continent by other means.
The original six Member States would do well to remember why they formed the Community in the first place and the economic benefits that flow from it.
Those of us that joined later should remember why we joined and the efforts that other countries made to integrate us successfully into the Union.
We should remember the economic benefits that have flowed to us from EU membership.
We should all remember that the financial and human effort needed to construct today's Union was the most efficient investment ever made on such a scale by countries of a whole continent.
Now is the time to bring that investment up to an entirely new level for the future.
I am concerned that this debate seems to be taking it for granted that the ten countries are already in, when they are not.
We in Parliament have to give our assent and we will scrutinise the final treaties very closely.
It is vital that the candidate countries maintain their efforts to come up to the required standards.
We welcome the three-fold safeguards set out by the Commission in the form of economic safeguards, internal market safeguards and justice and home affairs safeguards.
But we expect Parliament to be involved if these safeguard clauses are ever invoked.
We also welcome the Commission's proposal for a further progress report six months before accession.
We must all be prepared, if that report is negative on any particular country, to take the appropriate action.
The Socialist Group will also be monitoring the social component of enlargement, because we must make sure that enlargement makes things better for people and not worse.
If I could turn to Kaliningrad, Mr Haarder mentioned negotiations with Russia.
Could I gently remind Mr Haarder that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union, nor is it a candidate country.
I should also remind you that many of the problems in Kaliningrad are of Russia's own making, not least the refusal to allow many countries to set up consulates there.
They cannot have a veto on the future of the EU.
What we must respect absolutely is Lithuania's sovereignty in this matter.
Nor must we try to find solutions with negative historical connotations, such as train corridors.
We must also ensure that whatever solution is reached is practical and that we are prepared to give financial and other support to enable Lithuania and Poland to enforce it.
The Irish referendum taught us one important lesson.
The 'no' vote actually stayed the same, the difference was in the 'yes' vote, and this was the result of the positive engagement by politicians with their people.
In preparation for enlargement, we all have a responsibility to engage with our electorates to ensure that they welcome enlargement and recognise the benefits rather than worry about the costs.
Mr President, in two weeks it will be 9 November.
This is the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the wall which symbolised the division of Europe, the hostility and the distance between East and West.
On that day, we shall celebrate the fact that it is 13 years since the joyful masses clambered over a crumbling wall, and the long journey towards reconciliation and unification began.
Now we are almost there.
We are approaching our destination.
The Commission's report confirms that ten countries can become members in just over a year.
It is a fantastic feeling, but the joy is tempered slightly by a nagging unease.
We are getting there.
We are approaching the finishing line and are noticing that quite a few of us are becoming nervous.
Support for the candidate countries is waning, and several Member States, leading politicians and parties are speaking of waiting or postponing on the grounds that 'we are not ready'.
Internal policy considerations are overshadowing the historic task of unifying Europe for the first time ever; by means of agreements, negotiations and compromise, not by means of threats, tanks or invasion.
Of course, many people around Europe are asking themselves questions about how cooperation will work and how it will develop.
Difficulties and problems will arise.
After all, who believed that it would be easy to unify Europe?
This anxiety must be taken seriously, and we must discuss it.
We must demonstrate our genuine intention to reform and open up the EU.
It is towards this that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is working most actively in the Convention - because it has to succeed.
We must also become much better at bringing the results of the Convention's discussions out of the conference rooms in Brussels.
Above all, however - and little has been said about this in the debate - it is leadership which is required: from us, from the Commission and from you in the Council.
It is deplorable that internal policy considerations, mean-mindedness and populism are what are communicated to our citizens instead of talk of visions, opportunities and Europe's big chance.
We, the politicians, have an enormous responsibility to explain, educate and guide opinion.
Forked tongues arouse distrust in our countries and the candidate countries.
I hope, therefore, that the Council meeting over the weekend will be crystal clear and unanimous in saying: 'Yes, you are most welcome.'
Mr President, the process of enlarging the European Union by ten more States is now entering its final and decisive stage.
Our group has always followed it and played its part in shaping it; we have been active in doing this, but have kept a critical mind.
There are real fears that the hopes enlargement has nurtured over many years - for social improvements and an economic upturn - will not be fulfilled in precisely that way.
The stertorous political utterances, heard over and over again in this Parliament, about overcoming of the division of Europe and doing away with the inheritance of Communism, block out any more sophisticated view of Europe's post-war history and, there being so many different problems in the central and eastern European states, go over people's heads.
People are hardly being involved in the process at all.
The process went ahead along largely administrative and technical lines and was seen by Brussels as having to do with the acceptance of the acquis communautaire.
The governments of the candidate countries were sometimes not allowed to say much, and their parliaments were programmed to give approval after largely uncritical debates.
The acquis communautaire, which every country is to adopt and transpose, constitutes a paper mountain of over 80 000 pages.
If - as is the case - officials are scarcely able to get an overview of this, how can the public be expected to?
Under such conditions, there was little chance of the debate on the future of Europe, which we are often told we should be having, really getting going, either in the Fifteen or in the candidate countries, and little desire that it should do so.
That there is particularly deep-seated frustration among rural communities is no secret.
If you examine the differentials resulting from enlargement after previous accessions, you cannot fail to see that parity is to come about only in 2003.
Coupled with that, it is intended that the cooperative firms, alleged to be relics of the Communist command economy, should have the ground cut from under their feet by new directives designed to improve efficiency.
Let me say in blunt terms that European integration will not be made to work well by means of a reheated anti-communism, which cannot do other than target a fair number of the leading politicians elected by the peoples of the candidate countries.
I could name to you several good acquaintances of mine who fall into this category.
It seems necessary, in view of the dangerous lack of information, that we ask as a matter of priority, what effect the European Union has on the public's everyday lives and how we are meant to discuss it with them.
What is demanded of us is to talk less about transparency and democracy, and do more about them!
Mr President, being Dutch sometimes has its drawbacks.
To tell you the truth, I have been rather embarrassed over the past few weeks about the attitude of the Dutch Government. It has wavered long, far too long, over adopting a final stance and abandoning the veto.
As fellow MEPs have already pointed out, this was mainly due to the Liberals, who are conspicuous by their absence in this debate, and who, in my view, have adopted a small-minded bookkeeper's attitude in a bid to obtain short-term electoral victory.
Fortunately, an attitude of this kind cannot count on much support from other European Liberals.
Anyway, it will all be all right in the end, I think, not least because the opposition of the Social-Democrats and Greens will come to the rescue of the distressed Christian-Democrats in the debate that is being held in the Dutch parliament today.
Another reason why it will be all right in the end - and I do want to add this - is because we have before us a sound report from the Commission which is very open and honest about the long list of shortcomings which candidate countries are still displaying - something which I think is very brave - but, crucially, which also offers solutions to all the problems that still exist.
As has been mentioned by many fellow MEPs, the vital element needed to find those solutions is monitoring - monitoring the accession process and safeguard measures for two years.
I should like to put a question to Commissioner Verheugen on this subject.
Mr Verheugen, you spent the past two weeks in the Netherlands, you talked with the Dutch Government and you were undoubtedly informed of the Dutch Government's stance.
I should like to ask you for your observations on two specific points.
As you know, the Dutch Government proposes not to restrict those safeguard measures to two years, but possibly to extend them to three and four years.
What is your personal opinion about this and what is the Commission's opinion about this?
Secondly, it has been proposed to lift these safeguard measures only in the event of unanimity in the Council.
I should like to have your opinion about this too and, with regard to this last point, I should also like to hear the comments of your former colleague, Mr Haarder, current President-in-Office of the Council.
Finally, a word on Turkey.
For reasons that are incomprehensible, the Commission has not adopted a stance on this matter.
I should again like to ask the Council, and Mr Haarder in particular: is it conceivable - and I am choosing my words carefully - that the Council could reach a different conclusion regarding the setting of an accession date for Turkey?
For example, because Turkey could play a very positive role in the case of Cyprus in the next few months and because it is able to prove that it is taking the reforms seriously.
I would urge both the Commission and the Council to remain critical about Turkey, as we are doing, but also to continue to reflect on how the reform process can be promoted rather than frustrated.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully both to the Council and Commission statements and to what the House has had to say, and I have been struck, in particular, by the problem caused by enlargement.
I am very pleased at the outcome of the Irish referendum and I am convinced that it was Parliament that established the conditions which enabled the Irish people to review their positions.
I am particularly impressed with the work of the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who explained to us in his report this morning that it is important and necessary that Europe improves its north-south relationship.
Now, it is on precisely these issues that I would like to focus, particularly the question of the south.
When I hear about the arrangements we are making for the Structural Funds, where - it would appear - we are giving EUR 231 per capita to the citizens of the current Member States and EUR 137 per capita to the citizens of the new Member States, I feel that we are disregarding the fact that there are distortions. I have already had occasion to discuss these with President Prodi, and Parliament needs to reflect on the matter.
What will be the consequences of enlargement for southern Europe?
If I consider my native Italy, there is a large region in the south of Italy - Abruzzo - which is already excluded from the Commission's Objective 1.
Would it not be appropriate, therefore - this is my question to President Prodi - to review the Objective 1 and Objective 2 parameters?
Is there not a need to prevent enlargement, which we all want, having a negative impact on southern Europe?
This position, outlined by President Prodi, needs to become a major effort to bridge the gap between northern and southern Europe.
Mr President, enlargement by ten new members puts the EU before major difficulties.
Many of the candidate member states still have a great deal of work to do in order to be able to join the EU by 2004 in a proper manner.
The question also arises whether the EU would not in any case become unmanageable with so many new member states.
The necessary amendment of agricultural policy and structural funds alone places the current Member States before well nigh insurmountable problems.
What are the odds of the candidate member states actually complying with the EU's acquis communautaire?
These problems cannot simply be brushed aside.
It is, however, surprising how often the discussion is typified by unilateral thinking.
The argument that 'not enlarging' or 'enlarging at a later date' also carries a hefty price tag is heard very rarely.
Or the fact that the candidate member states have already made huge sacrifices.
Enlargement is not a matter of meeting a certain number of technical requirements.
It is an act of solidarity, of historical awareness, of strategic and economic importance.
It is a process that cannot be changed or broken off at this stage without major damage being done.
It is therefore to be hoped that the Council will be able to reach a deal on the financial package, the CAP and the institutional issues without delay.
Particularly in the institutional area, it is important to be vigilant of large Member States practising new power politics in respect of the small ones.
Given the major achievements yet to be accomplished by the candidate member states, the safeguard clauses proposed by the Commission are unavoidable.
The Commission must table specific and unambiguous text proposals promptly in order to make these clauses concrete.
It has been suggested that the period of application of these safeguard clauses be extended from two to three or four years.
The question does arise, however, whether the Commission intends to actually deploy these sensitive instruments if necessary.
Its current stance concerning the equally 'hard' Stability Pact is not very promising in this respect.
Needless to say, this is at present not the right signal we are giving the candidate member states.
- (DA) Mr President, I would like to extend my warmest thanks for the presence of history which can be sensed in many of the speeches made by my former colleagues and also for the commitment evident in the speeches by Mr Prodi, as President of the Commission, and Commissioner Verheugen.
We have been able to see how we have come closer to our goal with every passing week.
The week before last there came the Commission's recommendation, which won the support of a substantial majority yesterday in Luxembourg.
Last week there was the massive support for the enlargement project shown by the Irish.
Yesterday, we achieved common positions on Kaliningrad, on the institutions, on certain calculation methods and, of course, also on the choice of countries.
It must therefore be said that there are now extremely high expectations for the meeting in Brussels on Thursday, Friday and possibly Saturday, in which economic aspects are to be finalised, as Commissioner Verheugen so clearly put it.
The economic position of the present Member States should be laid down in order to make time for negotiations with the new Member States.
I would like to thank Mr Poettering, Mr Brok and many others for the unconditional support which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has given to this whole enlargement project.
I would also like to thank Mr Watson and many others for supporting the view that there must be no new conditions imposed.
This was echoed by Mr Lund and Mr Andersson.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo was quite right in saying that, just as a marriage must be built on love, so enlargement must be built on popular support.
Many people here have spoken about this and it could be a subject for my meeting with the Conference of Presidents at lunch, as it is of course up to Parliament in particular, and naturally also the Presidency and the European affairs ministers, to now get this public debate under way and garner popular support for the project.
On the other hand, I have to say that I was not impressed by the extremely unclear speeches made by Mr SjÃ¶stedt, Mr Bonde and Mr Modrow.
It was a good thing that the Irish voters did not pay any attention to this unholy alliance of old EU opponents, who have taken advantage of every single opportunity in their attempt to stall the European project.
For that I thank the Irish voters.
To Mr Suominen I wish to say that we are maintaining close contact with Lithuania and Russia.
Yesterday, the Council gave us a mandate to negotiate with Russia; and this is a mandate which fully respects both Lithuania's sovereignty and its right to join cooperation on Schengen at the same time as its neighbours.
The Presidency will do all in its power on Thursday, Friday and possibly Saturday to establish a common position on economic issues, too, which will make it possible to conclude negotiations with the new countries in Copenhagen.
We will be sleeping with our clothes on so that we do not miss a single opportunity to reach a compromise.
Without wanting to jump the gun, we are incredibly pleased with all the progress made, which has brought us closer to a solution with every passing week.
We must not now let the process be taken over by cold financial calculations of microscopic significance compared with the gains to be had by us all from enlargement.
We must not end up stalling the whole process by investing our energies in small financial details.
Perhaps we, the parliamentarians and governments, should try a little harder to explain to our citizens how little it costs per head.
If we have to sit there on Friday evening and night discussing whether it is 50, 35 or 75 cents per head, how long would that take?
One rapporteur said that the total cost of enlargement will be one tenth of the cost of German reunification.
Another mentioned that, in total, enlargement will cost one tenth of one per cent of our GDP.
This must not be allowed to compromise the historic task which awaits us.
Warm thanks to the rapporteurs, the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen.
Thank you to Parliament for today reaffirming that there is a momentum in this historic process.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will respond briefly to certain questions which I feel are extremely important: briefly not least because I was very pleased to see the extensive support for the enlargement process, which really has united almost the whole of Parliament in the political operation which I consider to be by far the most important part of my entire mandate and the mandate of my Commission.
I cannot think of anything else which is as valuable in both human and political terms as what we are doing.
I will therefore start by responding briefly to Mr Modrow.
Mr Modrow, the appeal to the will of the people for support for enlargement might not have been as successfully carried out as it could have been, as in all political processes, but what I found most remarkable, what struck me the most, was this new striving to implement the principles of democracy, solidarity and respect for minorities which has transformed Eastern Europe.
It has been an extraordinary experience for me to witness the continuous endeavours of the parties in the parliaments of these countries, parties which might be at loggerheads over other issues but which are in agreement regarding enlargement.
I am sorry that we are in disagreement on this very fundamental point.
Enlargement has been treated as an ethical and political matter as well as an economic matter.
Indeed, in many cases, although the economic dimension has been discussed, this great sense of turning over a new page in our history, this great sense of having unified Europe - not reunified but unified Europe, for Europe has never been united - is extraordinarily powerful.
We have - I repeat this too time and time again, and I learned it in the parliament of one of the countries soon to become part of our Union - unified Europe on a different basis, which means we can attract smaller countries too, we can attract minorities as well, for ours is a Union of minorities, it is a Union where no one person or body is in command: that is the immense, unique splendour of Europe.
Mr Poettering and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo mentioned two important elements. Firstly, the need to take the final step as regards the financial framework.
There is no alternative - we cannot jeopardise this great historic process for the sake of EUR 3 per head.
Clearly, Parliament and we at the Commission must push for these last steps to be completed. Secondly, the problem raised by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo of how to avoid the candidate countries becoming net contributors.
We should also be showing a minimum of solidarity with purely formal measures. I reiterate: let us take stock of the situation.
As the last speaker said, it is a question merely of a few euro per inhabitant. That is not asking much.
Just now, I read out the figure which the Member States will receive under the cohesion chapter and how that differs from the amount the new countries will receive. There are reasons for that discrepancy - life is complicated, we have limited budgets - but it is a discrepancy which we do not condone, which offends our sense of solidarity.
Moreover, as Mr Bigliardo pointed out, we clearly have to behave with the same solidarity in the future towards the Objective 1 regions.
That was our aim in not rushing into a mathematical calculation to produce a figure for the accession of the new Member States but, once again, waiting in order to be able to resolve the issue within a politically appropriate and intelligent way.
My last comment concerns the issues of the provision of information and the citizens' appreciation - matters raised by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Maes.
We need to make a greater effort to reassure our citizens and the citizens of the Member States.
Mrs Maes explored individual, specific areas such as enlargement and poverty, minorities and the economic crisis.
I have to say that the Commission launched a communication strategy as early as the beginning of 2000: all the questions and answers which we have received today have been posted on the Internet in all the languages.
For this campaign, for 28 countries, we set aside EUR 150 million for a period of five years. This is a modest affair, then - we are prevented from having recourse to the mass media by the limited size of the budget.
This provision of information is carried out in cooperation with the Member States and, most importantly, using the structures of civil society and supporting them by using them to promote our action.
Nevertheless, the campaign will not have the desired effects if the political leaders of the Member States do not work together with us to set up a debate on these issues, as Mr Rovsing said in his speech on this matter.
Clearly, therefore, I am calling for Member States' campaigns to be given more support, and maybe we could use some of the resources earmarked for 2004 and 2005 in 2003, which will be the busiest year.
I have to say, however - and I apologise to Parliament for this - that the new Eurobarometer statistics only reached me this morning because they were only published this morning, and that they are remarkably more encouraging than those I read out a few hours ago.
People usually present statistics to Parliament which are better than the reality, but, in this case, I had come with statistics which were actually less encouraging.
These new statistics reveal a radical change, which is due to the fact that the matter has been debated, that the press have brought the issue to the surface, with the result, for example, that 68% of German citizens are in favour and as many as 72% are in favour in France, the most Eurosceptic country.
This shows that, when problems arise, when a clear decision has to be made - 'yes' or 'no' - it would seem that the peoples of the countries realise that they are in a situation where they are deciding the course of history and are extremely aware of the importance of European Union affairs.
I would stress that we will analyse these statistics more thoroughly, for I only received them on a sheet of paper a few minutes ago and I would not like to mislead you.
In any case, they reveal that the people become more aware of the importance of European Union affairs above all when they are faced with a historic event.
Therefore, with all due reservations, considering that I am relying on a sheet of paper for information, I believe that this is a genuinely positive sign, for it means that we are working to change the course of history and we are working with the support of the citizens.
It is for this that I want, much more deeply and much more directly, to thank Parliament, the social partners and the great politicians who, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and, in some cases, even before these events, awoke in us this dream of a unified Europe.
In conclusion, bearing in mind the incentives we have regarding some of our neighbours such as Ukraine, it is clear that, while we now have the great task of completing this enlargement, we must also open the debate on Europe's borders, on its roots, on all these issues.
I remember talking about this the first time I spoke before this House.
It is not, of course, a debate which can be held today or tomorrow, but, clearly, enlargement raises the issues of our identity, our roots, our history and, by extension, our future.
Mr President, I wish to answer briefly the questions that have been put to me directly, starting with the weaknesses to which the regular reports have drawn attention.
I want to reiterate very clearly that we have been tasked with producing regular reports only on the future member states.
I do not know what would emerge if we were to write regular reports on the current Member States, applying the same yardsticks and using the same instruments.
Do you think we would come to the conclusion that there was no corruption anywhere?
Do you think we would come to the conclusion that privatisation was carried out in a transparent manner everywhere?
Do you think we would come to the conclusion that concentration in the media had no adverse effects on the free expression of opinion?
Or do you believe that I could not show you, in any city in any of our Member States, a district in which people live in the same degradation that one finds in a settlement of Roma in Slovakia, Bulgaria or Romania?
I just think that consideration of the social reality in our own societies gives us no reason to feel superior.
The mere fact that there are no reports on progress in the Member States does not in the least mean that they must in every respect be superior to the countries that now want to join us.
This question demands of us that we keep our feet on the ground to some degree and be fair in passing judgment.
Nor do I believe that it might be possible for a member of the Commission to call on the head of a Member State's government to join with him in seeking out the worst civil and social blackspots and to announce to the nation's media that he is ashamed of these conditions and that he will do away with them.
As to whether any head of a Member State's government can be found willing to do that, I have serious doubts.
If I may turn to the monitoring of the safeguards, the monitoring instruments are many and varied, and they will all continue to be applied.
It is of course the final monitoring report six months prior to accession that is crucial.
The political pressure alone that this report will exert will be so strong that we really can safely assume that the remaining deficits will be dealt with by then.
The situation as regards the safeguards is that I have told both the Council and, as recently as last week, the Dutch Government, that the new instrument on safeguards, which we are proposing, must be of limited duration.
The point must come when, again, it is the Treaty's ordinary instruments, rather than derogations, that take effect.
The two-year period that the Commission has proposed does not yet, however, exhaust the possibilities offered by the law.
Perhaps I have expressed that in rather complicated terms, so, to put it another way, there is still a certain amount of room to manoeuvre as regards the timeframe, and the Commission has no objection to the Council making full use of it.
I would, though, like to say quite definitely, that the instrument as a whole will be of no use if complicated procedures have to be involved and we need such things as unanimous Council resolutions in order for it to be applied.
In that case, we can forget it.
(Applause)
And, in that case, we will not need it.
Putting it bluntly, this is about having something that enables us to deal with smaller problems very quickly and not always having to set in motion the big weapon of infringement proceedings.
If, then, the products of a slaughterhouse in one of the countries are below standard, we have to be able to close the place down the next day.
By that I mean the very next day, and not only after the Council has come up with a unanimous resolution on the subject!
It is simple, practical things like this that are at issue, and the European public will not be mollified if we have to tell them that such an instrument can only be applied if it has gone through a procedure lasting for months.
Let me say this in all frankness: nothing is any use unless it can be put into action quickly and decisively.
Passing on to the matter of scope, the concept of the internal market applies to everything that has economic effects across borders, or to everything that has an effect on competition.
The honourable lady did indeed ask whether environmental and social matters might be included here, but I have my doubts as to how that might be justified.
If we find somewhere where the environmental acquis is not being fully transposed, I do not know why we should have, in the candidate countries, a fast-acting instrument whilst having to use normal infringement proceedings as regards the present Member States.
There are now thousands of infringement proceedings every year, so it is not the case that the problem of non-transposition of the acquis in the present EU does not exist.
I think, then, that I would have difficulties with us actually restricting this instrument to the internal market.
Apart from that, there are safeguard clauses in every imaginable policy area of the European Union, food safety being one example.
The safeguard clauses that already exist will continue to do so, and they will, of course, be applied.
Let me end with a brief comment on Kaliningrad.
What very much worries me about this whole debate, is the fact that the Russians have not, to date, been prepared to talk about the real problem.
I do not believe that the issues of access, visas and transit constitute the real problem and agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Brok and others have said. Looking at the conditions on this border, you cannot actually believe that easier access is the real issue.
I think the real problem is how to conduct a policy that prevents Kaliningrad from remaining socially and economically backward in a region that is developing very rapidly - which this region will do.
The inevitable consequence of that will be the growth of economic and, eventually, political tensions.
Everyone in this Chamber is capable of imagining how political tensions can vent themselves in a geographical situation like this one.
That is precisely what has to be avoided, and we will do it by engaging in a dialogue with Russia on how we can give Kaliningrad a share in the benefits that European integration offers to the Baltic region as a whole.
I hope that, when this vexatious issue of visas and transit is sorted out - which I believe it will be in a matter of days - the way will be open for us to discuss this question, which is of such importance to the future of Europe.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, that brings us to the end of this very important and interesting debate on the forthcoming European Council.
The sitting is now suspended until voting time.
Mr President, on a point of order, you may be aware that a number of Members were unable to take part in votes yesterday because they were delayed for seven hours at Gatwick airport.
You yourself will have experienced some of the extreme difficulties faced by many Members in travelling to Strasbourg.
In view of the approaching enlargement, are you satisfied that Parliament here in Strasbourg is adequately equipped for the needs of enlargement, given that Members and staff find it very difficult to get here from one of Europe's largest airports?
Are you confident that those coming from parts of Europe where the transport links are not so good will be able to travel to Strasbourg?
Is it not time you joined the growing number of people who think that Strasbourg is an inefficient and inappropriate place to host a Parliament of this size?
I urge you to look into this as a matter of urgency.
(Mixed reactions)
I do not wish to run the risk of indigestion before lunch today.
Yesterday I had the pleasure to welcome a group of visitors from Lapland, hosted by your colleague, Mrs Kauppi.
The Governor of Lapland remarked how easy it was to get from Lapland to Strasbourg.
She was very pleased to be here in such a short time.
I, however, have experienced the difficulties which you mention.
(Laughter and applause)
Yesterday I wrote yet again to the relevant airline authorities - to some effect I hope - about your predicament, and to say that this is no way to do business.
This is especially true for connections to Strasbourg, a city with an international vocation.
Mr President, a number of members will be wondering whether, as rapporteur, I will be seeking to refer this matter back to committee.
The committee was concerned that the Commission's strategy document was rather vague in terms of the action to be taken in the health and safety field.
I can now tell the House that, in a meeting with Commissioner Diamantopoulou yesterday and during the debate last night, I received assurances that the Commissioner will come to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to detail the action to be taken and that a report will be presented on an annual basis to facilitate the monitoring of progress by the committee.
On that basis, I recommended to the committee coordinators, at a meeting this morning, that we should proceed with the vote and not refer back.
The coordinators agreed, and I therefore recommend that we proceed with the vote.
Mr President, I wish to return to a subject I raised in the debates yesterday.
In fact Vice-President Imbeni advised me to mention it again now while we are voting on Mr Brok's report.
I should like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the fact that we are also voting on Parliament's right to obtain the approval of Parliament's Bureau regarding internal security measures, in connection with the agreement on secret security policy documents.
There are some very problematic points in these security measures.
For example, the national security services must find that Members of Parliament involved in examining secret documents are trustworthy.
Mr President, as you are personally responsible for these arrangements, I should like to ask why no debate was organised in Parliament on these security measures in connection with Mr Brok's report and how it is intended to organise this sort of check.
In my opinion it is something of a scandal that we are attempting to vote on this without any kind of debate, on the quiet, as it were.
The Bureau tabled a proposal for decision to plenary.
It is indicated in today's voting list.
It follows on from the debate that has been ongoing for some time now in Parliament, regarding access to sensitive documents.
It also reflects the request from the House in an earlier report asking the Bureau to draw up a proposal to bring to Plenary.
So the Bureau tabled this proposal on the basis of debates and votes in the House.
The proposal was discussed in the Bureau some time ago.
On more than one occasion it was presented by the rapporteur, Mr Brok, to the Conference of Presidents.
All the groups - including your own - participate in the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents.
You cannot be surprised, therefore, that this was coming.
No objections were raised when this item was included in the agenda.
I note the point you made last night and again just now.
I can assure you that this matter has been considered very carefully and was put to the relevant bodies in the House some time ago.
It is not an attempt to twist colleagues' arms at the eleventh hour.
I can assure you that there has been considerable debate and reflection in many meetings, both of the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Proposal for a decision (B5-0526/2002) tabled by the Bureau pursuant to point 1 of Annex VII to the Rules of Procedure, on the implementation of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing European Parliament access to sensitive Council information in the sphere of security and defence policy
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Report (A5-0308/2002) by Hans-Peter Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of the provisions of Parliament's Rules of Procedure concerning the discharge procedure (2001/2060/(REG))
Before the vote:
Mr President, in order to accommodate the strongly expressed wishes of part of the PPE-DE Group, my group withdraws its request for a separate vote on Amendment 3, which should enable you then to take all the amendments en bloc.
Mr President, I simply wanted to thank the Group of the Party of European Socialists for this gesture.
I believe that we have reached a compromise, that this compromise makes up a whole, that some of the members of the Group of the European People's Party are not entirely satisfied by the compromise, but I think that we must move on.
I therefore strongly urge the members of my group to give their full support to the compromise that we have reached.
Mr President, at this late stage in voting time, it is exasperating to have to point out that the House is incapable of applying the decisions that it takes.
We decided to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights the Alpha and the Omega of our work.
Within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, as custodian of the Rules of Procedure, I was obliged to table a number of linguistic amendments which should have been dealt with in an erratum.
These linguistic amendments included a number which, in my view, are not strictly linguistic, since they relate to the Portuguese, Italian, French and Greek versions.
They are seeking to replace the expression 'human rights' with the expression 'rights of the individual'.
To my great regret, in the erratum, this so-called linguistic amendment is not taken into account.
I am aware that at the Conference of Presidents, you consulted the legal services to find out which expression the House should use.
I hope that the House is capable of deciding by itself that the Charter should be applied in this Parliament.
Mrs BerÃšs, I shall raise the issue and seek the advice of the legal services at the Conference of Presidents, so that each group can give its opinion when the time comes.
It would be very simple to inform all the Member States of the European Union of the 'occurrences' (incidents, near miss situations etc.) in European civil aviation, something that is not done at present.
Nevertheless, although the report wants these events to be recorded and communicated to the States, it also demands that the 'confidentiality' of the information on these occurrences be guaranteed.
Who can benefit from this confidentiality, however, and what purpose can it serve, other than to conceal the real situation from those living near to airports, from users and air transport staff, other than to safeguard the commercial and financial interests of airlines?
Instead of this, we need the greatest transparency and, primarily, complete transparency with respect to the populations, as this is the only way of revising the entire chain of responsibilities in the 'occurrences' in question.
We must be able to go right to the top of this chain of responsibility, in other words to find those directly and ultimately responsible, namely the airlines and the airport management companies.
We are therefore abstaining on this report.
. (PT) In line with the Community instruments adopted recently to increase safety in civil aviation, the Parliament and Council proposal for a directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation aims to guarantee the reporting of any situation specifically endangering an aircraft or its occupants.
The data that is collected will facilitate information sharing, enabling lessons to be learnt in order to prevent accidents.
I congratulate Mr Collins on the excellent report that he has drafted on this matter, which I fully support, in particular on the issue of confidentiality in the mandatory reporting of incidents, the only way of ensuring that human error is revealed in the potential occurrence of accidents, which rarely comes to light spontaneously, unlike technical faults, for example.
I also wish to highlight the need to support the creation of reporting systems on a regional basis that would be linked to the integrated network of national incident reporting systems, thereby providing an entire region with information about various situations.
. (PT) The creation of information-sharing systems from various civil aviation authorities' reporting systems will enable all the actors involved to collate information about their errors and to produce a safer system for all air transport users.
This directive is extremely important because it significantly improves the effectiveness of the occurrence reporting system.
The fact that a large number of amendments tabled at first reading have been adopted by the Council in its common position is also to be welcomed.
Nevertheless, differences remain on which I have supported the positions of the rapporteur, which were supported, incidentally, by the specialised committee: on the one hand, when an incident that is reported is due to gross negligence, the Member States must be able to take legal action; on the other, what was Article 9 in the version originally proposed by the Commission, dealing with confidential reporting, must be maintained because the 'disidentification ' of reporting in this area is often crucial to a better understanding of the factors that can influence the occurrence of air accidents.
. (PT) The disturbing rates of accidents at work of self-employed people and the need to ensure the right to working conditions which respect health, safety and dignity required precisely this approach, which is why I have supported the excellent report by Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez.
Despite being inadequate, the Commission proposal makes a major contribution to resolving the problem of protecting self-employed workers with regard to health and safety at work.
It should be noted that it is in the sectors considered to be high-risk, such as agriculture, fishing, road haulage, the processing industry and construction, in which a high number of self-employed workers is concentrated, that a high rate of accidents at work occurs.
It is therefore crucial that an effective prevention policy is implemented, followed up by actions for training and information and by awareness-raising campaigns.
Against a backdrop of increasing professional mobility, it is crucial that Community measures are adopted to harmonise the various levels of protection for self-employed workers in each Member State, in addition to the recognition and implementation of legislation in this field.
I should like to take the opportunity of this debate and the vote on the Hughes report on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006, which contains some good points, to raise the question of the Commission's negligence when it comes to applying health and safety at work regulations.
My country, Greece, has a macabre sort of efficiency when it comes to large numbers of accidents at work and small numbers of inspections, and inefficient inspections at that.
Despite repeated questions to the Commission from me and other honourable Members, the Commission has been waiting to examine statistics from Greece for the last five years.
We need to put a stop to this and to provide mechanisms to monitor the application of health and safety regulations, especially in the workplace.
We cannot monitor, issue warnings and impose sanctions for public deficits and turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to health and safety.
. (PT) Community data on health and safety at work reveal a general trend towards improvement.
The situation remains quite critical, however, in some Member States.
In this connection I would state that the situation in Portugal is cause for concern, especially in sectors such as construction, the textile industry and agriculture.
I have voted in favour of this report, and I wish to highlight the following points:
The need to codify and simplify current Community legislation in this field and to encourage the Member States to apply this more rigorously;
The Commission must, as a matter of urgency and together with Parliament, draw up a detailed action plan, including financial commitments and timetables, incorporating the gender dimension and new types of risks and illnesses;
The need to encourage working within partnerships in order to facilitate better data collection and communication between the various actors involved;
The incorporation of the candidate countries into the institutions and bodies concerned in order to be able to provide effective technical and financial assistance;
Lastly, the importance of a preventive approach to the aspects of health and safety at work, targeting both workers and employers.
This report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no amendments to the report.
The British Delegation of the EPP-ED Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support.
The new rule, however, leaves no option but to vote against certain reports.
The British Conservatives support the Commission document on Health and Safety at Work, which talks of the importance of health and safety at work and the need to strengthen the prevention culture and secure a better application of existing law.
The Commission admits that people tend to see the Community legal framework as being excessively complex and unclear and proposes that it be simplified.
The British Conservatives support this.
However, the rapporteur has gone in precisely the opposite direction, proposing extension of the scope of the framework directive, new legislation on workplace bullying, a new directive on workplace ergonomics, strengthening of the display screen equipment directive and amendment of the manual handling directive.
A fundamental flaw in his analysis leads us to conclude that the rapporteur's conclusions are wrong.
The British Conservatives are therefore against this report.
The report deals with working-environment problems at workplaces in the EU and expresses concern that the situation is deteriorating instead of improving.
The rapporteur proposes a long list of measures, including better application of the existing legislation in the area.
This proposal has our full support.
He also calls for new legislation regarding workplace harassment, on the one hand, and requirements for workplace ergonomics on the other.
We oppose regulation by directives, both on principle and for practical reasons.
Existing directives on the working environment are not working well, principally because employers oppose them and because trade unions are too weak, and often set minimum levels that tend to commit the social partners to agreements affording levels of protection which are far too low.
If, on the other hand, we had strong trade unions, and national governments with social ambitions, we could bring in legislation at national level which was more precise, afforded higher levels of protection and could be implemented more effectively.
We have voted in favour of the report, however, as we agree with its political ambition of improving working conditions in the Member States.
. (PT) This report, which we have adopted, addresses an issue of enormous importance in the European Union, both due to its importance in dignifying work and in creating better working conditions, and because of the scant attention that the Commission has paid to this issue of health and safety at work, clearly reflected in the drastic reduction in staff attending to these issues by over 40% in the last ten years, as the report states.
The final text, which is the outcome of an extremely thorough debate to which we contributed various proposals, addresses various aspects of this issue and makes certain demands, specifically:
The urgent drawing up of a detailed action plan containing financial and timing commitments for each main proposal;
Special attention to be paid to the gender dimension, taking into consideration the discrimination still suffered by women, due both to less attention being paid to vocational training or difficulties in access to employment, and to the difficult, dangerous and poorly remunerated work that women often perform;
To propose a comprehensive Directive on workplace ergonomics in order to improve the existing directives and to take account of musculo-skeletal problems, which are suffered by over half the people affected by work-related complaints in the EU.
When Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, regarding public access to information about the EU institutions, was negotiated, it was decided that the European Parliament's access to sensitive documents should be covered by a separate Interinstitutional Agreement between Parliament and the Council to enable the European Parliament to honour its commitments under Article 21 EC of the Treaty on European Union.
All the agreements which are made between the Council and Parliament must, however, observe the fundamental principles of loyalty and the obligation for the institutions to make information mutually available.
In other words, it is not fair for the Council to take decisions on the internal working procedures of Parliament, thereby arranging the institutions in a clear hierarchy.
There is also a risk of information being withheld from small countries and small political groups.
The agreement limits the right conferred on all members - and the public - by Regulation No 1049, in that it creates a group which has special access to information.
An interinstitutional agreement in this sensitive area should be combined with strict confidentiality rules (compatible with those of NATO).
Rules like these could have been drawn up for documents concerning external security without this resulting in any change in the interinstitutional structure.
The rapporteur calls for the right, for the European Parliament, to have access to documents on security and defence that are classified as 'confidential', 'secret' or 'top secret' whilst pointing out that 'public access may be refused' to these documents, which are therefore kept from the people of the European Union, whereas the latter claims to ensure their defence and their security.
This only serves to highlight the derisory nature of this claim and the hypocrisy of the European institutions which never fail to take an opportunity to boast about the so-called 'transparency' of their work.
As for knowing whether the agreement between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament (which, in any case, excludes 'top secret' documents) would even enable a few hand-picked Members to have access to other documents on security and defence, the rapporteur states that 'the manner in which this Agreement is used in practice will be decisive'.
Clearly, for security and defence issues, as for all other subjects considered to be of some importance by the Council and the Commission, these two institutions only provide the European Parliament with as much information as they wish.
This will only come as a surprise to those who believe that the European Parliament has a role other than that of offering a 'democratic' smokescreen to policies which are dictated by the interests of the ruling classes and are completely unmonitored.
We shall vote against this report and the accompanying proposal for a decision.
. (NL) There was a time when the preparation and implementation of government policy was kept secret as far as possible, as the ordinary man in the street did not need to know how and with what arguments they were governed.
This objective of secrecy has even survived the introduction of universal suffrage.
These days, however, it is assumed that every individual is equal in the eyes of the law, that authorities are accountable to their electorate and that, with regard to government policy, there is public access to information. However, traditional secrecy strikes again in the case of public security, defence and military matters.
This could be justified in the short term if the majority of the population is being threatened by a dangerous minority of profiteers who want to abolish their constitutional rights.
On the other hand, secrecy can also protect powerful profiteers from popular anger.
The solution opted for, namely a voluntary agreement between Parliament and the Council, seems more appealing than it really is.
The public does not have a right of perusal, whilst Parliament does, albeit restricted to four members jointly appointed by the group chairmen, presided over by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
In practice, the vast majority of MEPs, and even entire parliamentary groups, will be kept in the dark.
Such a committee on security affairs thus only serves to protect secrecy.
. (PT) I heartily congratulate the rapporteur on his work and I also welcome the fact that rules enshrining a major advance in the functioning of the Community institutions and in their political transparency are now clearly written down, even in areas as sensitive as security and defence.
Today's final steps are the culmination of a long, painstaking and arduous process of political weighting and interinstitutional negotiation, which has led to a very positive and balanced result.
What was really needed was to achieve a reasonable and fair balance between on the one hand, the necessary transparency and, on the other, the essential caution required by the highly secretive nature of this type of information.
Without this balance, no progress would be possible in this sensitive area.
As a result of the practical solutions that have been found, of the good sense that has prevailed and of rigorous political weighting, Parliament, the citizens in general and all the Community institutions deserve our applause.
We have today voted against the draft Interinstitutional Agreement concerning access by Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy.
The main reason for this is that we consider the proposed committee, which is to consist of only four members, to be an overly small circle.
The opportunity for smaller countries, or smaller political groups, to be represented would therefore be minimal.
Their information deficit would increase.
On order to achieve increased openness and equality, there should moreover be more permanent members on the committee, and at the same time a given number of members should be able to be elected in accordance with the procedure laid down in the draft agreement.
. (PT) I believe that we have made good progress in relation to the previous system, which created frequent problems and confusion.
The new system, established by this revision of Annex V of the Rules of Procedure, is undoubtedly clearer and more efficient.
Nevertheless, I regret the fact that Mrs Theato's proposals for amendments, tabled by the PPE-DE Group, have been withdrawn, because I feel that the position of the rapporteur and the majority of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - which would ultimately prevail in plenary too - might be going rather too far by accepting, at first reading in April, the possibility that discharge might tacitly be granted simply as an indirect result of a motion for a postponement not being adopted.
Mr President, I asked at the very last minute to give an explanation of vote on both the MÃŒller and GrossetÃªte reports.
We supported Amendment 78, since it is pro-generic in principle.
It would ideally refer to line extension rather than abridged application, but the principle allows for the sale of generics in more than one country without repeating application procedures.
In the GrossetÃªte report, on Amendment 63, we voted to be consistent with our approach in committee.
On the second part of Amendment 113, it was put to us that the word advertising was open to misinterpretation.
. (PT) The definition of an internal market for medicinal products must not only achieve better standards of health in the European Union but must also stimulate scientific and technological innovation with a view to the development of new medicines and to speeding up the manufacture and commercialisation of generic products.
On the main issues being debated at this first reading I feel that: 1- without this meaning the total elimination of the decentralised procedure (national with mutual recognition), I believe it is crucial, where the marketing authorisation is concerned, to demonstrate increasing commitment to the centralised procedure (via the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products), in particular when it comes to new active substances, in the aim of achieving more rapid access for sufferers to new medicines and in the aim of ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises are not penalised; 2- authorisation must be granted for the marketing of generic products whose reference medicine has been authorised for more than eight years in a Member State or in the Community (and not ten years, as the Commission proposes); 3- with regard to information, the Commission proposal is ambiguous, whereas it is crucial to ensure the ban on direct advertising.
. (PT) This proposal for a regulation is extremely important, because it is intended to ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health by means of more rigorous procedures for vigilance of the market and for pharmacovigilance, in order to increase the number of medicinal products available, to complete the internal market in pharmaceutical products and, lastly, to amend the aims and working methods of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in the prospect of the enlargement of the EU.
Where I disagree is neither on these great aims nor on every patient's wish to have more rapid access, at Community level, to medicinal products containing new, safer and more effective active substances, but on certain specific details of the regulation, as demonstrated in the way I voted on this matter.
In particular, with regard to the key issue of the extent to which the authorisation of medicinal products medicines should or should not be completely centralised in the EAEMP, I wish to state that I, like the majority established in the specialised parliamentary committee, am in favour of medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance being able to receive authorisation from the national agencies. I therefore oppose greater centralisation, which would be disastrous.
In other words, I advocate the option of choosing between a centralised procedure and national authorisation, possibly accompanied by a procedure of mutual recognition.
. (NL) Medicines are commodities that earn money.
This is why the assessment of their use stirs up so much emotion.
Competing companies and competing methods benefit from legislation that results in companies selling as many of their own products as possible, thus pushing other products out of the market.
They want over-consumption of their own products and the exclusion of alternatives.
Unlike the Commission, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy opposes public advertising for medicines against AIDS, asthma and diabetes, and rightly so.
Producers and users of alternative medicines, including doctors who prefer these products, fear that the proposed rules will, above all, benefit the chemical industry to the detriment of natural products.
Some of these natural products are centuries-old remedies that work well according to their users, but whose effectiveness has never been scientifically proven.
As long as they are not harmful and their composition is known, they deserve to be given the benefit of the doubt.
Harmful and improper products that are only produced to make money should be banned, but there is no reason for granting the pharmaceutical industry a monopoly position.
I therefore vote against the industry's proposals and in favour of those that are advocated by groups of doctors and users.
We have chosen to support the amendments which make it easier for generic medicinal products, that is to say, cheaper imitations, to be placed on the market more quickly, thus forcing down constantly rising drug expenses. In Sweden, for example, these rose by 10 % each year during the 1990s.
The registration procedure for generic medicinal products needs to be simplified, so that it is possible to place generic medicinal products on the market directly upon expiry of the ten-year period following initial authorisation of the reference medicinal product.
The manufacture of the generic medicinal products should therefore be able to begin before expiry of the above-mentioned ten-year period.
Therefore, we also voted against the amendments which obstruct the placing on the market of generic medicinal products by protecting small changes in the original medicine.
We are also determined in our view that the present ban on advertising of medicinal products directly to the public must be maintained.
Patients require reliable information from an independent source.
On behalf of the British Labour Delegation, I would like to explain that with regard to the proposals in the GrossetÃªte report concerning veterinary medicines, we believe that the Commission should accept the current practice in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
This allows registered personnel to administer a range of animal medicines without a veterinary prescription in cases where veterinary involvement is not considered necessary for safe and effective use.
This has worked effectively for many years and has not led to any safety concerns in relation to consumers or users of such medicines.
We also believe that the re-validation of all such medicines should be set at five-yearly intervals, rather than given indefinite authorisation.
We do not support the Commission's view that all new active substances for veterinary medicinal products should be authorised under the centralised procedure.
This would significantly impact on the development of new products for localised species/conditions and would exacerbate problems of availability of such medicines.
Flexibility must therefore be maintained.
Mr President, the pensioners which I have the pleasure of representing in the European Parliament tell me that they are very pleased that I have voted - as I did - for this text, for I feel it is important and am waiting impatiently for Europe to have either a Constitution or a founding Charter with the status of a Constitution to which they can all appeal in order to call for justice whenever they are the victims of an injustice.
I am sad to say that citizens throughout the States of the world are often victims of injustices, both as young and older people, but it is particularly distressing and upsetting for the elderly citizen to feel that he is still a victim of injustice.
The Charter states that the rights of elderly people are to be respected by Europe, and that is why pensioners and elderly people throughout Europe are waiting impatiently for the Charter to become the Constitution of the European Union.
Mr President, I have had a dream in which Mr Fatuzzo's daughter phoned up my son, who is also studying law, and asked him whether he approved of the way I voted on Mr Duff's report.
I am unable to give out his response to this, as I awoke with something of a shock.
I therefore want to make it perfectly clear that we voted in favour of the report even though I see some of the problems as being the other way around.
My primary difference of opinion with the rapporteur is that I believe that the possible problem of the supreme courts coming to divergent judgments in matters of basic rights has not been resolved.
As a former supreme court judge, I know what I am talking about.
Despite this, the institutionalisation of basic rights prevails, and so the vote has been in favour of the report as a whole.
Mr President, I welcome Mr Duff's report.
It important that we incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the existing European Union treaties, but I also hope that the European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into the EU as an institution and not simply into the legal systems of the individual Member States.
It is unthinkable to have a modern European Union constitution - which is what the Convention on the future of Europe is looking at - without a binding bill of rights.
If the Convention drafts such a constitution without the Charter it will, in my view, be a disgrace.
Far from giving more rights to the European Union institutions, the Charter limits the exercise of power by the EU institutions because they must explicitly respect human rights.
The Charter should be legally binding and enforceable under EU law.
It is not, as the rapporteur says, a substitute for the fundamental rights systems of the Member States but a complement to them.
It is unthinkable that the European Union should draw up a constitution without first drawing up a bill of rights, which is why the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be given constitutional status and incorporated into the European Union's constitutional texts by revising the Treaties of the European Union before new members join.
This will give the Charter a legal dimension, allowing it to be cited in both the European and national courts.
I agree here with the position of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs; I do not agree with the rapporteur's view that the Charter should remain unchanged.
On the contrary, it needs to be expanded and its scope widened, given that it is way behind almost every European constitution when it comes to supporting fundamental rights.
Two years ago, when we debated the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we described it as useless and dangerous, pointing out that it lagged way behind international conventions and the constitutions of several Member States of the ?U. We feared that it was destined to form the core of an imminent EU constitution which would pave the way for federalism.
Our fears are being confirmed.
The ?U is becoming more and more autocratic, thanks in part to so-called terrorism.
It is updating its armoury (European terrorism law, European arrest warrant, European army, European police force) so that it can deal with reactions to its policy.
As for the so-called social model, the workers know all about that, with jobs being slashed, unemployment portioned out, the welfare and pension system dismantled and health and education privatised.
Those who support the Charter, including the rapporteur, who feels it is in no need of correction, have totally ignored the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who have protested at every single summit against the anti-grass roots and pro-monopoly system being set up.
All they want is to exert pressure so that the Charter is incorporated into the Treaties and made binding on the institutions of the ?U and the Member States.
If it is, we shall have an even more conservative and autocratic institutional framework which will render the constitutionally protected rights acquired by the workers useless.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
We voted in favour of the report, as we support, in principle, the incorporation of the Charter in a future treaty (constitution).
Our approval should be seen in the light of the following aspects, however.
The report proposes measures to improve direct access to the Court of First Instance.
We interpret this wording as a right for individuals to plead directly before the EU Court of First Instance on the basis of the Charter's rights.
It would be an ill-fated measure which ran the risk of opening the floodgates to a legal review of practically all EU decisions (bearing in mind the extent of the Charter).
We would rather see a system like the one which characterises the current right to plead before the Court of Justice of the European Communities: the rights under the Charter are applied indirectly, via the right of the national courts to refer cases to the Court of Justice.
The report adopts a rigid stance on changes to the Charter's horizontal clauses.
We are of the opinion, however, that it is reasonable to accept changes even to the substance of the clauses, as we find it hard to see how the Charter could otherwise gain binding status and an application in law which works in practice.
We share the opinion of the Convention's working group on this.
By way of a general observation, we also wish to emphasise that a binding charter in all events must not undermine the model for collective agreements which is applied to the labour market in the Nordic countries.
The Duff report, which calls for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into a European constitution, was adopted by a broad majority in spite of our opposition.
If its conclusions are subsequently adopted, at the end of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, it could bring about counter-arguments at the heart of the European institutions, the negative effects of which could soon become apparent.
It turns out that, the day before yesterday, we discussed the pact on budgetary stability, and that ultimately, many speakers found, like Romano Prodi, that it is stupid because it is too inflexible.
Yet, what else could a Charter incorporated into the treaties be, other than the equivalent to a Stability Pact applied to political rights?
