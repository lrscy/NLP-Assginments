Whether their farms be large or small, ordinary farmers buying feedingstuffs cannot at present be reasonably expected to know what these contain.
They have no laboratories available to them and, given the way feedingstuffs look nowadays, they can glean no information about the content from either the appearance, smell or taste.
Farmers therefore need significantly more transparency and significantly more precise information.
I think that this proposal is too complicated and that, in the long term, we ought to be able to find common principles for food and feedingstuffs which are somewhat simpler and somewhat more comprehensible both to the farmer and the final consumer of the food, for example a declaration of contents in descending order of volume and precise information upon request. As the situation at present stands and in view of the fact that we are now at the beginning of this food safety process, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will nonetheless be voting in favour of this report.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and also express the support of my whole Group for his proposals.
Commissioner, we think that, although recently timid proposals have been made regarding the possibility of developing vegetable proteins, the Commission tends to insist that this is problematic on the basis of two arguments: the cost and agreements with the United States.
It is worth pointing out the close links between cereals and protein crops.
The budgetary impact of protein crops is derisory in comparison with that of cereals and, although the United States set out requirements for protein crops, this was in exchange for accepting the high level of support for export refunds on Community cereals.
That is to say, protein crops also suffer from the consequences of balances of the CAP, and their cultivation could develop more if support for respective production was balanced out.
Also, there should be due evaluation of the benefits of pulses for biological diversity and reducing the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, and their positive effects on soil preservation.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there are important reasons that we need to take into account: we are currently dependent on imports for 75% of our vegetable protein needs.
This is an unacceptable strategic weakness and means that we must accept genetically modified organisms in our food.
Ladies and gentlemen, we think that the Commission should begin the work of revising the Blair House agreements.
Mr President, I will say immediately that the Commission's position is unacceptable, from the point of view both of protecting farmers' incomes and of protecting consumers' health.
Clearly there is no wish to call into question the Blair House agreements, which reduce the amount of Community land available.
We are in an odd situation, on the one hand, the ban on the use of animal meal to feed production animals too has increased the requirement for plant protein; on the other hand, as of the next growing year, there is to be a sharp reduction in the amount of protein crops being grown.
We feel that these crop productions must be guaranteed to protect the farmers and oilseed producers.
The Commission needs to present a comprehensive report on the effect of the Agenda 2000 decisions on the management of the land dedicated to oilseed crops in the different production areas of the Community, and a proposal regulating the labelling of feedingstuffs containing GMOs.
We feel that sufficient incentives must be provided for the production of plant proteins in the interests of the environment, of the meat consumer, who has to be able to trust the Community production chain, and of the oilseed production chain, which has made specialised investments and which is in danger of a sharp fall in employment.
It is worrying that the Commission says it considers that it makes more economic sense to increase imports of soya meal.
In this case, the economy is in open conflict with the interests of the Community agricultural sector and, in particular, with safeguarding the health and confidence of the citizen, which is not economically quantifiable.
Yesterday, Parliament adopted an amendment which reads: "Health should not be considered as a commodity, which can be the subject of political or financial compromises" .
Today, the Commission has told us that this is not so.
Mr President, Commissioners, the European Parliament this week is not a million miles removed from the government of Rameses II, the pharaoh who, in antiquity, refused to let the Jewish people leave Egypt.
I can imagine that, in the cabinet of that pharaoh, the plagues affecting the country were discussed on a daily basis, much like here in Strasbourg this week, where first foot-and-mouth disease was discussed, and now the effects of BSE are on this morning' s agenda.
Of course, Europe is not holding a people against its will, but we cannot simply skim over the plagues which are hitting our agriculture.
We need to take stock of our agricultural policy and reconsider the standards on which the policy is based.
I have stated in the foot-and-mouth debate that animals, as God' s creatures, are more than production units.
I repeat this statement in the light of the fact that we have fed herbivores, in other words plant eaters, their own species.
We have turned them into cannibals.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf was right to comment in his report that farmers are entitled to accurate information on the ingredients in cattle feed.
The Council wants to leave the labelling to the feedingstuffs industry.
Meanwhile, he suggests that farmers, upon request, are entitled to comprehensive information from the industry.
That is completely ambiguous, if the farmer is entitled to comprehensive feedingstuffs information, it is only logical that this information should reach him without any obstacles.
'From stable to table' is translated freely into Dutch as 'from farmer to plate' .
In that translation, the liability for the food process is emphatically placed with the farmer.
In order to be able to bear that liability, the farmer must be able to avail himself - without any beating about the bush - of information on the cattle feed which he feeds his animals.
The ban on the use of meat meal in cattle feed, which has been in place since December 2000, leads to a shortage in the protein supply in cattle feed.
Alternatives for animal protein include soybean and other oilseed crops rich in protein.
In the findings of research into alternatives, which Commissioner Fischler outlined here this morning, the recommendation is made that soybean should be imported from the global market.
Other alternatives are being described as too expensive and leading to distortion.
A real problem with the import of soybean is the fact that we have no insight into the production method.
I very much doubt whether we are really better off if we feed our animals genetically modified soybean instead of meat meal.
The BSE crisis poses new dilemmas.
The excuse that the European Union should not extend its acreage of oilseed crops due to WTO agreements is untenable.
All the more reason for abandoning these WTO rules.
I regret the ease with which the Commission rejects the growing of oilseed and protein-rich crops on fallow agricultural land.
It is clear that the reason for leaving land untilled is in order to reduce the production of cereals, among other things.
Less clear, however, is why the production of protein has to be reduced too in the light of an increase in demand on the European market.
Mr President, the Union' s vegetable protein deficit has been growing over the years, to reach 35 million tonnes in 2000.
In the last few months, with the BSE crisis and the ban on animal meal, it has been increasing at 300 000 tonnes a month.
So what does the Commission propose in the face of this?
It proposes to take no particular initiative but to go to the great world supermarket for agricultural surpluses and buy the proteins we need as cheaply as possible.
Well, I can see at least three reasons for rejecting such a spirit of resignation and surrender.
The first is that it puts food safety at risk.
It is vital to strive for self-sufficiency in such an important product.
The second lies in the environmental advantages of oil- and protein-rich plants: bio-diversity, crop rotation, nitrogen balance.
The third is the need to respond to consumer demand for more traceability and visibility.
And we have the means: support for bio-fuels, the safety net for oil-rich crops, supplementary aid for protein-rich crops, intensification of the public research effort and agri-environmental aid for farms which include leguminous fodder in their rotation.
Mr President, those are the committed and responsible attitudes I would like to see the Commission taking, instead of restricting itself to recommending imports of cracked soya from America or Argentina on very short term commercial grounds.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, European agriculture is in a state of crisis as a result of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease.
That we need measures to overcome this crisis as quickly as possible is nothing new.
Opinion is divided only on the question of which measures to take.
The starting point is the ban on meat and bone meal in feedingstuffs.
This ban is necessary as we have a crisis of confidence on our hands.
Mind you, we are not only dealing with a systemic crisis in the sector but with the need for confidence-building measures in favour of consumers.
The ban on meat and bone meal in feedingstuffs is a measure which will restore consumer confidence.
There must also be a European protein plan to wean Europe off imports from third countries because these imports contain genetically modified soya.
We must find a model which enables European farmers to react to these new requirements.
I also feel this complex problem is connected with the WTO.
The Commission proposal, however, to allow organic farmers only to plant legumes does not go anywhere near far enough.
I therefore support the line taken by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that planting can also be permitted on set-aside land of farmers who adopt environmental measures on the basis of Regulation (EEC) No 1257/00.
If we talk of confidence-building measures, then we must stand up for an open declaration and for a positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs.
I believe that being honest with consumers can get us out of this crisis and take account of the dramatic situation of farmers and the threat to very many livelihoods.
I am also hoping for support from the feedingstuffs industry to make an open declaration of feed materials. If such a statement truly reflects what is in feed materials, surely this cannot be a problem for the industry.
Thank you, Mrs Schierhuber.
I am going to give the floor to Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos. I am glad to see her back here with us and congratulate her on behalf of Parliament on recently becoming a mother.
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the communication on vegetable protein production, I join in what has been said by my colleagues in this House.
The Commission' s study is disappointing, as it is not very ambitious and is based on exclusively economic criteria.
The European Union' s situation with regard to its deficit of vegetable proteins, due to the Blair House agreements, in which we agreed to a reduction in our vegetable protein production while in the mean time we were feeding our livestock on meat meal from dead animals, required that the Commission take a more ambitious and broader approach to this study.
It does not take into account, as has already been said, the strategic significance for European livestock breeding of being dependent on imports from third countries for the supply of vegetable proteins, and of the fact that those imports consist almost exclusively of genetically modified food.
Nor does it take into account what it would mean to increase these crops that are rich in vegetable proteins in order to re-establish the balance and capacity to supply of the whole of the European Union, which would undoubtedly be very beneficial for achieving more extensive and better quality livestock.
In short, the study does not take into account any of the elements on which our agricultural policy should be based: food quality, protection and development of the environment and sustainable development, because neither is there any element in the study that tells us what an increase in these crops would mean in terms of creating another economic activity in agriculture, and in terms of the farmers themselves using them and processing them into food for their livestock, which would also mean a considerable increase in income in the rural economy.
In any event, what the Commission is telling us about it being better to continue importing and depending on third countries because it is cheaper is not correct.
We have experience of the cheapest thing not being the best thing.
Mr President, members of the Commission, the European Parliament in the second reading is revising its amendment regarding the declaration of the materials in compound feedingstuffs in terms of percentage by weight, while the common position proposes a declaration within certain brackets.
From the point of view of producers, Parliament' s objective is to be supported.
The more precise information there is on the content of feed the better.
We must remember that this practice of declaration is not in itself important for the security of feedingstuffs.
It is more important that all feed materials in compound feedingstuffs should be named in the declaration and that the feed materials meet with the requirements under the legislation on animal feedingstuffs.
I think we should achieve a rational result quickly, as the new legislation is necessary.
We must therefore move forward flexibly in the legislative conciliation process, bearing in mind that the second stage will be monitoring the legislation.
It will be expensive and in some ways impossible to start asking feedingstuffs manufacturers to ensure that each sack of feed should exactly correspond to the amount written on the declaration regarding percentages or that this should be monitored by the authorities. The most important aspect of this legislation is that we should invest in monitoring to a greater extent than is the case now.
Safety will only be guaranteed if the acts are complied with.
As for the idea in Amendment No 4 of a positive list, there too it has to be borne in mind that it would be a very arduous task of administration if all feed materials used in EU countries had to be compiled in one list.
There is already a list of prohibited materials in EC legislation and, in addition, there are general quality requirements for feed products.
In my opinion the matter should be discussed, but its benefits and drawbacks must be considered in precise detail.
Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report although I personally find it quite difficult to support in full.
My view is that the common position by the Commission is excellent.
Let me just go back to what Mr PesÃ€lÃ€ has just said: what is the real problem facing the food industry today?
It is usually fraud.
If we look back over the recent food scares, if we look at the problem of foot-and-mouth, it was a misuse of swill feeding; if we look at the problems of dioxin, there are sufficient measures there to prevent it.
It was the illegal use of an oil in a mixture.
Then there was sewage sludge which we had in one other Member State, and BSE which was all to do with changing temperatures.
But the legislation is present.
The first and primary position of this House is to guarantee that the Commission does everything it possibly can to ensure that the present legislation and the common position are put in place and enforced.
Therefore, I call upon the Commission, first of all, to promise us that the present legislation is enforced.
Turning now to the protein situation, Commissioner Fischler would not be surprised to hear that I would slightly disagree with his position on whether or not we grow our own proteins or import them.
But could he actually give me a guarantee: I understand that the European Union has regulations in place at the moment about the volume of GM crops allowed in and the percentage at present is - and I stand to be corrected on this - about 1% maximum of GM crops.
Could the Commission now guarantee that none of the soya entering the Union in current and future imports will exceed the 1% maximum?
The US has strict measures and regulations on imports.
We in the European Union must follow these regulations and ensure that we follow the same patterns.
. Mr President, Members of Parliament, today we have an opportunity to discuss another important food safety issue which is the labelling of compound feedingstuffs.
I appreciate the work which has been done by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf who is very committed to this issue.
The proposal in question has its origins in the legitimate expectations and demands of both the farming community and consumers.
This includes full transparency in giving livestock farmers details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs that they buy for their animals.
One of the lessons of the dioxin crisis was that there was often a lack of such information.
This is clearly not satisfactory.
This information should be available, not only to ensure transparency but also to assist in the traceability of products.
The labelling of compound feedingstuffs must be sufficiently accurate to allow the stock farmer to make an informed choice as to which feed to use and many of you have already made that point in your contributions.
I am satisfied that this objective is met in the Council's common position.
While it falls short of the Commission's original proposal of full and precise listing of the quantities of all ingredients, it nonetheless strikes an acceptable compromise.
In my opinion we have an excellent instrument for improving the existing labelling rules for animal feed.
The common position provides for all ingredients to be precisely named and for the quantities to be expressed in five percentage bands.
It also requires operators to notify the exact composition of the compound feedingstuff on the request of the stock farmer or any operator.
I would also like to remind you that, from the very beginning, there were difficulties in the Council in reaching an agreement.
A majority of Member States were opposed to the obligation to indicate on the label the precise composition of a given compound feedingstuff.
For this reason, the Commission accepted the French presidency's compromise which had the unanimous support of all the Member States.
I also consider that the common position provides us with a level of safety equivalent to that set out in the Commission's initial proposal.
The most important fact is the presence of an ingredient in the compound feedingstuff and not necessarily its exact quantity.
These exact quantities have a commercial value but they are not linked to health protection and that is the important issue in this consideration.
I would ask Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to reconsider seriously what he said earlier in his contribution that if there is not a change in the Council position in relation to this, he will be happy to see his entire proposal fall rather than compromise on this particular issue.
I believe I am correct in saying that the issue of public health and food safety is related to the presence rather than the quantity of what is contained in the compound feedingstuff.
We should focus on that and not lose the benefit of this important piece of legislation.
We risk pursuing a particular point to a degree of accuracy that is unnecessary and thus cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.
I am afraid that if the amendments which the Commission cannot accept are adopted, we will embark on a long and difficult conciliation procedure which will postpone the improvement.
I would also underline that the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading have been accepted in the common position except for the proposal that the Commission present a positive list of feed materials that may be used in animal feed.
This is inappropriate in the context of the labelling directive.
If you want a positive list, the first issue to be discussed is how to establish the criteria by which the positive list will be managed.
I therefore intend to launch a feasibility study on the criteria which could be used for managing the positive list and the resources which this would involve.
We can then report back to you, possibly with the proposal for legislation.
I do not expect this to be possible within the timetable mentioned in the amendment.
Unfortunately our resources and other priorities do not allow the Commission to set a more ambitious timetable.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to amend slightly an answer I gave to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on the question of foot-and-mouth disease the other day and correct the record.
The point he made was that the Commission had delayed in its response to the issues arising from the foot-and-mouth disease issue.
I responded by saying that the Commission had been notified on 20 February of the outbreak in the United Kingdom and that we had put forward proposals to the Commission the following day and that in my view that indicated a prompt rather than a delayed response.
There is one further piece of information that I should have added to this in fairness to the official working in my Directorate-General who by implication was criticised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
Mr van Goethem was told at 9.30 p.m. on 20 February and by 10.30 p.m. that night he had sent a fax to every single relevant minister in the Member States of the European Union.
I want to add that particular piece of information to the answer I gave the other day which included the fact that, on the following day, the issue was brought before the Commission promptly.
It may be an opportunity for Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to correct the suggestion he made about the delay, not for my sake but for the sake of the officials who work hard in my Directorate-General and who did an excellent job in this instance.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Your clarification will be noted in the Minutes.
Do you wish to speak again, Mr Fischler?
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to make this brief because I said what I had to say at the start of the debate.
I would like to thank you all very much for your committed contributions but I must also remind you that the task the Commission took on was to investigate the impact the ban on bone and animal meal in feedingstuffs would have on supply and demand.
It was not to examine the policy of oilseed production in the European Union.
These are two separate issues.
We must therefore separate the current additional protein deficit from the situation we already had in the Community.
It is a fact that approximately 30 million tonnes of soya and soya equivalents are imported every year.
It is not possible to make up for this deficit, at least using currently available options.
There is one thing we must not forget: soya beans cannot be planted throughout the Community, but only in regions with a favourable climate.
We cannot compensate for this on the basis of a policy of subsidies.
Secondly, I must remind you that the implementation of this policy is subject to the precondition that no distinction is made between promoting protein crops, cereals or other crops.
This is simply not possible, unless we offer appropriate compensation.
But what argument can we use to persuade the Americans to renounce the Blair House agreement if we have nothing to offer in return?
Please tell me what we can offer to make the Americans agree to our introducing a specific subsidy for protein crops to enable us to produce more proteins.
This brings me back to the current protein deficit.
The Commission is criticised for looking at things purely from an economic angle.
I must ask Parliament whether it is justifiable to pay six times as much in additional subsidies for a kilo of extra soya production than a kilo of soya would cost on the market.
There is no way round this issue, as we also have a responsibility to the taxpayer.
By way of conclusion, I would like to point out that the comments I have made here have nothing to do with the report we discussed yesterday evening.
Naturally, the Commission will continue to ensure that organic farmers will still be able to plant clover and clover grass and other protein crops on their set-aside land as we proposed.
I only mentioned that this morning because clover and clover grass have only been introduced to a limited extent in pigswill and poultry feed and are used primarily in feedingstuffs for ruminants.
. (DE) Mr President, I could refer to Article 122 but I would rather save time.
Mr Byrne, thank you for your comment and your answer.
Once again let me make myself clear.
It was not my intention to criticise you personally or Mr van Goethem, whom I respect for his good work. What is at issue is whether the Commission worked out a disease plan in consultation with the Member States which made clear what had to happen if the disease broke out.
My view is that not enough preparation was made.
My comment was not aimed at individuals but rather at the Commission, as an institution, and at the Council, which did not do any preparatory work at all. This mess, which we had to go through in the public gaze, was scandalous.
My criticism was also levelled at the culling strategy, which had not been properly thought out, and the fact that vaccination and vaccination plus assessment had not been incorporated into the strategy. This has now been conceded by the Commission, which is a step in the right direction.
Commissioner Fischler, I would like to put another question to you. Assuming, hypothetically speaking, that we did not have this agreement with the Americans and that you were to calculate the cost of planting beans, peas, lupins and so on on set-aside land, would the economic calculation be entirely different?
Am I right in thinking that it would?
Commission.
(DE) Mr President, I do not want to prolong the discussion.
I would simply like to make the following point clear. If we are dealing exclusively with planting protein crops on set-aside land, then I have to point out that this is not covered by the Blair House agreement but comes under the WTO provisions.
Accordingly, for a measure to come under the blue box arrangement, appropriate supply reduction measures would have to be adopted.
Our supply reduction measure is set aside. So it has nothing to do with the Blair House agreement.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Deadlock in negotiations on the EU/Morocco Fisheries Agreement
The next item is the Commission statement on the deadlock in negotiations on the fishing agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco.
Mr Fischler has the floor.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the issue of the Morocco Fisheries Agreement, I have been very committed from the outset, that is, since I assumed responsibility for the fisheries sector.
Before the previous agreement came to an end, I made contact with Morocco with a view to concluding a new fisheries agreement.
However, that was roundly rejected by Morocco for many months. Concrete talks of a new agreement only became possible following a meeting with King Mohammed VI in Casablanca in October last year.
Since then, seven political rounds of talks and thirteen technical rounds of talks have taken place.
From the very beginning, the European Union was at pains to show the greatest possible flexibility so as to comply with Moroccan wishes and interests.
Following my visit to Rabat in February this year, I had to conclude that the gulf between the two positions could not be bridged, in particular, because of the compensation demands by Morocco for the catch facilities that were being offered.
As regards fishing facilities, especially under the technical framework conditions of the fisheries sector, in other words, in which zones, at what times, and in what vessels, fishing could take place in Morocco, there were, in some cases, major differences of opinion.
Following my return in February, I immediately apprised the Council of the situation so as to sound out alternatives with the Fisheries Ministers.
The Council requested me to make a final attempt to reach an agreement on the basis of the existing negotiation mandate.
On that basis, on 26 March, I met Minister Chbaatou in Brussels.
Unfortunately, however, this meeting too was a total failure.
During the course of the negotiations, the Commission put forward a number of proposals to promote the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector, for example, to provide resources to develop the port infrastructure and services sector in Morocco, to promote and develop coastal fisheries, to promote training and research and to develop aquaculture.
We would have accepted very extensive landing obligations in Moroccan ports, which would have meant a radical change in the traditional fishing activities of many Spanish and Portuguese fishermen, but would also have contributed to the development of the Moroccan sector.
Moreover, we agreed to increase the proportion of Moroccan crewmembers on board vessels so as to improve the employment situation and the level of training in the Moroccan fishing sector.
In addition, we would have accepted further extensive reductions in catches in order to maintain resources in Moroccan waters.
For example, in the first year we would have accepted a drastic reduction in the presence of the European Union in Moroccan waters compared with under the previous agreement. The following two years would have seen a phasing out of cephalopod and shrimp fishing.
We would also have accepted new technical conditions which would have been less advantageous for the Community fleet and would have reduced fishing costs.
Despite this raft of concessions and despite the progress the Moroccan side has made following the negotiations, the following basic differences of opinion remain.
Firstly, the fishing conditions proposed by Morocco would have meant that the economic benefit for our fishermen would have been lost as we would have had to fish with considerably fewer ships in fewer fishing zones, and we would have had to accept longer periods in which fishing was banned.
Secondly, the European Union is of the view that financial compensation must be reasonably proportionate to the offered catch facilities.
Not only is this our general political guideline, it is also stated in the negotiation mandate of October 1999.
In any case, we evaluated the financial part not only in purely economic terms; we also took political considerations into account, such as the need to have good political relations with Morocco.
In return for our proposal for a fisheries agreement we offered Morocco compensation of EUR 70 million for the first year, 60 million for the second year and 40 million for the third year.
This offer was very advantageous to Morocco for a number of reasons.
Firstly, we calculated our financial compensation package on the basis of the fishing facilities in the final year of the previous agreement and not on the basis of the average of the last agreement.
That alone means a price advantage of 15% for Morocco.
Secondly, in our calculation we made no distinction between types of fish, even though we would have accepted greater reductions in the case of more expensive and, for the European Union, more interesting types of fish such as cephalopods and shrimp.
This also gives a price advantage for Morocco.
Thirdly, we did not take the landing obligations in Morocco into account in our calculation.
Fourthly, in the end I increased the compensation resulting from the calculation by 20% in order to demonstrate that we understood Morocco' s concerns about the development of its own sector.
On top of all that, at the last meeting with the Moroccan Fisheries Minister, Mr Chbaatou, I once again made it clear that our offer, which I have described above, was a more than fair price for the catch facility. I also told him that we were once again prepared to fork out EUR 5 million a year to prove our good intention for the conclusion of an agreement.
However, the Moroccan Minister stressed that Morocco had no room for manoeuvre.
Given the stance taken by Morocco, I do not see any possibility of concluding an agreement on the basis of our mandate.
That is the message I will be taking to the Fisheries Council on 25 April.
But the question of what will happen to the affected ship owners and fishermen, who have now been condemned to idleness for more than a year, is becoming increasingly pressing.
As you know, since 1 December 1999, we have made compensation payments to ship owners and fishermen out of the Fisheries Fund.
We have made all our preparations in line with the conclusions of the Nice Summit.
There is currently a Commission proposal with Parliament and also with the Council, whereby compensation payments will be extended to 30 June of this year.
We have also proposed leaving the 4% limit out of consideration for compensation payments.
We estimate that, so far, a total of approximately EUR 80 million have been paid out to affected fishermen and ship owners, 20 million of which were raised by the Member States themselves. This equates to a Community share of EUR 60 million, some 51 million of which have gone to Spain and 9 million to Portugal.
One thing is clear, however, additional measures and funds are necessary to secure the future of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing sectors.
In my view, we must act in three key areas.
Firstly, we should try to find alternative fishing facilities in other third countries, at least to a certain extent.
Secondly, we must help to develop alternative employment opportunities for the affected populations, perhaps in aquaculture, or in tourism, or in the service sector, or wherever an opportunity arises.
Thirdly, as we do in other cases, we must also support the breaking up of vessels for which no alternative use can be found.
To this end we will exploit all the room for negotiation at the disposal of the Commission.
However, we will have to approach the budgetary authority in this connection regarding the 2002 budget.
The next step must be for us to report back to the Fisheries Council.
Finally, I would like to stress that I very much regret the unbending stance adopted by Morocco, which has made an agreement which is advantageous to both sides impossible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Fischler, we know that you have done everything you can.
Others left you a veritable time bomb preventing you from reaching another agreement: the promise and the agreement in the previous one not to renew it.
We all knew that it was difficult for you.
Even so, after seventeen months, thirteen technical meetings, your personal involvement on seven occasions and that of the President of the Commission himself on one occasion, which is unprecedented, Morocco was persuaded to sit down and negotiate.
It was little more than that, however.
Morocco never wanted the agreement and showed it by imposing its intransigence and its unfair and unacceptable conditions, which the sector itself rejected as uneconomical and impossible to take on.
We always said that we would prefer no agreement to a bad agreement; and this is what Morocco is proposing, despite the generous, reasonable offers from the European Union, which are beneficial to both parties.
Morocco is within its rights but, having got to this point, should we carry on?
I think that if Morocco wants an agreement with the European Union, it knows perfectly well what it has to offer.
However, if it has not been reached in seventeen months, I think it unlikely that it will be reached now.
Therefore, Mr Fischler, you should take note of this and inform the College of Commissioners of Morocco' s intransigence in co-operating with the European Union.
We will be watching the development of bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco very carefully, both in political terms, as you mentioned, and in economic, financial and trade terms.
Why is Morocco rejecting more than EUR 200 million in three years, investment from European ship owners, the possible creation of joint ventures to develop its sector, the wealth that the catches could generate in its ports?
Why is it rejecting a gradual reduction of the European fleet over three years, while in private it authorises private Asian companies to use its fishing grounds?
This is quite legitimate, but can the European Union not guarantee better than anyone that its resources will be rationally preserved and fished responsibly?
Who in Morocco is really going to benefit from the lack of an agreement?
These are the key points.
I stress, Mr Fischler, that you should take careful note of all this but, following this upset with Morocco, I think that we must look to the future.
The situation is of course difficult, serious, and unprecedented.
It is not impossible to solve, however.
I therefore ask everyone for generosity and solidarity, employers and fishermen, unions and political parties.
And we need to ask the European Union to make a special effort.
The Nice European Council, incidentally at the request of the Spanish Government and JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, agreed - another unprecedented thing - to support the demands and, if they failed, the negotiations and, if these did not succeed either, asked the Commission for a specific action programme, as set out in No 59 of the Nice conclusions.
I ask you, Mr Fischler, for your commitment and understanding.
Fishing in the European Union asks for it now more than ever.
I ask for your personal political commitment to get involved in the pending fishing negotiations with third countries, Senegal and Mauritania first of all, and to open up new negotiations and explore new fishing grounds.
This is the future for redeploying the fleet, which is the priority aim; and at the same time, with the funds not used for Morocco, I ask you to support a broad social programme for fishermen and for the most affected areas, with alternative economic projects to restart their economies.
Your experience with the CAP should be useful to us so that, for the first time, programmes of this type can be adopted in fisheries.
I will conclude by saying that Morocco dealt a hard blow to the European fisheries sector and therefore to the European Union.
Now, however, we have to adopt a realistic, constructive and responsible attitude.
It has the support of Parliament, which will actively defend the sector.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that the time bomb is the one that we have here, now, as we are talking about an unprecedented failure of negotiations, which is not your failure, Mr Fischler, but that of many people, which leaves 4 400 Community fishermen and 415 vessels unemployed.
Those affected in my country feel that they have been deceived by their political leaders, who have always denied the problems in the negotiations, and the fact that there were deadlines for concluding them.
This is not the case for you, Mr Fischler.
How are they are going to believe in relocation to other fishing grounds if we all know that increasing the fishing effort would put resources at risk or would make the activity unprofitable?
Why did the negotiations fail?
Despite your efforts as Commissioner, which I recognise, a common strategy was lacking, not on your part, but on the part of the Commission, and above all, the Council.
You reminded me of the responsibility of ministers, whom you said were informed at all times and had taken part in the most recent rounds of negotiations.
Although the formal responsibility for negotiating lies with the Commission, the governments can and should prepare the way for agreement.
You said that what the European Union was offering was not bad; the attitude of the Moroccan Government was not that of a loyal partner.
We think, however, that the framework for negotiation was the association agreement with Morocco.
Maybe eleven months ago it was not right to mix fisheries and agriculture, but we have to remember that Morocco is still benefiting from agricultural concessions obtained in parallel with the fishery negotiations in 1992 and 1995, and that the European Union is the main importer of Moroccan fisheries, agricultural and industrial products.
You said to me at the time that no good would come of such a mix and that it was better to trust our partners.
We have trusted them and we have seen that on the same day that the negotiations broke down, Morocco was signing a fishing co-operation agreement with Japan, and while it was giving us the reasons of preserving resources, it was granting licences to Community and other vessels and fleets.
The sector and the public want to know what measures the Commission is going to take following the collapse of these negotiations.
In your speech you talked again about another mandate.
Is another mandate possible?
Do you think that we would change anything with another mandate?
Do you think that the negotiations have finished for good, or is it possible to restart them with a new mandate?
Mr President, today more than ever, I wish to speak on behalf of the fishermen and ship owners of Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Galicia, Barbanza, Morrazo, of La Guardia, and of the people of Spain and Portugal who need and who continue to call for a fisheries agreement to be signed between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco.
They are calling for fair agreements which will be of mutual benefit, in line with the whole range of economic, social, political and human relations established in 1995, defining the neighbourly relationship between our countries and the Maghreb State.
They are calling for an agreement on appropriate terms, which has been repeatedly approved by this Parliament and they do not accept the negotiations undertaken without faith or conviction by the Commission over the last 16 months to be valid or fitting. Nor do they accept the failure that has been announced.
For the same reason, I cannot accept the dismantling of the European fleet in Canary-Saharan waters and nor is it feasible to relocate or transfer them safely to other fishing banks where, furthermore, it would compete with other European boats.
Nor can we leave 4400 fishermen redundant and the coastal communities that live mainly from fishing are not in a position to find new ways of earning a living overnight.
We must not accept that their future lies in early retirement for the older people or in emigration for the younger ones.
The communities I represent demand that the Commission returns to the negotiating table to conclude the fishing agreement with Morocco.
They demand that the Member States, specifically the Spanish Government, abandon their passive or complicit attitude and bring into play the political and economic resources necessary to conclude new negotiations.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a European problem that is affecting European citizens and which is undermining the very credibility of the Union' s institutions and their ability to address a critical aspect of international relations for which they have responsibility, such as fisheries.
There is no reason to consider the agreement to be in conflict with preserving Morocco' s fish stocks. I am convinced that this will benefit the collective interests of the Moroccan people.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, my group would like to thank you for all the efforts that you have made in these negotiations, even more so when we think that what was lacking was not a fishery negotiation strategy, but an overall strategy.
In 1995 my group maintained that the fisheries agreement with Morocco should be included as part of the text of the European association agreement with Morocco.
The reason was obvious: between partners facilities need to be established in both directions.
Morocco needs access to the Community market, and the Community fisheries sector needs access to fishing grounds that it has traditionally worked in.
Morocco' s reasons cannot be found in preservation of resources.
Due to a lack of time, I am not going to give examples.
The association agreement took an unambiguous stand on Community concessions to Morocco and today we find ourselves without a fisheries agreement.
The consequences of the lack of an agreement are the loss of 4 000 direct jobs and 20 000 on land.
There may be a solution in seeking other fishing grounds for part of the fleet, but it is very difficult for the small-scale and inshore fleets.
If Morocco is intending to act as a partner, it should open up its waters to the Community small-scale fleet immediately.
Commissioner, among your measures, you yourself talked about increasing the European Union' s room for manoeuvre.
Soon the association agreement will have to be revised and Morocco will surely once again make demands for trade concessions that will even affect the same Community regions that are currently being seriously affected by the lack of a fisheries agreement.
Commissioner, I hope that the European Union finds this room for manoeuvre when the time comes to revise the association agreement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as you know, this matter is of particular concern to Portugal and to Portuguese fishermen, particularly in the Sesimbra and Algarve regions.
We have been, to a certain extent, surprised, after the last debate that we held in this House, in which we were informed that an agreement was possible, at the sudden news that the whole thing has collapsed.
I understand the complexity of the problem and I am shocked at the intransigence of Morocco' s position.
Nevertheless, I wish to ask the following questions: with regard to the difference in financial compensation between the European Union' s proposal and Morocco' s and according to the information I have, it has been more than compensated for by the sum of Community aid allocated to Morocco under various headings and also by the trade compensations or advantages it has gained under other agreements.
The question is whether the Commission is able to produce an overall strategy with Morocco.
I understand a country deciding to sell its resources to the highest bidder - it has political freedom to do so - but I also consider that any country that does so will have less need for international cooperation aid.
I should also like to remind you, on this subject, of what the resolution adopted in this Parliament in 1999 said: ever-closer cooperation between the European Union and Morocco cannot exclude existing relations in the field of fisheries, I should also like to know what support measures for converting the fishing fleet are being put in place.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are three observations we can make about these negotiations, which have ended in failure: the first concerns Morocco' s great unwillingness to show flexibility in their negotiations.
I understand Morocco' s wishing to place a high value on its fish stocks but the lives of communities and of their economic relationships are founded on compromise.
The European Union has made concessions to Morocco, by opening up its markets to many of that country' s products, including agricultural produce, and by opening up its doors to several million Moroccan citizens who have adopted the European Union as their homeland.
This is why it is so difficult to understand this absence of any reciprocal attitude on the part of Morocco.
I hope that the European Union will draw conclusions from this episode, both for its future cooperation with Morocco and for its own common fisheries policy.
My second observation is that the effort made by the Commission and especially by Commissioner Fischler, have stood in stark contrast with the passive approach of the Council and of the various presidencies of the European Union, including that of my own country.
Can this be because the agreement directly served the interests of only two countries?
Or can it be that the governments of those two countries were not sufficiently forceful to protect their own interests?
These are questions that require answers.
My third observation is that we need to lay the ground for the future, but this cannot be done with financial compensation alone, when fisherman are standing idle and when we are compensated for ships to be scrapped.
The failure of these negotiations must give the European Union food for thought with regard to the future of its common fisheries policy.
I see three main routes here. Firstly there is the need to create new political and financial instruments for facilitating new methods of cooperation and business partnership with countries that are rich in fishing resources.
Secondly, the next agreements with third countries must demonstrate serious political commitment. Thirdly, there is a need for a genuine revolution in the management of fish stocks.
Lastly, Morocco' s refusal is a mystery to me.
Is it possible to find out the real reasons for this refusal?
If we can discover the reasons, why can we then not consider a possible new negotiating mandate?
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are neither in a North African bazaar nor in a European marketplace. We are in a political assembly.
We are not market traders; we are politicians.
This is the viewpoint we should adopt when considering the failure of this agreement with Morocco.
It seems that Morocco has behaved arrogantly towards Europe and the Union must really not forget this.
I personally shall not.
It is also worth asking, however, and in fact it has been asked, whether the Council may have adopted a somewhat aloof or passive attitude.
This question remains to be answered.
We might also ask whether the fact that this issue only affects two of the Union' s countries may have had some influence.
This is undoubtedly true, and the Union has lost credibility in the eyes of the Portuguese people - and of the Spanish people too, I presume - and this is the main political concern that I wish to highlight.
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regrets the fact that an agreement could not be reached.
Our position has always been that we hoped an agreement would be reached, but with one extremely important proviso, namely that the agreement had to be mutually acceptable and beneficial to both sides.
It turns out that such an agreement is not possible.
That is unfortunate, but we must respect the right of Morocco to determine how to exploit its resources in its own waters.
It has the right to self-determination and it has the right to look for the best deal possible for itself.
In its Green Paper, the Commission sets very great store by the legitimate aspirations of developing states to develop their fishing industry, and the Greens very much agree with this principle.
Another issue in the Green Paper is the commitment of the European Community to the precautionary principle and the conservation of stocks.
The April 2000 report by the Scientific, Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries reviews the status of the stocks off Morocco, as well as other countries in west Africa.
They do not paint a very optimistic picture for anchovy, cuttlefish, demersal fish, black hake and sardinella.
The report says that there is no information on the status of these stocks.
The report also notes that octopus and hake fisheries are over-exploited and reductions in effort are needed.
It was also pointed out that there was a huge ignorance of the amount of fishing actually being conducted by EU vessels and this is a really important and very worrying point.
There was also the lack of guarantee for the protection of small-scale coastal fisheries.
Finally, we are pleased that compensation and funds for restructuring of fleets has been made available, but we also have to look at the overall fisheries policy within the European Union.
We cannot keep searching around the world for more and more places to transfer our over-capacity to.
We have to be realistic and realise that we must solve the problem from within.
Mr President, taking account of the statements made by Commissioner Fischler, we seemed to have reached the end of a process that has been dragging on since November 1999, with damaging socio-economic consequences for the Community fleet operating in that area and for the fishing communities that have traditionally depended on those fishing grounds.
The question I would like to put is whether it is still possible to begin the negotiation of a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, with acceptable conditions.
The Moroccan proposals on reformulating the previous agreement were unacceptable and some people in the sector even wondered whether a bad agreement was really better than no agreement.
In any event, as a result, Portugal now has around 30 boats and over 600 fishermen without any visible future.
In addition to extending aid, it is becoming crucial that the European Union guarantees compensation support for the fleet, to the fishermen and the areas affected, by supporting a programme of converting the boats that fished in Moroccan waters, guaranteeing the relocation to other fishing grounds covered by Community fisheries agreements and, of course, by considering changing the common fisheries policy.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to react just briefly to the very enthusiastic debate we are witnessing here today.
To begin with, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the start of a new agreement, or the start of negotiations for a new agreement, was always going to be difficult because no agreement had been reached in the previous agreement that there would be a successor agreement.
That naturally meant that, for months, the Moroccan side put forward the argument that, so to speak, there was an agreement that no new agreement would be concluded at all and that the Commission and the negotiators of the previous agreement had promised this.
Secondly, we must be clear about one thing. I do not believe we are sending out the right signal, if we say that there must be an agreement at all costs.
I have drawn your attention to the fact that the Moroccan side has said that it is not prepared to grant us more or better fishing facilities than they did last time or to back away from its financial demands.
If we accept, however, the financial demands for the fishing facilities that are being offered, then we will be creating a precedent for all the other third country agreements that we have.
We will drive up the cost for all these other agreements to an extent that would simply be irresponsible.
Naturally, the Moroccan side is at liberty to send us an improved proposal.
I told the Minister as much.
It would be a good thing, however, if that were to happen before the Council of Fisheries Ministers is held.
Given the current circumstances, I do not believe it makes any sense.
You must bear one thing in mind, however. If we conclude this agreement as it stands, there will be no economic benefit for the fishermen of Spain and Portugal, which means we will have to restructure the fleet from scratch.
That, however, would take place under conditions whereby very few resources would be available to us because most would be bound up for the next three years in a bad agreement.
I would once again like to stress just how important it is that we set about supporting the sector in question as well as we can.
We are all called upon to do that: the Commission, the budgetary authorities, Parliament and the Council.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Expenditure on CFP control, inspection and surveillance systems
The next item is the report (A5Â­0098/2001) by Mr JovÃ© Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution by the Community to certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing the control, inspection and surveillance systems applicable to the common fisheries policy [COM(2000) 684 - C5Â­0583/2000 - 2000/0273(CNS)]
, rapporteur. (ES) Mr President, the proposal for a Council decision represents the continuation of a policy of providing Member States with financial support to fund infrastructure required by this fundamental pillar of the common fisheries policy.
The proposal establishes the priority of implementing new technologies, using IT networks, possibly making satellite monitoring systems standard practice, training officials responsible for policing and the intervention systems which need to be introduced in order to meet the Union' s obligations to regional fisheries organisations.
Although in general the Commission' s proposal is acceptable, there are two aspects that conflict with the line adopted by the Committee on Fisheries and the European Parliament in other matters closely related with the one that we are dealing with.
Parliament has highlighted in recent reports on regional fisheries organisations that responsibility for control and surveillance within them should be solely that of the Community, and that it should be up to the institutions of the European Union, and particularly the Commission, to adopt the necessary measures to meet these obligations. As a result, it is logical that the action should be funded from the Community budget.
Given that the regional fisheries organisations are going to increase in importance in the future of the common fisheries policy, it is appropriate to follow the line defined by previous reports adopted by Parliament.
From the Commission proposal it can be understood that in the future the contribution to the work of the regional fisheries organisations would also be entrusted, at least partly, to the Member States, as would the tasks of inspection and monitoring.
While there is a common fisheries policy and the Community has powers in the area of fisheries, it should act as such and equip itself with the human and financial resources to deal with its obligations, as required by the principle of sufficient resources for the common fisheries policy.
Applying this principle has financial implications and requires legal developments and perhaps giving up some sovereignty, but, if a certain model of political construction is accepted, the resources need to be put in place so that the model can be put into practice.
The current situation does not exactly square with this model, as core responsibility for control lies with the Member States, and there is a need for a reasonable period for adapting the structures to the aforementioned model.
It is up to the Member States, on a transitional basis, perhaps for the three years covered by the programme contained in this decision, to continue to exercise these responsibilities as representatives of the Union.
However, this is no obstacle to reimbursing the Member States immediately for the full amount of the expenditure arising from these Community obligations, and for that reason, instead of co-funding, 100% of that expenditure should be reimbursed.
This is the aim of Amendment No 1 of the draft report.
The reference in the Explanatory Memorandum to the decision to establishing a reduction of EUR 41 to 35 million per year in spending on control operations is surprising, since it is very likely that the establishment of an adequate infrastructure for the control and surveillance programmes will require that today' s financial burden be increased rather than reduced in the future.
Amendment No 2 raises the percentage of Community funding for acquiring and modernising inspection and control equipment from 30% to 35%.
The majority of investment has already been made in this respect and the majority of future action will be in terms of modernisation.
In any case, as the investment is costly and - we should not forget this - we are talking about control of a common policy, the percentage of Community funding should be slightly increased.
To conclude, I must confess that I was tempted to begin a more detailed discussion about the future of the control system after the reform.
However, the experiences of recent reports which, by looking into the future, have lost some of their effectiveness, led me to take a more modest and immediate approach.
Mr President, once again what most stands out to me about the Commission proposal is the imbalance between the importance that it says it attaches to certain issues and the means that it then puts in place in order to resolve them.
If we believed solely in the declarations of intent, it would seem that the Commission really does see the fisheries control policy as a top priority.
The Explanatory Memorandum to this proposal commends the importance of this policy as part of the common fisheries policy, which it describes as crucial, a description that with which we all agree.
The Green Paper that was recently presented goes even further, saying that either the system must be improved, or a fatal blow will be dealt to the credibility of the CFP.
However, when the moment of truth comes, we are once again seeing that, following great declarations, two of the three essential elements are missing, and neither are the sufficient resources provided to carry out the measures, nor is the essential policy of transparency followed in order to make them credible.
It is impossible to understand how, when this policy is such a priority, and it is so essential to reinforce it, the budget allocated to it on this occasion is not only not being increased, but is being decreased from EUR 41 to 35 million per year.
Also, this being the third decision from the Commission going the same way, this time the Commission has not made the report on the results of previous measures public, so that we do not know, aside from whether the choice of the measures to be funded was more or less correct, whether they achieved practical results, including the highly desirable results of linking the sector to this policy, which until now was described as discriminatory and confused in Community waters and weak and lacking credibility outside them.
We therefore support the more than pertinent comments from the rapporteur in this respect, and all of his amendments and, more specifically, those that stress to the Commission that this House believes that, if the Commission has the powers regarding the regional fisheries organisations, it also has the political and financial responsibility for implementing the appropriate measures. This of course includes control measures, in which the European Union is putting the credibility of its supposed commitment to sustainability of resources on the line in the eyes of the world.
Mr President, as we have heard this morning, Morocco is currently eclipsing the EU' s fisheries policy.
I can well understand this as the consequences of the failure to conclude a fisheries agreement for the Iberian Peninsula are enormous for all of us.
I had the opportunity to convince myself of that just a short time ago.
Nevertheless, we must not remain paralysed; we must look at other important aspects of the CFP which were covered by the report tabled by JovÃ© Peres.
Let me get straight to the point. Surveillance of fisheries is not everything, but without surveillance everything else is pointless.
We know from our day-to-day experience that, without real and effective controls, the European fisheries policy would be nothing but a bubble of air.
We need to make progress and adapt ourselves to modern developments.
At a conference organised by the Commission last October in Brussels, reference was made to the international aspects of control.
We need a global approach.
The proposals tabled to this effect by the Commission are just as important as the provisions in the new Green Paper on the reform of the CFP.
Responsibility for the carrying out of controls is clearly regulated.
It lies with the Member States.
Financial support from the Community is of course imperative, particularly if we are talking about an equal, across-the-board level of control.
We need the support of the Community to bring about efficient modern controls in the future.
I am using the word 'modern' quite deliberately and here the Commission has set the right priorities: the introduction of modern technologies, the use of information networks, the use of satellite surveillance systems and better training of surveillance staff.
We must, however, think carefully about whether reducing the resources for the implementation of control measures is the right approach.
I think that, in implementing these controls, we should be sending other signals, namely in terms of the priorities of the CFP.
So an appropriate budget is of paramount importance.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Peres, I am very pleased that you have accepted the Commission proposal so positively and I would like to thank you very warmly for the work you have done.
Your report shows that, by and large, we are in agreement.
The financial involvement of the Community in the surveillance expenditure of the Member States has so far yielded very positive results.
Since, however, there are still many shortcomings to rectify in the area of surveillance, it must continue.
Indeed the new measures must be adapted to current circumstances, as you called for in your report.
Now I will come to the amendments. The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 6 as they stand.
Amendment No 3 seeks to add an additional recital, Recital 12, on the budgetary mechanism.
We agree with you on the merits of the issue. There is no problem with that.
But we do not think it is necessary to present the entire budgetary mechanism in the form of a recital.
Moreover, it is also superfluous, because there is no equivalent in the procedural part of the decision.
The Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 4, which calls for the reimbursement of up to 100% of the expenditure of Member States by the Community, as this would mean that the Community would not only take on 100% sole financial responsibility but also the accompanying sole political responsibility.
As far as Amendment No 7 is concerned, the Commission is unfortunately unable to keep to the proposed date of 30 June to take a decision on the choice of surveillance expenditure which will be co-financed by the Community.
The reason for this is that the Member States are to be given time up to this date to send us their reports on their surveillance expenditure.
And we can only take a decision afterwards.
But in future years we will be able to take our decision by 30 June.
A change to the comitology procedure in this case, as you propose, is unfortunately not impossible.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I have just heard the news that one of the assistants from my office in Brussels has been robbed at knifepoint, at the edge of the woods which are only yards away from the Parliament building.
Apart from that incident, I have also had reports from my staff that they have been threatened on previous occasions near the building, both on that side and on the section between the building and the railway station, particularly in the early evening.
I would like investigations to take place to improve the security for Members of the European Parliament and their staff in the area around our building in Brussels.
I will certainly pass your request to the security service, Mr Kirkhope.
I think the Quaestors should probably get involved too.
Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Wim van Velzen is present in the Chamber.
I would like him to hear my speech, but, in any case, I feel it necessary to inform you and all the Members that the comments made by Mr van Velzen about myself were unfounded.
Mr van Velzen has criticised me twice in this House, in my absence.
According to him, I was not consistent and correct in upholding human rights while I was in Cuba with Mr Wiebenga and Mrs Eriksson for a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union.
I would like to say that, at the very moment when Mr van Velzen was making this point in this House - at about 5 p.m. on Monday in Strasbourg, which was 11 a.m. in Cuba - I was talking to Mr Elizardo SÃ¡nchez, the director of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, who, in the hall of his house, was showing me the photographs he had taken with JosÃ© Maria Aznar, Felipe GonzÃ¡lez and our fellow Member, MÃ¡rio Soares.
Moreover, together with Mr SÃ¡nchez were all the representatives of the Cuban opposition.
Now, this is a fact, not empty words.
The delegation of the European Parliament represented this institution correctly, meeting with all the organisations of the Cuban democratic opposition even though we were not bound to do so by duty.
I am not asking Mr van Velzen to apologise because there is no need.
I would like to thank all the Members, my group Chairman and Mr Seguro for what they said, but I am sure that there will be no need next time.
Should I be criticised over human rights in the future, there will be no need for Mr BarÃ³n Crespo or Mr Seguro to take the floor because Mr Wim van Velzen will be the first to rise in this House.
I repeat - he does not need to apologise - next time, he will be the one to defend me against any totally unfounded accusations or criticism.
Parliament takes note of your statement, Mr Imbeni, as a personal statement pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, there will be no debate.
Mr Wim van Velzen, who is my deputy and a distinguished colleague, cannot be here today because he has to be in Sofia on behalf of our political group.
I would like to say to you Mr Imbeni, as Vice-President of the European Parliament that, despite all our political differences, you are also a distinguished colleague and Vice-President.
I suggest that you get together with Mr Imbeni, with my participation if you like, to discuss the background, which I and most of us here know nothing about.
We must be united, Mr Imbeni, when we are dealing with defending human rights. All of us in this House must be united.
Thank you for that felicitous proposal, Mr Poettering.
Welcome
Before starting our long voting session, I am delighted to greet Commander Ahmed Shah Massud, Vice-President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and members of his delegation, who have taken their seats in the official gallery.
(Sustained applause) We are pleased to welcome them to this House on the occasion of Commander Massud' s first visit to Europe, at the invitation of the European Parliament.
We already had a parliamentary arena here, and now we have a lion in it.
VOTE
I would like to confirm that the Commission cannot accept any of the seven amendments proposed.
The current position includes the amendments accepted by the Commission at first reading.
The Commission considers that this common position provides a level of safety equivalent to that set out in the Commission's initial proposal.
In addition, the Commission cannot accept at this stage the request to establish a positive list of feed materials.

On Amendment No 3 to paragraph 2.2, there are misunderstandings in the case of a number of the translations.
Vaccination does not have to lead to culling: vaccination simply means that the animals can be used.
That was presented in some of the translations as 'separation' .
It simply means that authorisation is given for animals which are vaccinated to be used in the food chain.

Joint motion for a resolution on the outcome of the Stockholm European Council of 23 and 24 March 2001 as regards foreign affairs matters
- (DE) Mr President, I would very much like to ask those who proposed Amendment No 9 to withdraw it.
I will explain why.
Many of us in this House, probably all of us, want the neighbouring countries of Macedonia and Greece to reach agreement on the name - whether it is going to be FYROM or Macedonia.
If a vote on this takes place today, I am afraid that it will not turn out positively, or at least with a very small majority, which would not be in line with what the proposers intended.
I would therefore like to ask that this proposed amendment be withdrawn.
The proposers' feelings have been expressed, and these are the feelings of many of us in this House, but I believe that the amendment as it stands should not be presented today, especially since Greece and Macedonia/FYROM are on the brink of an agreement.
Mr President, over the past few weeks, we have seen how important a stable Macedonia is which is able to solve its internal disagreements.
Moreover, Macedonia has been declaring for the past ten years that it has no desire whatsoever to change its national borders.
I therefore see no reason whatsoever why Macedonia could not choose its own name.
In all honesty, I do not welcome the fact that the Greek Members of the large groups have, in my view, once again managed to hold their groups hostage.
Having said that, it would be even worse if a majority of this Parliament were to declare that Macedonia should be denied this right.
That is why I am prepared to withdraw the amendment now, but I would call on the Greek Members finally to face the truth and grant Macedonia the right to choose its own name.
If I have understood you correctly, Mr Lagendijk, you are withdrawing this amendment and appealing to the good sense of Parliament.
Mr President, all I want to say is that state called FYROM exists only because of Greek support at the moment.

Motion for a resolution (B5-0246/2001) by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the third UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, could you please check whether Amendment No 2 of the Liberal Group on the resolution on foot-and-mouth disease has actually been voted on?
I myself have my doubts.
Could you also inform me of what would happen if that appeared not to be the case?
I can in any event assure you that this amendment still reflects the liberal group' s position, and perhaps you could record this as such in the declaration of vote.
However, I have the strong suspicion that this amendment was not voted on at all.
Piecyk Report (A5-0111/2001)
The Piecyk report from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism approves the conciliation agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the criteria to be applied to seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals so that they can become eligible for funding under the heading of the trans-European networks (TEN).
We can support the rapporteur' s determination to pursue the development of the infrastructure needed by port installations at European level.
European public finance for the development of public facilities, in order to achieve better land use, balance the means of transport more effectively, and fight pollution, is undoubtedly a priority.
Public funding, however, must be for public facilities and public services.
Now the ambiguity facing the European Union, which recurs in this report, revolves specifically around the future status, public or private, of port installations.
On the one hand, the Council is promoting the trans-European networks, while on the other, it is planning privatisations in these sectors, as in the directive presented on 14 February on opening up competition for port services, for example.
Europe never thinks about the needs of peoples and societies, only about opening up and competition.
Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, for you listen avidly to all my explanations of vote, I was born in Genoa, a coastal city, and I have worked as a sailor in the past.
Therefore, there is nothing so important to me as this document, which seeks to help and improve Europe's sea- and inland ports, as Mr Piecyk's report outlines so well.
This is why I voted for this document, in the hope that Europe will continue to concern itself with issues relating to sailors, the sea and ports.
Lehne recommendation for second reading (A5-0090/2001)
Mr President, Mr Lehne's highly competent report on this subject includes an amendment proposed by Parliament - Amendment No 18 - which provides for an anti-money laundering check to take effect for premium amounts exceeding EUR 10 000, whereas the Commission proposed to perform checks on these payments when the premiums exceeded just EUR 2 500.
I feel that the European Parliament's amendment is timely, and that is what convinced me to vote for the report.
Indeed, I feel that we must not exaggerate with our checks on money transfers, although checks are necessary, or we will exacerbate the situation by overburdening these transfers with excessively heavy regulations that can only make things worse.
Unlike what usually happens, with the European Parliament calling for stricter measures than the Council, in the case of Directive 91/308/EC on legalising the proceeds from illegal activities, or money laundering, the European Parliament is basically annulling and retracting the new measures proposed.
Where they apply to new lawyers and the confidentiality which has to govern their activities, the European Parliament is entitled to call for an exemption.
However, the same does not apply to professions such as accountants, tax advisers, brokers, notaries, auction houses etc., which must report any suspicion of money laundering to the authorities.
That is why these categories should not be approved and why I voted against the amendments in question.
The little war of amendments between Parliament and the Council throws light on the contradictions tying them both up in knots as they claim to be combating money laundering without daring to get to the heart of the matter.
If the laundering of money earned from drugs or illegal trafficking is to be effectively combated, banking confidentiality and business confidentiality have to be eliminated, not just suspended in a restricted way, and not just in court.
That would mean, however, revealing to public opinion the multitude of ways of accumulating capital and using it that are legal but still criminal in terms of the elementary interests of society.
That would be unacceptable to those who champion profit and the right of those who benefit from it to make what use of it they like.
They should not be surprised at their own powerlessness against those who push the logic of profit to the point of criminality.
We have no intention of endorsing these ineffective measures with our vote, any more than the laundering of capital, which is legal certainly, but acquired at the price of exploitation and used to the detriment of society.
The directive on combating money laundering is a step in the right direction and responds, at least in part, to the aspirations of citizens' movements and the proposals made by the judges most concerned about the issue.
Unfortunately, apart from one amendment, Amendment No 2, which extends the obligations of the directive to chartered accountants, and one other, Amendment No 27, which mentions OLAF and a possible European public prosecutor, Mr Lehne' s report does its best to reduce the scope of the directive.
As he, himself, puts it: 'the right of clients to confidentiality must not be undermined, even when the aim is to fight money laundering' .
Absurd pretexts are then added to that argument (complicated and completely useless obligations), and escape clauses which allow the professional associations to establish the necessary rules themselves.
For our part, we are in favour of total transparency in capital operations.
We recognise the absolute need to maintain the right to be defended but in no case should this mean impunity for anyone committing a crime.
So we are voting against certain utterly deplorable amendments, which represent so many obstacles to a vigorous fight against money laundering.
I am sure that I speak for all Members of this House when I say that I support greater coordination and cooperation to combat criminality and cross-border crime.
In particular I recognise the importance of common standards and rules in helping to overcome the legal obstacles that can be put in place of successful prosecution.
In Ireland, in order to combat the types of crime mentioned in the debate, we established the 'Criminal Assets Bureau' (CAB) which is a multi-agency organisation, headed by a legal officer and a chief superintendent of the police.
These have been very successful in seizing the assets of drug dealers and other criminals as well as gathering evidence for further prosecutions.
This has worked to bring a lot of criminals to justice and to follow the money trail to seize the proceeds of those criminal activities.
However great our desire may be to prosecute criminals, we must ensure that the normal rules of procedure and justice are not ignored.
In the present report, the desire to put accountants and auditors on the same level as lawyers is important to maintain this right of defence.
The move within the common position to allow information gathered in a 'money laundering case' to be put to other uses for prosecution goes too far I believe.
Finally I am against the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office as we already have OLAF, the Court of Auditors as well as the national agencies with responsibility for prosecution. .
The issue we are dealing with today is of capital importance for the future of our democracies.
The war against money laundering can no longer be waged by an isolated government.
For it to be effective, cooperation between the Member States must be organised.
It is essential to extend the definition of money laundering, because restricting it to drug-trafficking no longer corresponds to today' s reality.
Account must be taken of every type of crime that generates major financial flows, fraud against the financial interests of the Communities, and any kind of corruption.
It has become absolutely necessary to involve the legal professions in the operation against money laundering, otherwise the European system of preventing and combating dirty money will be ineffective.
There is no question, however, of lawyers accepting any threat to professional secrecy or the confidentiality of their relationship with their clients.
So those amendments are unacceptable.
Indeed, professional secrecy remains the fundamental rule in the exercise of the profession of lawyer.
It is incompatible with the expression of suspicion, worse still, the expression of possible suspicion.
What is more, restricting professional secrecy amounts to restricting citizens' fundamental rights.
Lawyers are officers of the courts, not police officers.
. (PT) The position adopted in this report constitutes a step backwards from the previous position.
Attacking organised crime is simply one part of the issue.
It is equally important that we adopt practical measures on crime against the economy, which results, specifically, from money laundering.
It is also significant that no practical measures have been proposed on the 'offshore' issue, the breaking of banking confidentiality during a judicial inquiry or even on the situation of assets acquired through money laundering, which is a criminal act, to prevent the use of financial funds created by such activity, at the inquiry stage.
Finally, it is important to note that the report contains some confusion about the concepts of consultancy and accountancy, by creating get-out clauses and opportunities to escape providing information.
Unfortunately, the Council of Ministers has presented us with a text which will lead to a further delay in amending the Directive of 1991.
We had hoped that this new version would be pushed through in first reading.
It now seems likely we will have to go through a mediation process, because we simply cannot accept the academic and impractical position adopted by the Finance Ministers, which Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs do not agree with either.
It is impossible to impose the transfer of existing money laundering rules for financial service providers lock, stock and barrel to all other professional groups such as lawyers and tax consultants and then insinuate that we simply wanted to protect the guild of lawyers.
This is just not the case.
It makes no sense that lawyers cannot settle an insurance claim or that brokers cannot draw up a plan until they have established their credentials.
It makes just as little sense to demand that cash only be handed over from person to person.
Such a demand would mean that bank night safe-deposit boxes would have to be set up immediately.
This would cause problems, however, for business people, especially from small and medium-sized businesses, who, for obvious reasons of security, deposit their day' s takings in the safe-deposit box of their bank after the banks have closed.
That, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the laundering of money from criminal activity.
I fully endorse the reasonable position adopted by the rapporteur, which the Finance Ministers could also live with.
They at least should know that any further delay in amending the money-laundering Directive is irresponsible, especially since the money-laundering mafia is becoming increasingly adept.
As a Member of the European Parliament who comes from Luxembourg, the effectiveness of the fight against the laundering of money from criminal activity lies very close to my heart, as the Grand Duchy has some of the strictest laws on money laundering.
These laws and their application as well as the cooperation resulting from the 1991 Directive must not be undermined by a too broadly interpreted definition of 'criminal activity' , which is what is called for under the common position adopted by the Council.
For reasons of efficiency, the directive should essentially be limited to combating the laundering of money from organised crime, which was its original objective.
Money flows which remain invisible to taxation and government statistics are still what many in business aim for.
Their view is that the government should not interfere in their profits and possessions.
Attempts are once again being made, rightly so, to get a tighter grip on money-laundering practices.
On the one hand, that requires the proposed measures to be as fool proof as possible, without escape routes for profiteers who refuse to meet the legal requirements.
I have the impression that the Council' s proposals are still too weak in this respect, and even the adjustments proposed by the rapporteur at second reading still leave something to be desired.
On the other hand, there is the fear that lawyers have been required to act as investigation officials at the expense of their clients.
In this case, this may be justified.
Nonetheless, this sets an undesired precedent.
Lawyers should not be required to act against those whom they have to protect.
By, however, drawing a distinction in recital 16a between the actual role of lawyers and this profession' s other activities, it might be possible to avoid this precedent.
I will therefore give the proposal the benefit of the doubt.
I support measures to tighten controls in the fight against money laundering by obliging banks and professionals to report clients under suspicion to the authorities.
Billions of pounds are lost every year across the European Union due to money laundering and fraud.
When we think of crime, an image of burglaries, violent muggings and knife attacks by gangs of youths on our streets often springs to mind.
Money laundering is an unseen crime, but it costs the taxpayer dearly and those found guilty should pay the price.
Those misusing the financial system should be caught and punished.
Moreover, money laundering is responsible for financing the evil trade in drugs, trafficking in humans and other horrific crimes.
We should not turn a blind eye to crimes of this kind.
We must crack down on banks and professionals, encouraging them to report clients under suspicion to the authorities.
We should even extend the scope of this proposal to include high-spending gamblers and auctioneers at the top end of the market.
Madam President, this issue is an important one at a European level.
Money laundering is not simply restricted to Manchester or to Madrid.
It knows no borders, and tainted money changes hands across regions and countries.
It is not enough to enforce purely British legislation, but measures must be taken across the EU.
We must work together to tackle this challenge.
Therefore, I applaud the efforts of this House to curb the use of the financial system for money laundering.
Graefe zu Baringdorf Report (A5-0079/2001)
We have voted for the recommendation for the sole reason that it advocates some sensible measures, like, for example, 'the positive definition of permissible feed materials' .
Even if the Council and the Commission were to end up accepting the amendments tabled, however, and at the moment they are rejecting them and dithering, that would not acquit the leaders of the European institutions of the massive responsibility for the propagation of BSE they incurred by refusing to take precautionary measures as soon as the threat represented by that endemic disease became tangible.
That was not even mere negligence or carelessness, it was a deliberate choice, under pressure from the agrifood lobbies.
It is yet another tragic demonstration that the vocation of protecting the profits of capitalist groups is incompatible with effective defence of the interests of the majority of the population.
Mr President, I voted for the report presented so well by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
'Why is that?' you may ask, Mr President.
I listened very carefully to both Commissioner Fischler's words and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report.
This report tells us that the maximum quantity for guaranteed dried feedingstuffs is being increased and that the rate of yield for peas is being increased by EUR 6.
Well then, the fact that these amendments have been included makes me particularly happy to have voted for the report, for I feel that they will be very useful for the progress of European common agriculture.
As the rapporteur states, it is important that the manufacturer of compound feedingstuffs, or whoever is responsible for labelling, provides a detailed list of all the raw materials used. The compulsory definition of acceptable raw materials in compound feedingstuffs for animals is also crucial, bearing the BSE and dioxin crises in mind.
We must also ensure that all materials that put human and animal health at risk are banned.
Nevertheless, this report was framed during a broader discussion of animal feedingstuffs, on which the Commission made a statement regarding the options for encouraging the planting of protein crops in the EU, taking account of the Agricultural Council of December 2000, which bans the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, and insists on the need to replace animal protein with vegetable protein.
The Commission' s proposal is based mainly on budgetary consequences, forgetting the basic principle of the sovereignty of food, when it states that the best and cheapest solution is to increase Community soya imports by 5%. This will make the EU more dependent for its vegetable protein, particularly soya meal, which could threaten food safety, on imports of genetically modified soya from the USA.
Using the pretext of WTO rules and costs, the Commission is refusing to increase aid for growing oilseed crops because they contravene the Blair House agreement. Similarly it refuses to support the use of fallow land under the set-aside system, because this would be in conflict with the WTO' s blue box that requires agricultural aid to be conditional upon production-limiting measures.
In this way, the Commission is refusing to encourage production within the EU. This is an unacceptable position, which we should reject, although we support the report, for which we have voted.
Politics is like drilling through thick planks of wood and, far too often, the only way forward is bit by bit.
We all know that, in times like these, it is a political imperative that we give people a feeling of security.
We need openness, labelling and transparency.
Politically mature citizens want to decide for themselves what to eat.
It is clear that this demand cannot relate solely to the end product.
So we have a fundamental interest in documenting the history of our food and making it transparent.
Farmers on the ground are responsible for animal protection and food safety.
They must be held accountable for what they feed to their animals, not only to secure their own economic success (though this is a factor we should not lose sight of) but also to satisfy consumers.
When I look at individual actions, I sometimes get the impression that time is running away from us.
My own land in Germany, Rheinland-Pfalz, has introduced a seal of approval for beef which aims to guarantee not only the origin of the animal but its history and what it has been fed.
The feedingstuffs industry has come on board of its own free will and offers an open declaration of feed materials and stronger controls.
Farmers would otherwise buy their feed elsewhere: only with this information can they get the seal of approval.
I hope in future there will be more such self-imposed obligations.
This would set the wheel in motion and feedingstuff manufacturers would be practically forced to make an open declaration out of economic necessity.
In the here and now, however, it is a question of taking a political decision and establishing the legal bases, which must be the same for everybody.
That is why we need the open declaration. We need traceability and we also need controls.
I hope that the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf will set the wheel turning.
I do not understand the Commission' s position in opposing a positive list at all.
Sanders-ten Holte Report (A5-0093/2001)
Mr President, like many of the Members, including yourself, I am sure, in two hours' time I will be on a plane.
I have read Mrs Sanders-ten Holte's report, which is rightly concerned that compensation should be provided in the unfortunate event - excuse me a moment while I touch wood - of a plane crash.
However, I call upon Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte to ensure, in the future, the application of more effective control measures to avoid aeroplane accidents, so that, whenever I take a plane, I can think of Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, whose photo I will stick to the seat in front of me, not just as the rapporteur of a document providing for our compensation in the case of an accident, but, above all, as the rapporteur of a document which will reduce the number of aeroplane accidents.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out how important it is that the Regulation is implemented in conformity with the provisions of the Montreal Convention.
A uniform Regulation on liability in air transport creates transparency.
It protects the interests not only of passengers but also of carriers which can maintain the generally recognised standards in international air transport.
The competitiveness of European air carriers must not be impaired through liability rules which are not covered by the Montreal Convention.
In order to create a uniform Regulation in conformity with the provisions of the Montreal Convention, I call on the Member States to ratify this Convention as soon as possible.
CamisÃ³n Asensio Report (A5-0096/2001)
Mr President, this document coordinates rail, road and inland waterway transport.
How delightful, Mr President, for me, the representative of the Pensioners' Party in Italy, to be able to vote for this document.
You might think, Mr President, that it has nothing to do with pensions and pensioners, but that is not the case.
It does concern pensioners.
If these measures are implemented, then, indeed, transport will be heavier on railways, inland waterways and roads, freight will be moved more quickly and the level of toxic emissions emanating from congested motorways and badly organised communications, toxins which, when inhaled by our citizens, cause serious diseases, will be reduced.
In actual fact, there are many pensioners who have been made ill by this bad road circulation, and that increases social security costs in our States, which is not a good thing for pensioners.
That is the connection, Mr President.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report aims to divert goods transport from the road to rail, inland waterways and combined transport with the aid of subsidies.
I find this fundamentally questionable. For one thing, Article 87 of the EC Treaty quite clearly states that subsidies in this form are not permissible.
For another, we have guaranteed a situation whereby subsidies will have a diverting function.
I find this fundamentally questionable.
I also wonder why, ten years after liberalising the transport markets, we are now starting to use taxes and subsidies to divert and control.
In principle, this cannot be positive for the future of the transport market.
Kessler Report (A5-0094/2001)
I concur with the gist of Mr Costa' s opinion.
However, there is one element which I am struggling with.
Recital 14 and Article 4 provide for the possibility of government aid being deployed for the use of infrastructure. This is also possible pursuant to the amendments.
In my opinion, this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable.
First of all because the starting premise is wrong, for transport by road already pays the lion' s share of the external costs.
Secondly, it is not judicious to grant extra support for the use of infrastructure.
Take rail, for example: the costs are not the most important reason why transporters do not opt for rail.
We need an increase in quality and reliability, and market discipline is then the best incentive.
I fear that this incentive for a modal shift, of which we are of course in favour, is counterproductive, brings about distortion of competition and undermines the work that has been done in the framework of the rail liberalisation package.
I will therefore be voting against recital 14 and Article 4.
They do not belong in this Regulation.
The first part of the report by Mrs Kessler - a name that, in the minds of us Italians, invokes two beautiful, excellent, very famous German ballerinas and which therefore lifts my spirits, despite the fact that the subject of the document is somewhat tedious - states, with regard to Grotius II, that there are funds for training, work experience placement exchanges, studies, research, meetings and seminars in the field of judicial cooperation, money which will go to judges, public prosecutors, lawyers, law officials, experts and interpreters.
I hope that the next document will stipulate that these funds are also to go to pensioners from these professions, who will certainly be able to give expert opinions on judicial cooperation.
. Given the seriousness of problems concerning crime, no one can doubt the need for greater cross-border cooperation, networking and mutual recognition in criminal matters.
However, I had a certain reservation in supporting the report because at present there is an alarmingly one-sided quality in our approach.
Too little attention is given in our debates or in the instruments upon which we vote to vital issues of civil liberty.
These concern the rights of persons accused of crimes who are entitled in all our systems to the presumption of innocence until guilt is proved.
These rights are guaranteed under Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
Experience shows, however, that interpretation of the rights in question is variable throughout the Union.
Sometimes prosecuting authorities ignore them with apparent impunity.
I call for greater and better attention to these points.
For example, when are we to see proposals for a EuroBail system?
Mutual recognition should facilitate common provision for conditional release pending trial.
It is a scandal that in many Member States people awaiting trial may spend many months needlessly in detention prior to trial.
This requires the most urgent attention of everyone in this Parliament.
Kessler Report (A5-0091/2001)
Mr President, I supported this document on the establishment of a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, particularly because it lays down that information sheets - vade-mecum - are to be issued so that those who are involved in this European Judicial Network know how to apply it practically.
I therefore hope that this vade-mecum, this instruction sheet, will also include the procedures that European citizens who have pension issues to resolve can follow in order to contact the European judicial authorities established in a network in civil and commercial matters, for civil matters include pension issues as well.
I wish to state briefly the reasons why I am supporting the Kessler report.
With the expansion of the single market and with the introduction of the euro currency, there are now greater opportunities for cross-border trade and commerce in Europe.
Also, with the wider globalisation of the marketplace, there is a necessity for a greater co-operation and understanding of different legal systems.
In any democratic system, the arm of justice must not only operate effectively but must be seen to do so and it must command the respect of the people.
The quicker and easier it is for the resolution of legal conflicts, then the better it is for the protection of legal rights and also to guarantee the conditions concerning the certainty of trade.
Therefore, the setting up of the EUROJUST programme with the co-operation of the judiciaries within the various EU Member States is a very important movement towards building a greater understanding of justice.
However, this should not be seen as an attempt to subvert or subjugate the systems operating within the various Member States of the EU.
Rather, it should be seen as an enhancement to implementing a speedy resolution of disputes by introducing a greater clarity in legal judgements.
I particularly recommend the point in relation to the establishment of a centralised electronic European Union judgment registry, which has been initiated by an Irish lawyer Twinkle Egan.
This will make it easier to understand differing judgements and to help build a greater consistency in how precedents operate.
May I congratulate my Socialist colleague Margot Kessler on her report which extends the existing European judicial network in criminal matters to civil and commercial law.
I fully support this common-sense strategy which broadens the system of cooperation between national authorities.
This will not only simplify judicial cooperation between the Member States, but it will also facilitate cross-border legal procedures.
Increased judicial cooperation is an important step forward for my constituents in the North-West who are sometimes desperate for help with a case in another EU country.
For example, a young parent whose children have been abducted by the other parent from the UK to France, will certainly be assisted by greater understanding between the British and French legal services.
So would the elderly couple who have exchanged their hard-earned cash for a holiday home in the south of Spain and have faced legal battles with the purchase.
It is significant that this network becomes part of the existing trans-European network for the electronic exchange of data.
In light of enlargement, the applicant countries should also be allowed to participate in the contact meetings.
Data will therefore be exchanged on the European judicial network from England to Estonia, making life remarkably easier for the authorities.
Madam President, I very much welcome increased judicial cooperation which will be of tremendous benefit to all our citizens seeking legal advice or bringing forward cases across the European Union.
JovÃ© Peres Report (A5-0098/2001)
Auroi Report (A5-0117/2001)
. (PT) I welcome the rapporteur' s proposals amending the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution by the Community to certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing the control, inspection and surveillance systems applicable to the common fisheries policy.
Control is important in guaranteeing a form of fishing that is responsible, sustainable and fair and the Community must therefore finance its costs and the necessary investment, bearing in mind that each Member State is responsible for implementing the system in its own economic area.
The Council' s proposal maintains the continuity of the cofinancing system, but limits the time framework, the financial participation and the type of actions funded.
The rapporteur proposes increasing Community cofinancing from 30% to 35% in training and investment actions, with 100% financing of eligible expenditure disbursed by the Member States for control and surveillance activities under EU participation in regional fishing organisations.
Furthermore, I think it is unacceptable that here too, the proposal for a decision is attempting to make budgetary savings, by reducing the budget for these actions from EUR 41 million per year to EUR 35 million per year, which is in conflict with the need to create an appropriate infrastructure to cover control and surveillance programmes that may involve an increase in the actual financial burden.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I just want to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. They voted unanimously for the six amendments that allow this report to go beyond the Commission' s proposal, which only sought to unfreeze land for organic farmers and primarily to remain within the context of the COM agreements.
The whole of Parliament wanted to go further and send a positive signal to breeders generally and also, at least initially, to farmers doing environmental work.
I venture to hope, on behalf of my group, and no doubt on behalf of many others, that the Council will understand and follow our lead in the matter.
As I said yesterday, Mrs Auroi' s report points in the right direction although, of course, the context is such that the proposals cannot measure up to our vegetable protein needs.
Reading the Commission' s report on vegetable proteins in the context of the ban on meat and bone meal, I was deeply shocked by the authors' apparent contempt for their fellow citizens.
First, contempt for consumers: the Commission' s position takes no account of the clear, strong and growing demand on the part of consumers for traceability and visibility in product origin.
Here the proposal is simply to go on buying the proteins we lack as cheaply as possible in the great world supermarket for agricultural surpluses.
So what if they contain GMOs?
Then, contempt for farmers: the Commission' s resignation is an insult to European farmers, suggesting they are incapable of producing the vegetable proteins we need on our own soil.
The measures proposed in the Commission' s seven- point plan (authorising the production of fodder legumes on land set aside on organic farms) is sympathetic but in no way commensurate with the challenge.
Between organic production and massive imports of genetically modified soya, there is a margin for the creativity of European farmers.
In fact one could say the Commission is trying to find technical, regulatory and budgetary arguments for refusing to act.
It is presenting us with a 'non-plan' for proteins.
The Commission is demonstrating an accountant' s logic which is not even economically relevant: the fact that soya is cheap at the moment does not mean it will always be cheap. A price rise is bound to come.
(The President cut the speaker off pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
The rapporteur has improved on the Commission' s initial proposal as far as she can and bearing in mind the emergency procedure, which was laid down in the package of seven measures to combat the crisis in the beef and veal market.
The Commission' s proposal was one-sided and limited and sought to make it possible, only for organic farms, to grow fodder on land set aside under the COM in cereals.
Given the Community deficit in vegetable protein production, the limitations of the Blair House agreement and the ban on the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, it has become necessary to create a genuine internal system of support for the production of fodder legumes and protein crops.
The rapporteur' s proposal, which I support, seeks to open up the same opportunity for conventional livestock farms and for farms covered by any agro-environmental programme in order to achieve a broad concept of fodder legumes, bearing in mind the importance, as we proposed for Portugal, of beans, sweet lupin and yellow lupin.
Nevertheless, the proposal lacks a real system of incentives for fodder legume and oilseed production, which might require the use of aid under the set-aside scheme or tying this partially to the production of fodder legumes, or through a change to set-aside assistance when fodder legumes are grown there.
The Commission would need to present specific proposals to this effect and not remain bound by budgetary constraints and by the World Trade Organisation.
Following the recent discoveries of the dangers inherent in feedingstuffs, especially in the economically advanced countries of the EU and, in particular, the problem of BSE caused by using animal proteins as feedingstuffs, meat and bonemeal should have been completely banned as a feedingstuff and replaced with vegetable proteins produced in the Community, so that Community farmers would not be dependent on soya from the United States.
In other words, the CAP should have been reviewed in its entirety, encompassing both the feedingstuffs sector and the farming sector which produces feedingstuffs.
In our view, the quota system should have been reviewed, especially in the Mediterranean countries, and in Greece in particular, where quotas are far below self-sufficiency and potential production levels and where the method of producing animal proteins is far healthier than the method used in the economically advanced countries of the EU, where quotas far exceed requirements, with the result that they export the dangers inherent in their feedingstuffs to all the countries with shortfalls, including Greece.
We should also examine the system for pricing and subsidising fodder crops, so as to support fodder legumes, with a view to guaranteeing cheap, top quality vegetable proteins and protecting the environment, given that legumes restore the soil and are ideally suited to crop rotation programmes, especially with the soil and climate in the Mediterranean.
Instead of which, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used various tricks, believing that the problem of BSE will be forgotten in time, in an endeavour to restore animal protein in animal feedingstuffs in six months' time.
In other words, it is endeavouring to restore meat and bonemeal which, it has now been proven, is responsible for BSE, disregarding public health in order to serve the interests of the Community feedingstuffs industry.
These endeavours are confirmed by decisions on the matter so far and discussions taking place in official circles.
The alibi which the Committee is using for these endeavours takes the form of the proposal to cultivate certain land set aside from arable crops with fodder legumes, allegedly in order to increase the production of vegetable proteins; at the same time, however, it bans the production of seed on this land and restricts it solely to hay production, and unsubsidised hay production at that.
Under this proposal, little or no vegetable proteins will be produced, even in countries with extensive set aside.
For Greece, however, and perhaps for other Mediterranean countries, the proposal is meaningless because they have little or no set aside.
The Commission proposal does absolutely nothing to resolve the problem of protein in Community fodder, and, as a result, it deliberately and consciously finds a 'solution' either in the Community meat and bonemeal responsible for BSE or in modified soya from the United States, which may well be equally dangerous to public health, as well as making Community livestock farmers dependent on the multinationals which market soya and soya products.
Because the Commission proposal does not make use of the productive potential in the Member States in order to resolve the problem of proteins, and feedingstuffs in general, once and for all and in a way which safeguards public health, because the purpose of the proposal is to mislead farmers and consumers, so that the dangerous method of producing proteins for animal feed can continue, and because I have no desire to help, even indirectly, in perpetuating this serious public health problem and deceiving arable and livestock farmers, I shall not vote in favour of the Commission proposal. I believe that my vote will act as an incentive and that the production of healthy and suitable feedingstuffs will become the subject of an objective fight on the part of the people of the Community.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, among the package of seven measures proposed by the Commission in order to deal with the BSE crisis is the modification of the basic regulation on herbaceous crops in order to permit, in the context of organic farming, the use of set-aside land for growing some leguminous fodder crops for feeding livestock.
As a background we have the ban of the use of meat and bone meal - a temporary ban that many of us trust will become permanent - and the now long-term EU deficit of vegetable proteins.
The Commission proposal is going in the right direction but it limits itself to proposing a symbolic modification, the impact of which, limited solely to organic farming, is not going to give visible results.
Mrs Auroi' s report, with the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, correct this timid proposal by extending it to farms that operate in accordance with Regulation 1257/99 on rural development, and by including, from 2002, the growing of leguminous fodder crops on land left fallow in conventional livestock farms.
In this way we may be able to effectively counteract the EU' s dependence on supplies of proteins that are in many cases genetically modified and, as they are used to feed livestock, are introduced into the food chain without any opportunity for control on the part of consumers.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore supported the amendments adopted in the Committee responsible and there is nothing more for us to do than hope that the Commission will take them into account along with the successive requests from members of this House for effective progress to be made towards a visible correction of the European deficit of vegetable proteins.
Foot-and-mouth disease (RC B5-0303/2001)
Mr President, I wanted to justify our vote straight away, but unfortunately you did not notice in this confusion.
This Chamber knows that I have asked for a serious debate since the start.
As Members of Parliament of the Austrian People' s Party in the European Parliament, we have spoken out against this resolution because we believe and we are convinced that it does not reflect what we imagine European agricultural policy to be.
It is clear that, with such resolutions, the real existential anxiety and need of European farmers cannot be addressed, given that there are 80 different types of virus and 300 million animals in Europe.
I would like to point out that in Austria more than 60% of land consists of mountains and disadvantaged regions.
We rely on exports and we must do our utmost to ensure that these regions remain inhabited.
I actually find it frivolous to make policy on a day-to-day basis at the expense of farmers.
I cannot imagine how animals that have been vaccinated can be labelled.
Mr President, consumer protection is a matter of great concern to all of us in this House.
I do not believe that consumers would pay tribute to us for that, as it would only lead to further loss of confidence.
The European Parliament' s resolution on foot-and-mouth disease deserves to be approved, notably because it steps back from the policy of slaughter, which can be useful selectively, but scarcely seems effective in a case like that of Great Britain.
Public opinion is doubtful, and it is right.
So the resolution we have just voted on is rightly geared towards authorisation of urgent vaccination, either in a particular region affected by foot-and-mouth disease, or in a 'buffer' region, or in the case of rare breeds.
Beyond these urgent measures, we might wonder why foot-and-mouth, once common in the countryside of Europe, and not usually fatal to animals (let alone humans), should now be producing a national crisis.
The answer is two-fold.
First, the disease spreads faster than before because agriculture has become massively geared towards production, and is therefore highly specialised and fragmented.
One animal can spend different stages of its life in several parts of a country, or even of Europe.
It is transported many times, the link with the original breeder is broken and traceability becomes unreliable.
So we think it is important to re-establish more stable rearing, where everyone knows who is responsible and where animals are not treated like inert merchandise.
That is part of the agricultural reform we are proposing for the years ahead.
Secondly, the massive slaughter seems to be motivated by economic reasons which are not always transparent.
One of these appears to be a determination to maintain exports at any price, because some purchaser countries regard meat from vaccinated animals as indistinguishable from meat from sick animals. Under those circumstances vaccination would be useless from the economic point of view, because in both cases the meat is worth less.
I find this financial reasoning absurd.
Surely exports could be accompanied by a vaccination certificate?
And why must absolutely everything be subordinated to exports? That just contributes to productivity-driven farming and necessitates subsidies which cost the taxpayer dear, all to achieve, ultimately, the destabilisation of farming in less developed countries.
The system is verging on insanity, and things will have to be put back on an even keel in the near future.
With 'mad cows' agri-industry created a new disease fatal to humans, and we still do not know how to cure it.
Foot-and-mouth, though, is an ancient disease. It does not affect humans and the majority of animals recover from it.
With the development of the world market in cattle and meat, however, agri-industry has given it an international epidemic dimension it did not have before.
The market imposes its own health requirements too, with tragic consequences.
The use of vaccine has been banned on purely economic grounds, 'economic' here being reduced to commercial regulations and an estimate of the financial costs which is in some respects questionable.
Hundreds of thousands of healthy (or curable) animals are being slaughtered purely in the name of an accountant' s calculation of profitability.
The decision-makers have only the market rules they have invented themselves to set against the despair of the farmers whose herds are being destroyed.
Elementary respect for life, protection of local economies, maintenance of a thriving social fabric in the rural environment, and the living and working conditions of country people have all been ignored in the definition of health policies in response to the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
All that remains is the power of the market and its laws of bronze.
It is definitely high time we freed ourselves from that power.
. (DE) In view of the fact that foot-and-mouth has broken out in at least four Member States, the foot-and-mouth vaccine which was adopted throughout Europe in 1991 must be screened and even abandoned.
Politicians such as the German Agriculture Minister, Renate KÃŒnast, who reject foot-and-mouth vaccination must reconsider.
The reasons for a ban that were valid then do not apply today, since improved foot-and-mouth vaccines have been introduced.
Nonetheless, research into the development and manufacture of foot-and-mouth vaccines must continue.
In particular, the following vaccinations should be authorised by the European Commission: emergency vaccinations (ring vaccinations) in regions hit by foot-and-mouth and in zones which are contiguous to regions hit by foot-and-mouth and for zoo animals.
The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which has followed on from 'mad cow disease' , has made the crisis in the livestock industry worse.
It has penalised farmers and has increased people' s lack of confidence in the safety of agricultural produce.
The liberalisation of agriculture and the free movement of goods have increased the risk and the spread of animal diseases with a CAP that, in the name of competitiveness and constant price reduction has promoted the concentration, intensification and centralisation of production.
In the current context, those who have been penalised most heavily are the producers, although we have not seen the necessary aid for compensation or sufficient contingency measures, in this case for foot-and-mouth disease.
I have therefore proposed the creation of a specific budget line within the EU budget, to support farmers and measures for eradicating animal diseases, given the food, health and veterinary crisis.
Given the spread of the disease, it makes sense to temporarily suspend the movement of animals between Member States and to increase controls on meat that is sold, and it is regrettable that the recent Agricultural Council did not take a decision on this matter.
In addition to short-term measures, however, we also need a new type of agricultural policy, which protects production and supports changes in production methods.
We need a policy that promotes the quality and safety of food in line with the precautionary principle.
We need a form of farming that is sustainable and which promotes the specific characteristics of each region and a greater variety of aid for agricultural produce, bearing in mind the varying levels of agricultural development.
We need a form of farming that contributes to economic and social cohesion and which is based firmly on family farming and on small and medium-sized holdings.
While I am not happy with every aspect of the compromise resolution, it does reflect the determination of the European Parliament to urgently address the serious threat of foot-and-mouth disease.
I have voted against sections of the resolution which deal with general vaccination and supported amendments which allow protective emergency vaccination, at the request of Member States.
Given that the source of Britain's first outbreak originated outside the EU, I have called for an urgent review of cross-border controls to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.
From an Irish perspective, we strongly favour a non-vaccination policy, and have made every effort to contain the country's single outbreak - so far with success.
As an island nation, exporting 90% of the country's beef production, our animal health status is a priority.
This resolution makes clear that any resort to protective vaccination during the present outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease would be at the request of a Member State.
In view of the confinement of FMD to one corner of Scotland, in Dumfries and Galloway and nearby, the Scottish National Party has taken and will continue to take a strong line in favour of maintaining the policy of culling and destroying to restore disease-free status in Scotland according to present international standards.
This is vital to Scotland's capacity to maintain its worldwide reputation for high-quality meat.
We have condemned dodges by Mr Blair's government that appear more calculated to secure electoral convenience than to serve the public interest and I repeat this condemnation here.
My willingness to support the resolution was entirely conditional on incorporation of an oral amendment extending a commitment to financial help to trade and tourism where these have been adversely affected.
I am delighted that my amendment was unanimously accepted, and that the resolution with this amendment was carried.
Commerce and centralism are the backbone of the European Union' s current policy.
Based on the notion that this will strengthen Europe' s position on the global market, silly measures are being imposed on all Member States.
The course of affairs with regard to foot-and-mouth is the latest illustration of this failing.
Between 1956 and 1992, we had managed to control this animal disease effectively thanks to a massive preventive vaccination campaign.
Due to the one-sided consideration of export interests, we are back where we were half a century ago.
Instead of introducing preventive vaccination and banning the transport of live animals over long distances, a choice is now being made in favour of pointless mass slaughter in order to destroy healthy animals.
In the absence of the possibility of vaccination, this primitive approach is considered to be the only means of curbing the further spread of the disease.
Even rare animals in nature reserves and zoos are now being sacrificed to the mad ban on vaccination.
Farmers are bewildered and at their wits' end.
Restricted emergency vaccination and taking time out for further research are not solving the problem.
In my opinion, the Member States can no longer adhere to the vaccination ban and must carry out vaccination immediately, even if this should lead to an even further setback in exports.
I find myself with some difficulty in supporting this proposal as it stands.
While I have changed my mind about vaccination in an emergency, I have some problem with the view that it can be used without the eventual slaughter of those animals vaccinated.
It is clear to me that to adopt such a policy would not be in the best long-term interest of the European export industry.
The Standing Veterinary Committee makes it clear that no vaccine has yet been developed that would differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals.
I agree that we should encourage the development of new vaccines that would give us more flexibility, better tracing and would ensure that we could continue to export to other countries, and we should develop improved controls on imports into anywhere in the EU, for it is clear we imported foot-and-mouth in the UK illegally.
Stockholm European Council: Economic and social aspects (RC B5-0237/2001)
Mr President, before explaining why I voted against this document of the Stockholm European Council, I must explain why I am speaking in English.
It is to make a present to the Italian interpreters, the Italian workers who, every day, have to work much more than the others to translate and put in writing my explanations of votes.
I am doing this in recognition of their hard work.
I voted against all Stockholm resolutions because there is no mention of the fact that European workers want to work less and have more time as pensioners.
We cannot accept the conclusions of the Stockholm European Council because, as I said during the debate, they amount to a ragbag of all the issues in no order of priority. They give the impression of a Europe with its tentacles in everything, which does not distinguish big issues from small, or the national level from the European.
That is damaging to the whole Union. The European Council, which is taking on increasing weight in the institutional balance, ought to present especially clear conclusions.
To make the necessary improvements the preparation for Councils must be reformed, but also, more profoundly, European powers must be clarified and lightened, and those issues should be on the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
In our view, rational and well-ordered conclusions ought to consist of three parts:
the first part should be devoted to certain vital issues of strategy, which the Council would have discussed thoroughly, and on which it would have taken some real decisions.
The second part would give instructions for implementation to the various Councils of Ministers.
Finally, the third part, which should be the most substantial, could set out certain guidelines that the Heads of State and Government intend to follow in their respective countries, particularly as regards managing the economy and social affairs - which was on the Stockholm agenda.
These guidelines would not be restrictive, and the expression of contrary opinions would be tolerated.
They would thus demonstrate a determination to develop free, informal and open coordination, respectful of national democratic choices.
Reading the Stockholm conclusions, we can see how far away we are from that.
In fact our motion for a resolution calls for thorough reform of the Treaty, involving the restoration of numerous powers to the Member States.
Every summit goes one step further in damaging the workers' interests and the Stockholm Summit was no exception.
Yet again, the summit' s sights were set on pension and social rights, with workers being called on to work more and receive less.
It is clear from their joint declaration that the Heads of State or Government of the ÃU are anxious about the increase in the number of pensioners, which they feel "will create substantial pressure on social welfare systems, in particular pensions, health care systems and care of the elderly";.
In other words 'prosperity' is being jeopardised by the increase in longevity.
And the solution is to increase employment in the 55-64 age group by 50% by 2010, at a time when workers, especially young people and women, are suffering from the scourge of unemployment and under-employment.
On the subject of the Balkans, they are continuing their policy of controlled destabilisation and, alongside their supposedly friendly stance towards the FYROM, they are endeavouring to promote the KLA as an equal negotiating partner with the government of the country.
It is perfectly obvious that the imperialist plans for the region have not yet been completed and that the people will be unable to live in peace until ÃÃÃÃ withdraws.
As far as Palestine is concerned, they are continuing their policy of maintaining the same distance from the state terrorism being applied by Israel and the just fight of the Palestinian people for a homeland.
On the economic front, they have limited state aid and subsidies, taken further steps to liberalise telecommunications, postal services, the railways and energy and have prepared to complete the sell-off of the public sector to the multinationals.
The joint motions for resolutions not only accept the summit conclusions, they also welcome the arrest of former President of Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic, and call for him to be handed over to the 'International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia' in The Hague, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against them.
The Stockholm European Council is happy with the European Union' s achievements and has announced that its 'strategic goal' remains "to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world" .
The working classes certainly have nothing to be happy about.
To say that 'unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 1991' is an involuntary way of recognising that it is still as high as it was ten years ago, when it was already catastrophic.
In addition, the balance sheet for these ten years includes the widespread introduction, throughout Europe, of poorly paid casual work and the decline of wages as a proportion of national income.
Only big companies and their proprietors and shareholders, can be happy about the exceptional level of profits, because that result has been obtained at the expense of working people, as well as public services and social provision.
As to the future, we are promised a continuation of current policies.
Some points even threaten a worse situation, particularly in terms of longer working hours and attacks on retirement age.
We refuse to give an endorsement for the future to European institutions entirely at the service of industrial and financial groups.
For public opinion and the media, Stockholm had all the hallmarks of a routine summit.
In fact, had it not been for the announcement of the joint Franco-German decision to postpone setting a deadline for the full liberalisation of the energy market until there is greater mastery of all the consequences and all the effects, the summit would certainly have been overlooked by the newspapers and TV.
It was an important summit in economic and social terms, however, and entirely in line with the Lisbon Summit, with the reaffirmation of the need to take action to secure full employment and skilled jobs in Europe.
As it turns out, those guidelines have immediately run up against the brutal announcement of redundancy plans at Danone and Marks and Spencer, with no consultation and without even having any genuine economic reasons.
Veritable 'dictatorship' by the stock exchange and frenzied profit-seeking to the detriment of employees, when they are in fact the prime wealth creators, has demonstrated - to anyone who did not already know - what a vast gap there is between the soothing speeches of politicians and the reality experienced by employees on the ground.
So unless we want to acknowledge the death of the European social model, we cannot stand by and do nothing, and personally, since 31 March, I have been lobbying the highest European and French authorities to propose measures to end this diabolical spiral.
I am now waiting, like many in this Chamber, for precise and relevant responses.
If these are not forthcoming, there will be no point in organising any summits on employment and social policy in the future.
In the meantime, I support Francis Wurtz' s proposal to create an ad hoc structure within the European Parliament, a sub-committee or observatory to monitor and analyse the adjustment strategies that powerful economic groups base entirely on staff reductions.
There should be a European summit on this vital issue for the equilibrium and future of Europe, in the course of 2001.
That is the spirit in which I have voted today for the joint resolution tabled by the left.
Yet another summit serving private interests.
In Stockholm, the fate of Macedonia would appear to have been dealt with in a few minutes.
Farmers must make do with European 'solidarity' to cope with foot-and-mouth disease and rule out a return to the vaccination programme, cancelled a few years ago to save money.
This time financial services emerge as the great victors.
Between now and 2003 a single market in securities will be established to allow a few profiteers to speculate in shares and bonds.
So, in the utmost opacity, financial dealings are encouraged and will revolve even more rapidly in the hands of a few industrialists, playing with the fate of millions of employees in passing.
We demand, at European level, suspension of banking confidentiality, opening of account books, and transparency in all operations.
That would be an effective means of combating money laundering and controlling the financial enterprises of companies, like Danone and Marks and Spencer, which persist in sacking people while making record profits.
Finally, the private operators have obtained confirmation of the liberalisation of juicy public services - the post office, electricity and gas.
Current social mobilisation calls for another type of summit, to bring together the efforts to ensure the establishment of a high quality European public service that responds to the fundamental needs of the peoples.
Stockholm European Council: Financial Markets (B5-0244/2001)
Stockholm European Council: Foreign affairs (B5-0248/2001)
Despite the belittling of the results of the Stockholm Summit by most of the media, progress was made, responding to the objectives of the economic and financial groups that dominate the European economy, as the Commission' s proposal made very clear.
The path has therefore already been mapped out.
As in the story about the half-cup of water, some will see it as half full and some as half empty.
The Lisbon strategy to speed up liberalisation, particularly through privatising transport, postal services, electricity, gas and telecommunications, was, despite everything, consolidated at the Stockholm Council.
Furthermore, the process of integrating the financial markets was also speeded up.
With regard to recovering 'full employment' , this does not necessarily mean an increase in the number of quality jobs, particularly if this increase takes place at the expense of greater job insecurity.
With regard to the so-called 'modernisation of the European Social Model' , new attacks were made on the pensions system and changes to social security, with the method of open coordination in this area being started up and with this objective being included in the EU' s annual economic guidelines.
It is worth highlighting, however, that the tiny echoes from the social part of the Lisbon strategy are due to the efforts of the workers and all progressives who want to see an economy that pays more attention to people' s problems and sustainable development. This is what I too hope for.
Although many of the items here do actually move the agenda towards our vision of Europe, we simply cannot accept that there should be any enhancement of the role of the political institutions of the EU, especially the Commission, and development of what is termed 'The Community method' .
Third UN Conference (B5-0246/2001)
The EPLP has voted for the motion for a resolution on the Stockholm European Council.
However, we have reservations about paragraph 13.
The EPLP continues to have reservations, as was expressed at first reading of the framework directive on informing and consulting employees.
The EPLP supports the view of the UK Minister for Trade and Industry, Stephen Byers, that it may be inappropriate to have European-wide legislation in the area of information and consultation.
Mr Byers stated that for the UK, "our whole system of corporate structures is quite different from that on the continent.
However, in many respects, the directive reflects the continental system of corporate governance, not that in the United Kingdom.
The directive is not appropriate for several reasons, but the issue is important and we should deal with it in our domestic setting." (Commons Hansard Debates 18 January 2001)
The Stockholm Summit will not be remembered for its successes, the endeavours of the Swedish Presidency notwithstanding.
It did not manage to set up a European Food Safety Agency, despite the spread of foot-and-mouth and BSE.
It did not manage to agree on a common European patent system.
It continues to rely on the USA for a satellite location system, now that the Galileo programme has come to a standstill, and questions relating to the electricity market are no further forward than they were at the Lisbon Summit.
However, the main problem lies in the guidelines issued by the European Council on dismantling social protection mechanisms.
By obsessing on notions such as the 'ageing population' , the need to 'modernise the European social model' and the priority of 'the sustainability of public finances' in relation to social systems, they are covering, strengthening and legalising the attempt being made by numerous governments in the European Union - such as Greece - to dismantle social protection systems and hand the workers over to private insurance companies without so much as a guarantee.
I believe that the labour movement should react decisively to these negative guidelines from the European Council in Stockholm.
The June Movement will not vote in favour of rules which mean that officials are enabled to legislate instead of elected representatives in open assemblies whose work can be monitored.
With regard to the resolution that has been adopted today on the 'external relations' of the Stockholm Summit, against which I voted, I must mention some aspects in a explanation of vote that I am obliged to keep short.
First of all, where the Balkans are concerned, I must criticise an unacceptable and flagrant example of interference and blackmail towards the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the USA, which is trying to whitewash and cover up the responsibilities of NATO and all those who waged a war against Yugoslavia, in blatant breach of the UN Charter and from within the Security Council itself. This was a war in which arms containing depleted uranium were used, the chemical and radiological effects of which on the population and on the environment have still not been fully assessed.
The causes of the current situation in the Balkans are complex and deep-seated, but I must highlight the interfering role of the USA and the EU, which have significantly and, at times decisively, contributed to undermining a process whose consequences for the situation throughout the region are far from resolved. A strategy of selectively and arbitrarily criminalising certain political leaders is therefore unacceptable.
Secondly, and bearing in mind the extremely serious situation in the Palestinian territories, I consider the resolution' s provisions to be quite inadequate.
The resolution does not clearly and explicitly condemn the escalation of aggression by Israel, the bombings and the repression by the Israeli army against the Palestinian population or the intensification of the blockade imposed on the Palestinian territories.
Thirdly, we must be extremely concerned about the absence of criticism of the current militarisation of the EU, which has the instrument of the common defence policy, as the European pillar of NATO, and the absence of criticism of the North-American anti-missile shield project (AMS) whose completion would contribute to relaunching the arms race and to greater insecurity throughout the world.
Although the decision announced recently by the United States to reject the Kyoto Protocol has not come as a surprise, it is nonetheless extremely serious.
It comes as no surprise because despite the fact that the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, at successive United Nations Conferences designed to finalise the rules for implementing the Protocol, it has presented various excuses to block negotiations.
This is serious because national self-interest has won the day.
It is unacceptable that, given the increasingly dramatic predictions of the effects of global warming, the country mainly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions has refused to participate in the only international instrument designed to limit these effects.
As serious as this decision is, however, we cannot waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States.
It is crucial that we put a brake on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol - and no other type of agreement - is the most appropriate political instrument to achieve this objective.
The non-participation of the United States does make the Protocol less comprehensive, but does not detract from its raison d' Ãªtre.
This may make application of the protocol more difficult, but it does not make it impossible.
The statement by the United States and the fact that COP6 part II, a conference designed to adopt the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, forces the European Union to redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership in this political dossier.
Both internally, by countering the very harmful developments in greenhouse gas emissions in most Member States and externally, by negotiating the rules for implementing the Protocol with as many countries as possible to ensure that it is ratified and implemented by 2002.
The European also has the task of fighting to ensure that the rules of fair trade are implemented so that the United States cannot gain any illegal economic advantages from not ratifying the Protocol.
At the moment therefore, rather than insisting on a dialogue of the deaf with the United States, the European Union must implement an action plan that will enable us to implement Kyoto across the board, in other words, with as many countries as possible, and as a matter of urgency, by 2002.
This action plan must enable us to achieve the following set of timetabled goals:
I) To negotiate, even before COP6 part II, the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol with Russia, Japan, Australia, Canada and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in order to reach an agreement that can be ratified by more than 55 countries, corresponding to more than 55% of emissions, which is the minimum level required for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force;
II) For the EU to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2001;
III) To adopt National Reduction Plans for greenhouse gases by the end of 2001;
IV) To present the directive on the implementation of the European Emissions-Trading System by the end of 2001;
V) To present, under the European Programme for Climate Change, a raft of copper-bottomed directives on policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the industry, energy, services, agriculture and mainly, transport sectors, in which emissions are increasing most rapidly.
VI) For the European Commission to draft an economic study on the competitive advantages that American products, particularly in the field of energy, will gain illegally over European products as a result of the European Union not implementing the Kyoto Convention;
VII) For the European Commission to draft a legal study to determine the way in which, within supranational institutions, particularly the World Trade Organisation and the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, these illegal advantages, to which I referred in my previous point, can be minimised.
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning' s agenda.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
