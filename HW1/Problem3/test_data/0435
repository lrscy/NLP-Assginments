Good luck in your new job.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-elect of the Commission. I have asked to speak in order to welcome loudly and clearly the course of events in recent weeks and to express my satisfaction at the way in which the nomination of the Commission has been handled, both by you and by us.
Mr President-elect, the fact that you decided to delay the vote on the Commission, that you listened to the mood of Parliament and that you made welcome changes to the composition of the Commission, means that, you showed respect for Parliament and contributed both to its reputation and its strength.
Now is the time for Parliament to make an equally sensible move by supporting your Commission and contributing to its reputation and strength.
In my opinion, what is needed is the reciprocal strengthening of the roles of the main European institutions, which would lead, one would hope, to greater trust in both the European ideal and the European Union on the part of our fellow European citizens.
Mr President-elect of the Commission, Europe deserves a strong Parliament.
Europe deserves a strong Commission.
The tasks which await us in this mandate demand vision, boldness and, as you have correctly pointed out, a robust institutional partnership.
In any event, Europe needs strong political leadership.
At the very least there are two tasks which are essential.
The success of the Lisbon Strategy and the successful ratification of the European Constitutional Treaty.
In the case of the first task, Mr President-elect, you have said many words, but in the case of the second far too few.
Let me now finish by calling on you to ensure that the European Constitutional Treaty is successfully ratified as part of your personal and collective political responsibility.
I wish you every success in this task.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Barroso, your new Commission has a big responsibility for European economic development and for ensuring that such development takes account of the environment and is characterised by a high degree of social responsibility.
The Lisbon process is now like an oversized elephant in an exclusive glassware shop, that is to say very difficult to handle.
I hope that the new Commission finds the strength and courage to develop new working methods and to do some new thinking when it comes to what is, for Europe, such an incredibly important issue, that of sustainable economic growth.
This is not a prestige project, but one that is enormously important for those who reside, and lead their lives, in the geographical area for which Parliament and the Commission together have very considerable political responsibility.
Â Â  Madam President, the other day in Brussels I pointed out that, when the celebrated thinker Ortega was asked from what distance events had to be viewed in order to write history, he replied: "at a sufficient distance not to be able to see the profile of Cleopatraâs nose".
Leaving anecdotes aside, Madam President, I believe that today history is being made in the present tense and, in this historic present we are living through, the European Union is emerging as one of the main players.
With a total of 450 million people, 300 million of whom use a single currency, it is the main commercial, financial and industrial power, the main donor of development aid and a key player, though still a beginner, on the international stage.
I believe, Madam President, that, as Mr DurÃ£o Barroso has said, what the Commission has to do now is to get to work on the internal dimension of the project, the internal market and economic and monetary union â in accordance with the direction and the commitments of the Lisbon process, with a view to achieving sustained growth and job creation â and on its external action, Madam President, exporting our system of values, making our contribution to the peace process in the Middle East and restoring relations with the United States on the basis of our convictions.
Mr DurÃ£o Barroso, Quixote said "They bark, then we ride".
A majority of this House will be investing a great deal of political capital in you tomorrow.
Use that capital responsibly, create a strong Commission that serves the interests of the citizens, defend the common interest and, above all, establish a direction for the integration project.
Do so, Mr DurÃ£o Barroso, by fulfilling your commitment, with a strategic alliance with this Parliament, establishing â as Mr Coelho said a moment ago â a positive complicity, and I am sure that you will make a success of the European integration project, which is one of the most exciting projects of our times.
Mr President-elect of the Commission, I wish you the best of luck in that task.
Â Â  Mr President-elect of the Commission, the replacement of Commissioner Buttiglione is certainly a step forward but it is a goodwill gesture which, in our judgement, is still not enough.
We are still somewhat baffled by the decision to appoint Mrs Kroes to the Competition portfolio, even though you know that that office will clearly result in a situation where a conflict of interest may arise.
In an executive, and I can tell you this from the painful experience of the Italian Government, conflicts of interest give rise to the worst sort of politics.
Finally, there is still some opposition to some of the fundamental political choices that you presented to us in July: I refer to the ambiguity on the subjects of war and peace, to the excessive emphasis that you place on the market and on competitiveness, and to the acceleration that you wish to impose on the processes of liberalisation.
I allude to some of the political choices that we would equate, if I may say so, Mr President, clearly with the right.
For these reasons, Mr Barroso, you will not have our vote of confidence tomorrow.
Â Â  Madam President, I shall try to finish what I have to say before the roof collapses.
Mr Barroso, you persuaded me to vote for you this summer, and, now that the gun smoke is clearing and I can now inspect the battlefield, I have to say that I was right to give you my vote back then.
I said at the time that I thought that a President of the Commission had to be a leader and a democrat at the same time.
To be both is a tremendous balancing act and you have skilfully negotiated the tightrope.
The witch-hunt by the Greens against Mrs Kroes demands a response.
If you take their thinking to its logical conclusion, it would follow that a doctor could not be responsible for public health, a former trade union leader could not handle social policy, a woman could not deal with emancipation, and a Green could not head up environmental policy.
If ever I need a referee, I prefer to choose someone who can play football.
Moreover, nobody is bound by so stringent a code of conduct as a Commissioner, and that too is institutional reform.
Mr Barroso, your Commission has outstanding ambitions in the field of economic regeneration and the combating of discrimination.
Like my group, I expect more democratisation as well.
To sum up, the European Commission, as an institution, has, in fact, been held up in its work of submitting proposals for legislation since last Christmas, and I think it has slept for long enough now.
President Barroso, get on with waking up Sleeping Beauty and go in to bat.
Tomorrow, I think, this House will put you in a position to do so.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I trust that sound was not a sign that a storm is on its way, and I hope the weather will remain fine.
On behalf of the Polish delegation within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to lend my support to the second Barroso Commission.
It is with a heavy heart that we do so, for the changes made within the Commission are on the one hand unfair and on the other not far-reaching enough.
Yet the enlarged European Union is in need of a new Commission and of your strong leadership, MrÂ Barroso.
Our common European interest demands such leadership.
It is therefore the substance of the new Commissionâs policies that is now the issue at stake, not individual Commissioners.
What do we expect of the new Commission?
We expect it to implement three priorities.
Firstly, we hope it will complete enlargement.
This was initiated but not carried through.
Secondly, the Commission needs to maintain and develop the European Unionâs solidarity and cohesion.
Thirdly, it must develop the European Unionâs eastern dimension.
As I said, enlargement was carried out in formal terms, but has not been completed.
The important point here is that the new Member States should achieve equal involvement in all dimensions of the EUâs policies, as well as full and equal rights, and that they should be treated equally.
The second priority, and one which is particularly important for the new Member States, is the European Unionâs social and economic cohesion, something that flows from the ever-necessary principle of solidarity.
The Commissionâs most immediate task will be to convince the Council that the budget for the next seven years should correspond to the tasks entailed by EU enlargement.
As you said in July, MrÂ Barroso, âyou cannot have more Europe for less moneyâ.
We expect you to keep your word and support the budget proposals put forward by the Prodi Commission.
This House will be on your side, MrÂ Barroso.
The third priority is the eastern dimension and the new neighbourhood policy., We expect you to take a proactive approach to this policy, MrÂ Barroso.
We need a policy which is generous but not permissive, which is demanding but effective, a policy which exports the European model of democracy and a market economy, a policy which opposes violations of the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, a policy which promotes civil society and honest and free elections in Belarus and Ukraine, and an open-door policy for the European ambitions of a democratic Ukraine.
In conclusion, we support your Commission, MrÂ Barroso.
Trusting that it will focus on these priorities, we hope it will be a strong Commission and that you will be a strong leader.
Â Â  â Madam President, the changes Mr Barroso promised to make were the result of the strong stand taken by the European Parliament.
However, we still have concerns about important issues and we are calling for clear guarantees and commitments from Mr Barroso's Commission.
We are not giving you a .
We are particularly concerned and are seeking guarantees about the functioning of competition policy and the safeguarding of efficient controls in cases of conflict of interests.
We are calling for the honouring of commitments regarding civil liberties and the abolition of discrimination and we shall be watching the European Commission closely in this sector.
We are calling for the strengthening of the agreement on institutional relations with the European Parliament and, above all, Mr Barroso, we are calling for you to focus on sustainable development, employment, solidarity and cohesion and to strengthen the role of Europe as a force for peace and cooperation when you present your Commission's programme statements.
Madam President, Mr Barroso, with a sense of responsibility towards the citizens of Europe, we shall judge severely.
We shall control the political initiatives, the political acts and actions of the European Commission and the honouring of your commitments on a daily basis.
I repeat, we are not giving you .
Â Â  Madam President, President Barroso, our Italian delegation believes that you have missed the historic opportunity that this Parliament offered you: to present us with a Commission equal to the challenges the Union has to confront.
Mr Buttiglione was not the only problem in your feeble team: you have not done enough to have our full confidence, which, out of a sense of responsibility, we will not give you.
There remains, in fact, the serious question of conflict of interest in the most important portfolio â Competition â previously held masterfully by Mario Monti.
To Mr Mauro and the other group leaders we say: we made no concessions to Mr Buttiglione, we have condemned the effrontery of the Italian Government for demanding the Justice appointment, and we appreciate the preparation and the courtesy of Mr Frattini, without underestimating what remained unsaid.
However, we should have wished for equal rigour and strictness in the case of conflict of interest and the other heavy burdens hobbling your Commission, in which some Commissioners will be impeded from fully carrying out their mandate.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr Barroso, on 27 October you demonstrated that the stand which you took from the same tribune during your speech on your election in June was both solid and precise.
You said at the time that you would pay great attention to the views of the members of the European Parliament, even if they opposed your own.
On 27 October, you listened to the voice of Parliament and acted accordingly, with respect both for the role of Parliament and the confidence it placed in you in June.
This act on your part means that you believe deeply that politics are the art of composition, which the European Union itself personifies.
You yourself stated that the main role of the President of the European Commission was to manage the dynamic assent which Europe needs and you demonstrated that you were already faithfully following that principle.
We believe that the new composition which you have presented is more efficient and will respond to the issues of prosperity, solidarity and security.
However, I remember your statement that, if any member of the Commission were unable to perform their duties, you would have no hesitation in asking for their resignation.
This, in conjunction with the importance which you attach to democratic scrutiny by Parliament, gives us guarantees of sensible management.
We 11 Greek MEPs of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shall support the Commission with our vote, but we shall keep a close eye on your work and we shall voice our criticism to you if we find that you have deviated from your commitments.
Mr Barroso, we wish you broad support for your new Commission and every success in your difficult job.
Â Â  President Barroso, you have come back here to the European Parliament with a new approach and that is good.
I think and hope that you have substantially understood that the future of European democracy does not rest exclusively on two legs, the Council and the Commission, but that there is a third entity that counts and wants to count.
That third entity is the European Parliament.
I take note of the effort that you have made in this direction: whether it is in recognising, I hope definitively, the role of Parliament, or in modifying the composition of the team that will accompany you in the coming years.
However, certain problems remain unresolved, and they cannot be underestimated.
I shall stress two of them: the first concerns the guidelines for social policy that â to say nothing else â are well short of Europeâs needs for jobs, welfare and rights in the perspective of Lisbon.
The second problem is the presence in your team of Mrs Kroes.
I have the impression that this Commissioner will soon find herself in a mass of problems.
Her conflict of interest is now seen by all and with her confirmation, President Barroso, you are undermining yourself and your actions.
Although I appreciate some of your changes, these problems will not allow me to express my confidence in your Commission.
In any case, you have my best wishes in your work above all for the good of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President-elect of the Commission, in recent weeks we have been able to see the way in which you deal with this Parliament.
Such a method denotes a marked feeling for the European institutions.
That is why we are convinced that you will lead the Commission in the next five years in a way that is new and different from that of the recent past, carrying out a sort of Copernican revolution.
We are sure that we shall have a President who is not allied to this or that political camp.
Europe needs women and men who can play the role of supreme representatives of all the institutions, including the European Parliament and the Parliamentary committees, in this way -â I refer to my colleague Mr Bourlanges, who is absent from the chamber.
In short, we need to have a growing enhancement of the institutions.
That is why we should have liked other governments, beginning with the Socialist Government of Hungary, to have shown the same institutional sensibility in these weeks as the Italian Government.
Only a Commission not concerned with influencing national politics can have the prestige and authority to allow Europe to have a balanced system of institutions in the ambit of which this Parliament can finally take full possession of legislative power.
A Commission with such a profile must be dedicated to securing swift approval of the Constitutional Treaty.
The birth of the first basic law of the European Union represents a great result for us all, even though I, together with the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, harbour a regret that an explicit reference to our Christian origins is missing.
However, together we all have the duty to imbue this great work of constitutional engineering with political will.
In short, Europe needs to be given a heart and soul, otherwise we risk only having a Europe with a currency and a bureaucracy.
That is why this Parliament has declared itself in favour of a seat for the European Union in the renewed UN Security Council.
The goal is to have a Europe that counts for more and more on the international chessboard, a Europe that is the bringer of peace, as it has been within its own frontiers for the last fifty years.
We are sure that you will opt for Parliamentâs positions, as a man not of a party but of the Institution.
Because you will be a man of the Institution, at the exclusive service of our citizens, you will have the confidence of the Italian delegation of the European Peopleâs Party.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-elect of the Commission, the Council will not help you since it does not seek to increase your power, otherwise the famous peer pressure, which the Council wants us to believe is the best method for moving forward, would have led the Dutch Presidency to accept that it was a mistake to continue the stubbornness of the Italians.
Neither the Dutch Presidency nor the European Council have helped you, so you have a weakened candidate in a crucial position within your Commission.
Your institution will come out of this weaker, so listen to what the European Parliament is saying to you.
In the letter that Mr Borrell sent you on behalf of the committee which I chair, we asked you what transparent method of warning and monitoring would be used in the event of a conflict of interests, a conflict which I believe will go much further than the cases highlighted by your legal services, since the problem is not a matter of which board of directors Mrs Kroes has been a member of, but rather of knowing in which sector she learned to defend a particular company or fight another.
You provided no reassurance in your speech either on this point or on the way in which you will relieve Mrs Kroes of her responsibilities in the event of a conflict of interests.
It cannot be the Director-General who becomes a twenty-sixth Commissioner âŠ
Â Â  Madam President, the big challenge now is to ensure that a success is made of enlargement and that Europe is given a dynamic economy.
The challenge is also, however, that of taking leave of a Europe that was divided and whose history can never be forgiven.
It is against that background that I have to say how unfortunate it is that, after twenty years in the service of a dictatorship, a Commissioner considers himself not to have any cause for regret.
Nothing to be sorry for after twenty years in the service of a dictatorship.
This says more about the Hungarian Government and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament than about the Commission, because the responsibility lies neither with the Commission nor with the President.
It is also interesting to note the debate we have had in this House today.
The PSE Group clearly believes that someone with their background in a free economy is more to be criticised than someone emerging, devoid of any sense of remorse, from one of Europeâs brutal dictatorships.
That is to your discredit and is difficult both to explain and to defend.
The task now, however, is to give some impetus to Europe, and it is in the light of this that we are giving President Barroso and the Commission our support.
It is a question of deregulating and of opening the way to freedom and transparency.
It is a question of advocating a Europe based upon the ideals of freedom and democracy.
What matters is to get the Lisbon process moving and to give Europeans the maximum amount of opportunities.
This Commission will then be a commendable one, and we give it our support.
Â Â  Madam President, this is no way to treat a Commissioner who distinguished himself by opening the Iron Curtain.
I have to tell the House that I find that absolutely outrageous.
The Commission that we are meant to approve tomorrow still has black marks against it.
You, Mr Barroso, are under pressure from governments, but do not underestimate Parliamentâs vigilance.
My group and I will be in the forefront when it comes to getting rid of failures in your entourage.
We will take you at your word; you undertook to get rid of members of your Commission who turned out not to be up to the job for some reason or another, and that is a promise you must keep if you are not to fail in the same way as Mr Santer did.
Anyone reading reports of what has gone on over recent weeks will know that this freely-elected Parliament has notched up some points; our commitment to Europe and its citizens has become more visible than ever before.
The peoples of what are now 25 Member States will in future be able to take a benevolent view of us, and, let us hope, of the Barroso Commission as well.
Â Â  Madam President, let me say that we now have a Commission composed of 25 members, of whom any one of us can say that one or the other is not to his or her liking.
That is, however, the most normal thing in the world in a team sport such as this; now the match is over, what matters now is the acquisition of capacity to act.
I have to tell Mrs Gebhardt, though, that if someone like MrÂ Buttiglione is to be criticised for the values he holds, conservatives must be allowed to criticise socialists without that being described as improper.
This, I believe, is where we have to maintain a balance, and I would urge that we do so, so let me â to take an example â say by way of an appeal to the Greens and others, that the game is over, that Parliament has won its points, and that what matters now is that the Commission be endowed with a large majority, thus legitimating it and enabling it, over the next five years, to do the work that we exist to monitor.
Of that work there is plenty to do.
Reference has already been made to the consolidation of the enlarged European Union and to the Lisbon process, as also to Europeâs role in the world and its trans-Atlantic relations.
How is terrorism to be overcome, and what part do we have to play in that?
How are we to secure our currencyâs stability when some of those who participate in debates are endeavouring to pretend that the Stability Pact is not there?
These are challenges of enormous significance, and so I would like to invite the House to give this Commission a big vote of confidence, while at the same time telling the Commission that a high degree of trust does also mean close monitoring of work in progress, combined with simultaneous good cooperation.
For it will be the two Community institutions of Parliament and Commission that will have to implement the Constitution, thereby making this Europe of ours a Community rather than an inter-governmental arrangement.
What this means is that cooperation between our two institutions is of crucial importance to Europeâs future, and we should stop sniping at each other and get on with the job.
Â Â  Madam President, it has already been said time and again that this House has helped Europe to gain a better Commission.
This is especially true in the case of the Commissioner responsible for justice and home affairs, a portfolio which is after all of particular importance to the public.
As coordinator for my group within the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can confirm that we were extremely impressed by the high level of competence demonstrated by MrÂ Frattini, Commissioner-designate and Vice-President, on various issues, including those of a highly complex legal nature.
He has at any rate a much better understanding of what this House expects of a Commissioner.
We also believe that MrÂ Frattini is capable of putting his past as a minister of the Berlusconi government behind him, even though it surprises us somewhat that he was able to remain a minister in Berlusconi governments for so long whilst holding the view he put forward during the hearing, demonstrating a very strong commitment to fundamental rights and the principle of the rule of law.
In view of this, how was it possible for the government to adopt so many laws which were questionable from the point of view of the rule of law, and which the Italian and European courts now have to apply?
We must therefore assume in his favour that, as foreign minister, he was always abroad when these laws were adopted.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Barroso for listening to the European Parliament.
The recent contentious exchange of views between Parliament and the Commission has done three things for the European Union.
First of all it has reaffirmed the reality that the European Union is fundamentally a political, and not a bureaucratic, project.
Secondly, it has strengthened the decision-making capacity of the EU by improving interinstitutional relations.
Finally and most importantly it has enhanced the democratic legitimacy of the EU by engaging our citizens in a genuine European debate through the forum of the European Parliament.
I personally now feel more confident in supporting a stronger college, reinforced by astute adjustments that have been made in some portfolios.
If only you could have gone further, Mr Barroso, but you have killed two birds with one stone in swapping the portfolios of the Hungarian and Latvian Commissioners.
In addition, I welcome Mr Piebalgs to the energy brief as a promising and able candidate untainted by the spectre of alleged impropriety, unlike his country's original nominee.
Mr KovÃ¡cs, who displayed incompetence and complete disdain for the parliamentary process during the first round of committee hearings, has inspired slightly more confidence in the role of taxation Commissioner-designate.
While I disagree with his political views, I am personally reassured by his statement to the effect that corporate tax harmonisation will remain a Member State competence.
Although I am in no doubt about her professional competence â and I underline that â I would like to reassert my concerns in relation to a range of conflicts of interest that may attach to Mrs Kroes as a direct result of her successful corporate career to date.
Perhaps, Mr Barroso, it is a case of the right woman in the wrong job this time round, but I wish her well.
On the whole I endorse your Commission as representative of the views of the democratically-elected Parliament.
While we will have just one vote for or against the entire Commission, I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to put clearly on the record today your full support for the principle of the individual responsibility of each of the Commissioners.
It would have been preferable not to leave your changes to the eleventh hour, but the outcome of the whole episode is that cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council has been strengthened.
This Parliament has emerged as a much stronger forum, and as one not to be treated lightly.
We have given you a clear message.
We are not rubber stamps.
I wish you and your college well.
Â Â  Mr President-elect of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in relation to the Commission presented to Parliament, there are several points that I am pleased about.
I should like to refer to one in particular.
That is the choice of seasoned and experienced personalities, as we have seen in the enormous majority of hearings before Parliament, including the hearing that I attended in the Committee on Transport for Commissioner Jacques Barrot.
I make no secret, however, of the fact, Mr President-designate, that certain issues have yet to be dealt with.
Mr Barroso, you organised the Azores Summit for President Bush and today, eighteen months after the start of the war, that war has not yet ended.
We are unfortunately aware of the number of victims it claims every day: I would like to know your views on that matter today.
The second point that should be considered, and which has just been mentioned, is the reshuffle of the Commission.
Reshuffle; that is a fine word, since it has changed little.
Do you not fear, Mr Barroso, that by appointing as Commissioner for competition a person who, whatever their qualities, which have been highlighted, will be at constant risk of conflicting interests. Do you not fear that the decisions that your Commission will have to take in such a sensitive area as competition will be permanently in question?
The third and last point, which is particularly close to my heart, is the case of Turkey, and everyone here knows your views on the subject.
In our view, Turkey, as we have said many times, should not become a member of the European Union, and there are many reasons for this.
I will mention just one, however: its accession would put an end to the Community project.
By enlarging ad infinitum, the Union will soon become an enormous free trade area or a classic international organisation, and will therefore lose all of its individual nature.
For several years, Mr Barroso, our group â and I did so myself in November 2002 â has been calling for a privileged partnership between the European Union and Turkey.
Are you open to that third option, which would resolve the dilemma between accession and exclusion?
As you can see, Mr President-designate, certain questions remain and we hope that this debate will serve to reassure us this evening.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the Barroso Commission and the European Parliament have been strengthened.
It is, however, a sad fact that certain Members have, improperly and wrongly, allowed their view of the Commission as a whole and of the challenges facing us to be obscured by differing views on individual Commissioners.
The Commission and Parliament form a channel of communication, and we need each other.
We need a strong Commission which shows initiative and which is dynamic and competent.
We need a strong European Parliament; without Europeâs citizens, or their representatives, nothing should and nothing can be decided in the EU, as we must bring the European Union closer to its citizens, as well as making it more transparent and democratic.
We must do everything in our power to ensure that EU policies can finally be made on the basis of the Constitution, internally, as is the case in the outside world, instead of their being based primarily on national and party politics; I say this thinking back to the comments made by MrÂ Schulz.
Let us turn the public into participants, and declare our goals, motives and successes.
I expect of you, MrÂ Barroso, that you give the Lisbon and Barcelona processes practical expression and make them operational, and that you do both these things in a way people find easy to comprehend.
I also expect you to eliminate obstacles within Europe and to drive forward the common foreign and security policy, as well as to ensuring that the Stability and Growth Pact remains strong, carrying out subsidiarity tests before presenting proposals, putting forward a clear and comprehensible justification for the added value of European regulations, and reaching an agreement with the Council that the 12Â stars are to be visible anywhere the EU has invested euros.
This is the only way in which a European awareness can be created and the distance reduced.
Around 500 Members and myself look forward to a self-confident, successful and fair cooperation.
I wish you all the best.
Â Â  I am one of those who would have preferred it if your Commission had been elected three weeks ago.
Had that been the case, you would have already started your work.
Upon reflection, however, I think that benefit can be derived from what has occurred.
The first lesson is that the European Union â and, in particular, the European Commission â must appreciate that it should not interfere in matters relating to faith, morality and ethics.
I have in mind, in particular, delicate issues relating to abortion, euthanasia, cloning, the family and marriage, which are all very sensitive topics concerning which there are different opinions in the various Member States of the European Union.
Following the events of recent weeks, I think that you, Mr Barroso, would be very wise to distance yourself from such topics and to avoid any incidents.
After all, if we really believe in the principle of subsidiarity and in unity in diversity, we must allow the individual States to regulate such matters according to their nationsâ circumstances.
The second lesson that we can draw from what occurred is that the European Parliament is strengthening its position and is steadily becoming more determined in the role it plays in the decisions taken by the European Union.
This strengthened role of the European Parliament places the European Commission under greater scrutiny and makes it more accountable.
At the same time, however, the European Commission will in this way be building up its own strength as it will be increasing its legitimacy in the eyes of the public.
That is to say, Mr President-elect, after has what occurred we now have a stronger Parliament.
We also, however, have a Commission that is stronger as it is more open to inspection and scrutiny by the representatives directly elected by the European people.
We have thus reduced the democratic deficit in Europe and have moved the European Union a step closer to its citizens.
Thank you.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Barroso, three weeks ago the Commission of which you are President was a good one.
Your guidelines were positive and your stance was firm and clear.
The aims you put forward were both beneficial to Europe as a whole and fair to the cohesion countries.
It remains a good Commission today for precisely the same reasons.
The majority of its Members were and still are worthy of our approval, because it has avoided any split between super-Commissioners and second-class Commissioners, because it is closely aligned with our ideological values, and because, overall, it is closer to the opinions of the majority of Europeâs citizens.
Madam President, Mr President-designate, the Europe I believe in is a Europe of freedom, diversity, security, prosperity and solidarity.
Those should be our guiding principles and indeed those were the values that you promised to defend, Mr DurÃ£o Barroso.
Europe must remember that without security there is no freedom, without competitiveness there is no lasting social model and without subsidiarity there is no unity in diversity, but a fusion of separate entities, which is something we do not want.
Lastly, the Barroso Commission has our support because it represents an opportunity to restore transatlantic ties.
Europe is not defined by opposition to any country, particularly not by opposition â and certainly not by submission â to our main ally, but I believe that this is clear for all to see.
Before I finish, a word to Mr DurÃ£o Barroso, who was a good Prime Minister of Portugal.
I do not ask you to be our Commissioner, nor do I want you to be our Commissioner.
I ask you to be the President of the Commission who never forgets the concerns of the citizens and of the Member States, regardless of their economic, demographic or geographical dimensions, and I trust that doing so will inspire you as you carry out your new and important duties.
Good luck, Mr DurÃ£o Barroso.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, before I give the floor to Mr NicolaÃ¯, on behalf of the Council, I would like to inform you that I have received seven motions for resolutions to wind up the debate.
The vote on these motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
I shall now give the floor to Mr NicolaÃ¯, on behalf of the Council.
Â Â  . Madam President, as both you and this House will be aware, neither the Council nor the Presidency are, formally speaking, parties in the discussions between your Parliament, the Commission, and its President.
We in the Council have of course been very much involved and have, as you will know, Madam President, given our assent to this new list of Commissioners.
I will readily declare to your House that I am gratified by what Mr Barroso, the new President of the new Commission, has presented to us today, and I wish to congratulate him on it.
I also want to congratulate the European Parliament.
I have always made it clear that the European Parliament does of course have every right â and, indeed, the duty â to set out a position as regards the new Commission and its members.
I have also always made it clear that we do of course have every confidence that Parliamentâs position will be a well-considered one.
We look forward to tomorrow.
I have every confidence that the decision you will reach will be a sensible one.
We in the Presidency have always indicated that this situation has never been seen as a crisis; it is, on the contrary, evidence of how conflicts can occur in a mature democracy, and a visible demonstration of how a short-term solution can be found to them.
I have every hope that it will become apparent tomorrow that a solution has been found.
By your leave, Madam President, I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mr Prodi and his Commissioners for having carried on with their work.
May I also say that we very much look forward to working with the Commission that has just been presented.
Let me say by way of conclusion that, if you, the European Parliament, come to a favourable decision tomorrow, I think we will all be able to come to the conclusion that both the European Union in general and European democracy in particular, have emerged from this situation with renewed strength.
Thank you very much, Mr NicolaÃ¯.Mr Barroso has the floor.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you. I thank you for this debate, for your generally positive reception and for having expressed different points of view.
I take note of the support of the majority of you, the concerns you have expressed, the suggestions you have made and also the priorities you have expressed.
I should like to respond in particular to three points: firstly, the composition; secondly, possible conflicts of interest; thirdly, cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission, thinking in particular of the framework agreement.
I shall start with the composition.
Some of you have criticised me because I have taken account of the will of the Member States.
That is true: I have taken account of the will of the Member States.
That is what the Treaty requires.
The composition of the Commission is not the sole responsibility of the President-designate the Commission: it is a responsibility shared between the President-designate and the Council.
What I am presenting here is therefore already the result of a compromise.
I say this so that it may appear in the Minutes, so that it may be made perfectly clear.
It is already the result of a compromise between the President-designate of the Commission and the Members of the Council, naturally also taking account of the will of the European Parliament as I have been able to analyse it.
That is why the debate in October was a positive one.
In fact, it was as a result of that debate that I came to understand your main concerns and have been able to try to resolve them.
Having said that, I have not been able to resolve all the problems raised and I must tell you why.
To a certain extent, you have made contradictory demands.
Some of you, for example, are very much in favour of keeping a particular Commissioner, while others do not want that Commissioner.
I have been surprised to hear some members of a parliamentary group express serious criticisms of a Commissioner, in this case the Commissioner responsible for competition, when that same group had insisted that I retain the Commissioner in question in this post, which puts us in a peculiar situation in terms of relations between Parliament and the President-designate.
In these circumstances, I must say that it is very simplistic to present the composition of the Commission simply as a problem between the President-designate of the Commission and the Council.
No!
When the President-designate of the Commission allocates portfolios, he is subject to the contradictory demands not only of the different political groups, but also of members of the same political group, as we have seen today.
I say all of this thinking of the future, since there are two aspects that I believe to be absolutely essential.
First of all, respect for the Treaties.
As you know, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, which means that I have had to respect them.
I am very much in favour of the Commissionâs institutional position, not through institutional egotism, but because more than ever we really need a strong Commission in order to move the European project forward.
I am therefore prepared to work with you in an honest, transparent and open way; I am ready for this positive complicity with the European Parliament, but I must tell you that that will not be done to the detriment of the Commission.
I could not accept that, because we in Europe all need an independent, credible and strong Commission, in accordance with the Treaties.
It is very important that I make this clear to you, so that all of us are aware of our responsibilities.
That is why I have taken account of the will of the Member States, while always respecting the Treaties, naturally.
I must also say that some of you have cooperated more than others.
It is true that certain Member States have shown greater understanding of the concerns that I have expressed than others.
I believe this should be pointed out, because I believe it is important to learn every possible lesson from this experience, for the future of the Commission and the proper functioning of our institutions.
With regard to the issue of conflicts of interests, I will say this.
First of all, I have taken account of the conclusions of the committee that held the hearing with MrsÂ Kroes.
I must read to you the conclusions of that committee.
I shall read them in English because I have the original in English.
The committee has confirmed that MrsÂ Kroes had, and I quote:
'... the required personal and professional capacity to assume the high office she has been proposed for, and that her actions and commitments, some of which go beyond that which would be strictly required, are sufficient to deal with the risk of future conflicts of interest.'
Those are the words of the letter addressed to me by the President of the European Parliament, which was written by the chairman of that committee.
The committee also asked me, as did the Conference of Presidents, what guarantees I could give, as President of the Commission, with regard to the mechanisms for preventing conflicts of interest.
In fact, we have taken a whole range of measures, too many to list now, but the philosophy is as follows: when a service, and in particular the Director-General responsible for competition, comes across a potential conflict of interests, he has the duty to point it out, but not to examine it, which is important, because the decision is not the responsibility of the Director-General, but rather of the President of the Commission.
Naturally, the President of the Commission cannot keep abreast of the hundreds and thousands of competition issues the Commission has to deal with.
The Director-General, who is assisted in this task by the Commissionâs legal services, therefore has a duty to provide warnings.
It is then the President of the Commission - who, as you know, in accordance with the Treaty, is responsible for the coherence and continuity of the Commission - who takes the decision, if he thinks there is a potential conflict of interests, to transfer that portfolio to another Commissioner, or to take that decision himself within the college.
There is, therefore, a mechanism.
Having said that, certain comments have been made.
Mrs Frassoni has mentioned three cases currently under examination, which could involve the anti-trust effort and which could involve conflicts of interest.
I accept that, Mrs Frassoni, but they are just three cases out of 561 of the same type which are currently being examined by the Commission, of a total of more than a thousand cases relating either to mergers or to State aid.
So there are cases that could clearly lead to conflicts of interest.
We have transparent mechanisms, however, for preventing these conflicts of interest from having any real effect.
This mechanism is democratic because the college has responsibility, and it falls to the President of the Commission.
Furthermore, some of you have made comments to the effect that a Commissioner from the Italian Government should not be made responsible for justice, simply on the basis that he is Italian or is a member of the Italian Government.
I must tell you that that is something I could not accept, on the basis of the principle of non-discrimination.
This responsibility depends first and foremost on the person, on the individual.
The notion that a person from a particular country or from a particular government cannot, as a result of that, offer a particular degree of responsibility, when they have the necessary political, intellectual and professional qualities, is not acceptable.
The Member States are democratic countries.
It is not for us, the Commission, to decide which governments are acceptable and which are not.
That is not our responsibility.
It is up to the electorates of the different countries to decide that.
The same goes for another Commissioner, that is, the Commissioner nominated by the Hungarian Government.
The Hungarian Government is a democratic government. If it were not, I do not believe it would be a Member of the European Union.
To say that somebody nominated by a democratic government of our Union, furthermore somebody who has until now been President of the majority party in that democratic country cannot, as a result of that, for a purely political reason, be appointed a member of the Commission, seems to me to be unacceptable.
That is why I believe we should try to keep that Commissioner.
There are clearly compromises to be reached here, ladies and gentlemen.
As somebody quite rightly said, there are twenty-five members of the Commission.
I would put the question to you: in each of your States, when your party is in power, are all the members of your national governments subject to your approval?
I believe not.
Why demand more of the European institutions, therefore, than you demand of your own national institutions?
That is where the problem lies.
I readily accept that there must be more transparency, more demands, but at times I wonder whether certain people, some through naivety, some with other intentions, are not trying to weaken the European institutions, which we want to be strong.
We are willing to accept great demands, but it sometimes makes me suspicious to see members of the Commission being subjected to much more stringent demands than national executives.
I wonder how many of our national governments would actually be approved if all their members were to be subject to the kind of hearings that you have organised here in this Parliament.
In relation to the composition of the Commission, some people have said that it is too liberal.
Let there be no doubt: this composition actually reflects the pluralism within our Member States.
If there were Communist governments in our States, I would have Communist Commissioners.
If there were governments led by the Greens, I would have Commissioners of that persuasion.
I would have no problem with that.
It is the governments, which represent the majority in their countries âÂ since, in all of our countries, the rule is the majorityÂ â who make the proposals.
There is therefore absolutely no justification for criticising the Commission because its composition is too left-wing or too right-wing.
The Commission is genuinely the fruit of pluralism and I would like to repeat what I have already said to you, above all to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and that is that I will not be a partisan President.
To respond directly, moreover, to the concerns expressed by Mr Schulz, Mr Swoboda and Mr Rasmussen, I must point out that, while I have a particular ideological political conviction, I nevertheless believe that as President of the Commission, I cannot be a President of the right against the left nor the left against the right.
I believe that, at European level, we must first and foremost unite, all of us with pro-European convictions, and work for the common European good.
Please allow me also to say something to the members of the Socialist group, with all the respect due to them: you will very often find that in the field of social cohesion, for example, you will have less difficulty with me in the Commission than you would have with certain Socialist governments currently in power.
We will see this when we discuss the Financial Perspectives; we will see then who really defends social cohesion and who defends a more active policy of redistribution.
We often say that we must defend the European social model, and that is true.
Did you know, however, that, in many Member States, particularly those that have just joined, there is no European social model yet, and therefore their problem is not how to preserve the European social model?
Their problem is how to achieve the European social model.
We must therefore work to make this enlargement a success and that is the direction we must work in.
With regard to the issue of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, I do not wish to anticipate the result of the vote on your resolutions tomorrow.
Since some of you, however, have put the question to me directly, in particular Mr Watson, I should like to say, with regard to the motion for a resolution presented by Mr Poettering, Mr de Vigo, Mr Duff, Mr Schulz, Mr Swoboda, Mr Crowley and others, that point 5(a), in its current form, is perfectly acceptable.
The principle is as follows: if Parliament decides, through a vote, to withdraw its confidence from a Commissioner, the President of the Commission must seriously examine whether it is appropriate to ask that member to resign; the President then either asks that member to resign, or must justify to Parliament why he is not doing so.
That is the meaning of the text presented to me and I believe that is the commitment my predecessor, Mr Prodi, had made; I feel no need to change anything.
The important issue is how to reconcile the principle of individual responsibility with the collegiate nature of the Commission.
This balance is not easy to achieve, since, as you are well aware, the collegiate nature of the Commission is laid down in the Treaties, it has the force of the law.
I cannot, therefore, accept going against the Treaties; I cannot accept the idea that a Commission should resign automatically in the event that you withdraw your confidence, because that is not laid down in the Treaties, and nor is it in accordance with either the spirit or the letter of the Treaty, and, as President of the Commission, I should be the principal guardian of the Treaties.
The Treaties establish the principle of collegiality, which does not mean that, on a political level, I am not perfectly willing to examine the concerns that you express with regard to a member of the Commission extremely carefully and to justify my decision.
Furthermore, I have asked the Commissioners to accept the principle of resignation in the event that the President requests it, and they have done so.
I believe that in today's Europe of 25, the authority of the President, which was increased further by the Treaty of Nice and which is still in force, has become essential in terms of the Member States as well.
That is why, at informal meetings, the Members of the Commission have accepted the principle that they should resign if their President requests that they do so.
So in certain respects we are going further than what you are asking.
What I cannot do is change the balance between the institutions established by the Treaty.
I believe that tomorrow we will have the opportunity to react and to make statements following your vote.
I could go into greater detail on this, if you wish.
I can tell you, however, that from now on the Vice-President, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, and I, will be ready to work with you on the renewal of the framework agreement, taking account in particular of the letter sent to me by Mr Borrell and also certain initiatives, in particular that of Mr Poettering, who has set several important milestones in the institutional debate.
So I see here a genuine will for constructive openness with Parliament.
I shall end by referring to the issue of transatlantic relations, which has been raised.
In this regard, I believe we must work with the United States of America on an equal and dignified footing, in a spirit of mutual respect.
We need it more than ever and the whole world needs that cooperation.
Today you have received the President of South Africa here.
I met him yesterday and he told me, as all the leaders of the developing world tell me, that closer cooperation between Europe, which is currently the biggest economic and commercial power, and the United States, is very important to them as well and that we must commit ourselves positively to a progressive transatlantic agenda with the United States.
That is what I will do, of course, while defending the European common interest, it goes without saying.
I will end by saying that the debates this week have enriched us all.
I reject the idea that there is a winner and a loser here.
I believe that the European institutions can strengthen each other mutually and that we can all emerge as winners from this constructive debate.
I would repeat to you my wish, and that of the whole of the Commission, to cooperate closely with you and to establish a positive agenda for Europe, because we have a great deal to do.
This idea of positive complicity with Parliament will be very important over the next five years.
They will be difficult years.
We are facing increasing numbers of demands, but we can work together, the European Parliament and the European Commission, without any party-political pettiness, without pointless divisions, above all trying to unite all of those who believe that Europe has a future and who believe that we can inspire our young people to support Europe.
On this basis, I can guarantee that I am willing to cooperate closely within the context of a constructive and transparent relationship with your institution.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
Mr Kilroy-Silk has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you.
You will recall that at the end of my allotted one minute of speaking time earlier today, I noticed you had the gavel poised at 59 seconds.
I alluded to the fact and said it seemed a bit unfair that you were ready to stop me when others had spoken for one and a half minutes.
I am told â I did not hear you say â that I was lucky that you had not used the gavel earlier because I was saying things that were untrue.
I would be very grateful if you could tell me two things.
What was it I said that was untrue, and what is the rule that enables the President of this Parliament to censor Members' speeches?
Â Â  Mr Kilroy-Silk, you must respect speaking times like everybody else and, furthermore, what you have said is not a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Kilroy-Silk's remarks on the Commission were correct, especially so in the case of Mr Mandelson, whose name is a by-word for sleaze in the United Kingdom.
Your remarks accusing Mr Kilroy-Silk of slander demonstrate the anti-democratic nature of this Parliament and of all EU institutions if such a further example ...
Â Â  Mr President, I have no intention of taking part in this charade.
I would simply like to say, Mr President, on a point of order, that I was present on Monday at midday, but that I was not listed in the Minutes. I would like that to be rectified.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Toubon.
We shall verify what you say and make corrections where necessary.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is Question Time, during which we will examine questions to the Council.
Â Â  I should like to begin with Question No 1 by Mr Papadimoulis, which deals with the execution of the arrest warrant for Kenan Akin.
I shall now give the floor to Mr NicolaÃ¯ to answer the question on behalf of the Council.
Â Â  . The Council is not aware of the details concerning the issuing and handling of the international arrest warrant and requests for extradition referred to by the honourable Member of Parliament.
Neither is it for the Council to determine whether Turkey has acted in breach of its international obligations in this specific case.
The Interpol alert issued pursuant to this decision is not based on an EU instrument or on an international instrument binding the European Union and Turkey.
The matter raised by the honourable Member therefore seems to fall squarely within the domestic jurisdiction of the countries concerned, and it is therefore not for the Council to express itself on this matter.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Parliament called in its motion, following these incidents, for all the necessary measures to be taken so that the people responsible for these murders and for the shooting of unarmed demonstrators would be brought to justice.
I do not know what Interpol does or does not do, but does the Council intend to do something in order to respond to what the European Parliament itself called for in its resolution?
Â Â  . I can elaborate a little on what I have just said.
Since the Council, as I said, is not aware of any of the alleged details concerning the international arrest warrant and requests for extradition referred to in the question, I cannot offer any new views on that.
However, we should bear in mind that international arrest warrants issued by Interpol are not by themselves binding upon the state that receives them.
They are more in the nature of requests from one state to another and do not automatically guarantee the detention and/or extradition of a suspect.
Instead, the question of extradition is largely governed by existing bilateral extradition treaties, if any.
Unlike the EU arrest warrant system, in which Turkey has no part, there is no implied principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions between the states involved.
The European Convention on Extradition under the auspices of the Council of Europe, to which Turkey is a party, follows a similar logic.
Â Â  . On 5 November 2004 the European Council adopted a new multiannual programme for the next five years, to be known as the Hague Programme, strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union.
The European Council conclusions highlighting the Hague Programme take account of the recommendation on the use of qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure adopted by the European Parliament on 14 October 2004.
In the Hague Programme itself, the European Council, taking into account the assessment by the Commission and the strong views expressed by the European Parliament in its recommendation, asks the Council to adopt a decision based on Article 67(2) TEC immediately after formal consultation of the European Parliament and no later than 1 April 2005 to apply the procedure provided for in Article 251 TEC Title IV, measures to strengthen freedom subject to the Nice Treaty, except for legal migration.
The presidency intends to submit a proposal for a decision to the Council as soon as possible.
The European Parliament will have to be consulted on that proposal.
By virtue of the protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, these two Member States will have the right to indicate their wish to participate in the adoption of the decision within three months.
In view of these procedural requirements, the European Council envisages that the move to the codecision procedure should take effect no later than 1 April 2005.
Â Â  I of course welcome the fact that the European Council has taken this decision to move forward.
I congratulate the Dutch Presidency and the President-in-office himself, on securing this agreement.
However, it does seem to show reluctance on the part of Member States that this will happen a year later than the Treaty of Nice specified.
Surely a move to codecision, which would make the decisions more democratic, and QMV making them speedier and of better quality, would improve the so far unimpressive record in building a common asylum and immigration policy.
We need to change the insular attitudes in national ministries, an attitude which accounts for why we had to amend the ARGO programme so that only one ministry can submit a project because it has not been possible to get three countries to cooperate.
Surely moving to QMV will help change that.
Â Â  .
Thank you for your remarks, but I have nothing to add to what I said in my first answer.
Â Â  I would like to coax the President-in-Office out of his reluctance to make a further comment.
It is quite clear that immigration and asylum can only work if there is coordination between the 25 Member States.
Does the President-in-Office believe that the national administrations now support European action in a way that they simply did not a year ago?
In particular, does he believe that on 1 April, Ireland and the United Kingdom will sign up to a joint approach to tackling these problems?
Â Â  . That is rather a new question and one which I regret to say I cannot answer immediately.
Â Â  . The Council has started to review the impact and efficiency of the measures adopted on 5 June 2003 in the light of the objectives of the common position on Cuba.
The objectives pursued through the common position remain valid, in particular that of facilitating peaceful change and respect for human rights in Cuba through dialogue with the Cuban authorities and with all sectors of Cuban society.
The review is still ongoing and I am therefore unable to give any information at this stage on possible conclusions.
Â Â  I take good note of the reply we have been given.
According to the Council, the revision announced is intended to maintain the same objectives, but I imagine that it will try to achieve these objectives through more effective measures than those taken until now, which have not only had no results, but have actually had negative results.
The President tells me that he has nothing more to say at the moment.
I understand the discretion needed during a negotiation process, and from what he has said I detect a will to improve the instrument in order to achieve the objectives we have agreed on.
Â Â  . I cannot say much more but I can elaborate a little bit.
You may have read in the press that an initial discussion on the revision of the common position took place yesterday in one of the competent preparatory bodies of the Council.
We will continue this discussion which, among other matters, concerns the celebration of national days in the coming weeks.
As yet, there is no consensus.
However, I would like to emphasise that all Member States agree on the importance of a broad strategic EU policy vis-Ã -vis Cuba, based on the common position.
This includes a package of measures aimed at intensifying and structuring the contexts with dissidents and civil society as well as with the Cuban authorities.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council whether it believes that the situation prior to the establishment of the common position was satisfactory in terms of promoting the development of democracy and respect for human rights in Cuba; whether the European Union should not have taken any measure following the wave of repression; and, finally, whether it is aware that this morning, by a large majority, the European Parliament called for the common position not to be altered and for the additional measures established following the wave of repression in June to be maintained.
Â Â  . I do not have anything to add.
I hope my answer was enough to explain the position.
Â Â  . The Council is aware of the problem posed by the need to strike a balance between security concerns and trade efficiency.
The question of the development of consistent cargo security requirements and a need to ensure minimal damage to trade is regularly raised in the framework of EU-US policy dialogue on transport and border security.
In this context, the EU-US agreement on the container security initiative signed last April, aims to agree mutually acceptable and reciprocal standards that would make burdensome additional controls upon arrival of goods in the US unnecessary.
In particular, this agreement sets up a working group designed to improve and establish standards practicable for industry partnership programmes, to improve supply-chain security and facilitate the movement of legitimate trade.
Also in the context of the EU-US policy dialogue on transport and border security, the EU is actively seeking US cooperation regarding the US bioterrorism act, in order to eliminate any potential negative impacts of this legislation on EU exports to the US.
Regarding the practical measures to be implemented in order to facilitate international trade activities with the US, to the benefit of EU firms, the Council invites the honourable Member to raise this question with the Commission.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would like to add that it is not a question of minor difficulties for European companies.
In this context I am of course referring particularly to Slovenian companies.
It is a question of the serious problems they are having in the United States because they never know how long it will take the customs authorities there to inspect goods.
In this respect I would like to suggest that you and, of course, the whole Commission investigate the possibility that, within the framework of the trade regulations, the customs authorities inform people in advance of the length of time it will take to inspect containerised goods.
In this way suppliers would not miss deadlines, and customers in the United States would be happy.
In short, this would enable trade between the European Union and the United States to be unimpeded.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  . That is what I tried to explain in my first answer.
It is really an issue for the Commission.
However, I understand the remarks.
In general, the EU presidency tries to enhance relations with the US in various fields, for instance through business dialogue.
Stimulating mutual understanding for, on the one hand, justified security concerns and, on the other hand, possible trade difficulties will, I hope, lead to practical solutions that achieve the right balance between those different interests.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, can I take your words to mean that you agree that there are unacceptable delays on the part of the American authorities with regard to European goods imported into the United States?
Would you therefore accept that retaliatory measures should perhaps be taken in order to ensure that our exports are properly treated by the American authorities?
Â Â  . I hope you will understand that I cannot add to what I have already said, and that this is a matter for the Commission.
Â Â  I understand the difficulties that the President-in-Office of the Council may have in giving a direct answer to the questions that are put to him.
A report from the Department of Homeland Security in the US outlines the measures it needs to take to improve security with regard to cargo.
Despite some draconian measures introduced over the last two years by the US Administration, those have not been carried out.
The delays that European exporters are encountering with regard to trade in the US appear to be targeted against European goods rather than the result of a general focus on cargo security.
Could you, as the presidency, make an approach to the US authorities to see if there could be a pre-delivery inspection at European level, which would then clear the goods for direct transport into the US, rather than being delayed at the US side?
Â Â  . I really have nothing to add on behalf of the presidency.
This is a discussion you should have with the Commission.
Â Â  I just think you are here, Madam President, to defend the interests of the Members of this Parliament.
It is not worth our while turning up to Question Time if the Minister is not going to respond or try to respond â as he could well do â to our questions.
I am not going to bother sitting around here listening to these non-answers!
Â Â  If I understand correctly, MrÂ Purvis, that was a comment and not a point of order.
I have taken note of it.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Council is well aware of the specific case referred to by the honourable Member, namely that of Mr Abdelkadar Bouchama, whose family has heard nothing from him since he was arrested on 18 May 1994.
This case, along with those of many dozens of what are termed âdisappeared personsâ kidnapped in the course of the conflict that has had the country in its grip since 1992, is one of some 7000 files on disappearances still under consideration by the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights.
In September 2003, President Bouteflika set up an ad hoc committee to look into disappearances.
As this committee is not empowered to conduct investigations, it has not as yet been able to finally clear up these disappearances.
Judging that the state was "responsible but not guilty", Mr Farouk Ksentini declared a general amnesty for all members of the security forces concerned, as had previously been done in South Africa.
Financial compensation has recently been offered to the families of disappeared persons, provided that they withdrew their accusations.
The Council has regularly put disappearances on the agenda for discussion and expects to do so again for the forthcoming meetings within the framework of political dialogue with Algeria.
This is an issue to which we are giving our attention.
In this context, the pending ratification of the Association Agreement constitutes an important development in the EUâs relations with Algeria.
When the agreement enters into force, it will enable the European Union to bring more focused pressure to bear on Algeria in connection with respect for human rights in general, and, more specifically, with regard to disappearances.
Â Â  Yes, I have two specific supplementary questions.
Firstly, is the Council prepared to intervene once more with the Algerian authorities concerning the case to which I specifically referred?
Secondly, I should like to ask whether it would not be possible, in the framework of the dialogue now facilitated by the Agreement, to propose a more efficient instrument than the commission, which you yourself have described as extremely inefficient?
Â Â  . Madam President, we in the Council cannot put forward individual cases in the way that has been suggested.
I expect the next Ministerial troika with Algeria to be held in 2005 â in other words, next year â and I am sure this will be an opportunity for the European Union and Algeria to discuss the issue of human rights, when these cases will be able to be considered as well.
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
You have said it: the European Union as such does not belong to the WTO.
Nevertheless, according to the Constitutional Treaty, the environment is an exclusive competence of the European Union.
I would like to know the Councilâs view on the idea of the European Commission participating in the WTO on behalf of the Union.
Also, an amendment to the Directive on penalties for marine pollution approved at first reading by the European Parliament proposes that ships with Community flags should be responsible in any part of the world.
The Council is opposed to this.
I would like to know which Member States are opposed to this measure.
Could they possibly be the European States with flags of convenience?
Â Â  . Thank you for your remark.
I would like to emphasise the importance of the status of the PSSA, a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area.
In the IMO framework protection measures for a PSSA can include ship routing measures such as an area to be avoided - an area within defined limits in which either navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and is one which should be avoided by all ships, or certain classes of ships.
Â Â  Mr Ortuondo Larrea, I intended to take one more question, and then Question Time will be concluded.
Â Â  You have not in any way answered my question.
Â Â  As you know, it is actually for me, as President, to invite speakers to take the floor.
As for how well or badly questions are answered, you are entitled to your own opinion.
I would like to end with Question NoÂ 9 by Mr ProinsiasÂ DeÂ Rossa.
Firstly, however, I would like to note that Question NoÂ 7 by Willy Meyer lapses, as he is not present.
Question NoÂ 8 by EdithÂ Mastenbroek has been withdrawn, which takes us to Question NoÂ 9 by ProinsiasÂ DeÂ Rossa, on state-owned enterprises and oil production in Burma/Myanmar.
You have the floor, Mr NicolaÃ¯, and I believe you wanted to provide a further response to the preceding question.
Â Â  . The honourable Member who asked the last question has left.
However, I can say that we are studying the possibilities for the accession he was asking about.
In answer to Question No 9, the Council informs the honourable Member that the draft common position, including its annex, was discussed within the competent Council preparatory bodies.
The local diplomatic representations of the EU Member States were consulted.
According to the common position, it will apply for a 12-month period and will be kept under constant review.
It will be renewed for a mandate as appropriate, in particular as regards the Burmese State-owned enterprises, as listed in Annex 2, if the Council deems that its objectives have not been met.
Decisions to amend Annex 2 are therefore taken by unanimity.
The Council is not in a position to comment on the inclusion of individual enterprises.
As regards the monitoring of the implementation, it can be noted that in Spring 2004 the Council created at technical level a working party dedicated to exchanging experiences and developing best practice in the implementation and application of restrictive measures.
It has started its work and is monitoring the implementation of the guidelines and evaluating restrictive measures within the framework of the CFSP adopted by the Council last year, notably to check whether EU restrictive measures are affected.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, the most remarkable part of your reply is that you cannot comment on the individual companies I have enquired about.
I fail to understand why you cannot tell me and this House why these three state energy, timber and telecoms companies are excluded from the common position.
Can you tell me which states opposed the inclusion of these three important Burmese state enterprises?
Do companies, either state companies or private companies in these states, already have joint enterprises with these important companies in Burma?
Â Â  . It is an issue under discussion in the Council.
I cannot add anything to what I said earlier.
Â Â  You cannot inform the House which Member States are opposing the inclusion of these three companies?
The Council is either open or it is not.
Why is it opposing the inclusion of these three companies in the common position and how can these sanctions be effective if they are not including the energy, timber and telecoms sectors?
Â Â  . My reaction is the same.
I cannot tell you what is under discussion in the Council and between Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ DeÂ Rossa, it is not you who has the floor at present.
Perhaps you could raise the issue again with the President-in-Office of the Council in a face-to-face discussion.
Question Time has already overrun â it should have been concluded at 7Â p.m. â and you have already had an opportunity to ask the question.
Questions No 10 to 15 will be answered in writing.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next sitting will take place tomorrow, ThursdayÂ 18Â November, from 10Â a.m. to 1Â p.m. and from 3Â p.m. to 5Â p.m.
Â Â  Mr President, I have risen to make a personal statement in accordance with Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure.
I was astonished at the accusations levelled at me by the President of the Commission during a debate held yesterday in this House, accusations in which I was not named, but from which it was plain that it was myself they were intended for.
MrÂ Barroso said that he had been surprised to hear certain members of a parliamentary group voice sharp criticism of a Commissioner, in this case the Commissioner for competition, when the same group had called strongly for the Commissioner in question to remain in that post. During these comments it was obvious that it was me he had in mind, as he even turned to face us while speaking.
I should like to note that MrÂ Watson has formally denied having said anything of the kind.
He simply pointed out that the letter signed by MrsÂ BerÃšs had been intended to show that the committee in question and members of this committee who belonged to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe approved the appointment of MrsÂ Kroes.
I believe that this is a crucial issue, as what right does the President of the Commission have to challenge not the substance of a Memberâs arguments, but his rights and legitimacy?
He has spoken of the unique relations that exist between Parliament and the Commission Presidency.
What gives him the right to restrict a Memberâs freedom of action?
Is MrÂ Barroso in charge of inter-group discipline?
Is it to be the case, merely because he has held conversations, and conversations he has interpreted wrongly, that the freedom of action of each Member of this House is to be restricted?
This is unacceptable, and I should like to ask that Mr Barroso provide a clear explanation of his statements before the vote at noon.
Â Â  Mr Bourlanges, I note your personal statement, which will be followed up in the appropriate manner, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0030/2004) by Mr De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report of the European Ombudsman for the year 2003.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament for the first time since the historic enlargement of the European Union and to present the European Ombudsman's annual report for 2003.
I took up my duties as Ombudsman on 1 April 2003, following the retirement of the first Ombudsman, Mr Jacob SÃ¶derman.
This report therefore covers his three final months in office, as well as my first nine months of work.
I would like to pay tribute to Mr SÃ¶derman for his excellent work and many achievements on behalf of European citizens, foremost of which is the establishment of the European Ombudsman as an effective, dynamic and well-respected institution, promoting openness, accountability and good administration.
I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing Commission for all its constructive work for citizens during its term of office and in particular to thank Vice-President Loyola de Palacio for her collaboration and support.
I look forward to working with Vice-President-designate Margot WallstrÃ¶m, whom I hope to be meeting soon in her new role.
The annual report for 2003 records the progress made by the institution of the European Ombudsman in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making itself better known to citizens, including, not least, the efforts to prepare the institution for enlargement and equip it to reach out to citizens in 25 Member States in the 21 Treaty languages.
In 2003, the total number of complaints received by the European Ombudsman was 2 436, representing a 10% increase on the previous year. In almost 70% of cases handled during 2003, help was provided to the complainant by opening an inquiry into the case, transferring it to a competent body or giving concrete advice on where to turn for prompt and effective action.
As I already indicated when appearing before the Committee on Petitions in April this year, the upward trend in complaints is continuing.
In the first 10 months of 2004, there has been an unprecedented 54% rise as compared to the same period last year.
I am confident that this does not reflect worsening administrative behaviour by European institutions, but rather an increased awareness by citizens of how to exercise their rights.
With the support and encouragement of Members of this House, we have made strenuous efforts in recent years to raise awareness among citizens of their right to complain.
I am convinced that these efforts have contributed to the increased use that is being made of our services and was heartened to see that Mr De Rossa's excellent report acknowledges these endeavours.
In 2003, 180 decisions closing cases following inquiries were made.
In 47% of cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration.
Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of an explanation from the institutional body concerned.
In 28% of cases, the inquiry resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the full satisfaction of the complainant, or in a friendly solution.
When a friendly solution was not possible, the case was closed with a critical remark or a draft recommendation was made.
Nine new draft recommendations were made during 2003, including one that led the Council to come into line with Parliament and the Commission by giving candidates in recruitment competitions access to their own marked examination scripts.
If an institutional body fails to cooperate, I can put the matter before this House in a special report.
I am happy to state that I saw no need to make such a special report concerning any of the cases closed during 2003.
Five new own-initiative investigations were launched in 2003, including an inquiry concerning the integration of persons with disabilities, particularly as regards measures to ensure that they are not discriminated against in their relations with the Commission.
Two own-initiative inquiries were closed with positive results during the year.
One of these led the Commission to change its tender procedures by allowing unsuccessful bidders time to challenge contract award decisions.
Most of these successes could not have been achieved without the active cooperation of other institutions in answering complaints rapidly, fully and correctly.
The 2003 report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to the Ombudsman's proposals and recommendations.
When I address Members and officials of the European Union institutions and bodies in person, as I did eight times in 2003, I am keen to underline the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints.
I would like to think that the Ombudsman can be seen as a valuable source of information for all institutions that wish to improve the quality of their administration.
The ultimate goal for all of us must be to provide the best possible service to the citizen.
Ombudsman institutions and similar bodies now exist at national level throughout the European Union, including all the new Member States. The sole exception is Italy.
Cooperation with these institutions and with their regional equivalents plays a vital role in improving the service to citizens through the exchange of information and experiences, the transfer of complaints between the European, national and regional levels and the provision of information to citizens about their rights under European law and about how to exercise and defend those rights.
The network of cooperation between the European Ombudsman and national and regional Ombudsmen throughout Europe, which comprises some 90 offices in 30 countries, was strengthened and intensified in 2003 with four high-level meetings in Athens, Valencia, Warsaw and Strasbourg.
Such cooperation is reinforced through regular communication initiatives by the European Ombudsman.
When I took office in April 2003, I committed myself to reaching out to citizens in every Member State, to inform them about the work of the European Ombudsman.
I therefore visited many Member States in 2003 and by 1 May 2004 had visited all ten accession countries.
I met national and regional Ombudsmen, high government officials and members of the judiciary and presented my work to non-governmental organisations, chambers of commerce, universities, the press and EU representatives.
The regular Eurobarometer surveys suggest that these visits are effective in promoting awareness of the European Ombudsman, which often increases after a visit.
Hits on the Ombudsman's website tend to confirm this.
The sharp rise in the number of complaints and, indeed, the number of admissible complaints further bears this out.
These information visits are complementary to the regular press and communication activities of the European Ombudsman which, in 2003, included over 80 speeches by the Ombudsman and the staff of the institution and a press release on average every nine working days.
Given the increased workload for the institution in terms of complaint handling, communications activities and liaison with national and regional Ombudsmen in the enlarged Europe, I proposed an increase in resources for the institution in the 2005 budget.
I am grateful to Parliament for having responded positively to that call, thereby allowing me to continue to serve citizens effectively.
I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Petitions for their support and constructive proposals, as set out in Mr De Rossa's report, and to put on record my appreciation of the work and positive contribution of that committee in the previous Parliament and of its then chairman, Mr Gemelli.
Many of the issues identified in this report will have to be addressed by the institutions, including, not least, access to documents, the infringement procedure and the Ombudsman's Statute.
However, let me react to some issues that are of direct concern to me as Ombudsman.
Firstly, we should not underestimate the importance of transparency in winning the trust of citizens.
As the De Rossa report rightly points out, there is still room for improvement, as evidenced by the fact that the lack or refusal of information still accounts for the greatest proportion of admissible complaints to my office.
Only last week, in response to a complaint from a Member of this House, I called on the Council to review its refusal to decide to meet publicly whenever it is acting in its legislative capacity.
The Constitution for Europe provides for the Council to meet in public when considering and voting on a draft legislative act, but surely citizens should not have to wait until the Constitution enters into force for this basic advance in openness.
I firmly believe that deliberating behind closed doors on issues that affect the daily lives of our citizens is something we cannot reasonably defend, especially now when all Member States have solemnly signed the text of the Constitution.
I was delighted to see that the De Rossa report emphasised the importance of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which elaborates on crucial elements of openness such as providing reasons for decisions and being service-minded and accessible in relations with the public.
I too regret that the Code is not yet fully applied by all the institutions and bodies, but expect the incoming Commission to build upon the commitments of Mrs de Palacio and begin working promptly towards a European administrative law, as envisaged in the Constitution for Europe.
Secondly, on the Ombudsman's Statute, in order to maintain confidence in the institution, the Ombudsman must be able to investigate the complaints that citizens entrust to him as thoroughly and as rigorously as possible.
During this legislature, I very much hope to have the opportunity to revisit the issue of the Statute, notably on the questions raised by the rapporteur regarding the Ombudsman's access to documents and the hearing of witnesses.
Thirdly and lastly, on enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Petitions, this is something that I am eager to develop.
In direct response to the suggestion in the De Rossa report, I see only advantages in the committee becoming a fully integrated member of the European network of Ombudsmen and similar bodies.
This network has proved a vital tool in terms of effective complaint handling and exchange of best practice.
We will continue to strengthen the network, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that the rights provided for under EU law become a daily reality for citizens.
I would therefore be delighted if the committee were to become fully engaged in this initiative.
With Parliament's agreement, I will see to it that my office makes the practical arrangements to implement this proposal in the very near future.
Next year the European Ombudsman will be celebrating its first ten years of existence.
It is my sincere belief that the relationships of goodwill, trust and understanding that have been built up over this period provide an excellent basis for further improving the quality of administration, to the benefit of citizens.
The European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions are vital partners for the European Ombudsman in this regard.
I look forward to ever stronger cooperation between our institutions in the future and I thank you very much for your attention.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that having become accustomed to compressing my thoughts into 60 seconds, it is something of a luxury to have five minutes to expound upon any issue.
I would like to thank the Ombudsman, MrÂ Diamandouros, for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the report.
I would also like to thank him for the excellent job he has done since his appointment.
He has confirmed the confidence that this Parliament placed in him on his appointment in April 2003.
In my view, he has more than justified that confidence.
I would also like to pay tribute to the former Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman, who undertook groundbreaking work in establishing the Ombudsman's office.
Mr Diamandouros has engaged in an astonishing level of activity, not only in dealing with the thousands of complaints he has received, but in preparing his office for enlargement and in visiting almost all of the Member States, including all ten new Member States.
One of the most striking statistics in his report â apart from the ever rising number of complaints, which the Ombudsman quite rightly points out is not necessarily a feature of deteriorating administration â is the fact that 75% of the complaints received by the Ombudsman's office did not in fact relate to his mandate.
That is not necessarily a bad thing, because it clearly indicates that the citizens see the Ombudsman's office as a port of call for problems they have with European institutions.
The Ombudsman very correctly ensures that all of those complaints are redirected to those bodies which can provide some redress for citizens, whether that is the Petitions Committee, the national Ombudsman offices, or other national institutions.
The role of the Ombudsman's office clearly is to ensure that there is good administration by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
The important role that the Petitions Committee plays is of course at the other side of that equation, where we seek to ensure that national governments and local authorities comply with European law in the interests of the citizen.
The report that we are dealing with today identifies a number of key reforms which in the view of the Petitions Committee need to be carried out if we are to ensure the democratic functioning of the European Union.
Openness, transparency and accountability are key building blocks to building a European demos.
We argue therefore that there is now a need, in the light of ten years' experience of the Ombudsman's office, to review its statute.
This need is also a result of the establishment of OLAF and indeed the fact that, quite shortly, we are hopefully going to ratify a constitution which contains a charter of citizens' rights and which will clearly enhance the role of the citizen in Europe.
The review must be undertaken by the European Parliament in cooperation with the Ombudsman's office and I hope that we can get review under way quite soon.
The Commission also needs to amend its procedures to allow parliamentary scrutiny and investigation by the Ombudsman of the infringement procedures.
We are currently denied the right to scrutinise those procedures, which I believe is improper.
The Council, in my view, must now accept Parliament's amendments to the Ombudsman's statute on access to documents, as the Ombudsman pointed out.
This Parliament, through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Almeida Garrett report, pointed out that there was a need to amend that statute, because at the moment, Article 3(2) imposes restrictions in terms of the Ombudsman's investigative powers and, as it is currently worded, denies access to documents which can be refused on duly substantiated grounds of secrecy and accuracy.
Access to documents from a Member State that are classified as secret may be granted only where that Member State has given its prior agreement.
In addition, employees of the institutions called on to testify must speak 'in accordance with the instructions from their administrations and shall continue to be bound by their duty of professional secrecy'.
This is not an acceptable situation in this day and age.
The Ombudsman, in whom Parliament and the other institutions have put their confidence, does not have access to documents and is denied access in this way.
Finally, I would also like to urge the Commission â pending the adoption of a legally binding code of good administration for all three institutions, which is provided for in the new constitution â to now buy into the voluntary common code which the Council and the Parliament are already applying.
It would be right and proper that they should do that.
I have one final brief remark to make.
This Parliament needs to review the manner in which the Council deals with Question Time in this House.
I sat in on Question Time yesterday and the President-in-Office refused to answer virtually every single supplementary question put to him.
I believe this to be contempt for Parliament and I intend to make a formal complaint, but I also believe we need to review how we deal with this.
We either have a real Question Time where the Council is held to account in this Parliament, or we abandon Question Time entirely.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ DeÂ Rossa, the Commission has read the report on the activities of the Ombudsman for the year 2003 with great interest.
As you are aware, this debate comes at a critical time, when the new parliamentary term has just begun and the procedure for appointing the future European Ombudsman is underway.
During last yearâs debate on the report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2002, the Commission took the opportunity to congratulate the first European Ombudsman, MrÂ SÃ¶derman, on the role he had played in establishing a European ombudsman system, and I would like to congratulate MrÂ Diamandouros, his successor, for the excellent work he has carried out.
MrÂ Diamandouros took up his post in April 2003, and has improved the efficiency of the institution he represents in promoting good public administration and respect for the rule of law and human rights.
The contribution he has made has been an invaluable one, both for the Commission and for the European public as a whole.
The Commission believes that the stepping up of contacts with national and regional authorities which act as mediators between citizens and public administrations in the Member States has made it possible to heighten the role of the European Ombudsman and bring the institution to the attention of the European public, something which the Ombudsman has highlighted.
This is of paramount importance, as institutions which no one knows about will not be used, and their value will not be demonstrated.
Both the Commission and the Ombudsman have taken note of the increase in the number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman, and the Commission believes that this increase will continue as the effects of enlargement become apparent.
Furthermore, I agree entirely with the Ombudsmanâs comments to the effect that an increase in the number of complaints does not mean that the situation on the ground is lacking in any way; it simply means that citizens are gaining an ever greater awareness of their rights, and this can only be a good thing.
With regard to the handling of cases, the Commission is delighted that in many instances the European authorities have taken measures which are likely to lead to a solution.
As far as amendments to the Statute of the European Ombudsman are concerned, it is now up to Parliament to take the initiative and to take a majority decision, with the approval of the Council, as the Commissionâs role will merely be to give an opinion.
You can however be sure, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission will examine any new initiative carefully and with an open mind.
The Commission did not wish to act hastily with regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which will be binding upon all EU institutions and bodies.
The inspiration for the Commissionâs Code, which entered into force in November 2000, mainly came from proposals put forward by the Ombudsman.
The first implementation report only covers the year 2001, and so we do not yet have the hindsight needed to put forward a proposal on an interinstitutional code.
We will therefore continue to work on the basis of more thorough information to ascertain whether this Code needs amending, and, if so, how it should be amended.
The Commission concurs with Parliamentâs proposals relating to EPSO, the interinstitutional body which was recently established to draw up reserve lists from among the best candidates in open competitions in line with the needs indicated by each institution.
Selection procedures must respect the rules and practices relating to transparency and openness which have been established over time, thanks in particular to the Ombudsmanâs activities.
The Commission supports Parliamentâs call to the EU institutions and bodies to apply the Regulation regarding public access to documents.
The Commission would like to point out that RegulationÂ 1049/2001 will in future also apply to EU agencies, which should make it easier to resolve various complaints.
With regard to access to documents relating to infringement procedures, what matters is that the Commission has the room for manoeuvre it needs to conduct its enquiries independently.
A balance must be found between the principle of transparency and the confidentiality necessary for dialogue between the Commission and the Member States.
The Commissionâs practices comply with the case-law of the Court of First Instance.
The Commission has revised its working practices for infringement procedures which have been closed, and documents are frequently made available on the basis of a case-by-case analysis.
So, MrÂ DeÂ Rossa, MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, this is what the Commission has to say for the time being in response to the report that has been put forward.
The Commission would also like to extend its sincere thanks, on its own behalf and on behalf of all citizens, to the Committee on Petitions for its excellent work.
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the chairman of this committee that I myself held this office 15 years ago.
The Committee on Petitions is making a tremendous contribution to citizenship.
Â Â  â Mr President, the 2003 annual report submitted by the European Ombudsman to the President of the European Parliament and presented to the Committee on Petitions deserves to be approved by all of us in keeping both with Mr De Rossa's report and the relevant resolution.
However, our duties do not end with approving the annual report.
We all need to take note of its basic conclusions and bear them in mind for further action.
We need to take account of the information given and to call for the lack of open character and absence of transparency in the operation of the European institutions to be addressed.
The fact that 75% of complaints do not come within the scope of the European Ombudsman does not reflect badly on the institution, because these complaints were referred to other agencies.
However, what is important for us is the analysis of the 25% of complaints accepted, two-thirds of which relate to the European Commission, in other words, the Community institution which takes decisions which impact on citizens.
Complaints were, of course, also made about the European Parliament and the Council, but for services such as the Personnel Selection Office.
One might, however, say that, even if we take account of the 40% increase in the number of complaints which MrÂ Diamandouros announced in 2004, few of the 425Â million European citizens took recourse to the European Ombudsman, an institution which has already been up and running for ten years and which has been served with acknowledged success and strengthened by the presence of both the first Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman, and his current successor, Nikiforos Diamandouros.
As the elected representatives of European citizens, however, we cannot permit that even one citizen should not enjoy the provisions of Articles 41, 42 and 43 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which now forms part of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, as approved by the Council.
It may not recognise extrajudicial remedies, but if, in accordance with Article 1(2) of the new Constitution, decisions must be taken both as openly and closely to citizens as possible, the role of the European Ombudsman and of the administrative Commissioners is a guarantee of honest administration, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Nor must we forget that our obligations to reinforce the efficiency of the institution must be implemented and we welcome the Commissioner's statements.
Finally, I would emphasise that it is to the credit of the European Ombudsman that he is conducting five own initiative investigations, the most exemplary being into the abolition of discrimination against the disabled on the part of European institutions.
As vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I should also like to express thanks for the proper and mutual transmission of cases, for the benefit of European citizens.
Â Â  . We would like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on his outstanding report, which accomplishment was certainly the outcome of hard work.
We would also like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his outstanding speech in which he outlined his activity as European Ombudsman.
To the socialists the most important thing is to reinforce the quality of democracy by placing the citizen in the centre of our work.
Most of our goals were echoed in both Mr Diamandourosâ and Mr De Rossaâs report; however, there are lots of areas to be further improved in order to provide the best possible service to citizens.
First of all, we call upon institutions to act as if the Constitutional Treaty were in force, especially with regard to the Council.
When acting as a legislative body, they should do so in a public and transparent manner.
I especially welcomed the Ombudsmanâs recommendation in this field.
The strengthening of European democracy is not possible without openness and transparency and it is unfortunate that there is still no transparency and that the Council continues to act behind closed doors.
Secondly, we support the work of the European Fundamental Rights Agency.
As you know, the committee has just recently published a discussion document.
I sincerely hope that the committee will thoroughly and comprehensively consult those who are involved in the representation and protection of citizenship rights, namely the Committee on Petitions of this House and the European Ombudsman.
The institution of the Ombudsman will be ten years old next year, and therefore it would be timely to review the reform of the Ombudsmanâs status.
Let us define the areas in which the institution of the European Ombudsman can be strengthened, for instance in the area of accessibility to documents.
Finally, I would like to welcome Mr Diamandourosâ commitment, with which he deepened mutual cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and his liaison network.
I am grateful for his help with our information campaign, which aims to familiarise citizens with the rights granted to them by the Constitutional Treaty and to make known to them their right to petition Parliament and lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman.
Mr President, dear colleagues, I would like to conclude my remarks by pointing out to you, as Mr Diamandouros has pointed out so many times, that the only way citizens will trust and believe in the Union is if their rights become part of their daily reality.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on his successful and comprehensive report.
The Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has improved the definition of the content of European citizenship, which had already been introduced by the Maastricht Treaty.
The protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens has thus made progress, in an improvement of relations between the Union and its citizens.
Even though they enjoy rights and are subject to Community rules relating to their activities, citizens today have few options for defending themselves against any cases of maladministration, and there is thus an ever more urgent need to guarantee civil coexistence in the best possible way and to come up with practical responses to societyâs needs.
The Ombudsmanâs task is to put forward appropriate solutions and to assert the fundamental rights and safeguards of the individual.
The institution of the Ombudsman is the most obvious expression of that sovereignty which is rooted in the people, and which acts in defence of individual rights against the institutions, from which citizens ask to be protected.
At heart, the European Ombudsman and the whole system of European local ombudsmen offer every citizen the opportunity to refer to them and, if necessary, to make use of their services, to make the European institutions more transparent and efficient, and to contribute to the Unionâs enlargement to include other applicant countries, while fostering the development of a culture of protecting citizenship rights.
The European Ombudsman is, therefore, the port of call for any citizen who feels his or her rights have been violated: he may investigate and put forward solutions in cases of maladministration by the Community institutions and, if the conciliation solutions he suggests fail, he may make recommendations or refer the issue to the European Parliament.
According to the annual report which our Ombudsman has presented to us, to date he has been busy â and in this he has also been effectively aided by the network of European national and local ombudsmen â with a huge range of issues: tax provisions, project funding, rules on competition, discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, health, income or other reasons, late payments, contractual disputes, arbitrary discrimination, lack of transparency or the refusal of various EU institutions to provide access to information.
The importance of his timely and impartial actions is therefore obvious to all.
His office, introduced into the Community system by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, now mainly operates within the area of defending citizens faced with a jungle of regulations and orders, which are already extensive within individual countries, and which will become ever more complex as a more complete supranational legal system is built.
For this reason the European Parliament, in thanking the Ombudsman, ought to undertake to highlight the importance of his office, as well as the Committee on Petitions itself, which is its operational arm for analysis, monitoring and making proposals, so as to foster the process of democratisation and social cohesion.
With the work of the European Ombudsman, assisted by the Commission and its technical systems, it is now possible to better consolidate the concept of European citizenship, to publicise and promote a culture of defence of the people in Europe, moving from a model of bureaucracy which weighs upon the EU institutions to one of defence of the people, and above all of power to the people â in other words, democracy in action.
In the light of this qualitative leap, I approve in organisational terms of the report which was presented to us today.
In this way we will be able to continue to reinforce the system protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the principles of cooperation and subsidiarity, in such a way that European citizens truly become masters, and not merely an electorate that is called upon to vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, on having produced such a sensible report and on his willingness to defend the amendments we have proposed to the Commission, sometimes by means of compromises.
The report on the European Ombudsman offers a very clear picture of the type of problems facing the citizens when dealing with European administration.
Amongst other things, the report notes that, despite the work done, in particular by the European Ombudsman and his team, the citizens are still experiencing problems obtaining information and documents from the institutions.
It is also necessary to do considerably more work to ensure that the process for selecting civil servants is more transparent and more based on merit.
This report also shows us that, if we want to ensure that the European Union is more accepted by the citizens, and that the citizens comply with the laws laid down by the Union, it is essential not to give the impression that some people are above the law.
This does not just affect the European institutions, but also the Member States, since they participate in the development of Europe via the Council and they are equally responsible for applying European legislation.
In this regard, we have presented amendments stressing the need to take account of the Commissionâs future role as guardian of the Treaties, particularly at this time, with the European Constitution about to be ratified.
While we are all aware that the mandate of the European Ombudsman only applies, amongst other things, to the European institutions, his office plays an important role in terms of monitoring the correct application of Community legislation.
I would therefore urge the European Ombudsman, in cooperation with Parliament and its Committee on Petitions, as well as the European Commission, to establish the necessary criteria to clarify when an infringement procedure should be opened and the principles on which those measures will be based.
Finally, I would like to refer to the amendments I have presented concerning the need to establish a general system of non-judicial measures, in order to give the citizens more power.
This amendment is based, once again, on the fact that the role of the European Ombudsman is to give the citizens the opportunity to express their views on issues that affect them.
I welcome both the European Ombudsman's report and that of the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, and congratulate them on their work.
Sinn Fein is committed to an EU that is accessible to the people.
We support measures that make the work of the EU more transparent, accountable, efficient and effective.
The citizens of the European Union demand and deserve institutions that deal with their concerns and complaints in a professional and open manner, and which are prepared to admit their failures and bring about adequate redress.
However, as the rapporteur makes clear in his report, a number of bodies, including the European Commission, have not adhered to recommendations and regulations on access to public documents.
It is both regrettable and unacceptable that a number of institutions did not give full disclosure of documents to the Ombudsman's office.
I want to reinforce the recommendation in the rapporteur's report that the Ombudsman should have unlimited access to documents in connection with any inquiries.
The work of the EU Ombudsman brings into focus the wider debate on accountability â or, more accurately, the lack of accountability â within the European Union.
As welcome and as necessary as the work of the EU Ombudsman is, that office is not a panacea for the European Union's democratic deficit.
Let us be realistic and clear.
Transparency, accountability and trust will not be secured through the effective operation of the EU Ombudsman's office alone.
Significant political change is required.
We must seriously go about the job of democratising the European Union.
We must create an EU that complements the role of the Member State, not one that undermines it.
We need an EU that allows local and regional democracy to flourish and which respects the sovereignty of Member States and their people.
Without this reorientation the Ombudsman's role, however worthy, can only be overwhelmed by our democratic deficit.
Â Â  . Mr President, I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his report, as well as the Ombudsman.
Given the situation, aren't we lucky to have Mr Diamandouros!
Please consider first, however, the situation that gives rise to an Ombudsman: a fundamental shift from real democracy to process democracy. It is a shift of power from the people to the bureaucrats, creating not a democracy, but a democracy-flavoured bureaucracy.
In a real democracy there is no need for an Ombudsman.
People speak for themselves, directly through their votes and through local participation.
If their representatives do not reflect their will, they are replaced.
Do the people know that they have lost their power?
They certainly have not been told.
If a vote were a unit of currency and real power was an item in a shop, it would be interesting to compare our buying power now to that we enjoyed 20 years ago or 20 years before that.
I believe we would find that there has been a cheapening of democracy.
At some level people know that their democratic currency has been devalued.
A growing awareness is mirrored in the chronically low election polls in European elections.
In view of this democratic deficit, I must be thankful that we have an Ombudsman to fight our corner â a corner that, in a democracy, we should be able to fight ourselves.
I am even more thankful that given the endless, faceless bureaucracy that people have to deal with in our process democracy, we have, as this report points out, a well-intentioned Ombudsman.
In the meantime, even as I direct constituents to the Ombudsman, I will continue to insist on a return of power to the people, which will lead to a real democracy.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Ombudsman, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor not only on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, but also as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions.
Extremely close cooperation exists between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, as both these institutions deal directly with citizensâ concerns, as well as contacting citizens directly and being directly contacted by citizens.
Nowadays, it is often said that EU institutions are removed from the life of citizens.
When the public feels that it has no connection with what is happening in the European Union, the office of Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are institutions to which all citizens can turn with their concerns and be sure that these concerns will be dealt with, or at least that they will receive a satisfactory explanation.
Citizensâ problems are of paramount importance, and the roles played by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are therefore also of great significance.
We cooperate very closely with the Ombudsman, and believe he does a very good job.
As well as cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, cooperation also exists with this House in the case of extremely important matters, including those which Parliament examines on the initiative of the Ombudsman and those upon which the Committee on Petitions has given an opinion.
It has now become abundantly clear that the role played by the Ombudsman, an institution set up in opposition, so to speak, to the other institutions, is a fundamental one.
Today we are examining the report for the year 2003, upon which MrÂ DeÂ Rossa has spoken on behalf of our committee.
We have a very high opinion of the Ombudsmanâs work.
I should merely like to add that, for obvious reasons, the institution of ombudsman never used to exist in Communist countries.
It was only as Communism declined, in its final days, that the post of ombudsman was created in Poland.
This post is gaining greater authority in my homeland with every parliamentary term.
It was also a pleasure for me to hear that MrsÂ Reding, the Commission representative, once held the post that it is my privilege to hold today.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party.
I am the mayor of a small town just outside Rome and, in the course of my administrative duties, I have had occasion to remark on the importance of the role of the ombudsman, as an interface and filter between the administration and citizens.
Although he operates in a different context, the European Ombudsman must â or ought to â be a modern, effective and efficient point of contact between the Community institutions and Europeans, bringing us closer to making a reality of every citizenâs fundamental right to sound administration conducted by means of transparent and fair criteria, as enshrined in the Nice Charter.
I welcome the course that has been embarked upon, of instituting a network of ombudsmen and other national and local bodies to which the complaints may be referred where the Ombudsman does not have jurisdiction.
Efforts to create a complete and useful system of extra-judicial resources for European citizens should be stepped up.
Additionally, following these first months of work as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I must nevertheless say that, as demonstrated by the data in the report we are debating, excellently drafted by MrÂ DeÂ Rossa, there is still considerable disinformation and confusion over the precise areas of competence of the European Ombudsman.
Even though in 2003 work progressed in due fashion, in accordance with the procedures, it is important to make a significant change in the way that individual European citizens perceive the Ombudsman by bringing his office, which up to now has been too remote, closer to daily life.
The hoped-for review of the Ombudsmanâs statute ought to focus on this aspect to increase the real, concrete chances of finding solutions to the problems submitted to him.
We need a European Ombudsman who can become a genuine link between the Community, the and the institutions which govern it.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to place on record my thanks and those of Parliament first and foremost to Roy Perry, my predecessor, who did so much to enhance the role of the Committee on Petitions, of which the Ombudsman's role is such an important feature.
I would also like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on a cogent report, and join him in thanking Mr SÃ¶derman for his services as Ombudsman and Mr Diamandouros for his time served to date.
I wish to make five quick points.
One, the Commission should reconsider its antipathy to a more open and effective control of Member States, particularly in regard to the implementation of Community law on public access to documents relating to the infringement procedure.
Two, the Code of Administrative Behaviour should be observed by all the EU's institutions and bodies, not excluding the Commission itself.
My Group will press this cause until it is achieved.
Three, my Group is wholly in support of an increase and improvement in the Ombudsman's investigative powers.
Four, we have heard that 75% of the complaints are declared inadmissible.
We must have a continuing education campaign throughout the European Union to improve the awareness of the Ombudsman and indeed the petitions procedure amongst our citizens.
Five, finally I would urge the Commission and the Council to insist on â indeed to demand â firm deadlines by which responses to the Ombudsman, the Committee on Petitions and, above all, to the petitioners or complainants, are made.
As a school report might say, all in all, so far so good.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros and the rapporteur on their work.
I should now like to turn to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
Contrary to criticism, the regulation on public access to documents works quite well.
I urge the Commission to accept our demand for a revision of that regulation, especially in respect of the new Constitution.
If the Council is to meet in public when it acts in a legislative capacity, we need a definition of a 'legislative capacity'.
I should like to mention Mrs Sinnott's remarks.
It seems she has left the Chamber, but she indicated that the Ombudsman is a manifestation of an undemocratic process.
Is she stating that the Scandinavian countries with an ombudsman enshrined in their constitutions are undemocratic?
If that is what she means to say, then she should apologise.
I should also like to say to another honourable Member, who I believe is a member of UKIP â she must be sleeping! â that the role of an ombudsman reinvigorates and reinforces the democratic process.
It is a part of the appeal process and it is about recourse to natural justice.
With regard to the infringement proceedings, I do not share the opinion that the infringement proceeding process is being abused by the Commission.
The infringement process often leads to a judicial process.
To make such documents public before a decision to go to the courts is made is to undermine either side in that legal process.
I thank Mr Diamandouros and the House for listening so politely.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the biggest majority at the European elections last June was won by the abstainers.
European citizens would all agree that they sent a clear message in every direction.
They do not feel that Europe expresses their views, concerns them or protects them on a daily basis.
In particular young people, women and socially excluded groups of citizens in general ascribe the disdain which they experience on a daily basis to the policy of the European Union.
Nonetheless, compared with this more general trend, we see that European citizens' confidence in the institution of the European Ombudsman has risen astronomically.
As the statistics show, complaints by European citizens this year alone are expected to increase by 40%.
If we interpret these statistics, apart from confirming that the institution was worthily represented both by Mr SÃ¶derman and by my compatriot, Mr Diamandouros, we find that European citizens are rewarding an institution which satisfies the obvious for them, by which I mean access to the institutions of the European Union.
However, what is needed in order for the institutions to function better and be considered worthy, apart from the personalities which represent them, is for them to be strengthened.
We often speak of the democratic deficit, of the lack of transparency or political will in a way which automatically forces my generation to classify them using political .
So let us therefore simply stop stating the problems and let us look for feasible solutions, solutions in deed, not in word, while at the same time supporting the institutions.
It is, of course, a fact that the new Constitution safeguards the institution of the Ombudsman and promotes, perhaps not perfectly, but certainly better than today, transparency and democratic participation in the Union.
If we support both, perhaps at the next elections we shall be surprised, this time pleasantly.
Perhaps we shall start to regain the confidence of the citizens and convince them to participate more in the common ventures of Europe.
Europe is changing.
That was the slogan of the last European elections.
Personally, I am convinced. However, it is up to all of us to change in a positive direction.
Â Â  Mr President, where there are systems there will be failures, and despite the comments by Kathy Sinnott, we have a very effective Office of the Ombudsman in Ireland and we are a democracy, so both go hand in hand.
I note that 2,500 complaints were received by your Office in 2003.
In my view that is very low. In Ireland roughly the same number of complaints are made annually, and we are rather small compared to the EU.
I also note, however, that there was a 40% increase in the number of complaints over the year in question.
I suppose that is because of the work you have done in making your office more familiar to the public. I do not think it is because the EU institutions work better than Member State institutions.
All institutions suffer from the problem of protecting themselves rather than looking after the public.
I know that many of the complaints you receive do not fall within your remit, but this serves yet again to prove the point that citizens simply do not know where to turn when they run into administrative and other difficulties.
As a newly elected MEP I too have difficulties with this Institution, so I share the problems that the citizens have.
I would like to say that, in general, a more client-focused approach by all of the institutions would make you redundant, though I do not think that will happen in the near future.
At national level, at least in Ireland, the Office of the Ombudsman has been a very positive force for change.
It has changed the system and the culture, and I believe that your office should be a similar force for change, not just a problem-solving office for the individual but one that can change the system for all citizens and for the better.
I wish you well in your work.
Â Â  Mr President, in 2003 the European Ombudsman dealt with 363 inquiries.
Of the 2Â 436 complaints received, 250 of those inquiries were initiated in 2003 and 110 were inquiries which were not closed at the end of December 2002.
I would like to make two observations about these figures.
Firstly, on the face of it this seems a very small number of inquiries compared with the complaints received and begs the question, even if the EU citizen knows that the European Ombudsman exists, does he or she know what he know what he actually does?
It may upset the consensus here this morning, and I do not mean any offence by this, but could many of the new Members of this Parliament even name the Ombudsman?
I doubt very much that they could.
I would like to point out that 66.9% of those inquiries related to the European Commission â so much for the Commission as guardian of the Treaties.
However, for fear that we will become complacent in this House, 10.7% of the inquiries referred to the European Parliament, the second highest number.
Secondly, while the 10% increase in complaints to the Ombudsman is not to be welcomed, we should recognise and interpret these figures within the context of the efforts that the office has made to increase its profile.
However, could the 54% increase announced today by the Ombudsman be connected to the fact that a lot of Members of the European Parliament were in election mode and generating publicity?
I note what has been said about EPSO and I would urge that greater efforts be made to remove the difficulties which exist there.
In conclusion I would like to reiterate the importance of the many roles of the Ombudsman and to wish him well in his duties.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much appreciate the willingness of the House to listen to my concluding remarks.
I will be very brief.
I wish to thank all the Members of the House who honoured me with their remarks for the constructive nature of those remarks.
I wish to thank Mrs Reding for her comments and to point out that, as 13 years ago she was chairman of the Committee on Petitions, she has the experience needed to appreciate the kind of work done by that committee and by the Office of the Ombudsman.
I wish to thank Mr Libicki, chairman of the Committee on Petitions, for his comments, and to assure him that I look forward to working closely with him in promoting the joint and common goals of the Ombudsman in that committee.
I will not answer all the comments individually, but would like to make some general points.
I would urge the Commission to revisit the issue of the Code.
The Commissioner might have been too modest in saying that she does not have the information at the moment to be able to assess the possibility of moving forward.
To the extent that this is possible, I assure her that I am at her and the Commission's disposal to help move this issue forward for the benefit of all citizens.
Access to documents, transparency and the promotion of non-judicial means are, and will remain, at the top of my priorities.
Let me conclude by making three remarks. In addition to the 54% increase in complaints this year, we have also experienced a 62% increase in admissible complaints.
This suggests that more and more people are coming to us for the right reasons. That suggests, in turn, that we have been successful in informing people of how to proceed correctly and about what we can do for them.
My second point concerns the fact that 70% of the complaints were made against the Commission.
This clearly does not suggest that the Commission is working worse.
It simply reflects the fact that it is with the Commission that the vast majority of citizens have dealings.
It is inevitable that the majority of complaints made will be against the Commission.
The degree of resolution and cooperation we receive from the Commission is high.
I will keep on top of this situation, and remain very conscious of the need for me to act as a control mechanism in respect of the institutions, including the Commission.
Lastly, I want to go on record again in thanking MrÂ DeÂ Rossa for his report, thanking the Committee on Petitions and thanking this House for its support.
I remain committed to serving the citizens with your cooperation and support.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
Â Â  I would like to welcome the delegation of the Swiss Federal Assembly, chaired by Mr David Eugen.
The delegations from Switzerland and from the European Parliament are holding their twenty-third inter-parliamentary meeting today in Strasbourg.
I would like to stress the important role played by the inter-parliamentary meetings between Switzerland and the European Union in terms of promoting cooperation and mutual understanding between our citizens.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I wish them a fruitful and productive meeting.
I would also like to welcome the Delegation of the Parliament of Azerbaijan, headed by Mr Siruz Tebrizli, Chairman of that Parliamentâs Committee on Human Rights and head of Azerbaijanâs delegation in the Parliamentary Committee on EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation.
That delegation is here for its annual meeting with the delegation of the European Parliament.
I wish them a happy stay in Strasbourg.
(1)
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that we share a common ambition: a strong and independent Commission that can drive Europe forward with this Parliament and with all those who have that same vision.
I take note of the resolution on which you have just voted.
I look forward to examining it closely.
However, my first impression is that it can provide a good basis for us to reach agreement on how we will work together over the next five years.
These arrangements should be formalised through an early updating of the framework agreement adopted in 1999, to guide the cooperation between our two institutions.
I would only ask that our agreed approach takes account of our respective roles and obligations and the European Union Treaty.
Before dealing with detailed points set out in point 5 of your resolution, let me reconfirm that I stand by my commitments regarding the creation of a Commissioners' Group on Fundamental Rights and new proposals in this important area.
Turning to the specific issues in point 5, let me give a first response.
With regard to points 5 (a), (b) and (c), as I indicated yesterday, I have sought and received a commitment from my team that the Commissioners will resign if I ask them to do so.
I will examine very seriously any criticism expressed by this Parliament regarding the performance of Commissioners.
I stand ready to explain to Parliament the conclusions that I draw.
In this way we are affirming the principle of individual responsibility of every Commissioner, without calling into question the principle of collegiality for which, under the Treaty, the President of the Commission is guarantor.
With regard to the replacement of Commissioners, we must make a distinction between the current situation, which foresees no role for either the Commission President or Parliament, and the future situation under the Constitution.
The Constitution will bring the procedure for replacing Commissioners closer to the procedure for the confirmation of the Commission at the start of its mandate.
In this transitional phase, I can therefore agree that new Commission members should not appear officially before this Parliament until they have met with the relevant parliamentary committee.
As regards their appearance before Council, that is not entirely in my hands, since a nominated new Commissioner will have to carry out duties linked to his or her portfolio.
In the event of a reshuffle of my team, I accept a similar obligation that Commissioners whose portfolios change should not appear officially before this Parliament until they have met with the relevant parliamentary committee.
With regard to points 2 and 5 (d), your resolution suggests that we have not yet taken the necessary steps to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
Yesterday I explained the detailed arrangements for dealing with potential conflict of interest problems that might arise in a portfolio.
Let us now implement them. We will have the opportunity to assess their effectiveness at a later stage.
I will make any further changes that prove necessary in the light of experience.
With regard to point 5 (e), as I indicated in July, I share Parliament's view of the need to strengthen multiannual programming and strategic planning, together with the Council.
I will therefore present to you in January draft proposals for the five-year strategic objectives of the Union, which should be jointly adopted by all institutions.
I will listen to your debate on the subject in December and take account of your main concerns.
This anticipates this important new area of cooperation, also provided for in the Constitution.
Now points 5 (f) and 5 (g).
Our relationship must be built on trust and regular contacts.
My team will therefore give priority to appearing before this Parliament.
Both I and Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m intend to maintain regular and active contact with the Conference of Presidents.
The announcement of Commission decisions and proposals to Parliament reflects the current arrangements under the framework agreement, which I am, of course, willing to respect.
Nevertheless, I believe that this has not always been implemented satisfactorily, either for the Parliament or for the Commission, particularly as regards communicating effectively to the wider public what the Union does.
I hope that we can discuss improvements to this arrangement, focused on identifying the most important proposals deserving the attention of Parliament and our joint communication effort.
Presentation of these proposals should be timed as far as possible to coincide with plenary sessions.
If we can do this, I would argue for greater flexibility on other more routine initiatives.
Point 5 (h).
The Commission already explains how it will follow up the positions of Parliament on legislative proposals.
Experience shows that this mechanism is useful and I will be happy to extend it to positions taken by Parliament in cases other than legislation.
Point 5 (i). We need to distinguish between issues related to the flow of information between the Commission and the European Parliament and issues linked more generally to access to European documents covered by existing legislation (Regulation 1049/01)
I am happy to look with you at ways of improving the flow of information between Parliament and the Commission.
As I stated last July, it is a fundamental requirement for this Parliament to provide democratic oversight.
In relation to Regulation 1049/01, we should consider practical experience with the rules on access to documents. Nevertheless, we should not forget that those rules have been enforced for only a little over two years.
We should not therefore plan an immediate review, but rather agree a timetable for a review during the lifetime of this Parliament.
Since the rules on access to documents were agreed by codecision, we should not forget that this is an area where the agreement of the Council will also be required.
Point 5 (j). The main guidelines of the code of conduct governing the behaviour and operation of the new Commission have already been endorsed by my team.
I am willing to inform the European Parliament of any changes to the provisions of the code on conflicts of interests or ethical behaviour and will take due account of any views it expresses on such changes.
Point 5 (k). I believe the common approach to setting agreed priorities and planning our work and the more regular contacts between our institutions will help to improve the flow of information in these two areas.
However, we should look at possible improvements in the light of current experience.
Mr President, honourable Members, generally speaking I consider this resolution a good basis.
Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m and I will work with you constructively, addressing the points I have just made and any others that our two institutions might think appropriate, with the aim of reinforcing the roles of the European Parliament and the Commission in their work for Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few weeks we have been witness to what I believe to be a valuable exercise in European democracy.
Not once have you heard me utter a single word in criticism of Parliament, even during the most difficult times and even when no agreement could be reached.
Quite the contrary, I have always given you constructive answers, which were proof of my desire to cooperate with your institution.
It is my opinion that we have now resolved all the problems in a spirit of compromise, and, after all, the only way in which Europe can be built is in a spirit of compromise.
It is impossible to please all the people all the time; compromises must always be made.
We have reached an outcome which is, on the whole, satisfactory, and I am delighted at this fact.
We owe it to the people of Europe to ensure that the European institutions which come out of this exercise are stronger and better able to meet the publicâs expectations.
You will be aware of what these expectations are: more growth, more jobs and a strengthening of the European model, which combines reforms and economic dynamism with solidarity and social cohesion.
You have before you a competent and efficient Commission, and I can assure you that as its leader I will devote all my energies to achieving these objectives and to ensuring that the men and women of Europe notice what has changed.
I am counting on your support.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has just adopted, and by a very, very large majority, a resolution which â I am firmly convinced â represents further progress towards a more parliamentary European Union.
It is clear from this convincing result that this House is united in its desire to work constructively with the Commission while also exercising its parliamentary and democratic control over it.
Our resolution expresses a desire for a good working relationship between the Commission and this House.
The Commission and Parliament need to regard each other, in principle, as allies, and that not only because of the attitude of some governments.
Necessary though it is that this House should monitor the Commission, we would have you know, Mr President of the Commission, that we are, in principle, always shoulder to shoulder with it, for it is an important European Union institution.
When acting as the guardian of the Treaties and watching over adherence to the law, you will always have us, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, at your side.
As you mentioned in your response, we want to implement the content of this resolution in the form of a framework agreement with you, just as we had done with the Prodi Commission, and we should start working on that together soon.
It will then be for Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, as the future Vice-President, to continue the work of her remarkable predecessor Mrs de Palacio, with whom we negotiated the framework agreement.
What is very important is what we have resolved as regards the confidence that we place in the members of the Commission or deny them, and, if Parliament adopts a motion of no confidence in one of them, it is then that you, Mr President of the Commission, must give serious thought â as is already stated in the agreement with the Prodi Commission â as to whether you should dismiss him or her.
If you do not do as this House demands, then you must appear before it to justify yourself, and that, in parliamentary terms, represents an advance over the situation that existed before.
At no time in the course of the next five years must your Commission include among its members anyone who has not gone through the parliamentary process.
If changes are made in the Commission, for whatever reason, we insist that every new member of the Commission should undergo hearings in this House.
That is what it says in the resolution, and we are going to make sure that it is in the framework agreement.
It is good to see the whole college of the Commission here, and what we expect of you throughout your mandate is that you should always give an account of yourselves to Parliament whenever it â through the plenary, its committees, or any other of its bodies â so demands.
When Parliament summons you, your presence before it takes precedence over all other commitments you may have made, and that is important, for it is to Parliament that you are responsible.
On this we will insist, and â in view of the widely divergent conduct of the members of the former Commission in their dealings with this House â we will be very vigilant to see that this is actually done.
Your strategic programme will be very important, and we expect you to present it in January.
In an earlier resolution, the Conference of Presidents had in fact decided that, had the process not been delayed, we would have had a debate in November, in this part-session, on what this Houseâs expectations of this are.
We have now decided that the House will set out its principles in a resolution in December.
It is then that you can, and must, not only take note of Parliamentâs positions, but also bring them and the Commissionâs strategic programme into line.
Let me also say that our group finds it regrettable that the motion on subsidiarity tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was not adopted.
It is our contention that, where Europe has the competence to act, it must do so, with strength and reason, but it must not claim every task and role for itself; there are still the municipalities, the districts, the regions, and the nation states.
Each of these four levels has its own tasks to perform, and that is why we adhere to the principle of subsidiarity.
Let me conclude by saying that our group will, today, be united in expressing our confidence in you.
While being alongside you, we will express criticisms in a positive way, but will also be determined to exercise our right of parliamentary control, and so, with that in mind, we wish you, Mr President, and your college of Commissioners, all the best and every success for the next five years.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to quote from something once said by Willy Brandt, a great European, a Member of this House, and one of the most significant of MEPs.
Willy Brandt said that the European Parliament was not given rights; it had to fight for them.
This House has indeed fought for rights for itself over the past three weeks, and we can all take pride in the fact that it succeeded, for we have put a stop to a trend â the trend towards excessive governmental power in the European Union.
We have made it clear that Parliament, being the freely-elected representative assembly of the peoples, is equal to, and possesses the same prerogatives as, the bodies representing the states and their governments.
What we have seen happening here in this House over the past three weeks is a demonstration of how far democracy has advanced in Europe.
This struggle against governments, and also against executives with which one does not agree, is what parliaments are elected for; it is the reason why they exist, and it is in order to engage in this struggle that delegates are elected to parliaments.
If our struggle is attended by the same success as we have had, we gain â as we have all noticed â popular confidence in our institution.
People understand that.
From the North Cape to Sicily, from the Azores to the border with Russia by way of East Frisia, they understood what this struggle was about.
Their approval of this Parliament of ours has never been as high as it is now, and that is something we should make use of.
It makes this institution stronger.
Both institutions â Parliament and the Commission â have come out of this process stronger, and you, Mr President, with the Commission over which you now preside, have every opportunity to bring about change.
Let me pick up what you said about a blind date, which was a fine phrase to choose.
Some blind dates can be exciting; not all of those you have been on were.
If you no longer want to go on blind dates, then tell the governments, quite plainly, that the procedure under which you, MrÂ Barroso, have to accept everyone they propose to you, and then pay the political price for their proposals â that, with the Barroso Commission, that procedure has come to an end.
If you do that, both you and the Commission will be winners. You will both be the stronger for it.
In the debate that has gone on over the past few weeks, we have concentrated on core messages.
If I may remind you of the hearings and of what came out of them â for it was from these that the conflict arose â these core messages can be summed up in one sentence, which is that a broad majority in this House stood up in defence of the civil fundamental values of the European Union.
The freedom of opinion of each and every individual is indeed one of these, but another is the right of Parliament to decide who shall join the executive and who shall not.
Yet another is the strengthening of democracy.
The freely-elected assembly of the people has come out of this with renewed strength, and that is a good thing.
It is a good thing, because without it, we cannot treat one another as equals.
President Barroso, you are quite entitled to criticise Parliament.
I can recall how, in one of this Houseâs debates a few days ago, you certainly did have criticisms to make, albeit of only one side of this House.
You are quite entitled to do that, but we are obliged to check up on what the executive does.
So let me repeat that we will, whenever â and I mean whenever! â incompatibilities arise, and whenever we think your Commission or the policy guidance are going in the wrong direction, take exactly the same action as we have done over the past three weeks.
The interplay between the executive and parliament at European level lies in the fact that you have the monopoly of initiative, while it is our duty to ensure that the laws made are just and socially balanced, and that is precisely what we will be doing over the five years that lie ahead of us.
What we learn from the experience of history is that more democracy always brings with it more social justice.
For that reason, the democratic progress we have achieved is, for us, the beginning of a battle that we will be waging for five years.
I said it yesterday, and I shall repeat it today, that Europeâs social achievements, which have come to pass in the Member States, cannot be sacrificed at European level.
It is there that they must be secured, and this we see as your Commissionâs crucial task.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will approve the proposals you have put forward today.
A number of Members in our group are not yet convinced and will not be giving you a vote of confidence today.
