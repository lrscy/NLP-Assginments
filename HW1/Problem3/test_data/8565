Each product has a life cycle, which starts when it is made available to the consumer. When the consumer uses it, the product' s environmental sustainability - a rather complex term although now universally understood - immediately becomes part of the equation.
The relationship is delicate and it does not end with the use or end, so to speak, of the product' s life.
Indeed, the most serious problems often arise when the product ceases to perform its function and needs to be disposed of, pensioned off, in other words eliminated from the world in which it has performed its function.
It is at this point that the most critical environmental implications come into play, for not all products can be disposed of using the same technology, nor are they all hazardous to the same degree or all biodegradable to the same degree.
That is why the Commission is proposing an initiative which deals with the problem at source: if a product is to be easy to dispose of at the end of its lifecycle, this must be taken into consideration right from the design stage, and this is where the greatest merit of the report lies.
Here, then, is the proposal to create incentives to encourage initial research on how to keep manufacturers better informed of the technologies and raw materials available to this end.
The proposal does not overlook a factor which could give rise to opposition from manufacturers: cost.
The text states in quite practical terms that, in addition to encouraging the provision of aid to producers who will face greater costs if they supply these biodegradable goods, a pricing policy also needs to be established allowing manufacturers to set different prices on the market and, moreover, why not, allowing variable taxation to be introduced as well.
In other words, those involved in protecting the environment, who are therefore helping us, deserve some support.
Mr President, Commissioner, we manufacture products, but what do we do with a product when its life cycle comes to an end?
The Green Paper is about answering this question from an ecological point of view.
So far, in my opinion, we have been giving inadequate answers to this question, with well-known consequences: substantial detriment to the environment by production and the use to which products are put, with associated detriment to the health of workers and consumers.
Rather than carry on with this policy, we should get serious about one that is integrated.
In that way, we shall be able to make financial savings and will not need to eliminate environmental damage.
For these reasons, too, we need a strategy for the development of more environmentally friendly products and services.
The report before us, completed by the amendments adopted in Committee, provides a good framework for a product policy on ecological lines.
The Commission proposal for the discussion process in Committee was of little help, though.
The statements made in this text were couched in vague terms, there were no evident structures for further action, nor was there any evidence of a coordinated discussion process.
I do not think that any entrepreneur or consumer is going to be won over to an environmentally friendly product by such a hotchpotch of proposals.
The Commission must see to it that the statements made in its forthcoming texts are of greater clarity.
What is important to my group is that the environmental costs as a whole should be reflected in the prices of products.
Tax incentives should also be guaranteed so that disadvantaged consumers can also buy environmentally friendly products.
European product standardisation must be involved to a greater extent, and services should also be made subject to environmental criteria.
Another option for the creation of a market for environmentally friendly products would be, for example, the use of economic guidance instruments.
We should monitor their use and the effect they have, and it is vitally important that we should ensure that EU environmental legislation is not neutralised.
In view of the unsatisfactory text produced by the Commission, the rapporteur has done a good job, but further action must not be limited to contributions to discussion.
We urgently need definite proposals for the promotion of environmentally friendly products.
Producers and consumers must be made sensitive to the various aspects of environmental quality.
This report is a start, but the real work on its content remains to be done.
Mr President, I must not be especially critical, but try to look ahead to a future White Paper rather than discuss the rather odd draft Green Paper.
Within the safe food sector, where most of my work is done, a 'farm to fork' principle, which is very effective when attempts are made to legislate and to try to see the connections, has now finally been arrived at following a host of scandals and disasters.
I should like the White Paper to be based on approximately the same principle so that each product can be traced and seen in its context: finite or renewable raw materials, the supply of energy, what form of energy is used, chemicals, the flow chart for the product, logistics etc.
This is especially important for very large volumes of products, consisting in actual fact of food, water and household chemicals.
These account for more than half of the consignments transported on our roads and consume an incredible amount in terms of resources, despite our perhaps not even thinking of them as products.
I am therefore looking for a strategy in which everything is traceable and in which we can track a product' s history, and for principles that are valid whether we are talking about a car or a packet of sausages for lunch.
Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for its resolution on the Commission's Green Paper and just remind you that it is a Green Paper, the start of the debate on integrated product policy.
In particular I would like to thank Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo being such a committed rapporteur on this challenging and difficult issue.
I would also like to thank you for your speeches.
I would agree with a lot of what has been said during this short debate.
In reducing the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle, the objective of IPP is fundamental to addressing our environmental problems.
For this reason IPP is a key measure within the Sixth Environment Action Programme and the Sustainable Development Strategy also underlines its importance.
The difficulty we face is that there are so many products on the market today, products that often have long supply chains involving many different actors.
Because of this it is impossible to develop a "one size fits all" instrument.
Instead we need a variety of instruments and exactly which ones depends on what is most effective at each point in the supply chain.
They can be both voluntary and mandatory.
I agree that voluntary measures should be complementary and we should make sure that they are not the only instrument used.
When thinking about IPP at European level, we should also recognise the experience gained in several Member States - Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Italy, to name but a few- over the last few years.
There is, therefore, widespread acceptance of the concept and interest in it.
In 1999 the informal Environment Council asked the Commission to come forward with a Green Paper on the issue.
I therefore delivered this paper to start the debate on what form the European IPP should take.
The reactions to it from the 130 stakeholders who submitted comments were generally positive, but what came back was what has been reflected here, namely that it is sometimes seen as being too fluffy and not really an understandable concept.
But it sounds nice, as they say, and in general the opinions of the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions were favourable as well.
The Green Paper suggested a strategy and tools for making a European IPP a reality.
Many such tools already exist - public procurement legislation, European eco-labels and EMAS, to name but a few.
In other areas we will have to be innovative and think of new instruments.
The Green Paper sought to canvas the views of stakeholders on the way forward.
The Commission did this not just because it wanted to develop the best possible policy, but also because IPP needs the active involvement of all stakeholders to succeed.
Your resolution concludes this stakeholder consultation process and will enable us to develop the White Paper.
From your resolution and the comments from stakeholders it is clear that the White Paper needs to start with concrete environmental problems.
This is what we have learnt from this discussion.
Issues such as climate change, hazardous chemicals and biodiversity affect us all.
If we take environmental problems rather than instruments as our point of departure, we can better convey the idea that IPP is more than just a collection of tools, something that we perhaps did not do sufficiently in the Green Paper.
We have to link it to concrete environmental problems to describe how to use these instruments.
This is also what Mrs Paulsen referred to.
These tools will still be important.
We need to continue developing them because we cannot address millions of products individually.
However, I too am coming to the conclusion that we need to focus our actions on particular products and sectors.
You rightly make this suggestion in paragraphs 24 and 25 of your resolution.
We will also need to set out the strategy for implementing IPP and its advantages and the Commission will need to consider carefully the measures within IPP's scope as well as how it relates to other policies.
It is my intention to ask the Commission to adopt this paper during the second quarter of this year.
Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Europe and Space
The next item is the report (A5-0451/2001) by Mr Alyssandrakis on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Commission communication to the Council [COM(2000) 597 - C5-0146/2001 - 2001/2072(COS)] and the European Parliament on Europe and Space: Turning to a new chapter.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this European Commission proposal is about developing a space policy not at the level of individual Member States but at the level of the European Union.
It was drafted together with the European Space Agency and proposes three lines of approach: strengthening the foundation for space activities, enhancing scientific knowledge and reaping the benefits for markets and society.
The report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomes these lines of approach and acknowledges the overall benefit of developing space activities.
In fact, the development of launch systems is prerequisite to any other space activity.
We can build in this sector on the experience and technical know-how which the Member States have acquired over several decades, especially from the Ariane launch system.
The second line of approach is a perfectly natural one, in that space is an ideal place for carrying out research which cannot be carried out on earth, such as astronomic research into radiation which cannot penetrate the earth's atmosphere, research under conditions of zero gravity etc.
The third line of approach is very broad and covers everything we call space applications.
These applications range from satellite telecommunications to navigation and earth observation systems and have become an integral part of our daily life.
I should like to stress here that, if mankind is to benefit from space activities, then space must not be used as a platform for strategic competition.
It is highly significant, in my view, that the committee report emphasizes in the very first paragraph that space activities should only be intended for peaceful purposes.
I am particularly worried by the amendment proposing to add the phrase "which purposes may include strategic applications within the context of peaceful operations" .
If we adopt this amendment, we shall be opening the door to all manner of strategic activities in space, provided they are cloaked in the mantle of a "peaceful operation" and we have seen plenty of them on earth over recent years.
In short, this is a Trojan horse that will change the tone of the report and allow all hell to break loose.
I call on all my fellow Members to keep to the Commission text.
I also propose that they adopt Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 from Mr Souladakis' s opinion.
I must stress that taking a stand against the militarisation of space is terribly important, especially following the recent decision by the United States' government to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Agreement and its insistence on developing the so-called anti-missile shield.
I tabled Amendment No 5 because I wanted to put the implications of this action on the record.
May I also point out that, in my personal opinion, certain aspects of the proposed GMES programme involve strategic activities.
The application of space policy is also the subject of this debate.
The European Space Agency has operated on a transnational basis on our continent for several years now and has played a pivotal role in developing the space activities of European countries.
It is therefore only natural that there should be close collaboration between the European Union and the European Space Agency and we have already reaped rewards from this collaboration.
The committee report notes the role of the European Space Agency and proposes that it be integrated into the European Union in the long term, but without losing its independence.
I must say that I personally am against this.
What worries me is that, if this happens, the European Space Agency will lose the independence which has helped it emerge as a global player.
International collaboration is a sine qua non in the space sector and the committee report refers favourably to it, stressing the need for international collaboration to be developed not just with the Russian Federation, the United States, China and Japan, but also with less developed countries for which the European Union could provide access to space.
Finally, I should like to raise the subject of funding.
As we all know, access to space has its rewards but does not come cheap.
Ãhe Sixth Framework Programme for funding research classifies space and aeronautics as a priority sector.
That may show willing, but it is not enough.
We do not just want a more general commitment, we need a more general commitment.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is important to the future of the European Union's space policy.
I trust that the direction taken in the final vote will be to the benefit of our nations and mankind as a whole.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has examined the Commission proposal and basically agrees with its approach.
However, it notes that the CFSP is dealt with as an economic and development issue rather than as a defence and safety issue, with all that implies for Europe.
This is in all probability due to the fact that the CFSP is still under development.
In this sense, I suppose that this proposal will mature at the next stage, as far as foreign policy and defence systems are concerned.
As far as the content is concerned, I have several comments to make. First, there is a medley of policies in the Member States, which need to be more or less unified.
Secondly, on the question of the strategic use of space: the strategic use of space is unavoidable de facto, but it must be used for peaceful purposes such as Petersberg-type tasks.
In all events, our committee is opposed to the type of strategic mentioned in the famous Star Wars policy. It will, nonetheless, need to be used for missile interception installations in space and during wars, which destroy satellites.
Having said that, I believe that we need to push forward with this policy, on which we agree, our criteria being that these methods must be used for peaceful applications, policies must be unified and any action taken must be integrated into a single European policy because, in the final analysis, Europe must not be dependent for its safety, communications and security on the satellite systems of either the United States of America or Russia.
In this sense, quite apart from the fact that this initiative is of interest from a development point of view, it will also be of political interest and must therefore be considered crucial to the common foreign defence and security policy of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by thanking Mr Alyssandrakis for the good work he has done with us.
Ever since Lisbon, we in Europe have had the ambitious objective of being the best in the world, and technology and science are of course part of that, although I am not primarily thinking of the electronic voting apparatus we tested yesterday, but of advanced technologies such as, for example, telecommunications, earth observation and ecology.
Europe must - as the past demonstrates - concentrate its strengths in these areas.
Airbus and Ariane, based in Toulouse, are showpiece projects, demonstrating that Europe, if it concentrates its strengths, is capable of competing on a global scale.
Industry is becoming ever more concentrated, and what counts here is the creation of European structures linking the European Union, the ESA and the Member States, which will facilitate more effective cooperation across the board.
Thought should, though, also be given to international cooperation beyond Europe.
Here, I am thinking not only of the USA, but also of Russia and China.
Any European research policy should of course be of the sort that is also likely to attract the rising generation in this sphere.
I am myself from the aerospace industry and have been given to understand that fewer and fewer young people have been studying these subjects in the last few years.
We should be tackling that ourselves and not looking to immigration as we do in other areas.
We also need clear objectives in this area, though; hence the urgent request to the Member States to vote clearly in favour of Galileo.
Industry, too, should break new ground here.
It is important to the future that not only State bodies should take on responsibility, but that industry should also contribute to the development of services that the citizens can use and that are also capable of being marketed.
In conclusion, I would like to deal with an important point that has been mentioned, namely the so-called militarisation of space.
I do not think that Europe should be developing a 'Star Wars' programme, but I find the idea of equating any military use of the infrastructure with SDI highly dubious.
After all, we do not speak of the militarisation of telecommunications just because the German Army uses the telephone.
We want a European foreign and security policy, we want a Rapid Reaction Force, we send soldiers to other countries, and these troops must receive the information they need.
So we should indeed be thinking at a European level about becoming independent in this area and capable of using our own infrastructure in the future, so that we can do what our responsibility for our own soldiers and our political responsibility in this area require of us.
I therefore ask for support for the amendment that Giles Chichester and I have brought in.
We really cannot talk here in terms of an SDI; on the contrary, this is a sensible use of the infrastructure in Europe's interests.
Mr President, I join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Alyssandrakis on his report on the Commission communication to the Council and Parliament on Europe and Space: Turning to a new chapter.
This is not the first report that Mr Alyssandrakis has drawn up on the subject of space and, I suspect, not the last.
The Socialist Group will be supporting the report.
We believe that space has important civil and industrial applications.
Europe cannot afford to be sidelined.
Europe cannot afford to allow the US and the other space powers - Russia, China and Japan - to leave us behind.
We need to develop further the technological basis of space activities, in particular launchers, to move eventually to European independence.
On the way to European independence we may have to work with those trying to catch up with the US's enormous lead.
We therefore welcome the statement in the report that space research is one of the priority themes for the Sixth Framework Programme for research and development.
Europe, unless it gets an unequivocal agreement with the United States that it can have access on all occasions to the GSP system, will have to work with others inside and outside the European Union, in industry and government, to develop its own independent system.
We can support the amendment from Mr Chichester to the effect that we can include military applications for peacekeeping purposes.
At the same time we support the rapporteur's own amendment, Amendment No 5, which deplores the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and deplores the development of national missile defence, which we believe will trigger a new arms race in East Asia.
To make our position absolutely clear, we are also willing, if Amendment No 1 is passed, to support the rapporteur's Amendment No 2, to the effect that we believe space should be used to create peace rather than conflict.
We do not see these as contradictory but rather as establishing a limit beyond which we do not wish to go.
I hope that in the vote tomorrow we achieve what we intend, as I have set it out this evening.
I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to focus on just one key issue in the short time that I have, namely the dangers of the militarisation of space.
Many European citizens are deeply critical of the proposed US national missile defence system, which they rightly see as an offensive system which is certain to start a new and costly international arms race.
How much more concerned would they be if they realised the aims of some of their own politicians and legislators?
I do not mean people here, but there are others who have ambitions to launch their very own, home-grown European Union programme to militarise space.
That is what some people would like to turn the European space programme into.
We need to send a very clear message with this report, to make it absolutely clear that any use of space should be solely undertaken for peaceful purposes and in accordance with international law.
I therefore welcome in particular the emphasis which Mr Alyssandrakis has given to this in his report and appreciate the amendments he has tabled to strengthen these aspects still further.
It follows that I also very much regret the amendments by the PPE Group, which again introduces that idea of using space for military applications.
Although I accept that this has been put in the context of what are called peacekeeping operations, I am still concerned that this is the start of a slippery slope.
I am very happy that Mr Radwan does not want to see an EU Star Wars, but I am very concerned that his intentions could be misinterpreted: that other people could see peacekeeping in a different context from the one that he sees it in.
We need to remember as well the context of the report released by the European Space Agency in December 2000 in which the so-called Three Wise Men looked into the future of ESA and concluded and I quote: "Embarking on development of a European defence system, including a space component, will provide a significant part of European public investment."
That report went on to say: "We see it as logical to use the capabilities of ESA also for the development of more security-orientated aspects of European space policy."
All this adds up to the very real possibility that the European space policy will adopt a very specific military component and therefore it is timely and urgent to send a message with this report that we want to keep space for peace.
Mr President, I add my compliments to Mr Alyssandrakis for his report and the work that he brings to this particular field of our committee's activities.
My first observation is that the use of space for research and for commercial applications is often overlooked in the wider world because it is not as dramatically exciting as projects like the Apollo moon landings, yet it is extremely important, as this report emphasises.
I welcome the objectives set out in the communication for European policy.
I confess I particularly like paragraph 10, which calls on the industry to do more about commercial exploitation of space.
That is an important way ahead.
We want industry to be very much involved in the exploitation of space.
It seems to me that this report is something of an appetiser - or hors d'oeuvre - for the Galileo report, which we will be considering next month in our Strasbourg part-session.
Paragraph 12 in particular refers to Galileo as being part of the European strategy and to its importance for transport.
We should take careful note of that.
We have to recognise the difficulties in obtaining funding for space exploitation, space research, space utilisation.
I particularly welcome also the reference in the report to the need for international cooperation drawing in other powers and partners.
I come back to the question of using military applications for peacekeeping operations.
To be realistic, we need funding from defence budgets for space projects in a number of fields.
We should not be frightened of drawing on that source of funding for applications intended for peacekeeping.
That is very important to emphasise.
I regret that Mr Alyssandrakis has taken fright at my reference to military applications.
He should take more note of the phrase "peacekeeping operations".
Mr President, Commissioner, Galileo Galilei's words, 'and yet it does move' can be applied to European space policy's present situation.
I have my doubts, though, when I see the downright interminable tug-of-war about the establishment of Europe's satellite navigation system, Galileo.
So I am all the more pleased that there are some first positive signs that European space travel is to be given new momentum, something that is urgently necessary if Europe is not to lose its connection to this important and forward-looking high technology sector.
Whether the systems we are working with are for communication, navigation, or observation, satellites play a decisive role.
We should not make the mistake of comfortably relying on the existing systems of other, even friendly, nations.
We should rather be demonstrating our own capabilities in this field, which is the only way that we will have reliable operational freedom and that European industry will have a chance of a healthy future.
I speak from my own experience, having on several occasions been Parliament's rapporteur on the European satellite navigation system.
In Europe, the potential we have in this field is so valuable, that we should not simply leave it unused.
'Tackle it!' must be our watchword.
A political signal is indispensable.
The first stage on this road is the drafting of a coherent strategy for space travel policy, and the Commission has done very good work on this.
I emphatically support the proposed lines of action.
Europe must accord space travel more importance in future.
Let me sum up my priorities for European space travel in a conceptual pairing that may perhaps seem paradoxical: independence and cooperation.
Independence means our own strength, autonomous structures and jobs geared to the future.
Cooperation, on the other hand, represents the strengthening of the EU's relationships through compatibility and exchange.
Space travel should be given new impetus.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Alyssandrakis on this excellent and authoritative report, which urges us to put in place a Community space policy.
That said, given the progress made on Galileo, I think that we are still a long way short of the target and that we must not give up what we already have for something far less certain.
In other words, the intergovernmental method is now proving that it is working better than the Community method.
This is because, throughout the world, space development cannot be achieved unless a number of conditions are in place.
First of all, we must not be afraid of public support, funded from the public coffers.
The market can fund not everything...not American rockets, not Russian rockets, not French rockets.
Secondly, the military funds a large part of civilian resources; let us not beat about the bush.
If we refuse to accept a dual system, we will have great difficulty in launching the space industry in Europe, given that, as you have seen with Galileo, the pacifism of this House is, at the end of the day, a gift to American militarism.
I think that we must also have this set out very clearly in our minds.
The Americans said that they do not want Galileo because it is incompatible on a strategic and military level with GPS.
Lastly, we must also have a genuine industrial policy.
However, I do not think that we are fulfilling these conditions as yet.
This is something that I regret, but we must move in this direction if we eventually want the European Union to be the space power that it should be and that it must be if Europe wants to maintain a high level of technology.
As a final point, I would like to say that I think if we want to move forward in this area, we must strengthen our cooperation with those who want to move in this direction and leave behind those who do not want to.
And this is not simply for the sake of Galileo, it is also for the future of a European space policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report, which indicates the way forward that will enable us to open up a new phase in European space policy.
I wanted to speak about space today because this is a subject close to my heart and because I am lucky enough to live in Toulouse, where, as Mr Radwan said, everything is connected to aeronautics and space.
Two of the world' s largest sub-contractors in the space industry are based in Toulouse and much of the work of the European Space Agency in France is carried out in the National Centre for Space Studies.
We all know that satellites are used for the protection and observation of our environment, for risk prevention and for the defence of our territory and are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives.
The benefits of a coordinated space policy are therefore important to us and have already enabled progress to be made in cooperation.
As several Members have already said, we must now step up a gear and put in place a genuine European policy.
As Mrs Langenhagen said, in an area where it has immense potential, the European Union must acquire the resources that make success possible.
However, the fact that no decisions have been taken on the future of the Galileo European satellite navigation project is a regrettable example of what we must avoid.
Considerable investment has already been made and we cannot allow ourselves to take this amount of time before reaching an agreement, because we lose a little more credibility each time this happens.
But, I know, as all of us in this House know, that you, Commissioner, are making every effort to bring this project to fruition.
In March, the Transport Council is due to take a decision on the future of Galileo and Parliament must bring to bear its full weight so that this decision can be reached.
At the Laeken European Council, the representatives of the Member States pledged to make the common security and defence policy more operational.
As the report points out, if space activities are to be intended only for peaceful purposes, this can include military uses for peace-keeping activities, as requested in the amendment tabled by Mr Chichester and Mr Radwan on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
How can it be feasible for the European Union to develop a common defence policy if it does not make available the technical resources for this domain?
Ladies and gentlemen, we must draw up a realistic and consistent framework for our space policy.
The protection of the environment, the security of our people and the preservation of peace all depend on this.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on staying in office.
It is you that we have to thank for your constant reference to religious values in the Convention on Fundamental Rights and for your reclaiming of them.
The phrase 'European values' is often an empty one.
It could, though, be a quite different matter with this report in our hands, because this report means that there is a chance of Europe demonstrating, in a very important area, that we do things differently to the others.
We can make outer space a space for peace.
Then again, that has a great deal to do with principles.
Here we have Amendment No 1, which says: '...which can also include a military application for peace-keeping operations.'
Space for peacekeeping operations - one might polemically say, yes, but against whom?
Against the little men from Mars, who are on their way here, or for the use - as Mr Chichester has hinted - of a military-industrial complex yet to be created in Europe?
That would be devastating.
It would be precisely the dependence on the military-industrial complex that so much characterises the last remaining superpower that we would be inviting in through the back door while still talking of European values.
That would be Pharisaical!
I would very much recommend rejection of Amendment No 1, but the adoption of those following it.
Particularly when Christian and religious values are at issue, values of which you, Mr President, have always rightly reminded us.
Mr President, the USA unilaterally withdrew from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
This happened after their own national intelligence service stated that no missile threat from any 'rogue state' even exists, at least not for the next ten years.
According to the American press, the Republicans in Congress pressured the intelligence organs to change their stance and to create a baseless threat scenario.
A powerful missile shield is now being created in response to this figment of the imagination.
Ultimately, nobody is safe from injustice and from the terrorism which draws strength from this.
September's treacherous terror assaults show us where the true threats to security lie.
A missile shield will militarise space, since antiballistic missiles operate in space.
The result of this will be a renewed arms race, but in response to the USA's example we too are making a small decision on principle here: in our opinion Galileo may be used for military purposes in peacekeeping operations.
The people of this world need common security and justice which applies to everyone.
This must be the main goal of the Union.
The hunt for terrorists will never end if we fail to remove the causes of uprisings and civil rights struggles.
The demilitarisation of space, which was achieved with so much trouble during the Cold War, is ending without any rational reason.
There will always be those who are ready to carry out absurd acts.
Is it the case that when the absurd act does not concern individual structures, but the entire world, it becomes more acceptable?
When we worry just about our own security, we are sowing the seeds of war.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the request of the Council, the European Commission has produced a communication on the need to undertake the rapid development of a consistent space strategy in conjunction with the European Space Agency.
Like the rapporteur, Mr Alyssandrakis, I welcome this and I also congratulate him on his excellent work as rapporteur.
The Commission is proposing to strengthen the foundations of its space activities by developing scientific knowledge.
The rapporteur stresses the need to develop further the technological basis.
In my view, all this involves substantial public support, financial support, although support, other than financial, may be required.
The Sixth Framework Programme on Research, for which I am the general rapporteur, meets this requirement in part, by making space and aeronautics one of its seven priorities and granting it a budget of just over EUR 1 billion.
In my report, I also proposed measures to train researchers and engineers, both in the field of space and in other areas, in order to resolve problems relating to their mobility, which are exacerbated by the physical distance between sites.
My last point is to mention the dangers of the militarisation of space.
There are risks, undoubtedly, but I do not think that we can undertake military activities when our goal is to prevent or to manage conflicts in order to keep or find peace.
Nevertheless, our priority must be to develop further the use of space for purposes of general interest and public service.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on your re-election.
Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Alyssandrakis and thank him for his clear and constructive report, and also to thank all the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as well as the members of the various committees who have taken part in this debate and who have been involved in this report.
I am very pleased to be able to take part in this debate today and to do so on behalf of the Commission, in place of my colleague Philippe Busquin, with whom we work very closely on the issue of space, especially in view of my responsibilities in this area with the Galileo project.
The report you are debating today is an important milestone in the history of European space policy, whose development has recently been taken on board by the Community institutions.
It is the political support for the work carried out by the Commission and the European Space Agency within the framework of their joint working group, work which is fully described in the recommendations of the motion for a resolution.
My colleague, Philippe Busquin, has been working very hard on this project, which I know will go towards fulfilling Europe' s requirements for becoming the most competitive knowledge-based society in the world by 2010.
My speech will focus on three points.
The first is the spirit of the European Space Policy, which is part of the framework of a vision of a Europe that takes full advantage of the potential of the knowledge-based economy, especially through the creation of a true European research area, in line with the spirit of the Lisbon conclusions, which should also be the spirit in Barcelona.
A Europe, furthermore, that actively encourages sustainable development, which, since Gothenburg, has been one of the European Union' s priorities.
A Europe that is willing to involve its citizens more in the decision-making process, thereby giving a practical example of governance.
This is exactly where Parliament' s role is crucial, especially in explaining technical issues, such as Space.
In addition to these general principles we need to mention two specific aspects: firstly, the will to accept the international dimension of space and our responsibilities on the world stage, providing Europe with the means it needs to be truly independent; and secondly, the concern to work on maintaining peace and to ensure the security of all European citizens.
At this juncture, I would like to point out - in response to some concerns expressed by the rapporteur - the resolute nature of the instrument for peace that is the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) initiative in the area of environmental monitoring and safety.
The second aspect is the recent progress made in this field, given that over the last year considerable progress has been made in the area of space policy by means of the communication that you are examining today and also the associated Council resolution.
European Union policy has taken account of the strategic importance of space activity for Europe.
With regard to the specific progress made, I would like to mention two fundamental stages. The first was the creation of a joint Commission and Space Agency task force, which resulted in a second communication.
This was presented at the end of 2001 to the European Council, the Space Agency and Parliament.
The second stage is the joint preparation of a strategy for the implementation of the GMES initiative.
Within this framework, an action plan has been prepared, firstly at European Union level, then at European Space Agency level, with the approval of an additional section at the Agency Ministers' Council.
In 2001, however, certain limitations came to light, for example the lack of results obtained from the last Council of Transport Ministers with regard to the Galileo project.
I deeply regret that these delays have occurred and I would like to once again state very clearly that, in my opinion, there is no economic justification for calling the viability of the project into question, although what remains, ultimately, are doubts with regard to the political will to go ahead with a project as ambitious as the Galileo project.
I hope that these doubts can be allayed in the next few weeks and that by March the Union will have made a positive decision, once and for all.
The third aspect concerns the future.
What, exactly, is there left for us to do?
The answer is, a great deal.
In order for Europe to fulfil its proper role in this regard, it must establish close cooperation with all parties concerned, especially with regard to a more operational form of cooperation between the Commission and the European Space Agency.
In the short term, this involves negotiating a framework agreement between these two institutions to formalise cooperation between them and to confer the role of organising the implementation of the Union' s space programmes on the Agency.
An informal 'Space Council' will have to be convened at some stage, that brings together the Research Council and the Council of the European Space Agency.
In the medium term, it is proposed that the Councils of the Union and the European Space Agency, as well as the European Parliament should decide on space policy, on the basis of the guidelines provided by the Heads of State and Government.
However, in the longer term and specifically within the framework of the debate that is due to start shortly on the future of the Union, the European Space Agency, and space policy in particular, must also be reflected in the Treaty itself.
Before drawing my conclusions I would like to make some comments on a number of recommendations outlined in the Alyssandrakis report. I would like to focus specifically on the issue of frequencies.
A European coordination mechanism is being set up in this field in the form of a task force in which national political leaders will participate in the area of regulation.
Another issue is that of full convergence between the report by the think tank' s task force and Parliament' s point of view, with regard to the need to carefully study the situation of competition on a world scale and to adopt appropriate measures, especially with regard to launch pads.
We are also very interested in the idea of organising an international conference to explore opportunities for cooperation.
As Mr Alyssandrakis is well aware, we are already cooperating very closely with Russia.
Finally, generally speaking, the Sixth Framework Programme should make progress in the direction proposed in various recommendations, because for the first time, the subject of space is one of the priorities of this framework programme, but also because the European Space Agency will, for the first time, be able to participate in the programme as a partner with full rights.
Ladies and gentlemen, the report that you are going to adopt represents a substantial and powerful boost for the efforts to implement an authentic European Space Policy.
The success of such an undertaking requires the mobilisation of all of those involved and strong support from all of you here today.
I would like to say - along the same lines as some of the other speakers, such as Mr Savary and Mr Caudron - that we cannot block the necessary capacity and presence of the European Union with regard to space technologies on the pretext that certain types of project could have a dual usage.
It has been clearly stated that the objective of the GMES initiative is peace, and that the initiative is not financed from budgets, nor from funds with military financing and uses.
In fact, quite the opposite is true, and this holds for the Galileo project too.
Simply avoiding taking part in the space race for the sake of peace will not prevent space, which is already partially militarised, from becoming more so.
We must have a firm will to be in space with the criteria of the European Union in mind: to see space used for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind as a whole.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Road Transport
The next item is the Joint Debate on the following reports:
(A5-0437/2001) by Mr Hatzidakis on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive [9068/1/2001 - C5-0433/2001 - 2000/0060(COD)] laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic,
(A5-0469/2001) by Mr van Dam on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 881/92 and (EEC) No 3118/93 for the purposes of establishing a driver attestation (10353/1/2001 - C5-0473/2001 - 2000/0297(COD), and
(A5-0430/2001) by Mr Grosch on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council [COM(2001)56 - C5-0037/2001 - 2001/0033(COD)] on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, when I started working on this report, I thought I would be able to wrap it up in no time at all.
In the end, it was far more complicated than I had imagined, but today we are on our way to an auspicious ending and that is what counts.
The aim of this proposal for a directive is to harmonise the maximum length of both rigid and articulated buses when undertaking transport throughout the European Union.
Until now, this matter has not been regulated explicitly; there was only the guarantee that rigid buses of up to 12 metres and articulated buses of up to 18 metres could circulate freely in the European Union.
At national level, for example, there are 4 different maximum lengths for rigid buses, meaning that some buses are unsuitable for EU-wide use, thereby distorting competition.
The Member States wish to harmonise these maximum lengths, at least for buses used throughout the European Union, and have asked the Commission to work out a proposal.
I should like to remind the House that Parliament adopted 3 amendments at first reading.
In the first amendment, it proposed extending the date until which Member States may authorise buses with dimensions not complying with the requirements of the new directive to circulate on their territory from December 2009, as proposed by the Commission, to 2015, in order to allow a normal economic life for those buses.
The Council proposed stretching this date even further until December 2020, a modification the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism agreed with fully.
With the second amendment, the European Parliament proposes the same length of 18.75 metres for articulated buses, as for buses with trailers.
The common position also accepted this amendment so of course we have no problem there.
The last amendment allows rigid buses of up to 13.5 metres to have two axles.
Buses between 13.5 and 15 metres long must have three axles, in order to avoid exceeding the maximum weight per axle.
This amendment too was accepted.
Only the part of this amendment defining "rigid" was not accepted, but this is a merely terminological question.
It should be noted that the common position adopts the Commission's proposal to use the new manoeuvrability criteria which are in the process of being adopted within the Economic Committee for Europe of the United Nations in Geneva.
Portugal and the United Kingdom, I would remind you, may ban buses from their territory which do not comply with the old, stricter manoeuvrability criteria for up to three years after the directive enters into force.
Similarly, Member States are allowed to impose local restrictions on the use of extra long buses for safety or other reasons.
I am referring here to Article 7 of the common position, which the committee discussed at length.
This should largely meet the concerns expressed in some amendments rejected at second reading in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Consequently, it is clear from all this that there is nothing left for me to do but to propose, as the Committee has done, that Plenary adopt this common position without amendment, since it strikes a reasonable balance between internal market, regulatory, safety, technical and commercial considerations.
Mr President, the proposed regulation introducing a driver attestation requires all drivers in the employ of transport companies within the European Union to carry a standardised document.
As a result, it would be a simple matter for inspectorates across the EU to verify whether the relevant driver is employed correctly, that is to say in accordance with current, national social legislation rules.
At the moment, such inspection is difficult to implement outside national borders due to varying regulations and documents.
Parliament has backed this initiative at first reading.
It was noted, however, that this proposal could not be expected to be a universal remedy.
After all, there are also bilateral, international and ECMT licences, by means of which drivers from outside the European Union can legally work in a certain way in the European Union.
For a number of businesses, the dividing line between the legal and illegal deployment of these drivers does not seem clear enough.
Consequently, this proposal only applies to drivers who are employed by EU businesses and who drive lorries from these businesses.
However, Parliament was of the opinion at first reading that the proposal should be subject to a phased introduction for non-EU drivers and EU drivers on account of the administrative measures which Member States would be required to take.
With this, Parliament demonstrated that it had an insight into the situation in the sector, where non-EU drivers form the key problem, at least judging from the number of complaints about these practices.
This is why Parliament has opted for a two-year delay before the regulation enters into force for EU drivers.
In addition, Parliament was of the opinion that the data to be included in the attestation should also comprise the driver' s licence number and social security number.
In its common position, the Council has shown widespread endorsement of Parliament' s views.
It recognises the issues described and deems the attestation at least to be a constructive element in solving existing distortions of competition in international road transport.
Of Parliament' s amendments, the Council has only directly adopted the amendment on the inclusion of the driver' s licence number and social security number.
The amendments on a phased introduction for non-EU and EU drivers have not been directly adopted by the Council.
The Council does accept a phased introduction but does not yet wish to establish the ultimate date on which, based on data currently available, the proposal becomes effective for drivers from the European Union.
The proposal should not enter into force for EU drivers until it transpires that this would actually add value, based on an assessment of the regulation in force at the time.
In addition, the Council has given an interpretation of the inspection percentage (20%) of the number of attestations issued.
As rapporteur, I have to conclude that the positions of the Council and Parliament are not miles apart.
Both recognise the nub and urgency of the problem: non-EU drivers.
This is the group, therefore, that should come under this regulation as soon as possible.
Both the Council and Parliament agree on this.
As far as EU drivers are concerned, I should like to note that - on the basis of data available - the situation is far less urgent.
The evaluation established by the Council seems to be a useful tool for bringing more data to light.
However, I am of the opinion that it is very desirable to settle on an end date for this evaluation.
This is why I am very impressed with Commissioner de Palacio' s written pledge to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to commission the relevant evaluation within three years.
I trust that she will orally confirm this assurance during this sitting.
All in all, I think that Parliament can be satisfied with the text that is now before us.
I would therefore like to recommend that, together with the Commissioner' s pledge, it be adopted without any amendments .
I should like to finish off with a remark about the report by Mr Grosch.
I endorse the report, but it is vital that the candidates be adequately tested after each training course and that daily practice be included in continuous training.
If we prescribe that it is on the basis of national standards that each driver must be trained, this will promote so-called 'student tourism' , which is exactly what we want to avoid.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the liberalisation of road transport has brought us in Europe greater choice and better prices.
Competition has also correspondingly become more intense, which has necessarily also led to the tendency for safety and work conditions to lose out in many businesses.
The directive now before us on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road is intended to be, in essence, a protective measure and to improve the situation of these drivers.
Not only technological developments but also more stringent environmental and safety requirements seem to us to make a sufficient case for, on the one hand, improving their training and, on the other, needing to add to this through continuous training on a regular basis.
In the many discussions we have had with the industry, we have also, however, established that shortages in the labour force must not result in this directive having a restrictive effect.
A reason why I also wish to thank all the groups, who played a very constructive part in this dialogue, is that the Committee accordingly attempted to introduce proposals for amendments which were not intended to completely change the Directive, but to make it a bit more flexible.
For one thing, we created a sort of bridge to the driving licence, being aware that, in many Member States, training leading to the award of a driving licence already imposes certain conditions equivalent to the training requirements we are proposing.
So it seems important to us that the training should be gone through without being duplicated, once for the driving licence and again in professional training.
The same philosophy applied to the training objectives.
Our concern was not to lay down every detail, but only the training objectives in general terms and thus to leave them in the Annex, because this makes possible the flexible use of these training objectives and leaves open the possibility of adapting them in the light of future developments.
Training at present varies from one country to another, and we have accordingly laid it down that countries can revise the details in consultation with the Commission.
The objective is that training should be equal.
This Directive is not intended to alter any training already provided by a country.
Continuous training appears to us to be an important issue as regards further development, and we hope that, here too, a bridge to the driving licence may be created, because we see continuous training for the driving licence as also constituting a significant element at a later stage.
We have also opted for flexibility in the form of seven hours' continuous training, in other words, one day, rather than for larger units, in order not to impose a burden on businesses.
We have not, I think, gone over the top with one day, representing 0.05% of an employee's labour input.
I personally also insist firmly that there should be flexibility about the training centres.
If we are to speak in terms of mobility in Europe these days, the training centre is not necessarily to be tied to the business or to where the driver lives.
If this certificate is to be valid right across Europe, it should also be possible to train anywhere in Europe.
In this, we are also aware of the fact that this may well be an interesting and important Directive, but that, unfortunately, not all the problems have yet been solved.
Mr van Dam has just mentioned the bilateral authorisations, which are still valid in Europe, leaving room for misuse in this area.
We know too that certain businesses continue to avail themselves of the possibility - something I rather regret about Mr van Dam's report - that we will limit this standard driver's certificate to the countries that are not members of the EU.
For there are excesses in these areas within the Fifteen Member States too.
I do not want to name the firms involved, but some names in this field are well known to us.
I would like to conclude by saying that all this could form an integrated whole if, tomorrow, we were to gain a standard driver's certificate, a directive on journey times and rest periods, a card to confirm these and then also this Directive on driving licences and the training needed today.
This could be readily monitored; hence our appeal for improved monitoring, not only to the Commission, but especially also to the Member States.
Any Directive, no matter how good it is, can only be of value if it is regularly monitored - monitored, moreover, to an equal degree in each and every Member State.
Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate our three rapporteurs - Mr Hatzidakis, Mr van Dam and Mr Grosch - for the work they have done.
The level of knowledge of the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism never ceases to amaze me, in regard to technical details such as the number of axles on buses, turning circles of buses, and so on and so forth.
I am grateful to them for their work.
As far as the PSE Group is concerned, in relation to Mr Hatzidakis' report, we are happy with the common position and the same goes for Mr van Dam's report.
We will be voting accordingly.
Regarding Mr Grosch's report, I welcome the directive because it recognises that we now have an opportunity to improve road safety.
Working conditions for drivers have direct economic but also safety implications.
By proposing a training regime for professional drivers we will be enhancing the status of those drivers.
It is also important to recognise that in light of enlargement these provisions will have to be incorporated into legislation by the candidate countries.
I know many Member States include driver education in their basic education system, but for those that do not, this directive will make it possible for all drivers to receive proper training.
The issue of subsidiarity was raised in committee and indeed is raised again in plenary through a number of amendments.
My group believes that the compromise position that we reached in committee, with the help of our rapporteur, Mr Grosch, enables the directive to offer mere guidelines and therefore negates the need for subsidiarity.
My group will therefore be voting against most amendments that advocate this principle and in support of the rapporteur's position.
We will also vote in favour of Amendment No 43, which proposes an assessment of the effectiveness of this directive and vote against other amendments that try to be too prescriptive.
We are, in short, agreeing with the rapporteur.
I thank all the rapporteurs for their work and congratulate them all on producing three well-balanced reports.
First of all, I should like to thank the three rapporteurs for the volume of work they have carried out.
I should particularly like to congratulate Mr Van Dam on the important work he has done.
The St. Gothard tunnel accident made it clear that common European legislation is very necessary and urgently required so that tough action can be taken against illegally employed drivers who do not carry the necessary paperwork.
However, whether attestations will be sufficient will become evident from the evaluation.
I should also like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his report.
This too stresses the need for prescribing uniform requirements for drivers, because this is a typically transnational profession.
In the final analysis, what matters is safety and fair competition on the roads and, in this light, it is of the utmost importance for each driver to have had adequate training before they use the public roads, and for them to be able to specialise and receive continuous training, and for the requirements to be equivalent in all Member States and accession countries.
This will also afford the profession more standing, which is very important, and will also make it more appealing.
For the Liberals, it is essential for what has been learnt also to be tested properly by an independent body.
However, a certain degree of flexibility and pragmatism will be required.
The duration of the training, as proposed by the Commission, is unnecessarily long and would have an inhibiting effect.
Furthermore, a proper exam will provide far more certainty that the driver has actually learnt what he thinks he has learnt.
However, the flexibility which Mr Bradbourn and others would like to build in is excessive in our view.
We are unable to back the majority of the amendments because they would, in fact, render the regulation superfluous and the exam ineffective, and we should thus be overshooting our target.
Mr President, Commissioner and rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity briefly to point out that, in fact, in a very short space of time, we have slowly but surely put together a package consisting of a number of reports.
These reports are not only those before us but are also those on the organisation of working hours, whereby the working hours for employed, but also for self-employed, drivers have been reduced from an average of 60 to 48 hours.
In this package, we have drawn on our concern for safety, the environment and efficiency to still try to get a number of proposals adopted in order to improve the whole environment of freight transport by road, as well as the role which the driver plays in this.
Reference has already been made to accidents which happen on a regular basis, also involving people from third countries who do not carry the paperwork.
With regard to the report by Mr Van Dam, I should like to note that we really have been in a position to implement this in a relatively short space of time, and that is why I should like to support his attempts to prevent another round of amendments so that we can roll up our sleeves at the earliest opportunity, in the knowledge that there will undoubtedly be a number of flaws which will be picked up during the evaluation which will take place within three years - at least, I assume that this promise will be confirmed shortly.
I also endorse the comments by Mr Brian Simpson that the way in which subsidiarity is being used by Mr Bradbourn in his amendments is not actually the way in which we should be working at the moment.
As the Group of the Greens, we shall resolutely vote against this approach.
I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to rapporteur Hatzidakis and, obviously, Mr Grosch.
Mr Hatzidakis, this was a technical amendment.
These are the kinds of reports which we passed on to the then chairman with great pleasure, and I wish you every success in your next job in this transport environment.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are now discussing three proposals concerning road transport, which are not in themselves the most exciting topics to the general public.
Consequently, few political points can be scored.
But even small steps are necessary in order to ensure flexible transportation.
I thank those who have drafted the reports for their splendid work and, for example, Mr Grosch for his positive and constructive attitude to his colleagues' proposals for amendments.
With regard to Mr Hatzidakis's report, it is particularly satisfying that the Council is now permitting the use of old buses until the end of their economic life.
Anything else would of course be a senseless waste of resources.
As far as dimensions are concerned, I would like to mention the situation regarding lorries.
Finland and Sweden allow lorries which are larger than normal.
We allow lorries six and a half metres longer than elsewhere in the EU.
These dimensions should definitely also be adopted for use throughout the entire area of the EU.
If this procedure were followed, the load carried by lorries would be increased from forty tonnes to sixty tonnes.
The advantages here are obvious even to the layman.
Space would be saved on our congested roads, since two Finnish lorries are the equivalent of three lorries from elsewhere in Europe.
Continental Europe could from time to time take a lesson from Nordic pragmatism.
The combination of improved traffic flow and the economy of scale would lead to a cleaner environment.
This is precisely what is announced in the Transport White Paper; merci, madame Palacio Vallelersundi.
Therefore I ask the Commission to respond in this matter and to consider a proposal along these lines.
It should be remembered that road transport is far and away the most important mode of transportation in Europe, which in addition to everything else offers door-to-door service.
The railways, which, sad to say, work poorly, must of course be improved.
The fact that icebreakers travel more quickly than goods trains is absurd (not that Finnish icebreakers are particularly slow!).
The last thing we should do, however, is to throw a spanner in the works for road transport.
The dynamism of Europe depends on a flourishing economy, and the lifeblood of this is effective road transportation.
By standardising provisions we can ensure fair conditions for competition, not only between forms of transportation but also between Member States.
I believe that these proposals are a step in the right direction.
Mr President, I too wish to thank our colleagues for their fine drafting of the reports concerning road transport.
These actions will improve traffic safety, and this is an important matter.
A reasonably balanced common position on the maximum authorised dimensions for vehicles has been achieved, as the rapporteur Mr Hatzidakis stated.
Extending the transitional period makes it possible to make sensible use of the current stock of buses until the end of their life-span.
The time made available for this is now truly sufficient.
Technical development offers the opportunity to use increasingly longer vehicles, while at the same time also taking safety factors into consideration.
Standardising the maximum lengths of buses will also reduce distortions of competition.
The adoption of a standardised driver's certificate will promote fair competition in the sector and will also improve traffic safety.
Applying the Regulation solely to the drivers of third countries, at least in the first phase, is justified.
This third report on standardising the professional training of drivers for the carriage of goods or passenger vehicles by road may both promote traffic safety and improve the status of drivers.
At the same time it will also be possible to raise the prestige of the sector and to increase its attraction to young people.
This, too, is an important matter.
It is also worth noting that a better mode of driving will also spare the environment.
The basic training requirement for drivers must not however prevent existing drivers from returning to the sector.
Account is taken of this in the report.
Participation in training must be as flexible as possible.
The training programme must be drafted in such a way that the length of one course section should be at least seven hours.
Most important, however, is to ensure that the training makes it possible to truly improve the professional competence of drivers, exactly as Mrs Sanders-ten Holte recently emphasised here.
Mr President, Commissioner, every day we read newspaper reports of major accidents on Europe's roads, caused by lorries with over-fatigued, over-worked and inexperienced drivers.
Who among us does not shake his head and wonder how such a thing is possible on our roads at the beginning of the 21st century?
The quality standard for road transport in the EU can and must be increased - there is no doubt about that.
The driving profession, with the ever-increasing demands made upon it, must be built up and made more appealing.
The safety of road transport must also be improved.
It remains to be seen whether the option that the Commission is proposing here will indeed improve the situation.
In my view, the directive before us will achieve no decisive added value.
Training is inherently to be welcomed and is advantageous to the profession, but the driving test means that every driver, even today, has to demonstrate more than just a comprehensive knowledge of the Highway Code.
'Swept twice keeps cleaner longer' , they say back where I come from, but there is no clear and compelling logic to the way the Directive now - as I see it, unnecessarily - requires double the course content in many areas.
Here is a crucial example.
There is in Germany already a real training scheme for professional drivers, which takes three years, so, in comparison, the time required, referred to in the title of the Directive and, incidentally, reduced further by the Council, can only be described as basic vocational training.
Nothing more can be achieved within a time limit of 140 hours.
I mentioned added value, yet, when I consider the details of the regulations under consideration, what I perceive at several points is more of a deterioration.
An eighteen-year-old is now supposed to be allowed to drive a forty-ton lorry with a hazardous load across the Alpine passes - and that after only a few hours' basic training!
That cannot be what the originator had in mind.
We need the profession of driver to be enhanced; that is what the Directive is meant to do.
There is, though, a need for improvement as regards safety on the roads.
Perhaps everything would be much better, if we had, at long last, a new tachograph.
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a directive on weights in international traffic, which is, of course, not only about weights, but also about dimensions.
This is a typical tactic, to have a heading announcing, actually very tersely, what is meant to be at issue, and then, in the directive in question, to proceed to expand on it as a matter of course.
I have already for some time now been following with a critical mind developments on European buses, because this wealth of detail was actually far from necessary at a European level.
We - and Parliament is at one on this point - are, at the end of the day, fighting for the principle of mutual recognition.
We should then, if at all possible, cause the principle of mutual recognition to prevail in fact. Let there be harmonisation only where it is really, absolutely necessary.
I wish at this point to commend the directive as an example of how short and precise an overall provision on European buses should be.
What I would really like is for this directive to abrogate all other directives on European buses, thus enabling countries and nations to have buses of a design appropriate to their needs, as, of course, a village bus in Sicily's hot climate has to look different from a bus in London's rush hour or a bus that has to cover great distances in northern Finland.
This is where harmonisation is false, costing a lot of money and calling for unnecessary effort.
This is where the Commission urgently needs to do some thinking about which areas require voluntary self-regulation and which need standards to be laid down.
We have excellent standards committees, but only where they are absolutely necessary do we need framework directives.
Mr President, these proposals for the training of heavy goods vehicle drivers are, like much of the legislation adopted by this House, totally unnecessary.
All we need is the mutual recognition of national qualifications, possibly underpinned by a loose framework directive, to ensure minimum standards, especially with regard to third-country nationals.
However, what we have is a typical piece of EU legislation: intrusive, prescriptive, vastly expensive.
It is a Christmas tree on which we have hung our wish list of expensive baubles.
Environmental issues are important, but they have no bearing on the ability to drive a truck.
The proposals for training on a healthy diet have already attracted widespread ridicule in the British press.
Asking the British trucker to give up his sausage and eggs is like inviting the Pope to a disco - it simply makes us look absurd.
But we are inviting worse than ridicule.
In the UK alone these proposals are estimated by the industry to cost over EUR 200m a year in a business already under great stress.
The time commitment for training required of the individual owner-operator is unsustainable and will drive hundreds out of business.
In this House we constantly pay lip service to the needs of SMEs, yet again and again we ignore their concerns.
We talk about the problem of unemployment, then we pass directives that destroy jobs.
These proposals form part of a concerted attack by the Commission on the road haulage industry.
I should declare an interest: my stepson is a truck driver and he and his colleagues are aghast at these proposals.
I have studied them in vain for a realistic business impact assessment.
We are looking at huge costs, huge damage to the industry - especially to small businesses - and huge damage to European competitiveness.
A further impediment to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives, and all for what?
For benefits which at best are vague and speculative.
I urge colleagues to reject the Grosch report.
Let us stand back for a moment and consider the huge damage we do as we create a torrent of onerous and unnecessary legislation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing three reports, or to be more precise, three legislative proposals that aim to improve road safety and guarantee better a smoother operation of the internal market.
I would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis on his excellent work as rapporteur on the report on the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic, and on his work on achieving an agreement at the end of this process.
I would like to express my satisfaction, because the report' s conclusion manages to find a reasonable balance between the internal market, regulation and safety, without forgetting technical and commercial considerations.
In fact, this was the intention of the Commission when it proposed the initiative and, I would, therefore, like to thank Parliament for adopting the common position, which the Commission fully supports without amendment given that, in practical terms, it incorporates all the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading and introduces other slight modifications to the Commission' s initial proposal.
Now that I have thanked Mr Hatzidakis for his work, I would like to also thank Mr Van Dam for the work he has done and tell him here and now that the Commission intends to draw up an evaluation report over three years, as soon as the Regulation enters into force.
I hope that, with this, Parliament will be able to vote on the basis of the Council common position and bring the matter to a conclusion, which will allow us to embark upon a more focused battle for employment and to regulate the situation of third country nationals employed as drivers by EU transport companies.
Lastly, I would like to refer to the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road.
I would like to thank Mr Grosch, who has drawn up the last report on road transport that we are debating today and say that the report and its explanatory statement show that the European Parliament shares the point of view of the European Commission on the importance of this proposal, even though it is a technical proposal.
The measures proposed allow for a complete package to be introduced in the area of training and assessment of bus and truck drivers to establish minimum requirements.
Mrs Langenhagen, this is not an obligation to reduce the amount of professional training given in particular countries, it simply seeks to establish minimum requirements that must be met in all countries.
There is, therefore, no need to alter the three-year requirement currently in force in Germany.
In fact, the opposite is true, given that this is in excess of the minimum stated in the Directive.
What is really needed is for all German drivers, not just the minimum number, as is the case today, to take up and complete this training.
The objectives are to raise the quality of professional drivers and standards in road transport in general and to guarantee positive results in terms of road safety.
Generally speaking, we can accept the majority of the amendments, making a few alterations here and there, but some of them, on the other hand, we are bound to reject.
For example, Amendments Nos 25 to 41, which aim to make the initiative the sole responsibility of the Member States.
We should not forget that only 5% of Community bus and goods vehicle drivers currently benefit from professional training.
Just 5%.
This proposal is, therefore, essential in order to improve this situation, and only Community legislation to make it mandatory can fulfil this objective. These amendments, however, would lead to reduced safety standards and a clear distortion of competition.
In particular, with regard to Amendment No 37, we will incorporate some of Mr Bradbourn' s concerns into the modified Commission proposal, in order to thus leave a wider margin for the principle of subsidiarity, because we feel that on some of the issues he has raised, he is right.
Even if the Commission is able to accept the principle of parallel training with the aim of obtaining both a driving licence and a certificate of professional competence, we would prefer to avoid any kind of duplication, and this why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 6, 16, 17 and 18.
We cannot accept No 5 either, because imposing basic training on drivers who already work in this profession but do not have three years previous experience could cause difficulties in the sector, which is currently suffering from serious problems due to a lack of drivers.
However, in the spirit of compromise we could accept Amendment No 27.
With regard to Amendment No 10, which relates to the inclusion of training within working hours, the Commission considers that this is an issue that both sides of industry should agree upon, and, therefore, cannot be accepted.
The Commission has problems with Amendment No 13, which refers to the place of training.
We feel that there could be a certain degree of flexibility in continuous short-term training, and that it should be able to take place both in the Member State in which a driver is normallyresident and in the country in which he or she is contracted to work, but not in other areas, given that there are similar accepted requirements with regard to driving licences and the driver card.
Amendment No 19 introduces an international transport option based mainly on the understanding of languages.
This is not the aim of this proposal and, therefore, cannot be accepted and we reject it.
The Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 2, 22 and 23 either, because they go beyond the scope of the current Directive.
Finally, we believe that Amendments Nos 42, 44 and 45, which lay down the duration of training in the body of the text rather than in the Annex, cannot be accepted either.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by thanking the three rapporteurs for their work.
I would also like to thank Parliament, and there are no surprises here, for two of their proposals, specifically the proposal on maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and maximum authorised weights in international traffic, and the proposal establishing a driver attestation and I hope that these will be approved so that we can move ahead as soon as possible with their implementation.
I hope that in later stages of proceedings we will be able to reach agreement on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road, which we also consider to be a vitally important factor in improving road safety and in preventing market distortions, specifically in the transport market within the European Union. I hope this happens because, as I have already said, many of the amendments tabled are going to be accepted and some of those that mention the suitability of leaving a wider margin for subsidiarity will be incorporated into the amended proposal that we will be presenting at an appropriate time.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
ACP/EC Partnership Agreement
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0412/2001) by Mr Rod on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the proposal for a Council decision [2117/2000 - COM(2000)324 - C5-0417/2000 - 2000/0124(AVC)] concerning the conclusion of the Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States on the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though I adopted a rather critical tone in the report' s explanatory statement, we must nonetheless adopt a constructive approach and, despite the fact that time is getting on, I would recommend that the European Parliament issue an opinion in accordance with the ratification of the ACP-EU agreement.
The signing of the Cotonou Agreement was not initially accepted.
Although the ACP countries had always shown they were willing to continue their cooperation with the European Union, Europe was becoming involved in other matters.
European interests on the international stage changed and Africa became a marginal continent.
There are no ACP countries among the 10 leading beneficiaries of European aid.
A genuine political assessment of LomÃ© was never carried out but the same foundations have been used for Cotonou.
However, we have doubts regarding the ability of the Cotonou Agreement to provide a dynamic for sustainable development if we do not have a more balanced international economic order, in which the developing countries will finally have rights.
The structural causes which have undermined the success of the LomÃ© Conventions are still present: the burden of debt which is strangling the budgets of the ACP countries and their potential to invest in sustainable development, the continued deterioration of trade terms to the detriment of the ACP countries, in the absence of an international system for trade regulation of primary products, a structural adjustments policy which imposes budgetary restrictions on ACP countries and, lastly, an inconsistent European policy which, like its development policy, not only subsidises agricultural production and exports its surplus to developing countries, thus destabilising the local markets, but also authorises industrial fishing vessels to fish the territorial waters of the ACP countries, which adversely affects the local people' s means of subsistence and compromises the protection of biodiversity.
Furthermore, do not underestimate the internal working problems of the ACP group, the democratic shortcomings in certain countries and the misuse of funds by corrupt regimes.
The Cotonou Agreement is not groundbreaking.
It perpetuates and accentuates the transition towards liberalisation initiated by LomÃ© IV and continued by the international institutions: that is, the liberalisation of trade, coupled with the withdrawal of the non-reciprocal trade system, as well as Stabex and Sysmin, in favour of the future trade regime which is likely to take the form of Regional Economic Partnership Agreements (REPS) that are compatible with WTO rules.
But can the ACP countries contend with global competition?
By differentiating them from the least developed countries (LDCs), which benefit from the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, is there not a danger that this will undermine the cohesion of the ACP group?
There is economic liberalisation as well, within the framework of the general agreement on the commercialisation of services.
Privatisation of this economic sector is a very dangerous process in the ACP countries where the basic public services such as education, health and justice are already fragile, even non-existent.
Equally, the reference to the TRIPS agreements is a danger for the people of the South who are at risk of being denied access to their own natural resources.
Biodiversity is under threat.
Furthermore, in the Cotonou Agreement, the environment is relegated to the background and the sole aim is to limit the environmental impact of development policies, which runs counter to a sustainable development strategy.
However, the Cotonou Agreement contains some interesting aspects that we must put to good use.
Acknowledging civil society as an actor in the partnership is a major step forward.
Its representatives must take part in the dialogue on development strategies and policies at an early stage, be involved in the implementation of programmes and directly benefit from the funds.
We must define civil society and ensure that it is not exploited by any party.
The civil society in each ACP country must therefore be organised at national as well as at regional level, in order to actively participate in its country' s development.
This process has been launched with the ACP Civil Society Forum.
The European Union must support this process, as it did under the Belgian Presidency.
The role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is thus strengthened in that it must monitor the participation of civil society as well as, and in particular, the implementation of democratic processes.
But it has no binding instrument to do this.
Political dialogue is another essential element.
It must also be reciprocal and effectively implemented.
The 'Everything but Arms' initiative was undertaken without consulting the ACP countries and penalties are still random.
Lastly, since the European Commission wishes to make considerable investments in several key sectors, the National Indicative Programmes should give priority to strengthening public services and administrative and institutional capacities.
In reality, everything depends on how the Cotonou Agreement is applied.
For example, the new Cotonou Agreement provides for flexible aid planning, in other words, according to how each country performs.
But who will define the performance criteria?
Will we assess the ability of each country to re-gain some balance in macro-economic affairs or the impact of aid on eradicating poverty?
It does not seem likely that the new distribution of competences between the Commission services will provide greater consistency in the development policy.
To what extent will the Directorate-General for Trade be able to encourage a more favourable trade model in the ACP countries, whilst also protecting European trade interests?
Lastly, the fact that the Directorate-General for Development is gradually being stripped of its prerogatives in this area does not bode well.
As far as we, the Members of the European Parliament, are concerned - and this will be my final point, Mr President - after tomorrow' s vote, our task is finished in theory.
Since the European Development Fund has no budget, we are no longer responsible for monitoring and achieving the objectives of the ACP-EU cooperation.
This is unacceptable and we must work together to implement this agreement so that aid can make a real contribution to the well-being of the people of the ACP countries, as regards their food, health and educational requirements.
Mr President, it is now one and a half years since we were able to congratulate the Commission on the Cotonou Agreement, and it is really somewhat disgraceful that there are still only three EU countries that have ratified the agreement.
I realise that there are probably some that are on the way to doing so in the course of the spring, but it is still not too satisfactory.
At least it is good that our approval is being put in place tomorrow, even if I agree with the rapporteur that it is only the beginning.
However, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
A lot has undeniably happened in the world since the agreement was signed in June 2000, but that does not of course make it any the less important.
I think it can be said that the fact that foreign policy is bound up with development policy has, since then, been heavily underlined, and I am also pleased that I am today speaking on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for this shows the connection between foreign policy and development policy.
In a speech in December 2001 in Berlin with the title, 'From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe' , Commissioner Nielson made these words his own.
Which form of policy comes first may be immaterial. However, 11 September made this connection and, in particular, the importance of foreign policy, abundantly clear.
11 September showed what can happen if we do not ensure development in all parts of the world.
It is now our task to pursue such development.
The same applies to our continuing work in Kosovo.
In connection with Zimbabwe too, the link between foreign policy and development policy is clear, as too is the fact that, in spite of everything, the EU has succeeded in obtaining an agreement, which means that we can operate in Zimbabwe in the hope of achieving good results.
I agree with the Commissioner, whose speech contained the concluding remarks - which I would certainly echo - to the effect that the C in CFP '...stands for common, not convenient and colonial' .
I agree that we therefore still have work to do, as we also have here in Parliament.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for the enormous amount of work he has put into this document and for the information that is in it.
However, I am disappointed that he is so pessimistic, both looking back to the past and forward to the future.
Of course I support some of his criticisms: too much paperwork, a lack of decision-making, slow delivery times and a lack of capacity in developing countries.
This has given rise to frustration, but Commissioner Nielson is tackling these problems with some vigour.
I am much more optimistic than the rapporteur.
I believe the Cotonou Accord is the right path.
LomÃ© had its faults.
But it was a unique concept and much good work was done.
The new Partnership Agreement is based on the right principles, enhancing the old LomÃ© Convention.
The theme of poverty alleviation must be right.
The only question is how best to implement it.
There is much discussion on project finance versus budget support.
Should we be using multilateral aid or bilateral aid?
I strongly support multilateral aid backed up by bilateral aid where it can complement a project.
I do not believe that project aid has failed.
The problem has been the under-capacity of countries to continue projects once they were completed by the European Union.
I am equally not yet convinced that budget support can be controlled tightly enough in many developing countries and fear that it will open the door to corruption.
I believe it is the new factors in the Cotonou Accord that will have the most influence: the political dimension, the emphasis on good governance, conflict prevention and resolution, the interaction with civil society, the regional approach to strengthen trade and the Parliamentary element of the Joint Assembly.
All these are elements that should strengthen the partnership.
All this has changed my role as co-president in the last year.
I certainly have played a more political role in the past year, discussing, for instance, conflict resolution and good governance with President Taylor in Liberia, or having discussions on the Zimbabwe situation with the Presidents of Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique, and hearing and seeing the effects on their countries.
All this depends on an effective Commission, with properly funded and staffed delegations.
Most of the ones I have seen are extremely badly serviced at the moment for lack of funds and the petty paperwork they have to handle.
This is Parliament's fault.
We must urge all countries to ratify the agreement, as Mrs DybkjÃŠr has said, to allow the ninth EDF to come into force.
This partnership has to work.
If we really wish to see an end to economic migration and terrorism in the world, we must provide a standard of living in developing countries which persuades people to stay and work there.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I might anticipate the result, the Group of the Party of European Socialists can support the Cotonou Agreement with conviction, even though nothing is so good that it cannot be improved still further.
The tightly allocated speaking time unfortunately does not permit a comprehensive appreciation of the Agreement, and I am therefore obliged to limit myself to a few aspects of it.
The Cotonou Agreement represents the unbroken continuation of European cooperation with the developing states of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, which began with the YaoundÃ© Agreement and has since 1975 been expanded by a total of four LomÃ© Agreements.
The parties to LomÃ© I were just 46 ACP countries and nine Member States of the then European Community.
The Cotonou Agreement now joins together 77 ACP States and 15 countries of the EU.
Even more important, though, than the geographical expansion is the broader basis with regard to content.
The collapse of the blocs and the associated political upheavals across the world, including in the ACP States, meant that the political dimension became more significant, as did trade policy.
The treaty comprises such important matters as the safeguarding of human rights and the application of the principles of democracy and the rule of law, responsible governance and the strengthening of civil society, failure to observe which may be met with sanctions.
The political dialogue established by the Cotonou Agreement and the obligation, equally embedded in the Agreement, to work for the consolidation of peace and the prevention and settlement of conflict, along with the declared aim of combating poverty, are important instruments of ACP cooperation, although unfortunately not a guarantee of its success.
To demonstrate this, it is enough to refer to Sudan, the Horn of Africa, the Congo, Zimbabwe, Islamic fundamentalism and HIV/AIDS.
Parliament's monitoring of ACP cooperation is an example to the world.
The Cotonou Agreement has given it a new value, enhancing both its parliamentary character and its role as an open forum for discussion and a monitoring institution.
This, too, is part of the new quality of the Cotonou Agreement, and it, too, makes it easy for us, as a Group, to support this Agreement.
Will the Cotonou Agreement yield more results than its LomÃ© predecessors?
The new cooperation agreement with the ACP countries has drawn on the experience gathered to date, and bears witness to new insights in the field of trade, good governance, aid and the role of civil organisations.
There is naturally room for criticism but, in my view, Mr Rod is taking things too far in his comprehensive report.
In his analysis, Europe is the devil personified while the ACP countries have been elevated to the status of saints.
The disastrous, violent conflicts are caused by poverty, and poverty is caused by the rich West.
Unfortunately, things are not as simple as that.
It is unfair to claim that Cotonou will only lead to unbridled liberalism.
However, the agreement does stress with good reason the importance of the participation of players other than the local government, such as NGOs and the private sector.
Not only donors have to draw lessons, but also the developing countries themselves.
It is therefore to be welcomed that Cotonou reminds the ACP countries of their own responsibilities.
It is right that aid should be provided according to the achievements of the receiving countries.
Success in the longer term does not only depend on us but also, and above all, on the partners' own continuous efforts.
Would Commissioner Nielsen agree with me on this?
Administrative capacity is crucial if results are to be achieved.
At least as important is preventing the abuse of power and human rights violations.
I therefore consider the planned, broad dialogue to be at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement.
It is vital that the EU and the ACP partners should not stop at good intentions.
Europe must drastically reform its own development, trade and agricultural policy and the ACP countries must put all their efforts into democratisation, political stability and conflict prevention so as to allow their countries to develop socially and to make them fully-fledged trading partners.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Rod and congratulate him on his excellent work on this matter and stress that, broadly speaking, I agree with the ideas he puts forward in his explanatory statement and with the conclusions he proposed and which we approved in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
I shall, therefore, limit myself to a few brief observations.
I wish to say, first of all, that, to my mind, the greatest success of this new Convention lies in the very fact that its moment has actually arrived, given the long and difficult obstacles that we have had to overcome.
These difficulties and obstacles began with the recommendation to end our partnerships with the ACP countries and culminated in the untimely and rather inconvenient problem of migration, already in the final stage of negotiations.
The final outcome of these negotiations, in addition to the establishment of a new Convention for a period of twenty years, is therefore, to my mind, to be considered one of the more positive aspects.
There are also other, more substantial reasons for the Convention, however.
For example, a greater call for the participation of civil society, especially if this is given a broad meaning and if it is not at variance with the cooperation and support deserved by the central administrations of the ACP States, which suffer, as a rule, from considerable structural weakness. This also applies to the regionalisation that has been planned, if this is undertaken carefully, if it is not imposed and if it does not represent an undesirable fragmentation of the ACP countries.
It should be pointed out, however, that there are also aspects of this new Convention that make us rather apprehensive.
Firstly, the systematic call for the imposition of unilateral conditions and objectives which, apart from having the potential to destroy a partnership that we want to be of equals, could also undermine the choices made by the ACP countries themselves on their own development policies.
Secondly, the rapid move towards enshrining the liberalising rationale of the WTO which, as we know, has been particularly damaging to the least-developed countries.
These are aspects which we cannot sweep under the carpet and which, like the clear change of direction towards the East of the European Union - I would remind you that none of the ACP countries is yet on the list of the ten countries that benefit most from European cooperation - may compromise a partnership that we would like to be beneficial, mutually advantageous and capable of ending the cycle of underdevelopment and the enormous poverty that affects those countries.
Mr President, we are not doing much more than going over old ground.
It is nearly two years ago that the negotiations about the Cotonou Agreement were completed.
Despite this, I hope that the Council will take the report by Mr Rod seriously.
I would compliment the rapporteur on the sharp analysis in his report.
The fact that a number of inconsistencies have survived in the Cotonou Agreement and the unwillingness to reduce underdevelopment if this means abandoning self-interest put the rapporteur in a sombre mood regarding the outcome of the development project.
I share his concerns on this.
I can only partly subscribe to the shift towards integration in the world trade system instead of a change of that system to benefit the poorest.
Admittedly, aid without trade is not very effective, but trade is no panacea for underdevelopment.
I should like to finish off with a word on the future regional trade agreements.
From the WTO' s perspective, there is little choice other than continuing with LomÃ© in the same vein.
However, I should like to draw your attention to another perspective, namely that of development.
I am not so certain that the regional economic partnership agreements will benefit all our partners.
Specifically, the least developed countries will not find them very useful.
Furthermore, conflicts of interest may arise between the various countries in their more or less artificially divided regions.
This is diametrically opposed to the EU' s conflict prevention policy which is high on the agenda.
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, the new agreement on cooperation and development, the Cotonou Agreement, constitutes a significantly improved framework for cooperation with the ACP States.
It is an agreement that we emphatically support, one in which the significant improvements in terms of content and policy originated in proposals by Parliament.
We do not, therefore, share either the rapporteur's highly critical assessment or his reasons for it.
Indeed, we take the view that it is something of a caricature.
Let me, in response to the rapporteur's analysis, list three points in favour.
Firstly, the establishment of a parliamentary assembly represents genuine progress, in that, after an appropriate preparatory period, ACP States will be represented only by freely elected parliamentarians, rather than by ambassadors, as is still to some extent the case.
This principle must not only be incorporated into the new rules of procedure of our Joint Assembly, but also put into practice.
We will vote against the admittance of any ACP ambassador if, for example, he displaces freely elected African delegates.
The second is the regional approach to cooperation, also originating in proposals by this Parliament, which puts an end to economic parochialism in Africa.
Our cooperative effort must in future be focused on regional free trade and cooperation agreements.
We insist that our regional parliamentary cooperation should begin on the ground this very year, for example subsequent to our Southern African meeting in Cape Town in March or our meeting with ECOWAS in the course of the year.
Thirdly, we support the reinforcement of the clause on democracy and human rights, which we believe must be speedily implemented.
Let me mention only Nigeria, Togo and Zimbabwe as examples of why this is so.
We hope that this will bring about genuine parliamentary partnership with our fellow parliamentarians in Africa and elsewhere in the ACP countries.
Mr President, our friend Mr Rod' s recommendation in favour of Parliament' s ratification of the Cotonou Agreement is accompanied by an exhaustive analysis of the agreement, its significance and new developments, made from a critical point of view that we share for the same reasons as the rapporteur himself: because of the gaps in the Treaty and the shortcomings that have already become apparent during its short provisional life.
This does not prevent us, however, from supporting it and encouraging its ratification.
This agreement was drawn up in a world significantly different to that of the first LomÃ© Convention. Under current global conditions, economic instruments are no longer sufficient in themselves to steer globalisation towards the goals of justice.
We must also have instruments of political cooperation.
For this reason, even with all the shortcomings, this agreement should be welcomed so that we can get the best out of it.
The role of the European Parliament in this agreement cannot be limited to controlling the European Development Fund.
I think that we can achieve a great deal with this agreement.
At the moment, we can publicise its positive aspects and attempt to have it ratified by our national parliaments.
It is scandalous that a year and a half after it was signed, only three of the fifteen Member States appear to have ratified it.
Another important action that we can encourage is the consolidation and effective operation of the national parliaments in ACP countries.
Mr Rod highlights the participation of civil society as something new in the agreement and recognises the ever-important role of the State but, within States themselves, efficient parliaments are the best guarantee of preventing poverty, fighting corruption and of making our cooperation more effective, which is the underlying objective of the Cotonou Agreement.
We support our partners' parliaments and also the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, which will be able to carry out the function of democratic control conferred on it by the agreement.
Mr Rod asks us the million-dollar question: does our cooperation in the context of the Cotonou agreement aid the development of our ACP partners or does it simply seek to impose the liberal model on these countries?
And does the liberal model actually guarantee fair development in these countries?
I think that, on its own, it does not work.
For this reason, we should make an effort to ensure that this Cotonou agreement is apart from being merely a framework for trade relations, an instrument for decent and equitable political and economic relations with the ACP States and to ensure that our cooperation with them is one of the pillars of a supportive and democratic world order that we need and which we are committed to, at least, as far as my group is concerned.
Mr President, I welcome the report by Mr Rod and I agree with him that the renewal of the framework agreement governing cooperation between the EU and ACP States is best considered against the backdrop of the challenges posed by globalisation, economic liberalisation and the European Commission's reform of external assistance.
Indeed, over 18 months after the signing at Cotonou, we can now begin to assess the agreement by looking at the actual progress made in bringing it to life.
First, despite its strengths, in one particular aspect at least the previous LomÃ© agreement fell short, that is in the fight against poverty.
I very much welcome the promotion of poverty eradication as one of the core aims of the new partnership agreement, but we must ensure that this is also reflected in the Commission's programming through its country strategy papers.
I regret to say that the strategy papers reviewed so far show the transport sector receiving 35% and macroeconomic support 25% of all programmable resources.
In the Committee on Development and Cooperation we have on countless occasions stressed the need to plough resources into basic health and basic education if we are serious about poverty reduction.
It is right to stress this point again tonight.
The second crucial change from LomÃ© concerns civil society participation.
What sort of results can we expect after hearing reports that civil society has not yet been involved in a genuine and meaningful way?
I am disappointed to see that out of a possible 15%, only 2% of resources have been allocated to capacity building in the country strategy papers drawn up so far.
Was this because civil society organisations were not consulted or because civil society has such a low absorption rate?
The Cotonou agreement stipulates that civil society participation should come from the bottom up, yet without the capacity this is impossible.
Finally, in pointing out some of the practical challenges that lie ahead, I would not and do not want to denigrate the huge achievement of the negotiation and signing of the agreement in the first place.
The EU-ACP partnership remains a model for North-South cooperation in our world and one which we celebrate properly in our vote for ratification in the European Parliament this week.
Mr President, allow me first to congratulate Members of Parliament on having taken this important step in the process of approval of the Cotonou Agreement.
You all know how important it is to complete the ratification process in order to be able to implement the agreement fully, including its financial component.
You also know how important the ACP-EC relationship is in the framework of the Community' s development policy.
One very important aspect is that the text of the Cotonou Agreement is a negotiated text.
This is also indirectly reflected in the comments from many in this debate about the fact that having the agreement is quite an achievement.
The way we obtained it was through real negotiations.
This is what Mr Howitt pointed out in presenting this as a model for a more global relationship between north and south.
There are many deficiencies in it and much of the criticism comes from the fact that it is still very ambitious and it is difficult to implement.
This has to do with the expectations we have as to what our partner countries actually put into the programming process.
This is not for us alone to decide, which is partly my response to Mr Howitt's comments.
I shall now make some brief comments on the report as such.
I find the report' s approach towards the trade dimension of Cotonou interesting, although I cannot agree with all of it.
Certainly, the report' s evaluation of the economic and trade regime under Cotonou is based on a political view of development and North-South relations.
For example, we do not agree with the report that the Cotonou Agreement is in favour of "development only through market laws".
In our view, the Cotonou Agreement provides a comprehensive framework, integrating trade as one instrument among others to promote sustainable development.
The core element of future trade relations will be the Economic Partnership Agreements which aim to create favourable conditions to enhance both the volume and the benefits of trade.
It is true, negotiations of regional economic partnership agreements will aim at the progressive and flexible liberalisation of trade flows and at the integration of ACP countries into the world economy.
But this will be in line with their level of development and will take into account the socio-economic impact of trade measures.
REPAs will be based on regional integration, strengthening and deepening the existing regional integration initiatives.
This is also why I do not share the view expressed by Mr Belder that these initiatives could be some sort of risk, in relation to conflict prevention.
We clearly have the expectation that this regional cooperation will be part of conflict prevention and strengthen it.
This is what experience tells us.
REPAs will also be linked to comprehensive economic and social measures which can be financed through the EDF.
This is not sufficiently reflected in the report.
Some statements in the report could, in our view, be more precise.
For example, the reference to EU beef exports to Western Africa is highly critical of substituting local beef by subsidised EU beef.
However, this argument is based on EU exports from 1981 to 1991.
We are now in 2002 and the Community' s export policy to developing countries has changed in recent years.
In particular, since the early 1990s we have considerably reduced the export refunds for beef exports to Western Africa, precisely to avoid any substitution of local beef by subsidised EU beef.
As a consequence, there has been a progressive decrease of EU beef exports to ECOWAS countries from a level of 54 000 tonnes in 1991 to only 1600 tonnes in 2000.
This is a classical case.
We have had a number of them in the debate about coherence.
Most of these cases are historical cases and they have all been solved.
But there are other very real, meaningful important problems to discuss within the framework of the debate on coherence, so I would strongly advise everybody in this debate to put the finger on the real problems instead of providing only archaeological material.
There is also a certain confusion in the report when it comes to trade relations with LDCs.
It is stated that LDCs would automatically opt for the Everything but Arms regime, whereas non-LDCs had the choice between Economic Partnership Agreements and the normal GSP regime.
This is not the case.
On the contrary, it is important to stress that LDCs will be part of the regional economic partnership agreements process.
REPAs will tackle all barriers to trade, including issues such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures or technical barriers to trade and will build on the existing regional integration initiatives.
Both are highly relevant for LDCs.
Finally, let me emphasise that REPAs need to be integrated into the development strategies of the ACP and the EC.
It will therefore be essential that negotiations on the REPAs and implementation on the one hand, development policies on the other, are mutually supportive and that appropriate EU support measures are included in regular EDF financing.
REPAs will set a trade policy framework which will need to be fully coherent with development policies.
It is true that the objectives of the Cotonou trade agenda are ambitious but doing nothing and continuing with our past approach would incur major risks and would probably not reverse the economic marginalisation of ACP countries.
When we look at what has happened so far on the basis of the instruments of the past, this is quite obvious.
The Cotonou Agreement provides the instruments to help ACP countries to integrate in the world economy and to reduce poverty.
We have to use them in the best possible way.
It would be a misunderstanding to think that our agreement here and our instruments can do the trick.
There are very good basic reasons why these poor countries are not well integrated into the world economy.
There are real problems there.
The report is written as if it were a realistic assumption that as part of the engineering and the negotiations underlying the Cotonou Agreement we could easily have confronted and changed many of the underlying global issues.
I hope I am not shocking anyone by saying that it is not as easy as that.
It never was an option to offer the ACP countries a framework of economic development that was not based on the fact that the market economy is here to stay.
But this is not the same as saying that the market is the only method.
The Commission disagrees with that statement.
In fact the whole endeavour of our ACP-EU cooperation, as well as the rest of our global development cooperation effort, is proof of the fact that we are trying to do something that could never have been done if development was left to the market as such.
This is why we do it.
Let me end on a more conciliatory note by quoting from the conclusion of the report, which I strongly support.
"In effect the existence of a new ACP-EU cooperation agreement is a victory in itself.
Furthermore, it contains innovative aspects that will have to be interpreted and used constructively.
As the European Parliament has no powers to amend this text, it is essential to work to get the most out of it, so that aid can make a real contribution to the well-being of the people of the ACP countries, as regards their food, health, educational requirements, etc."
This is the kind of language I can identify with.
We welcome this conclusion.
I want to conclude by expressing deep satisfaction on behalf of the Commission that the European Parliament has now concluded its part of this process and we hope to see it concluded in general as soon as possible.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
There are no comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr van Orden has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the continuing deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe.
Last Friday Zimbabwean ministers had a meeting with EU representatives and they have been asked to write a letter or a report by tomorrow on improvements in the situation in Zimbabwe.
In fact, over the last week things have continued to deteriorate.
It is very important that the international community should show that it really means business by bringing Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe to task.
We need to be preparing smart sanctions now.
I urge you to ensure that the Council and the Commission take a uniformly tough line on Zimbabwe before it is too late.
Presidential elections will be held there on 9 March and time is running out.
Thank you very much, Mr Van Orden, we take note of your words and we shall communicate them to the Presidency.
Mr MacCormick has the floor for another point of order.
Mr President, I should like to take up a point Mrs McKenna raised yesterday concerning electronic voting and the secret ballot.
It is unhappily the case that the secret ballot arrangement by electronic voting is imperfect at the moment.
It is imperfect because, even when one uses the device mentioned by Mrs Jackson yesterday of a paper to cover the screen, it is easy for one's colleagues behind and beside to see how one voted.
When a secret ballot is important, Members should be protected from peer-group pressure.
I would therefore like you to refer to the Bureau the question of whether the electronic voting system can be improved in order to really function as a secret ballot and protect Members from those pressures from which they ought to be protected.
Thank you Mr MacCormick, it is not necessary to communicate this request to the Bureau, since it already began to study this issue yesterday.
There are other possibilities.
It is not that your consideration is irrelevant and we perfectly understand your political interest, but on the basis of our experience yesterday, which was the first under this system, the services are examining how to resolve this issue.
I, as the person responsible - for the moment, since the allocation of posts in the Bureau has still not been decided and I still have my former responsibilities in relation to buildings -, received a proposal yesterday afternoon which related to this.
I therefore imagine that the Bureau will be able to resolve this issue soon, with the help of the Quaestors.
Mr Sumberg has the floor for a point of order.
I would ask you not to spend too long on points of order.
Mr President, on a point of order.
May I ask you to ask the President of this Parliament to note that a vote took place here yesterday for a full inquiry into foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom.
The vote for that was carried because the British Labour Government refused my constituents an inquiry into that terrible disease.
In this Parliament yesterday the British Socialists ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Sumberg, please, this is not a point of order.
I know that you have the right to try to take advantage the opportunities granted you in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, but it was not a point of order.
Thank you.
Future of the common fisheries policy
The next item is the report (A5-0470/2001) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission White Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy [COM(2001) 135 - C5-0261/2001 - 2001/2115(COS)]
Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for the issues dealt with in the three reports on this morning' s agenda, is ill.
He was in Strasbourg yesterday, and he is still in Strasbourg at the moment, but he will not be able to take part in these debates.
I must therefore ask you to forgive the Commission' s absence.
I believe that we cannot paralyse debates, but that we should go ahead.
The Commission will be represented here by the top officials responsible but not by the Commissioner, who will not be able to participate.
On the other hand, the Council, which is not present either, has not apologised for its absence.
I believe that we must move ahead with our agenda.
On behalf of the House, I would like to wish Mr Fischler a speedy recovery.
Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, has the floor.
Mr President, I would like to point out, in support of what you have said, firstly, that Mr Fischler had informed me that he was unwell and was therefore not able to be here with us today.
I must say that Mr Fischler has always attended other debates.
Since he is unwell, a case of force majeure, we must of course simply reiterate the President' s wishes for his speedy recovery.
I think we must go ahead with this debate since we have already spent a lot of time preparing the reports scheduled for today, essentially the MiguÃ©lez report.
These are very important issues and we have managed to have them debated during this January part-session, which was difficult since there were institutional aspects to be resolved.
And furthermore, we are holding the debate on a Thursday, which is not usual for fisheries, and the reports will be voted on on a Thursday morning.
Therefore, as chairman of the committee, I would request that we go ahead with the debate despite the fact that the Commissioner is not present and that we send him our best wishes for a speedy recovery.
Mr President, before the fisheries debate in which I too will be taking part, I would draw your attention to the fact that this afternoon' s agenda features the Stauner report on the Community action programme Leonardo da Vinci.
I understand that further research is being carried out, as a result of which it would probably not be wise to vote on it at 5 p.m. today.
I would ask you to consider, together with rapporteur Stauner, whether this topic is ready for a vote today.
I have a feeling that it is not.
Mr Meijer, the question of procedure which you raise is certainly feasible.
The vote is scheduled for this afternoon, if the debate is closed.
If we have finished with the report which you have referred to, by Mrs Stauner, in accordance with the agenda, the vote is scheduled for 5.00 p.m.
I would be grateful if we did not hold up this debate any longer.
Furthermore, Commissioner Vitorino has informed us that he is on his way to Strasbourg, but it will be difficult for him to get here before the vote.
But if necessary, Mr Varela, Commissioner Vitorino could express the opinion of the Commission, which it has sent us in writing, before the vote, if you think it is essential.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are going to vote on today is clearly not the MiguÃ©lez report.
For obvious reasons: the Committee on Fisheries, by accepting the majority of the amendments to my report, and myself, by reaching a compromise on certain points with some of the Members presenting amendments, have made significant modifications to the initial text.
This text is, therefore, a synthesis of the various positions held in this Parliament in relation to the reform of the CFP, and when it comes to evaluating it there will be certain people who consider that the glass is half full and others that the glass is half empty.
In any event, I believe that the report contains a sufficient number of positive elements in comparison with the current CFP for me, as rapporteur, to request that this House vote in favour of it.
I must say that in the Committee on Fisheries there has been more agreement on the shortcomings of the current CFP than on identifying concrete proposals for its reform.
Nevertheless, I believe that it contains sufficient positive elements to lay the foundations for a future CFP.
The greatest difficulty has been in reconciling the various interests: those of the companies, in order to allow them to be economically viable, those of the preservation of resources and social and economic measures which are able to defend an activity largely based in the least developed regions, outermost regions and Objective 1 regions.
The European Commission should be able to show sufficient political intelligence to reconcile these three aspects, above all because the failure of any one of them would lead to the failure of the other two.
We are concerned about the existing contradiction between the highly critical analysis carried out by the Commission of the current CFP, which is shared by the European Parliament, and the subsequent proposals for reform, presented in the Green Paper, which are hardly innovative.
The Green Paper opts for little change, or 'more of the same' , which pleases nobody.
The report I am presenting is clear when it comes to defining the fundamental objective of the common fisheries policy: balancing the viability of a strategic European Union economic sector - which contributes to our food supply and is vital for employment and the economic and social cohesion of the outermost regions of the Union - with the maintenance of sustainable marine eco-systems.
With regard to the conservation and management of resources, the Committee on Fisheries asks for TACs to be set by means of rational and transparent measures, incorporating scientific opinions and data from the sector' s professionals, especially since they will be set on a multiannual and multi-species basis.
It asks for an end to the incoherences between the current CFP and the single market, demanding that areas of restricted fishing, either closed seasons, boxes or restricted access, be based on scientific criteria for the protection of resources.
In fact, as the report indicates, the current CFP entails a derogation from the principle of equal access and, in the absence of a Council decision, this derogation will end on 31 December 2002.
The CFP is obliged to respect the fundamental principles contained in the Treaty, including, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of equal treatment.
Relative stability requires a new analysis, as the report states, of the communities which are highly dependent on fishing, which considers the evolution in the Community over the last 25 years.
This analysis is essential to the review of the CFP.
The Committee on Fisheries has also rejected the extension of the exclusive access zone beyond the current range of 6-12 miles.
With regard to the fleet, the report makes its point clearly by pointing out that the Multiannual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs) have not produced the desired results, largely as a result of the lack of will of certain Member States to implement them correctly.
The reduction of the fleet is a socio-economic sacrifice which, in order to be understood and accepted by the fisheries sector, must be carried out in a balanced fashion in all Member States and also receive sufficient Community financial support.
The Community must continue to contribute to the modernisation of the fleet, by means of structural measures, strengthening the aspects relating to safety and living conditions on board, without this involving any increase in fishing effort.
It is therefore necessary to continue with the structural aid.
With regard to inspection and control, we recognise that the operation of monitoring and control mechanisms is unsatisfactory.
We believe that all the efforts aimed at conserving resources are destined for failure if we do not have a harmonised European system with a high degree of conformity within the sector.
It is necessary to extend the competences of the Community inspectors and establish a single penalty system.
With regard to international relations, the Community must deal with them decisively, relating them to the European Union' s foreign policy.
From the point of view of fisheries, the Union' s international relations must be seen from a primarily commercial point of view, with a view to achieving fishing opportunities for our fleet.
The fisheries agreements constitute and will continue to constitute an essential element of the new CFP.
To this end, it is necessary to create a uniform strategy in the reaching of international agreements, in such a way that the professionals are subject to the same conditions in terms of fishing opportunities, the payment of charges, licences and the using of surplus quotas.
The European Union' s commercial relations and policy on markets must combine the respect for the principle of Community preference with a reduction in tariffs together with the establishment of a list of sensitive products, giving the processing industry access to the supply of raw materials.
As for the social aspects, they were completely absent from the Green Paper.
We ask the Commission to fully incorporate these economic and social measures, which are necessary in order to ensure the economic and social cohesion of the regions dependent on fishing.
The fisheries sector is characterised by tough working conditions and a lack of collective agreements, which makes it necessary to increase social dialogue.
To end, within the time allotted to me by my group, I would like to express my regret at the elements that have been lost during these long months of parliamentary negotiation, in particular two points: a Community fleet which can operate under a single flag and a single body of Community inspectors.
I regret that the European Parliament, on this occasion, is not the innovative and pioneering institution which all we Members wish it to be.
In terms of fisheries we are decades behind in relation to the European project, but just as we now have euros in our pockets and our skies are watched over by Eurocontrol, sooner or later the European flag will fly on our fishing vessels.
Mr President, I have changed my usual seat in the Chamber.
Today, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
The Committee on Development has made a number of fundamental comments on the fisheries policy in relation to the development policy.
First of all, the Committee notes that the European Union is one of the world' s most important fishing entities and we must be aware of this.
Furthermore, the EU' s market is so vast that over half the fish consumed is either caught by the EU' s fleet outside Community waters or else imported, much of it from developing countries.
One can therefore understand that the common fisheries policy can have quite a considerable impact on developing countries.
The Committee on Development believes that the European Union must ensure its common fisheries policy is consistent with its policy on development and cooperation.
This is obviously essential because it cannot simply shift the problems of the European fisheries sector to other areas.
And, as we know, these problems are numerous; for example, we have excess fleet capacity, overexploited resources, declining employment and a largely degraded marine environment.
Therefore, to shift these problems to other areas of the world is not acceptable and is not an intelligent, long-term policy.
We also believe that the fisheries agreements, which are one of the crucial elements of the common fisheries policy, must not only be based on this first principle, but also upon reliable scientific assessments of the status of fish stocks and on the impact of fishing on target species, in particular.
As the main rapporteur said, scientific assessments are clearly necessary.
If we do not have them, which is, unfortunately, often the case in developing countries, we should adopt the precautionary principle so as to avoid the over-exploitation of resources.
The final point that I would like to make is that we must ensure adequate protection for coastal fishing communities in third countries and thus guarantee their food safety.
. (ES) Mr President, since we had no choice, the Committee on the Environment decided, with one abstention and a large majority in favour, that only the balance of the marine ecosystem - as other Members have said - is going to guarantee employment in fishing in the future, and the fleet ought to be brought into line with the existing resources.
As the rapporteur said, we must overcome the failure of the current CFP.
All of us who live in coastal regions know that biological rest periods, prohibited areas, dimensions of nets, TACs, etc. do not improve the situation and that the proposal made in the Green Paper does not go any way towards improving it.
We in the Committee on the Environment believe that we must take action on sources of pollution, of which there are many - industrial pollution, huge pressure from tourism, which we in our country understand very well - action on special ecosystems such as those which we have in our country, like the estuaries, action on oil refineries and other plants which act in opposition to what we want to see.
We need social, environmental and economic indicators that guarantee that actions are effective, as well as accompanying social measures and incentives aimed at sustainable fishing practices, such as the small-scale fishing which takes place on our nearest coasts.
We must respect the cautionary principle, which is well defined in the code of conduct of the FAO and in the United Nations agreement.
We must increase consumer confidence by acting not only on traditional fishing, but also on aquaculture.
There must also be information and increased awareness, as well as the participation of the citizens and the sectors involved so that the measures to be adopted in those sectors may be successful, as well as the participation of local and regional authorities.
And control and monitoring - as the rapporteur said - of the measures adopted, because otherwise there will be inequality between the various countries.
Mr President, in our view, we must not forget that greater fleet capacity does not guarantee employment.
Employment has fallen by 19% in the productive sector and by 10% over recent years in the processing sector.
We must therefore act to eliminate this contradiction.
Mr President, I, too, wish Mr Fischler a speedy recovery and am also in favour of us not deferring this morning's debate.
The subject is simply too important.
Getting this report, with its 400 amendments, through the committee was a really tough business.
The large number of amendments was certainly not attributable to the involvement of Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, whom I respect as a colleague and who has done exemplary work in producing a balanced report, and I would like to thank her once again for this.
Some will mock and ask themselves what all this expense is for, but I cannot emphasise enough what significance this report has for the future of fisheries in Europe.
A common fisheries policy has been in place for just about twenty years, with all their highs and lows.
Fisheries swam through many a trough.
Brussels cannot be made to bear all the responsibility for that, however.
On the contrary, not every Member State and not everyone in the fishing industry is pulling their weight, and it is for that reason that the CFP has not fully met the high demands made of it.
This year, we are at a crossroads in the truest sense of the word.
In which direction do we want Europe's common fisheries policy to go in future?
I can assure you that Parliament's recommendations will fall on good soil at the Commission, as this cooperation between the institutions in the interests of Europe's fisheries, and for their benefit, must be carried on, and it will be.
Now that the Commission knows what this report recommends, it can submit its reform proposals, which we await with eager anticipation, and so I hope there will be a large majority.
One thing, though, must be clear.
This will be a voyage over a rough sea for, as I have said, there are massive challenges ahead.
Let me briefly highlight a few things that I see as vital to Europe's future fisheries policy.
Firstly, without fish, there will be no more fishing industry.
This equation may be simple, but it is true.
We must give even more attention to the maintenance of healthy stocks than we did previously, because only healthy marine eco-systems guarantee sustainable management with a future ahead of it.
After all, we all - here in Parliament and out there on the coastline - want a viable fisheries sector, and one that is viable not only for today and possibly tomorrow, but for the decades yet to come.
Secondly, we know too little about how the marine eco-system is interlinked, and so there must be more intensive research.
Thirdly, it is a fact that there are insufficient fish in European waters, and so we must also fish outside them, and to this end we need agreements with third states.
These are expensive and are costing more and more; they will probably be too expensive as soon as tomorrow.
We have to strike out on new pathways here, even if this will require greater involvement of those who directly profit.
We owe this to our taxpayers.
Time is passing too fast, not only the time I have to speak, but the time left to reform the CFP.
Let us, by the end of this year, find a common and sustainable solution in the interests of our European fisheries.
Mr President, the review of the common fisheries policy gives us a chance to guide the future of fisheries in the European Union over the next ten years and we have to get this right.
The CFP has not yet achieved what it set out to achieve, and that is a sustainable fisheries sector.
Instead we have a situation where our fish stocks have been depleted and our seas polluted, while our technological capacity to fish has increased beyond recognition.
The cornerstone of the new CFP has to be environmental and economic sustainability.
One way of achieving this is to recognise the CFP's regional dimension.
We should increase industry involvement in fisheries management and conservation, allowing for an improvement of dialogue between fishermen and scientists.
Sustainability means that we have to take the environmental dimension of fisheries management seriously.
However, this has to be coupled with clearer procedures for responding quickly to conservation emergencies.
We should retain the principle of relative stability, but also ensure greater effectiveness and consistency in the control and enforcement of EU requirements, while attempting to simplify the burden of control on fishermen.
As we know there are still weaknesses in inspection and control, and the inspection structure and coordinated approach must be welcomed.
However, the use of uniform penalty procedures will require careful examination.
The area of fisheries agreements which Mr Lannoye talked about also needs to be reviewed.
Development considerations, poverty reduction and environmental impact are key considerations.
There have been many examples where local fishermen in some of the world's poorest areas can no longer fish.
When they cannot fish, they do not eat.
Reform is essential.
A lot has to be done in a very short time, but there is too much at stake for it to fail.
I hope that this time next year, when we return for the first part-session in 2003, we will see a newly reformed CFP fit for the future.
Mr President, when it is normal practice to congratulate rapporteurs on their work, it is difficult to find appropriate words to use when something exceptional has been achieved.
So I shall say simply that it is a tribute to the work of Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos that a report that attracted over 400 amendments at the committee stage has come to plenary with only 25 to be considered.
Before dealing with the nature of the substantive motion for a resolution, I want to touch briefly on the amendments by my own group.
Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 look to the international level.
Amendment No 3 seeks common definitions and methodology in respect of fisheries subsidies and fishing capacity and effort and the interrelationship between them.
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are designed to improve the monitoring both of the cost-effectiveness of fisheries agreements with third countries and of fishing activities conducted in the context thereof.
Amendment No 6 seeks only to soften the wording of recital H because of doubts that the CFP can actually guarantee those working in the sector living conditions comparable to those in other production sectors, although it should certainly assist in this respect.
Finally, Amendment No 7 wishes merely to add recreational sea angling to the areas to which, along with deep-sea and coastal fishing and aquaculture, separate attention needs to be given.
We hope that these amendments will meet with the approval of the House.
More generally, we believe that the motion for a resolution has achieved a commendable balance between the demands of fishing as an economic activity and the need for conservation.
In sustaining the principle of relative stability, and the six- to twelve-mile limit, it recognises the fragility of fisheries-dependent communities.
