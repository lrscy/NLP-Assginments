I therefore propose that we continue our debate whilst awaiting further information.
Â Â  Mr President, important as this debate is, it pales into insignificance when compared with the atrocious terrorist attacks in my capital city today.
I would like to join, I am sure in the name of all in this House, in utterly condemning that terrorism and in expressing condolence and sympathy to those who have been injured and killed.
We live in an age where terror seems to know no bounds.
Coming from Northern Ireland, where we alas have known much of that in our history, oneâs heart goes out to the people affected by this morningâs terrible events.
Turning to this subject, Northern Ireland, like many parts of Europe, once boasted a vibrant and large textile industry.
Today it is reduced to all but nothing, with thousands upon thousands of job losses.
Since trade policy was foolishly handed over to the exclusive competence of the EU, the plain truth is that Member States are powerless to act in the face of cheap imports ravaging their textile industry.
The plain truth is also that the EU has failed the textile industry.
The abolition of import quotas on 1 January 2005 has, in the UK and elsewhere, caused soaring imports, especially from China.
Whereas we are denied import quotas, Chinaâs state owned factories benefit from export subsidies, state aid and even free electricity, as well as the benefits of its artificially undervalued currency.
Little wonder that we cannot compete.
Commissioner Mandelsonâs decision to impose anti-dumping duties on certain synthetic fabrics is welcome so far as it goes, but often such fabrics are then further processed in China to give them added value, thereby avoiding the anti-dumping duties.
For example, a synthetic fibre that might be subject to that duty is given added value by making it into a roller blind, whereby it escapes the anti-dumping duty and is dumped in the EU at ridiculous prices.
That loophole must be closed.
Generally, the Commission needs to be much more robust with China than it has been hitherto.
Â Â  âMrÂ Allister, Parliament, which, I believe, in its entirety supports the condemnation of terrorism that you have just made, also expresses every sympathy for the injured, since at present we still do not know whether there have been any fatalities.
Terrorism, since that is apparently what we are concerned with here, will always be met by Europeans who are prepared for terrorists and who refuse to yield.
We know that there were several major events in London yesterday, a happy event with London being chosen as the 2012 Olympic city, and the G8 taking place.
What has happened, therefore, is certainly no coincidence.
Let us then condemn these acts in the strongest possible terms.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to express my sympathy to all the victims.
Since 1 January 2005, WTO members can no longer impose quotas on textile and clothing imports.
The impact of this measure on the European market has proven to be enormous, both for importers and producers.
It is a good thing that the Commission has engaged in dialogue as a means of finding a solution to this dilemma, for by doing so, it has given the European producers some breathing space â no more than that, and nor can it be more than that, for the WTO does not allow any more and is not expected to change its position.
European producers will now have to come up with a real response to the new situation.
We need a strategic response to the problems in the long term, because the European textiles and clothing sector, and not that sector alone, has a structural problem.
There are many products that are, or can be, produced more cheaply in China, or maybe in other countries too.
It is also a fact that China fails to adhere to the WTO rules, and this is a major problem, particularly in the areas of intellectual property, working conditions, the environment and market access.
It is because of this that it can produce more cheaply, and the resulting unfair competition is something that really should be addressed.
Compliance with the existing rules must be ensured.
Many poorer countries have, in recent years, become hugely dependent on the textiles and clothing sector, and they, too, are seeing jobs disappear as they struggle to compete with China.
We must prevent the least developed countries from becoming the biggest losers.
Too little consideration, moreover, is being given to the interests of importers and producers who, in response to the post-2005 situation, have entered into financial commitments, sometimes major ones.
They should not become the victim of a rescue operation in a section of the production industry.
They are entitled to predictability and legal certainty.
Finally, we can, of course, protect our trade position, but always in line with the WTO, and showing due responsibility towards poor countries, and in respect of fair trade, human rights, and the environment.
I might add that all WTO members should, in fact, do likewise.
My compliments to Mrs SaÃ¯fi.
Â Â  Mr President, over the last three years alone, over USD 20 billion was invested in Chinaâs textile and clothing industry, much of it even coming from our own industries, and its capacity increased by 50%.
What that means is that in China, every year, 20 billion articles of clothing are produced, equivalent to four items for every human being on this earth. That sums up its capacity.
Let me now pass on to the social aspect.
Women working in Chinaâs textiles industry have a place right at the bottom of the social scale, many earning less than a dollar a day and, moreover, without any rights.
Even so, Chinaâs share in global textile markets is soaring.
The poorest states in the world are now losing even their textile industries.
Africa, stricken with Aids, is losing thousands of jobs a day.
The European Union is currently losing a thousand a day.
Around the world, over 30 million jobs are under threat of relocation, not to mention the 30 million jobs accounted for by sub-contractors.
This is more than just a fundamental change in the world of work; it is a catastrophe.
Things have come to such a pass in China that the country is competing with itself; social security rules are being cut back and businesses are being discharged from their social obligations.
While we talk about fair trade and core labour standards, capital can do as it pleases.
The one thing I ask of you, Commissioner, is that you raise the issue of social security at the forthcoming WTO negotiations in Hong Kong.
Saying âyesâ to liberalisation means that the âhowâ has to be considered as well.
This I say in my capacity as Vice-President of the International Textile, Clothing and Leather Workers' Association, whose members â over 10 million in 110 countries around the world â are devastated by this catastrophe.
Â Â  â The textile sector was the first sector of EU industry to feel the pain of changes in the global market.
New market participants have appeared on the textile market, above all China and India.
It is sad to hear statements by European Union officials that when China's membership of the WTO was negotiated ten years ago, no one imagined such growth in China.
Textiles and other sectors with problems show that this is not about a single European state's inability to manage its economy.
It is a problem for the majority of industrial sectors in the whole of Europe.
While having an industrial policy, the European Union only really predicts the general direction for growth and employment.
The sectors recommended for expansion are not identified; this is a matter for the Member States.
As a counterbalance to China, the rapporteur proposes to concentrate textile production in the Mediterranean region.
However, this will definitely not stop China, and Europe will have new competitors.
There is a need for an analysis and long-term development forecast of EU industrial sectors, taking into account the appearance of new market participants and the division of markets.
I therefore invite the European Parliament to urge the European Commission to prepare proposals to amend industrial policy, to forecast long-term industrial development up to 2030-2050 and to submit recommendations to industry about sectors of the future that should begin to be invested in now.
If we do not undertake such measures, a Chinese âtsunamiâ will devastate industry in Europe.
Â Â  â We will now interrupt this debate, which will resume at 3 p.m.
Â Â  Honourable Members, in the last hour, reports have reached me of what now appears to be a coordinated series of attacks on Londonâs transport system.
Explosions have been detonated on three buses and at four tube stations.
Deaths have already been confirmed, and many people have suffered terrible injuries.
I do not yet have any specific figures, but we may have to deal with many deaths.
Reports of attacks are continuing, and they arrive every few minutes.
On behalf of Parliament I want to express our condolences to all those who are suffering the consequences of these barbaric acts.
As President of Parliament and a citizen of a country that experienced only last year the horror of this kind of multiple attack, I want to send, on behalf of us all, a message of solidarity to the British people.
We all stand with you today.
We will never let the atrocities of terrorism defeat the values of peace and democracy in Europe.
I ask you now to observe a Minuteâs silence.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to replace part of the amendment, that is to say that we wish to replace the words âpriority will be givenâ with the words âthe Commission will encourageâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the rapporteur and under Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to ask the Commission if it is now prepared to accept the amendments of this House.
Â Â  . Honourable Members, the Commission maintains its position as stated yesterday by my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, meaning that the consultation of the European Parliament is required.
Â Â  . Mr President, in that case, again on behalf of the rapporteur, I should like to ask the House to refer this back to committee for further consultation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to respect the deceased.
At this very moment, a serious of new explosions is taking place in London.
That is an attack against the entire Union, which cannot refrain from making contact with the current Presidency of the European Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, I rise under the same rule, for the same rapporteur, and I put the same question to the Commission, please.
Â Â  .I, of course, take account of Parliamentâs position and will not fail to communicate it to the College.
Â Â  . Mr President, that may be half a step forward, but I should still like to refer the matter back to committee for further consultation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to clarify that, by way of this report, we recommend that the European Parliament reject the agreement on the transfer of passenger data between the EU and Canada.
That does not mean that the agreement cannot go ahead, even if we vote against it, because we are only being here.
You may recall that the European Parliament last year rejected a similar agreement with the United States on grounds of both substance and procedure.
The agreement was signed nevertheless and this House subsequently took the Commission and the Council to court.
The case is pending and a court ruling is expected by the end of this year.
I need to underline that the agreement with Canada is much better in substance.
We recognise that a good deal has been negotiated by the Commission.
However, the Commission chose the identical procedure as it did in the case of the agreement with the United States.
Both the European Parliament and the national parliaments are effectively being sidelined.
The Commission should have chosen the assent procedure instead.
The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously endorsed the view that the Commission has chosen the wrong legal base.
If Parliament were to accept this procedure now, it would basically undermine the pending court case.
I reiterate, by voting for this report, the Council can still go ahead with the agreement.
In other words, rejection by the European Parliament does not in any way jeopardise the agreement but, at the same time, Parliament remains coherent with its earlier positions and will not undermine the court case.
Therefore, I kindly ask you to vote for this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is a split vote on Amendment 2 to paragraph 26.
The first part is up to the word âmarketâ and then the rest of the amendment would be deleted, so it would be similar to the original form in committee.
I propose that the first part be adopted.
The second part would not be adopted; it would be rejected.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is a linguistic problem in this amendment.
I should like the word âandâ changed to âorâ, so that this is the least of all possible reasons why a clearing and settlement service can refuse access.
So âandâ should be changed to âorâ in the English version â the original version â and then in all the other language versions.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to make a practical proposal: we were unable to vote on MrsÂ SaÃ¯fiâs report on the textile industry this morning and I know that it is scheduled to be put to the vote this afternoon.
I believe that, given the considerable implications of the textiles issues, not least for employment, we ought not to vote on such a matter rather hastily this afternoon.
I suggest postponing the vote to the next part-session.
Â Â  Mr President, I think Mr Wurtz has got it absolutely right; what matters is not that we have not yet brought the debate to a conclusion, for that is in order.
What matters is that, instead of holding the vote today, we should wait until the next part-session, which will be in September, and vote then.
I strongly support the motion.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I very well understand the arguments put forward by my fellow Members: they are right that the textiles issue is a fundamental one.
I should simply like to remind you that the part-session in Strasbourg concludes on Thursday afternoons at around 5 p.m. and that Members should be in attendance.
Requesting such postponements means finally accepting that we do not work up to the end of our part-sessions as they are scheduled.
I genuinely regret that.
Â Â  Mr President, I had asked to speak even before the declarations of vote on the order of business.
I would like to put to you the straight question as to whether it really is legitimate to move the adjournment of a vote before the end of a debate.
I do not believe that it is.
I believe that this should have been moved only once the debate was over, or, alternatively, that we could have voted this evening, and I would ask you to check this before then.
In that case, we would have to include in the closing vote another vote on the motion for adjournment, for it was, or so I believe, irregular to vote on that in the middle of a debate.
Â Â  . I'm voting today for my Report on the initiative by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to adopting a Council decision adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff because we have received some assurances that there will be a greater level of accountability and transparency in the way that Europol's activities are conducted.
Europol is extremely important to European citizens and to the European Parliament.
Its activities on issues such as drug trafficking, illegal trafficking of human beings and other organised crime is vital work which has increasing importance with the enlargement of the EU and potential further enlargements.
In voting for my Report, I have noted the EP Hearing with the new Director in June 2005 of Europol and the EP visit to Europol's Headquarters in April 2005.
It is important we support the work of Europol, but that, in turn, the Council understand the urgent need for accountability and transparency in Europol's core work.
At present we have not yet achieved this level of accountability.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wanted to make it clear that I twice voted against Amendment 43 when we voted on the Isler BÃ©guin report, not out of any ignorance of the content or of the proposal by the Committee of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but because we should ask ourselves the fundamental question of whether individual committees should now, while we are in the middle of a debate on the financial perspectives, be able to adopt resolutions that go against what we resolved in relation to the BÃ¶ge Report.
We will only have any clout in our negotiations with the Council if we, no matter how legitimate the individual committeesâ opinions may be, do not, in anticipation of the decision on the financial perspectives, sabotage the basis on which our decisions are arrived at.
It is for that reason, bearing in mind our negotiations on the financial perspectives, that we have voted against.
Â Â  Mr President, having voted against the Isler BÃ©guin report, I wish to make clear that I am in favour of protecting the environment and also of the financial settlement, which is absolutely necessary.
I also favour keeping to the position we arrived at on the financial perspectives, as laid down in the BÃ¶ge Report.
I am, however, opposed to the institutions giving support to environmental associations or non-governmental organisations, and against the European Union taking upon itself any more functions.
Even in protecting the environment, subsidiarity must be the order of the day.
Primary responsibility for it lies with the Member States.
That applies to forestry policy, and also to the buying-up of land for nature conservation.
When money is tight, we have to concentrate on what is essential, that being support for the environmentally-responsible management of land.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE +) falls short of what is required, in terms of financial resources, and it is unacceptable that it fails to cover the NaturaÂ 2000 component.
The report adopted today improves considerably on the Commissionâs proposal, by introducing, with improved funding, the nature and biodiversity component, which covers the creation, preservation and management of Natura sites, (the network of the most important nature sites in the EU), thereby helping to achieve the objectives aimed at halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond.
The amendments that have been tabled clarify the objective of the LIFE + project.
It provides for drastically reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, protecting Europeâs forests, providing more information on the environment and increasing the involvement of European citizens in achieving environmental aims.
The question now is whether this ambitious project can be implemented with the existing resources and political will.
Â Â  . I voted for this report.
Life + is the key instrument for the development, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and communication of community environmental policy and legislation.
It will notably support the implementation of the 6th Environment Action Programme.
We must ensure that a proper budget is established for Life + commensurate with its ambitious goals.
Â Â  . The commitment shown by the EU to addressing environmental issues is, broadly speaking, worthy of our support.
It is our responsibility to try to leave a habitable world for future generations; for this reason, the abuse of resources as though there were no tomorrow is disgraceful.
Nevertheless, one must distinguish between policies to protect the environment and policies that bring the environment to the centre of the stage as though it were the only issue that existed.
There are other key areas that we must not overlook, such as people, economic needs and development needs.
In this context, I broadly share the concerns that Parliament has expressed both in committee and in plenary debate, especially given that the common agreement is a reasonable one.
We protect the environment because we put people first.
That should be the principle guiding what we do.
Â Â  . There is much scepticism about the European Union among the Swiss public, who fear the loss of their political rights and do not want to allow anything to be imposed on them.
To date, the Alpine state has taken the wise course of entering only into bilateral treaties, as a result of which it enjoys a privileged partnership with the EU, something that is also to be recommended to many other states who want to retain their sovereignty and characteristics.
The EU, racked by crises, slides on one banana skin after another, thrown into disarray by the German visa scandal, with the double ânoâ to the Constitution and unresolved budget issues following close behind.
It has to be said that this very rejection of the constitution may have made it easier from some of the Swiss to vote in favour of Schengen and Dublin, as it is more probable that they will come to like a loose federation of states than a centrally directed single state.
Against the background of prevailing suspicion, the veiled threat of Schengen/Dublin is not exactly likely to foster trust, the result being that everyone knows that they will have to vote in September on the extension of the agreement to the new Member States of the EU.
It is precisely this ignorance, and the all too obvious steamrollering of sovereign decision-making that causes the European public such concern.
It is not acceptable that support grants worth millions and deceptive promises should be employed to entice new Members or bind countries closer to the EU, thereby robbing them of the option of going their own way outside it.
Â Â  Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to welcome the agreement between Europe and Canada on the processing and forwarding of Advance Passenger Information and Passenger Name Records data, which we regard as thoroughly well-balanced.
It represents a decisive step in addressing the sensitive issues of global security and the fight against international terrorism, of which we have seen another lamentable example today.
The PPE-DE Group has abstained from voting today, this being our chosen way of protesting to the Council at the short deadlines, which are scarcely credible and leave no time for the debate that needs to be held.
Our protest is directed solely at the procedure.
We want this agreement, for on it depends the security of the citizens whom we in this House represent, and the way we have voted is intended to reflect that.
I would like to express our congratulations to the Commission on the agreement and on the proposal, as also to the rapporteur.
Â Â  . I welcome the substance of the agreement with Canada on the use of Advance Passenger Information (API) / Passenger Name Records (PNR) data of passengers on flights to Canada.
I particularly welcome the principles of non-discrimination and reciprocity, the possibility of jointly reviewing the execution of undertakings made, and the fact that data transferred are limited by the âpushâ system, which sets a positive example to other similar agreements such as the one with the USA.
I am delighted that, unlike the USA, Canada has a legislative data protection system, including supervision by an independent data protection Commissioner.
I also welcome the fact that Canadian law allows citizens rights of access, rectification and even opposition as regards any personal information relating to them, and that the Canadian commitments extend this right to EU citizens who are not present in Canada.
I support Mrs in ât Veldâs outstanding report and its proposals, and I agree that we need to wait for the Court of Justiceâs ruling on the USA PNR case.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the political situation and independence of the media in Belarus.
I am grateful to colleagues from different political parties and different political groups who supported this resolution.
I look forward to the Commissionâs concrete actions to provide, as soon as possible, the necessary assistance to begin the broadcasting of independent radio programmes to Belarus from abroad â from Lithuania, Poland and, possibly, Ukraine.
Â Â  . One of the direct effects of the most recent EU enlargement has been that politicians, the media and the people have increasingly turned their attentions to the countries that are now the EUâs closest neighbours.
One of these is rightly Belarus, where events over a number of years are cause for serious concern.
As was abundantly clear recently with Ukraine, the EU is capable of using its influence to promote successful transitions to democracy.
This idea lies at the root of the concerns expressed in the resolution that was adopted in this House and to which I gave my full support.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that within our Europe we will never again have to witness a war against the sovereignty of a State.
I hope that a situation never again occurs in which a national economy is crushed with the connivance of the World Bank, in which extortionate conditions are imposed one after the other, and in which public and state-owned enterprises are despicably expropriated or put out of business.
I hope that everyone still feels shame for one of the most ignoble pages in the history of Europe, which caused death, misery and instability in the Balkans.
With this in mind, I abstained from the vote on the hypocritical resolution on Srebrenica.
Â Â  . Ten years after one of the lowest points in recent European history, we should try to remember and learn from the terrible events of that time, and to understand two enormously important points: firstly, we should appreciate that peace, which most people nowadays take for granted, is a fragile gift, and secondly, great strides forward have been made in these ten years.
Right now, our duty is to remember the horror and the part played by those who encouraged and carried out the massacre, to remember the fact that there were organisations that failed to protect the victims and to learn from the mistakes that were made.
Â Â  . The massacre in Srebrenica, Bosnia, ten years ago should never be forgotten.
In July 1995, the Bosnian Serb army took control of the small spa town which had been declared as a UN âsafe areaâ.
Within five days 7 000 men and boys were brutally murdered.
This was the worst case of genocide in Europe since the Second World War.
A decade later and still the men who ordered the massacre are at large.
The EU must do all it can to put pressure on the relevant authorities to capture and put to trial those responsible for this atrocity.
Â Â  .â Î€he Communist Party of Greece voted against the unacceptable motion for a resolution on Srebrenica because it endeavours to exonerate the murderous war by NATO against Yugoslavia and justify the crimes against its people, who were dismembered by the intervention by the American and European imperialists, initially causing war within the country and then the NATO attack.
It is using Srebrenica to launder this dirty war and to legalise forthcoming movements to redivide the Balkans and imperialist interventions planned in the area as a whole.
An effort is being made to sanctify the US-inspired special tribunal set up in The Hague, the 'bill of indictment' of which has collapsed and been ridiculed.
As far as Srebrenica is concerned, we would point out that:
? the reasons for the foreign imperialist intervention cannot be concealed;
? the people remember that the bomb in the market square of Sarajevo which exacerbated the war was the result of action by foreign secret services.
The reference in the resolution to Srebrenica as the greatest post-war crime is a blind forgery of history, because the greatest post-war crime of imperialism in Europe to date is the slaughter of Yugoslavia.
Politically, those with moral responsibility for the war, for the bombing of the maternity clinic in Belgrade, the intensive care unit and the school in Alexinatz, for the slaughter of civilians, for the use of cluster bombs and for the destruction of infrastructures are the American and European imperialists.
Â Â  . One of the key areas of our relations with the Far East is the embargo on arms sales to China, which I support, although I am aware that this is, more than anything, a symbolic gesture, given that, even without European arms, China remains a threat to Taiwan, and that China still commits an alarming number of human rights violations.
Chinaâs power â both now and in the future â is not exclusively military in nature.
It is now a growing economic power that uses a huge amount of energy.
It is a demographic power.
It is a diplomatic power, in view of its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and its diplomacy and cooperation policy of helping developing countries without imposing any kind of democratisation process; far from it in fact.
Consequently, rather than simply discussing whether or not to remove the embargo, the EU needs to think strategically.
Our prime objective is to ensure that China becomes a democracy.
No democracy poses a threat to us, whereas a military, diplomatic and demographic power with huge economic strength and without democratic checks and balances might pose a medium- or long-term threat.
Â Â  Mr President, I was unable to support the conclusions of the resolution on landmines, although, as someone who has been involved in development cooperation, I share this concern and I regard the use of landmines in developing countries as a great tragedy.
I represent an EU country that is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Ottawa Treaty by the year 2016.
By that time we will have scrapped the worldâs safest and least destructive mines, which protect our 1Â 324Â kilometre long border with Russia.
The mines have not just been left in the ground unsupervised: they are in storage and guarded.
When they were placed in the ground during the war, precise maps were produced so that they could be deactivated later on.
No civilian can tread on a Finnish mine or accidentally step on the tripwire of a deactivated mine.
Images of children with mutilated limbs do not apply to conditions in Finland.
Countries where that happens cannot be part of the Ottawa Treaty.
We already know that our defences are weakening substantially.
We will have to find a substitute system with the same function but a different name.
Our problem is therefore one of semantics.
One might ask what logistic strategy adheres to a set of morals that insists on the destruction of the present antipersonnel mines but agrees that some replacement system should be acquired.
The purpose of warding off and destroying the enemy does not alter the fact that this weapon system is to be exchanged for something more modern, more expensive and more effective.
The new systems are not in any way less lethal instruments of death than the current land mines.
Their purpose is to prevent the enemyâs advance.
In resolving the problem we should focus more on the use of mines as instruments of terror than the equipment itself.
Â Â  . Anti-personnel mines are among the most heinous devices used in warfare, as they, often invisibly, extend the horrors of the conflict into the future.
We therefore naturally wish to express that we are committed to ensuring the success of the Mine Ban Treaty, and that we share the concerns that Parliament has raised in this regard.
Our displays of concern and commitment to the success of this Treaty are not enough, however.
Countries such as EU Member States must commit themselves to providing direct support for the victims, who are usually in countries with terrible development problems such as Angola.
Â Â  . The PPE-DE Group abstained on the resolution tabled by the other political groups on anti-personnel landmines largely because we do notÂ support those parts of the resolution which call for a widening of the anti-personnel landmine campaign to include anti-tank mines and other categories of munition, which are currently required in the inventories of our responsible armed forces.
These weapons are, in any case, under consideration by the parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) â a highly responsible group which is examining matters such as detectability, fuse design and self-destruction in order to minimise collateral effects.
We attach importance to maintaining a broad consensus on the anti-personnel landmine issue, and therefore remaining focused on what really needs to be done â making safe those areas in many parts of the world where mines are a threat to the civil population and an obstacle to economic development and assistance to mine victims.
Â Â  . The illegal and unsustainable exploitation of forests has a devastating effect on both mankind and nature.
In vulnerable regions such as the Amazon, Central Africa, South-East Asia and Russia more than half of the logging activities are illegal.
The government of Brazil announced last year that the destruction of the world's largest tropical forest, the Amazon, proceeds apace.
In the 12-month period ending last August, farming and logging, much of it illegal, destroyed 10,000 square miles of forest.
This was the biggest one-year loss since 1995, when the Amazon shrank by about 11,000 square miles.
Internationally the EU has committed itself to protect the last ancient forests and to fight the illegal exploitation and trade of timber through CITES, WSSD and CBD.
In May 2003 the European Commission published the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade Action Plan.
I urge them to speed up implementation of this important initiative.
Â Â  . My intention was to abstain on the vote on the resolution as a whole on the Kauppi report.
Â Â  . I welcome this report as a contribution to finding a way forward in completing the Internal Market for financial services, specifically in the area of clearing and settlement for Securities Transactions.
A common regulatory and supervisory framework for clearing and settlements is necessary for the further integration of the single market in financial services.
This report sets out a reasonable approach to devising such a system.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say on the subject of the vote on Bulgaria and Romania I say on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and it is that it was our group that was the motivating force behind yesterdayâs debate.
We wish to stress that the previous enlargement of the European Union was a great success, and that is what we want the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to be.
In no group in this House were there as many votes in favour of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania as from our group, the PPE-DE.
We want it to succeed; we also want the accession treaties to apply as a whole and to their fullest extent.
We have taken a different view as regards the observers.
The Conference of Presidents, meeting on 9Â June, decided that the observers should come on 26Â September.
Let me make it quite clear that the idea of inviting observers â that is, from the ten countries that are now Member States â originally came from our group.
We are firm advocates of the idea that countries due to join us should send observers.
We would, however, have preferred it if the observers were to join us in this House one year prior to accession, as once did the observers from the ten new Member States.
There would have been an opportunity, when we moved the debate on Monday, to inform the House that its President had already, and without our knowledge, extended the invitations.
This was something of which we needed to be informed.
This state of affairs has prompted us to withdraw our motion and both the changes to the vote for which we had asked.
We would have been glad if the House had been able to arrive at a common position.
As most members of our group were in favour of abstaining from the vote, we did not vote in favour of the joint motion.
As democrats, we will of course respect the majority that has resulted from it; we will welcome the observers and look forward to working with them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the admission of observers from Bulgaria and Romania to the European Parliament.
I believe that that is an extremely important step forward towards the day marking the full membership of these, the last two ex-Communist states, which, in my opinion, ought to have been accepted with the other eight countries on 1 May 2004.
Within the Italian national anthem is the line ââ, which â I will say it for the benefit of the interpreters â means âlet us all join together for the coming battlesâ.
The terrible news that we received a short while ago from London prompts me to say that, if all of the European Member States remain united, we will be able to defend ourselves far better from the insane attacks against democracy, as is happening at this very moment in London.
Â Â  Mr President, further to what has been said by our group chairman, I would like to say that I abstained from voting on the resolutions on Romania and Bulgaria, as the fact that the President of this House had already, on Friday, sent a written invitation to the observers meant that neither resolution actually has a procedural basis any more.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have responded to this change in the procedural basis by withdrawing the resolution, and that was the right thing to do.
As the other side had not done likewise, and the resolutions â to the substance of which we were not opposed â had already been taken, and the deeds had been done, it was not necessary to draft a new resolution.
I always work on the principle that, if you have sent someone an invitation, you cannot withdraw it if circumstances have not changed.
While we extend a warm welcome to those to whom the invitations have been sent, and look forward to their working with us, we do believe that what is more important than any date is that equal treatment should be given to all acceding countries, that rules should be obeyed and that their substance should be taken seriously, for, if that were not the case, the public would get the idea that we did not treat everyone equally.
I have to reiterate that it was incumbent on the President of this House to inform us during Mondayâs debate of precisely what he had done.
Had he done so, we would have saved ourselves a great deal of recrimination, upset and misunderstanding both before and during this debate.
Â Â  . I warmly welcome this resolution on observers from Bulgaria and Romania.
The presence of observers from the Bulgarian and Romanian Parliaments can make a useful contribution to the preparations for a successful accession and I look forward to their arrival.
Â Â  . Mindful of the state of negotiations on Bulgariaâs prospective EU accession, of the difficulties that remain to be overcome and of the most recent accession processes, I feel that, although this process might take longer, the same conditions should be set for Bulgaria and its politicians as those set for other countries at the same stage.
I therefore welcome the decision adopted by the Conference of Presidents on 9Â June to invite the parliaments of Bulgaria and Romania to appoint parliamentary observers and to welcome those representatives from 26Â SeptemberÂ 2005 until the countries formally join the EU.
Â Â  . The European Democrats and many others within the PPE-DE Group fully supported the joint motion and acted to oppose negative proposals, which were then withdrawn.
We regret the fact that this issue was unnecessarily brought before the House at this stage.
We confirm our commitment to the early enlargement of the EU to include Bulgaria and Romania and to welcoming parliamentary observers from these countries in September. This is as soon as possible after signature of the Treaty of Accession, in accordance with precedent.
We all recognise that much still needs to be done if Bulgaria and Romania are to be ready for accession on time.
But at this stage it is most unhelpful to talk of delay and prematurely to raise the spectre of safeguard clauses.
In this regard we reiterate the need to ensure that each country is dealt with on its own merits.
The elections in Bulgaria on 25 June produced an unclear result.
It is most important therefore that a stable and broad-based coalition Government, with strong elements of continuity, is put in place as soon as possible to implement the necessary programme of modernisation and reform with urgency and effectiveness.
Â Â  We shall continue with the debate on the report by Mrs SaÃ¯fi, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on textiles and clothing after 2005 [2004/2265(INI)] (A6-0193/2005).
Â Â  â MrÂ President, allow me first of all, because we are resuming this debate in very distressing conditions, to offer my sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the attacks that have taken place in London, the terrible consequences of which we are learning minute by minute.
To return to our debate, the major importance of which was stated this morning, my group, through Caroline Lucasâs speech, has stressed the extent to which it supports the series of temporary measures that are being proposed.
That said, I should like today to highlight certain points that appear to me to be essential.
The first concerns two paragraphs in the report that seek to minimise the scope of the REACH Directive, and which we consider to be totally unacceptable.
Those two paragraphs actually make a very clear recommendation to limit the scope of application of the directive in order to prevent its having â supposedly â harmful consequences for the textile industry and its competitiveness.
I would remind you that the draft REACH Directive, currently being debated in Parliament, proposes to record, assess and monitor the use of chemical substances that could be harmful to our health and our environment.
These references are therefore completely unacceptable, because we do not believe that the competitiveness of our industry can be increased at the expense of health, the environment and employeesâ working conditions.
It is all the more unacceptable given that in my region, for instance, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which is hard hit by the restructuring, we are unfortunately well versed in this type of debate, which advocates curbing environmental demands in order, so they say, to protect jobs.
That systematically results in a social and environmental disaster.
I am referring, of course, to the very high number of asbestos victims.
I am also thinking of the Metaleurop affair, which was the subject of a major debate in this House, and which caused the inhabitants of the region to lose their jobs, their health and their soil, unusable for years.
This attack against the REACH Directive is therefore entirely misplaced, all the more so since it is expected that its effect on the textile and chemical industry in general will be to foster and drive the capacity for innovation.
Our discussion ought to be much more focused on the competitive advantage resulting from the low cost of producing textiles products in China.
In fact we should be aware that these low production costs are due to the exploitation of Chinese workers and to the violent suppression of their demands.
Allow me to refer to an extract from an Amnesty International report, a relatively recent one since it dates from 2002, which states very clearly that in private companies in China overtime is not only compulsory, but is also unpaid, and that certain factories impose fines on those refusing to work overtime or arriving late for work.
Chinese workers work between 10 and 12 hours per day and their accommodation and food costs are often deducted directly from their wages.
It is not unusual for businesses to withhold wages for sometimes two months, or to keep the identity cards of certain workers for several months.
In short, trade unions are hugely repressed.
Since we have a structured dialogue with China on human rights â talks moreover took place last week â it seems to me that we ought to highlight the freedom of trade unions.
The numerous trade unionists today incarcerated in Chinese prisons ought to be the subject of protection measures, protection measures provided for in the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders.
This is an entirely crucial factor in the debate, which, I believe, has been unjustly concealed.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, since 1 January, hundreds of textile workers have found themselves thrown onto the streets, and tens of SMEs/SMIs have disappeared together with their know-how.
It is hard to say, but it is not the trousers and T-shirts imported from China that should be counted, but the jobs destroyed and the lives shattered.
When we hear the Commission and the Council of Ministers say, âwe are not aware, we were not aware, we could not be aware, it is Chinaâs faultâ, I can only cry out: but who are they trying to kid?
The decision to abolish the quotas was taken 10 yearsâ ago with the agreement of all of the governments.
China has been part of the WTO for nearly four years.
Over the past two years, nine out of ten textile machines have been bought by China.
Ultra-modern factories have been built there thanks to direct or indirect capital investments, including from Europe.
The European governments and institutions knew all of that and have done little or nothing at all.
They are therefore entirely and jointly responsible.
The pitiful agreement that CommissionerÂ Mandelson reached with the Beijing authorities will not change anything.
The ineffable CommissionerÂ Mandelson is like MoliÃšreâs doctor: he waits for his patient to die in order to ascertain his illness.
However, can the general interests of Europe be reconciled with the specific interests of the City: invest in China, Turkey or elsewhere?
Today it is the textile industry, but tomorrow it will be the car industry or perhaps the aeronautics industry, as China already manufactures Airbus doors and builds regional aircraft that compete with European, Canadian or Brazilian products.
You were surprised by the instinctive rejection of your ultraliberal constitution by the majority of those rare people in Europe who had a vote!
This overwhelming rejection is, however, the peopleâs punishment for your policy, including that relating to the textile industry.
The public do not want that policy to become the basic law of the Union.
In order to save and develop our textile industry, it is time for a change of policy.
After introducing a moratorium on the lifting of quotas, the Commission is duty bound to boost and assist research and development and training efforts in this sector.
The European Central Bank ought to encourage the introduction of low-interest loans for SMEs/SMIs in the sector, promoting employment, research and training.
The Union should take measures to prevent imports of goods produced by children or slave labour or by workers denied their freedom to participate in trade union activity, and to impose a tax on social dumping.
Finally, emerging countries should be given assistance to develop their internal markets.
Â Â  â Mr President, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs SaÃ¯fi, I would like to note for the Commission's benefit specific points of dialogue, agreement and/or disagreement with regard to the strategically important European textile and clothing sector.
I am in favour of opening up markets; I am against neo-protectionism, but in favour of the principle of reciprocity.
I am in favour of abolishing quotas, but with a parallel obligation to undertake symmetrical obligations with regard to duty-related and technical barriers.
I am in favour of international competition, but against all forms of its distortion, in favour of free but balanced trade, but against infringements of intellectual and industrial property rights, against imitations and piracy and against aggressive practices of economic, social and ecological dumping.
I am in favour of agreed solutions with China and memoranda of understanding but, at the same time, against the fragmentary approach being taken to aggressive Chinese exports to Europe.
I am against what is still, to a large extent, a closed and non-transparent market in China, the maintenance of high import barriers, the application of unfair practices and the lack of adequate cooperation on fundamental investigations into dumping practices.
I am in favour of the immediate implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean trade zone on the basis of the principle of reciprocity.
I am in favour of adequate Community financing to strengthen research and innovation, especially in the less advantaged areas of the European Union.
The pros and cons â and these are not all â are the topical parameters of a real challenge in relations between the European Union and China and a challenge in general for the world trade system.
To close, I should like to express my sympathy to the families of the victims in London and to add my feelings of repulsion about the incident to those of the British Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the calamitous effects of the latest round of liberalisation in the textile sector on 1 January 2005 made action urgently necessary, and I am very glad that the Commission has done something.
Although it deserves a great deal of praise for the speed with which it initiated negotiations and took steps to deal with the situation, these steps could have been more far-reaching and could have been taken sooner.
I would like to highlight the important role this House has played in this respect.
It was what we did that compelled the Commission, even more than it would have been, to have recourse to these measures.
Left to themselves, they might well have done rather less.
It is, though, to challenges such as these that European policy must respond.
Here in Europe, we enjoy the great advantage â and it is one of which I am glad â that our consumers are surely among the most mature in the world, and so they should be given the chance to decide what and how to buy, on the basis of far more information and with greater ease.
We should give thought to the possibility of introducing a âmade in Europeâ label, which would be able to be carried only subject to certain very stringent criteria being complied with, first among them, of course, compliance with international labour standards, along with social and environmental standards and a ban on the use of child labour.
If we succeed in this, we will also be able to find another way to respond to this development and make the world rather more socially responsible and cleaner.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this debate, which is unfortunately being conducted in a rather deserted Chamber, is important because it relates to one of the most significant sectors for European industry and therefore for the economy and citizens of Europe.
It is a sector that has been going through a serious crisis for some years now; the crisis has now been accelerated by the introduction of new trade agreements and the fall of many customs barriers, but the sector had already been experiencing great difficulties for a long time.
It is an important sector in terms of volume of business, the number of workers, its distribution in various European countries and its particular concentration in certain regions.
As a consequence, a crisis within that sector leads, in a number of local situations, to nothing short of a crisis for the economic and production system.
As we have already stated on other occasions, we too felt that the Commissionâs intervention came slightly late in the day. People had already been calling for it for some time, with the data in hand, in view of what was taking place with regard to imports and their volume.
Despite this criticism, however, we welcome the action taken by Commissioner Mandelson, whom we invite to oversee not only the agreement reached and its implementation, but also what is happening with regard to other categories of products.
In actual fact, the issue has not been resolved once and for all, and what has been done for a few categories of products, somehow containing the situation, could be required in the coming months for other categories of products.
For now we must not waste the time we have gained and we must make use of the recommendations originating from the high level group, from cooperation with entrepreneurs and social partners and from the ongoing talks.
Action must be undertaken to promote the restructuring and reorganisation of that sector, so as to overcome a profoundly structural crisis.
I refer in particular to employment, to professional training, to credit assistance, and to all of those innovations that can help such an important sector for Europe to remain that way.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, dark clouds have hung over the future of the textile and clothing sector ever since Europe and the nation States have been subjected to the dictatorship of the World Trade Organisation, have been enslaved by the free market and the rule of finance over the economy and politics, and have therefore assented to globalisation, which has also often been glorified in this House.
As a consequence, they have given up protecting industry, production and national labour.
At the moment, the prospect of exporting many European goods and services has almost been wiped out, because it is impossible to withstand the competition from the so-called âAsian Tigersâ with regard to markets in developing countries.
Added to that is the fact that we are subjected to unparalleled competition within our internal markets, both as a result of goods imported from the countries mentioned, and because of the diabolical mechanism allowing European producers, who have perhaps also benefited from government funding for their activities, to relocate production and to import and market their products in the countries in which the brands originate.
In view of the terrible predictions made by industry associations, and taking into account that in the absence of national sovereignty, imposed by this bureaucratic Europe, initiative measures cannot be taken by individual Member States, the Commission must expedite policies and directives supporting European businesses and employees in the sector, and prevent the marketing in EU countries of goods produced by the Asian Tigers, which are invading our markets. , they are goods produced without any guarantees for the consumer in terms of the production processes and the materials used, which often have a very high environmental impact, and which, furthermore, do not respect social guarantees and workersâ dignity, in complete contrast to what is stipulated by the World Trade Organisation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening now in the textile sector in the trade between China and Europe presages, in our view, what will happen in many areas over the next few years.
We are only seeing the first stage.
That is why our present responses to this issue will serve other areas of our industry in the future.
We cannot accept the deregulation of international trade without concerning ourselves with the related human, economic and environmental consequences.
A case in point is the textile sector where the end of quotas was dreaded and where there have been countless company restructurings, indeed outright shutdowns, in the regions in which this industry is still very prominent.
Faced with these human dramas, we are, in a sense, powerless.
The introduction of safeguard clauses, the fight against counterfeiting and the supplying of aid for research and information provision are all helpful roads to go down, but we cannot stop there.
In paragraphs 18 and 24 of her report, MrsÂ SaÃ¯fi rightly emphasises the need to combat all forms of modern slavery and forced labour, as well as the exploitation of children.
Indeed, it will never be possible for our modern economy, based on, among other things, respect for human dignity, to compete faced with such abuses.
MrsÂ SaÃ¯fiâs responses, designed to combat these scourges, are insufficient, however. One has to be able to hit where it hurts.
That is why, together with 50 of our fellow Members representing four political groups, we have lodged an amendment asking the Commission to consider putting in place an ethical tax on products proven to have been manufactured in violation of all the rules of human dignity and, above all, involving the exploitation of children.
It is crucial that an institution like ours serve more than one generation and that it serve to generate hope.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I sincerely welcome the outcome of the European Commissionâs negotiations with the Chinese authorities. This will provide companies affected by the huge rise in imports with some respite in this extremely serious crisis for the textile and clothing sector.
It is now necessary to monitor the implementation of the safeguard clauses and to evaluate the effects of these measures.
I should like to put three questions to the Commissioner.
How do you intend to respond to this resolution by the European Parliament on the future of the textile and clothing industries?
How do you intend implementing the High Level Groupâs recommendations, which have been received very favourably by Parliament?
And what actions do you intend to take to enable companies to have access to the market?
For example, might the European Union support trade strategies common to those small- and medium-sized European enterprises that might wish to form consortia with a view to conquering new markets such as Chinaâs?
Fellow Members have already said this, but the current crisis in the textile sector was foreseeable, and crises in other sectors of industry are foreseeable in the context of a globalised economy.
We must all work with ingenuity and tenacity to safeguard the textile, clothing and leather industries, for the lessons we shall learn from this crisis will, in the long run, help us to maintain and develop other sectors of the European economy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the future of textiles and clothing after 2005 without doubt presents a complete picture of the new economic and trade realities at global level.
Textiles and clothing are a key sector for the European Union and I therefore support Mrs SaÃ¯fiâsÂ protest at the absence of the competent Commissioners in this House.
The sector, which is mainly composed of small- and medium-sized enterprises, today finds itself in great difficulty as a result of Chinese goods, produced and sold extremely cheaply, invading our market.
Imports from China have increased on a worrying scale, particularly following the definitive abolition of import quotas in January 2005.
As a consequence, the EU textile and clothing sector finds itself under unprecedented pressure.
Our factories are closing down with increasing frequency and thousands of workers are left without jobs.
In Italy, 24Â 000 jobs were lost in 2004 and over 66Â 000 in the last three years.
It must be stressed that this problem also afflicts all of the developing countries that used to export their goods to Europe and that are now no longer able to withstand the Chinese competition.
As a consequence, factories are not only closing in Europe, but also in Sri Lanka, in Pakistan, in Morocco and in the entire Mediterranean area.
What can we do?
The appearance on the world trade scene of new, aggressive global players, in particular China and India, makes it necessary to review the traditional objectives of Community trade policy, characterised by the maximum opening up of the markets to assist in promoting European industry worldwide.
The current scene and the way it is likely to develop, however, dictate a more prudent approach, aimed at protecting European industry in the face of unbalanced and destructive competition.
The following actions need to be implemented urgently: approving without delay â as Commissioner Michel stated in this House this morning â the proposal for a regulation for the compulsory marking of origin of goods imported into the European Union; laying down industrial policies aimed at providing support to the sectors most exposed to international competition, including through the use of the Structural Funds; strengthening the trade protection instruments available to European businesses, including anti-dumping measures â as has been done for leather shoes â and anti-subsidy measures as well as the safeguard clauses; making the fight against counterfeiting a European priority, by supporting CommissionerÂ Frattiniâs initiatives; and steering the Commissionâs choices towards bilateral agreements.
If Hong Kong were to collapse like CancÃºn, there would be no time to relaunch the multilateral negotiations.
To conclude, I call for a review of the position on the new policy on chemical substances â the REACH Directive â particularly in order to guarantee the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, first of all, many thanks to our fellow member, MrsÂ SaÃ¯fi, for her excellent initiative and her report.
I very much want to emphasise how important this subject is.
A common European market requires common rules.
The same rules of competition must be applied to all the participants in the European textile market.
That is part of what respect for competition means.
China represents the ideology of state enterprises.
No one will be able to accept advantages being accorded to Chinese enterprises.
Our national governments are not entitled to accord advantages to national enterprises.
The Commission would immediately pronounce a ban.
It would, however, be a mistake for our national industries not to react, faced with China.
That is why I am in favour of applying the principle of reciprocity of trade, as everyone could benefit from it.
It is therefore extremely important to ensure that the High Level Groupâs recommendations are properly applied and to be vigilant when it comes to properly implementing the Shanghai agreements.
Â Â  â Mr President, the recent EU-China agreement is a positive development and we must acknowledge the important contribution made by Commissioner Mandelson to the final outcome.
This agreement gives the European textile industry some breathing space but, more importantly, it allows for crucial strategic decisions to be taken even now as regards the regrouping and modernisation of the textile sector in Europe.
Today, international developments in competition are forcing companies into making progress in leaps and bounds, into technological modernisation, innovation, research, technology and lifelong learning.
That is why the European Union must develop the structural policies and Structural Funds for the textile industry, develop the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development, create a specific Community programme for the development of the textile and clothing sectors, dynamically develop the institutional possibilities offered by the WTO to overturn China's social and environmental dumping and combat the problem of child labour by taking, where necessary, specific defensive trade measures, by safeguarding and defending free and equal access to third country markets and pure competition for European products, by defending consumer rights, by combating piracy and imitations and protecting intellectual property rights and by taking initiatives for a new integrated cooperation agreement with China to replace the 1985 cooperation agreement, which has basically been overtaken by international developments.
I should like to take advantage of Commissioner Michel's presence here to finish by saying that the Commission will also need to step up its investigation into uncontrolled imports of Chinese shoes, which have created serious problems in European countries such as Greece.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to express, on my own behalf and that of the Commission, our sincere condolences to the victims, and to the families of the victims, of the atrocious and barbarous acts that have taken place in London.
I should also like to express my complete solidarity with the British authorities.
Ladies and gentlemen, I note that, behind a few inevitable and no doubt necessary criticisms, the general tone of the speeches is fairly favourable to the Commissionâs approach.
That is already the case with the draft resolution, even if a number of people consider that still further steps could be taken, for example when it comes to social norms, protection against China or industrial restructuring.
Even so, I should like to revisit a few of the concerns expressed.
The agreement with China is of concern to, among others, MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda, MrÂ Guerrero, MrÂ Caspary, MrÂ Allister and MrsÂ Martens.
I would say that MrsÂ Martens found the right words to express this concern.
Like the majority of those who follow these issues, she thinks that the agreement with the Chinese will allow European industry some breathing space between now and 2008 and that this agreement is therefore good in itself.
I wish to point out that this agreement is to be applied strictly and that the quantities imported are strictly accounted for within the framework of genuine self-limitation quotas.
With regard to the safeguard clauses provided for by Chinaâs act of accession to the WTO, it will be specified that the European Union has not formally relinquished these, but the agreement with the Chinese is obviously global and designed specifically to avert such conflict in administering the sector as might arise from the harsh measures constituted by these clauses.
These clauses would therefore only be applied if this were really justified, something that does not seem to me to be the case, precisely because the agreement with China covers the most sensitive products, that is to say almost half of the Chinese textile sector liberalised in January 2005.
MrÂ Allister who, I see, is generally well disposed towards this agreement, will appreciate that the management of Chinese trade thus put in place obviates the necessity for the anti-dumping measures that he was recommending.
Finally, I should like to reassure MrÂ Caspary that the agreement with China will enable volumes to be stabilised, with a reasonable annual rate of increase of 8% to 12%.
It therefore protects European manufacturers but, until 2008, also stabilises importersâ stocks.
Flexibility clauses are envisaged within the framework of the negotiations under way with the Chinese in order to mitigate the limitation measures, to the advantage of importers.
Allow me to say a few words about respect for social standards on the part of developing countries.
I would say in reply to MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda that, although the European Union and the Commission actively promote such standards, developing countries criticise us on this subject, interpreting our demands as a form of protectionism in disguise.
Matters are therefore not always as simple as they appear.
Developing countries constitute the vast majority of ILO members and reject the link between trade and social standards.
However, the Commission is not giving up and is proposing systematically to introduce into any preferential free trade agreement negotiations a withdrawal of preferences clause in the event of non-compliance with these standards.
It is also acting positively.
For example, the Council followed its lead on 27Â June 2005 after we had proposed making new trade concessions to SriÂ Lanka, because the latter had just ratified the ILOâs eight basic conventions.
The policy is fairly clear: ban child labour in exchange for abolishing customs duties on exports to the European Union.
It is a question of making a link between multilateral trade negotiations and social standards. We cannot say what will be decided in HongÂ Kong in December, but the Commissionâs very strong attachment to this link can be pointed out right now.
If he had been able to be present in the House this morning, my colleague in charge of trade, PeterÂ Mandelson, would have certainly explained how, in Turin on 26Â May 2005, he intervened along these lines within the framework of a meeting organised jointly with the ILO.
In this area, as in others, many practical measures are possible. For example, serious thought is being given to a partnership and social dialogue structure with China where textiles are concerned.
I would return now to the European Unionâs trade policy priorities by way of replying to MrÂ Belder, among others.
Implicit in the draft resolution is the need to give priority to the Euro-Mediterranean zone, particularly in relation to Asia.
The Commission largely shares this point of view.
Developing trade between the two banks of the Mediterranean should help the development of this region and partly resolve the serious problems, such as immigration, that are common to the north and south of the area and that extend beyond the problems relating to textiles.
There are other priorities: Africa, in connection with which I would refer you to the G8, meeting today in Scotland; the Least Developed Countries; and the poor countries of Asia.
The Commission therefore agrees with MrsÂ SaÃ¯fi on this point: a number of comparative advantages need to be maintained in favour of those to whom the European Union intends to give preference.
That is why, for example, it very strongly supports putting in place the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin, which should be adopted by the Council this autumn.
I would, moreover, take this opportunity to invite Parliament to help the Commission put pressure on the Council in order to speed up the adoption of the protocols in question.
Finally, it should be noted, on the question of trade preferences, that, since this year, the European Union has withdrawn most of its trade preferences from China.
This negative priority is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the draft resolution.
MrÂ Zingaretti, in particular, referred to the trade protection measures.
If third countries subsidise their exports, there are responses available.
In fact, the European Union has a whole arsenal of responses available to it.
These include antidumping duties or anti-subsidy measures.
For example, a week ago, the Commission opened an antidumping investigation in connection with certain types of Chinese and Indian shoes. The matter was discussed.
We are not in the business of pious hopes in this House. I can assure you that these measures are taken very seriously by these two countries.
When it comes to counterfeiting, which is MrsÂ Muscardiniâs concern and one that is shared by the Commission, the European Union has made progress.
Since July 2004, a new arrangement is in force enabling companies to ask for the customs authorities to confiscate goods likely to be counterfeit.
What we have here is a unified, free and simple Community procedure, intended as it is, in part, for small textile companies representing, as one MEP rightly said, 90% of the sector.
However, does not greater efficiency demand, above all, that more be done to integrate the European customs authorities?
A Community Customs Code has existed since 1992, but it is applied by 25 national customs authorities, which are sometimes difficult to coordinate.
Fraudsters are often clever at exploiting such situations.
A lot therefore remains to be done in this area.
On the subject of intellectual property, which is a very sensitive subject in the textile sector, recent years have been characterised by a veritable explosion in statistics.
I should like to point out that Chinaâs accession to the WTO now imposes obligations upon it and also gives the European Union the option of taking more vigorous action if China does not comply with the obligations arising from its accession.
I would therefore say to the representatives of the European left, who do not want the European Union to fund relocations, that we are in complete agreement.
It must simply be pointed out that there is not a single clause along these lines in any preferential trade agreement.
I do not think it right to suggest things that are untrue or to allow them to be said.
MrÂ Rull and MrÂ Karim too spoke about the industrial restructuring of the textile sector.
I think that MrÂ Karim is right: European industry has been urgently awaiting a miracle from the Commission since the beginning of 2005 and the liberalisation of the Chinese textile sector.
It has already been said, but I should like to state emphatically that liberalisation was decided upon ten years ago, in 1994.
A number of Member States have also been able to prepare for it.
The crisis in the textile sector is not, therefore, European in nature. It affects only those Member States that are unprepared.
It must also be pointed out that industrial restructuring measures are largely the responsibility of the Member States.
In its sphere of competence, the Commission proposed to reserve a portion of the Structural Funds for those sectors undergoing industrial restructuring following crises just like that in the textile sector, a matter now being discussed by the Council.
In December 2004, the Commission â and, more specifically, Commissioner Potocnik â together with Euratex (that is to say, the European Apparel and Textile Organisation) announced an initiative known as the âEuropean Textile Technology Platformâ, one of whose purposes is to encourage technological innovation and so promote more upmarket products in the face of Chinese competition.
It is true, as MrsÂ Lucas very rightly said, that the real victims of the liberalisation of the textile sector are the poorest countries, otherwise known as the Least Developed Countries, and that is precisely because they manufacture products with little technological content, such as cotton tee-shirts.
Europe has the resources to go upmarket and to specialise in textile sectors.
I am thinking of fabrics with very high technological content, in respect of which Chinese competition is more limited.
Protection is, admittedly, necessary as a temporary measure, but innovation is surely the real solution.
I am sorry that this resolution has not been adopted from today for, on behalf of the Commission, I broadly share the approach proposed by it.
I should like to make a few more comments.
MrÂ Leichtfried and MrsÂ Toia say that these are good measures but that the Commission could have reacted more quickly.
The Commission responded in five months, after having verified that harm was indeed being caused.
Where the Chinese are concerned, there can be no question of imposing quotas lightly.
MrÂ Romagnoli, I should like to repeat what I have just said.
I challenge you to say by what precise mechanism the Commission might encourage relocations.
It is not true that it would do so.
MrsÂ Laperrouze welcomes the agreement, rightly I believe.
Regarding the High Level Group, a plan for identifying trade restrictions was presented by the Commission to the High Level Group on 14Â June.
It was presented by more than one Commissioner, namely MrÂ Mandelson and MrÂ Verheugen, and MrsÂ SaÃ¯fi was also present.
Regarding MrÂ Tajaniâs speech, in which he talked of marks of origin, the Commission is preparing a draft regulation to make such marks compulsory upon import. You must know, however, that the Member States are divided on this issue, a factor that is obviously slowing down progress on the matter.
Regarding the reciprocity mentioned in MrsÂ Lienemannâs speech, I agree, but this needs to be discussed within the WTO.
Allow me to conclude by drawing attention to two small considerations that are by no means irrelevant.
An Airbus represents 20 million Chinese shirts.
It is worth reflecting upon this and bearing in mind that trade is not a one-way affair.
Trade operates in all directions and, by focusing upon one product in particular, one can sometimes significantly lose out on another product.
That is something worth repeating.
I should also like to comment upon the highly ideological charge I heard made against liberal Europe, about which so many bad things are said.
I just want to point out that it is liberal Europe that has made peace possible and that has led to the wealth that has been created no doubt being better distributed and shared out here in Europe than anywhere else.
Collectivist or Marxist Europe, about which some people are clearly nostalgic, certainly cannot, in my view, offer the same track record as what is known as liberal Europe.
As for trade union freedom, which was talked about in the same breath, it is guaranteed everywhere in the liberal states.
I have not yet seen it genuinely guaranteed in totalitarian states, even left-wing ones.
I say this simply because of my own liberal affiliations and because, from time to time, it is worth repeating.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in September.
Â Â  Â Â Â In view of the inroads China is making into the EU market, this report is too little, too late.
The future of 170Â 000Â companies and 2.5Â millionÂ workers in Europe is at stake, as well as a market worth EURÂ 185Â billion.
One need look no further than the US for a good example of how not to take decisions on this matter. Within two years of quotas being lifted in 2002, China had gained a 65% market share in the country.
The Chinese problem consists not only in cheap clothing imports, but also in unfair practices such as state subsidies, tax breaks, land distribution and subsidised energy and transport.
If we wish to stop China in its tracks and to keep jobs in Europe, we should convene an extraordinary WTO session to discuss how we can prevent global trade being dominated by a single supplier.
At the same time, we should launch the emergency procedure provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clauses, and set up a new programme to secure funding for regions where the sector provides jobs for workers who would otherwise be unemployed, and ensures that women are not forced into inferior jobs.
We should make funding available for restructuring under the new Financial Perspective, and for new solutions and the implementation of research results in the SME sector under the Seventh Framework Programme.
EU policies should be targeted at modernising industry, as otherwise the Electronic Proposal Tool will never be anything but a dead duck.
The governments of heavily industrialised Member States should be granted derogations from the ban on subsidies, and an impact assessment must be carried out for REACH in order to ensure that it does not act as a brake on the competitiveness of European industry.
A consolidated market should be set up under the EU-Mediterranean agreements, and a similar platform should be established in the Baltic region.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Duarte Freitas, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union [COM(2004)0687 â C6-0201/2004 â 2004/0247(CNS)] (A6-0195/2005).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, particularly its draftsman, MrÂ Freitas, together with the members and draftsmen of the Committees on Budgets, International Trade and Regional Development, for all the work they have done on this report.
On 28Â JuneÂ 2001, the Council adopted a reform of the agricultural support scheme in the outermost regions of the Union.
These measures go back to 1991 and 1992, and they have proved their effectiveness in promoting agriculture and the supply of these regions with agricultural products.
Managing them has, however, posed a number of problems.
The two strands of the Posei scheme, which constitutes the specific arrangements for supplying and supporting local producers, are characterised by administrative inflexibility.
With regard to the specific supply arrangements, the Commission is required to legislate for what are often only modest variations in the quantities of products to be supplied in the outermost regions.
This is not an efficient administrative framework.
The support schemes for local production comprise a range of as many as 56 micro-measures laid down by Council regulations.
It is not possible to adapt these measures without interinstitutional legislative procedures, a state of affairs that prevents any rapid response by the Community when it comes to adapting the support measures to specific situations.
That is why the Commission proposes a change in philosophy regarding both the aid given to these regions and the adoption of a participatory method of decision-making.
The new system would also allow the measures to be adapted quickly, taking account of the specific features of these regions.
The draft regulation envisages the presentation of one programme for each outermost region in the Member States concerned.
These programmes will comprise two sections: one on the specific supply arrangements for agricultural products â agricultural inputs or products designed for transformation â which are essential in terms of human consumption in the outermost region concerned, and another section on support for local production.
With regard to financing, the regulation affects neither the sources of financing nor the level of Community support.
The Community will finance the programme under the EAGGF Guarantee Section up to 100% within the limits of an annual ceiling laid down by the Council regulation.
A part of this support will be compulsorily reserved for support for local agricultural production.
The amounts are calculated on the basis of the average of the amounts spent on financing the specific supply arrangements during the reference period 2001 â 2003 and on the basis of the ceilings for expenditure applicable to support for local production.
A portion of the subsidised amounts will be integrated into the direct payments under RegulationÂ 1782/2003.
They are among the ceilings to be found in Annex 8 of this regulation.
I turn now to the reform of the sugar arrangements and to the outermost regions.
Although they do not form part of the Commission proposal, I should like to make a number of comments concerning the reform of the sugar arrangements and the outermost regions.
The Commission is well aware that the characteristics of sugar production in the outermost regions of the Community are appreciably different to what they are in the other regions.
That is why financial support should be given to this sector through the granting of subsidies to farmers in the outermost regions.
The restructuring arrangements will be financed through the deduction of a specific amount from all the quotas applicable to sweeteners.
The sugar companies in the outermost regions will not fall under these arrangements.
These regions will thus be placed on an equal footing with the ACP countries in terms of price.
This is an approach considered reasonable by the Commission.
What is more, the French outermost regions, which were the only ones to benefit from support to outlets, will receive an additional amount of EURÂ 15Â million corresponding to current outlet measures in respect of the reference period.
The direct payment in favour of the outermost regions will be included within the single framework of the Posei programme which we are debating and, as a consequence, excluded from the single payment arrangements.
The French and Portuguese outermost regions have benefited in the same way as the other Member States from the same increase in the amount of their direct payments, corresponding to the reduction in additional prices.
In the case of the French outermost regions, the amount increases from EURÂ 39Â million to EURÂ 44Â million and, in the case of the Portuguese outermost regions, to just over EURÂ 1Â million.
I now come to the Commissionâs position concerning the amendments.
In view of what I have just said, the Commission is able to accept AmendmentsÂ 1, 8, 9, 18, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 32 and is able in part to accept AmendmentÂ 35.
Unfortunately, the Commission does not wish, and is not in a position, to accept the other amendments proposed.
Â Â  . âThe archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, and the French overseas departments, are referred to as the EUâs outermost regions and are characterised by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate and economic dependence on a few products.
This concept of outermost regions was introduced into the EUâs primary law in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, and constitutes the legal basis for the Council to adopt specific measures applicable to the outermost regions, acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting Parliament.
As the Commissioner mentioned, agricultural programmes specifically designed to offset the problems faced by the outermost regions have been in place since 1991 and 1992.
These programmes have encompassed two types of measure: firstly, specific supply arrangements, to support the supply to these regions of agricultural products destined for human and animal consumption, processing in local industries and agricultural inputs; and secondly, support for local agricultural production.
These measures have had a considerable impact and have had a positive influence on reviving the economies of the outermost regions.
As has also been mentioned, however, experience over the years has shown that greater flexibility is needed in the management of these two schemes.
The proposal currently before us maintains the previous programmes, but proposes a radical change of philosophy, whereby the management of programmes is made easier and the decision-making process is brought closer to those principally affected, namely the regions themselves, whilst at the same time maintaining the level of support granted in the past.
The Commissionâs intention to decentralise decision making and simplify the management arrangements is to be welcomed, as is the approach based on encouraging participation in decision making and speeding up the implementation of measures responding to their specific needs.
I therefore broadly agree with the Commissionâs proposal.
There are some issues, however, that should be improved upon, and to this end some amendments have been adopted that form part of my report.
Firstly, I feel that, given that there are no export refunds, no restrictions should be placed on the possibility of exporting or re-dispatching processed products that have received support under the specific supply arrangements.
This is because production and the market in the outermost regions are often too small to guarantee the sustainability of local processing industries, which are essential for the survival of some agricultural crops and for a degree of diversification.
Consequently, in some cases these industries need to complement their supplies with raw materials from outside and to export or dispatch their products to ensure their viability.
I must also express my satisfaction with the measures announced by the Commission for the outermost regions in the proposed reform of the sugar common market organisation.
Yet there is one specific question that this does not resolve.
I refer to beet production in the Azores, involving the Sinaga company, which will have no chance of survival, either under the regulation currently in force or with the Commissionâs proposal.
Secondly, given the time limits laid down in the draft regulation for the submission of programmes and for their approval, I feel that the date scheduled for their application needs to be made more flexible, in order to remove the risk that the current regulation will be revoked before the programmes arising from the new legislation can enter into force.
Thirdly, I also wish to stress the importance of introducing the possibility of granting derogations for the outermost regions in the area of rural development, taking account of the specific features and vulnerable parts of this area, thereby providing continuity for the current regime.
Fourthly, as regards the basis for defining the financial ceilings, I feel that the reference period of 2001 to 2003 is inappropriate for defining the amount of funding, as this takes no account of the impact of changes made under the 2001 reform.
My report therefore suggests that, in the calculation of financial ceilings, account should also be taken of exemptions granted under the specific supply arrangements.
As well as representing a fairer deal for the outermost regions, this approach does not inflate the amounts involved in support currently granted to those regions.
Lastly, I should like to congratulate my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support that they have given me and, in particular, the Members from the outermost regions, who have worked very hard on this process.
I should also like to thank the politicians and the representatives of the socio-economic sectors of these regions for their dedication and support while I was drawing up this report.
Commissioner, I wish to point out that this report was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I trust that Parliament will take this into account when it gives its final opinion on this issue as expressed via the vote.
I trust that the Commission will appreciate the enormous importance of this issue to the outermost regions, and I naturally ask the Members of this House to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  . â I should like to congratulate Mr Freitas and all of the (many) Members from the outermost regions and elsewhere involved in drawing up this report.
I wish to tell the Commission that over the course of recent years we have already managed to achieve some positive results, by improving the provisions of this regulation on issues such as the aromatic wine known as and dairy quotas specific to the Azores; indeed, we have also been successful in blocking the Portuguese Government from transferring those quotas to the mainland.
We already have the beginnings of an agreement on the extremely tricky issue of sugar beet and sugar cane refining in the Azores, to which the rapporteur referred.
That being said, I wish to draw the Commissionâs attention to the problem that Article 4 bans âprocessed productsâ in some language versions, and âproducts incorporating products imported under this schemeâ in other language versions.
This issue is dealt with extremely badly in the Commissionâs proposal; it may be highly technical, but it is also of major importance.
I call on the Commission to do what it has done in other areas: to channel all its efforts into addressing this problem, to listen to what we have to say and to see what this may mean on the ground in these outermost regions.
With this kind of attitude, we can achieve a positive outcome on this issue, too.
Lastly, I wish to offer a special word of thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, who supported the vitally important strengthening of this programme.
The Committee on Budgets does not always act in this manner, but this does illustrate the committeeâs great concern with the interests of the outermost regions.
Thank you to everyone, and let us hope that the final hurdles can be overcome.
Â Â  . â I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Freitas on his outstanding report, and in particular on his dedication and his preparedness to accept amendments and suggestions from other committees â from all committees, in fact â not least those of the Committee on Regional Development, for which I was the draftsman.
I also commend him on the way in which he accepted suggestions from all Members from the outermost regions, who strove hard to resolve this problem that affects everyone.
Although the Commissionâs draft regulation is to be welcomed, some amendments were needed in order to ensure the continued effectiveness of a scheme that has made a considerable contribution towards regional development, from the point of view of the citizens, businesses and, especially, agri-food undertakings.
Of the suggestions and amendments that we tabled, I shall mention only the most relevant ones.
The first of these concerns the annual amounts of funding to support measures for agriculture in the outermost regions.
We share the rapporteurâs view that the 2001-2003 calculation submitted in the Commissionâs proposal was inappropriate, given that 2001 was a transitional year in which the POSEI agriculture programmes were reformed, and that those reforms only came into effect in 2002.
We therefore suggest that a three-year reference period of 2001 to 2004 would be more suitable.
The second aspect concerns exemption from customs duties.
It makes no sense for the Commissionâs proposal to ignore this substantial gain for the outermost regions, hence the suggestion that the amounts granted in the three-year reference period be taken into account in setting the future ceiling.
The third aspect is that of exports.
We share the belief that, in order to satisfy what the Commission said in its statement, we should look into the possibility of creating a regional integration area, we should support the rural world in these regions and, to this end, we should pave the way for independent exports of processed products and imported products under the special supply arrangements to third countries, neighbouring countries of course, or to the rest of the Community.
I have no doubt that this will solve the problems of various agri-food companies in all regions, but especially the sugar beet production industry in the Azores, as has been mentioned previously.
In the light of these aspects, I hope that the Commission will take on board the opinion not only of these Members, but of Parliament as a whole.
Â Â  . âI should first like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his outstanding report on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions.
I share and support the rapporteurâs positions, in particular those concerned with making the management of support schemes for agriculture in the outermost regions more flexible and with the prime objective of adopting a decentralised approach that encourages participation and that ensures that the measures in force are, where necessary, implemented swiftly.
In the context of this philosophy, the Member States are now planning to submit to the Commission one programme per outermost region, which will cover the two strands of the Posei agriculture schemes â the specific supply arrangements and the support scheme for local production.
Each programme will contain a description of the current agricultural situation, its weaknesses and potential, the proposed strategy, the expected impact and a timetable of implementation.
This will enable each outermost region to define its own agriculture development strategy to cater to its specific needs.
Accordingly, due account can finally be taken of the double insularity faced by producers and operators on some islands that form part of certain outermost regions.
I also wish to highlight the rapporteurâs suggestions as regards developing an effective policy to help small- and medium-sized enterprises in the agri-food sector of the outermost regions.
This measure has had a positive effect on the agriculture sector, on jobs and on trade.
I cannot finish without mentioning a good example of the implementation of the concept of outermost region enshrined in Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
The agricultural and supply policies provide for special treatment tailored to the specific reality of each outermost region, and this special treatment has been improved upon and strengthened in the light of experience gained with the implementation of the Posei schemes.
This certainly sets an example that ought to be followed when adapting the remaining common EU policies to the specific characteristics of the outermost regions.
Â Â  . â I offer warm greetings to you, Mr President, and to all of the Members of this House, on my behalf and on behalf of my fellow Socialist Member of Parliament and friend, Mr Capoulas Santos.
In light of the specific features of the outermost regions, such as remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult climate and economic dependence on a few products, all of which combined have a detrimental effect on their development, these regions rightly enjoy special protection, which is enshrined in Article 299 of the Treaty.
This protection is, moreover, the result of successive decisions by Parliament, the proceedings of the Seville European Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and the conclusions of the third report on economic and social cohesion.
Accordingly, it must, as a matter of urgent priority, be translated fully into practical reality.
The Commission issued a timely communication aimed at establishing a stronger partnership for the outermost regions entitled âa stronger partnershipâ, which deserves a favourable response.
The report before us â on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions â forms part of the process of implementing that strategy.
The agriculture sector is hugely important to these regions, and this report represents substantial and noteworthy progress in this regard.
Nevertheless, the initiative can and must be improved considerably, and this report by Mr Freitas can play a substantial role in achieving such an improvement.
I wish to congratulate Mr Freitas on his dedication and positive attitude during the process of drawing up the report, and those congratulations are extended to all of those Members who were actively involved and who made relevant contributions towards finding appropriate solutions to the specific characteristics of each region.
Special mention, in this connection, goes to the draftsmen Mr Casaca of the Committee on Budgets, MrÂ Jardim Fernandes of the Committee on Regional Development and Mr Assis of the Committee on International Trade.
Although the proposal for a regulation before us does not provide for changing the sources of funding or the pace of support, it will, however, introduce greater flexibility in implementing different measures and better adaptation to the specific features of each outermost region.
This will be achieved by means of stepping up participation in the decision-making process, which is a positive step and one that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports.
The Commissionâs proposal suffers, however, from shortcomings and gaps on a number of aspects.
We now have the opportunity to plug those gaps, on the platform of the broad consensus that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development managed to attract through the proposals it adopted, not to mention the opinions adopted by other committees.
We therefore have ample reason to call on Members from all sides of this House to use their vote on the relevant amendments that have been tabled to express their solidarity with some of the more problematic regions of the EU.
After all, we want to see the Union become more economically and socially cohesive.
We also call on the Commission to welcome the most relevant proposals adopted in this House and we feel sure that both it and Parliament will be equal to the task of meeting the legitimate expectations of the people and authorities of the outermost regions.
Today we have seen a degree of openness on the part of Mr Michel; time will tell if there is more to come in the future.
This is the only way in which the objectives which were clearly and objectively set out in the preamble to the Councilâs proposal for a regulation under discussion and which we fully endorse can be achieved more satisfactorily and more quickly.
What we really need is to work towards strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Freitas on his balanced report.
The outermost regions of the European Union suffer from geographical, climatic and economic conditions that are adverse in comparison with those prevailing in the others, a situation the particularities of which the EU has acknowledged and, indeed, mentioned in Article 299(2) of the European Communities Treaty.
It is therefore the EUâs business to ensure that its more distant regions can share in the development of the whole.
As agriculture is an important means of support for the economies of the outermost regions, I welcome the Commissionâs proposal for a Council regulation on special measures for it.
Measures of this kind, formerly provided by programmes going as far back as 1991, are now indispensable to the outermost regionsâ development, ensuring on the one hand that these can be supplied with the agricultural products they need for life, while also, on the other, promoting the local production, marketing and processing of such products.
By providing for decentralisation and simplified management tools, the Commission proposal ensures a more flexible approach to the EUâs outermost regions, and this is something that I very much welcome, believing as I do that the best solutions to problems are, as a rule, to be found locally, where there is most knowledge of a given regionâs particular circumstances.
This is the only way in which we will, in the long term, be able to make the outermost regions more competitive, enabling them to make up for lost time and catch up with the rest of the EU, for suspending, on a permanent basis, the rules of the internal market or using money from the Structural Funds cannot be sustainable solutions in the long term.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I speak as a representative of a new Member State where the agricultural sector is crucial to the existence of many citizens, and where the lack of adequate subsidies for farmers has had a severe impact.
I am therefore delighted that this particular Community initiative has been launched, with the aim of supporting agriculture in regions that are geographically remote and that have only limited access to the common market.
The most interesting aspects of this report would appear to be the concern that crops which have traditionally been grown in a certain area, and which are characteristic of that area, should continue to be cultivated, and be exported throughout the EU with a special EU.
The EU should provide particular support to local and non-industrial manufacturing processes, since the products of such processes have a better taste and flavour.
As I see it, enabling cheaper exports to neighbouring third countries would also be one way in which we could provide appropriate assistance to outermost regions.
This idea would merit consideration by the Community as a whole, including the new Member States, which have long-standing ties with their non-EU neighbours.
This would solve the problems we face with regard to the poor eastern regions of the EU, which are located in Poland and elsewhere and which share borders with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.
The economies of these Member States have suffered as a result of the restrictions imposed on trade with those countries.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the effectiveness of the Posei programmes has been proven and recognised by the European Commission, the latter considered, only two years after the last reform was implemented, that a change was needed to the ways in which the specific supply arrangements and the support for local lines of production in the outermost regions were managed.
The European Commission has, however, committed itself to ensuring that the proposed reform will not bring into question either the timeliness of the measures or the way in which they operate and will not affect either the sources of financing or the level of Community support.
The fact is that certain conditions laid down by the draft regulation imply more complex evaluation procedures, programming, monitoring and control for the beneficiaries than does the present framework.
Moreover, the budget proposed for the specific supply arrangements, calculated on the basis of unduly strict historical references, would, contrary to the Commissionâs promises, amount in reality to restricting the level of Community support and be in danger of curbing the development of the industrial sectors concerned, whereas if the Poseidom were not subject to any change until the end of 2006, the specific supply arrangements would continue to progress at their present rate and would therefore increase substantially.
Everyone is now agreed in recognising that, without the Poseidom, it would be impossible for the diversification sectors in the overseas departments to develop.
Implementing different arrangements now would be tantamount to saying that all the efforts made to date, by both the European Union and local farmers, have been to no avail.
The excellent report prepared by MrÂ Freitas achieves a balanced compromise between the need for reform and the preservation of a system of support for sustainable agriculture on the farms of small economic size of the outermost regions.
I sincerely hope that the Commission and, above all, the Council will be very much inspired by Parliamentâs opinion and avoid even partially bringing the current support measures into question.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Freitas for the work he has done as rapporteur, which I believe to be very satisfactory.
I would also like to thank our Unionâs Commission for the work it is doing in favour of the outermost regions.
I believe that Mr Michel has said it very clearly.
This is a success story: over the last 14 or 15 years, the outermost regions have benefited from special treatment via these programmes â Poseidon, Poseima and Poseican â which have allowed four million citizens, living on islands spread throughout the world â in the Central Atlantic, in the Caribbean and in the Indian Ocean â to have a decent way of life that is consistent with their needs.
The programmes have also enabled certain regions whose people previously left those regionsâ shores now to maintain their populations and, in some cases, even to bring new people in.
In short, there has been a clear improvement in the living conditions in these regions.
This has been achieved by means of a very reasonable procedure, which consists, on the one hand, of allowing agricultural surpluses from the rest of the Unionâs territories to enter our territory and also enabling other parts of the world to import products. On the other hand, it prevents those imports that are necessary for maintaining living conditions from destroying agriculture and other elements of the local economy.
The proposal now being presented to us by the Commission is intended to make the system we had more flexible.
As the Commissioner has said, it was necessary to adopt 56 micromeasures that were not in reality in line with the importance of this type of organisation.
The amendments being presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are aimed at making the mechanism more flexible and must also be accepted.
I would like to point out â perhaps for those people who are not aware of the situation â that what justifies this special treatment and this flexibility for the outermost regions is their complete inability to compete within the Unionâs markets.
In other words, the aid to the farmers of the Canary Islands, La RÃ©union, Madeira or the Azores is in no way going to prejudice the rest of the European Union, since the competition conditions are the same.
On the contrary, I would say that these regions are going to facilitate the development of the economy in the rest of the Union, since they will have markets with a degree of purchasing power that benefit the whole of the European Union.
I therefore hope that this House will approve the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a large majority and that these measures will continue to function to our benefit and to the benefit of the rest of the European Unionâs territory.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for his work.
There is a need for special measures to be taken in all the European Unionâs policy areas, particularly, of course in agriculture, and especially in its outermost regions.
I myself am from a region, Lower Austriaâs , which was for decades on the fringes of Western Europe and of the free world, and it too had to contend with some similar problems, such as problematic topography and climate, inadequate resources, a small and regional market and a scarcity of jobs.
The Member State in question has been helped by support programmes from the European Union to build up innovative and self-supporting agriculture and to create jobs.
Solidarity in real life is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union.
It is unfortunate that several Heads of State do not see that so clearly, particularly as regards the common agricultural policy.
Following on from what the Council resolved at its summits in Brussels and Luxembourg, productive agriculture must be possible throughout the EU, in every region and location.
At the end of the day, it is the disadvantaged regions that need agriculture to help bring people employment and prosperity.
More than that, the support measures we are discussing today enable our model of multifunctional and sustainable agriculture to function as an example to those in all the parts of the EU that are far from the continent.
In many states adjoining the regions in question â and here I am particularly thinking of South America â an agricultural industry comparable to that in the USA is in the process of being developed.
We are now being presented with an opportunity to create a sustainable economy by other means â the right ones in economic, environmental and social terms.
Â Â  Mr President, we are discussing a regulation today which may go unnoticed amongst the serious problems facing the Union at the moment but which, for the agricultural sectors of the outermost regions, is of fundamental importance and which in many cases is a matter of survival.
I would essentially like to stress two aspects of the draft we are discussing today: firstly, the maintenance of the funding, which was approved in the last reform in 2001 and which, given the current situation, is no small issue; and, secondly, the decentralisation of management that gives local authorities the power to introduce the necessary flexibility in accordance with the needs of the agricultural sectors at any given moment.
In other words, there is no intention to make changes in terms of the level of the aid, but it is intended to create a more flexible instrument in the field of management, as indicated by Mr Duarte Freitas in his Amendments 4 and 21.
The rapporteurâs Amendment 27 intends to give legal coverage for imports of C sugar in certain outermost regions, particularly in the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira; there are certainly obstacles here, but I hope that the Commission can analyse the matter and take it into account in order to find the most appropriate solution.
In his speech, Commissioner Michel made an ambiguously politically-correct reference to the management of the specific supply arrangements for the islands â I am referring in particular to the Canary Islands.
Believe me, Mr Michel, the people of the Canary Islands would like both the local authorities and the services of the Commission to guarantee the greatest possible transparency in the management of the SSA, of the specific supply arrangements for the islands.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to the debate.
Allow me to reply to a number of important points raised.
Firstly, I wish to reaffirm that the main purpose of this fundamental change is to give the Member States greater flexibility, which should enable them better to take into account the needs of the outermost regions.
Regarding the reference period â and I would refer in this connection to MrÂ Freitasâ and MrÂ Fernandesâ speeches â a number of you are demanding a flexible period for calculating the financial ceilings applicable to the specific supply arrangements.
I think I am able to state that the Commission has made substantial efforts to ensure that the new support arrangements are favourable to the outermost regions.
It has to be said that adopting the proposed reference periods would lead to a considerable increase in expenditure.
The proposal constitutes a package. One cannot single out the more agreeable provisions and ask for those deemed less favourable to be reexamined.
I would take the liberty of drawing your attention to this feature of my reply.
The funding has been calculated on a basis favourable to these regions, particular account having been taken not of the historical figures but of the ceilings laid down for support for local production.
The Commission is not inclined to modify its proposal concerning these financial ceilings.
With regard to limiting the specific supply arrangements to agricultural products â a matter addressed by both MrÂ Freitas and MrÂ Casaca â the Commission also wishes to provide a clearer framework for the Posei measures.
That is why the new arrangements concern only agricultural products, listed in Annex I of the treaty.
The unsatisfactory situations that applied in the past when it came to administering the Posei measures need to be brought to an end. The Commission proposes transitional periods that should enable the various sectors to adapt to the new situation.
The case of the Azores and Sinaga has also been mentioned.
Raised by MrÂ Freitas and MrÂ Fernandes, the matter concerns the problems specific to the Azores and, in particular, to the Sinaga sugar refinery.
The Councilâs draft regulation does not include new provisions concerning exports and shipments of products that have benefited from the specific supply arrangements.
Since 1992, the Commission has been applying the same criteria to all the outermost regions, that is to say the average for the trade flows during the period 1989â1991.
This approach was confirmed by the European Court of Justice in the Sinaga case.
This needs to be pointed out.
The opportunities for financial support for sugar production in the Azores have been considerably increased in the Councilâs draft regulation.
The proposal provides for funding calculated, where support for local production is concerned, on the proportion of the development potential for sugar production within the framework of the production quotas: almost EURÂ 4Â million per year, instead of the current effective production of EURÂ 400Â million per year.
On the basis of this generous funding and within the framework of the broad margin of flexibility left to the Member States in choosing sectors to subsidise, it is for the national authorities to decide, if they so wish, to increase support for sugar production and the specific sugar refinery, following consultation with all the interested parties.
The Commission is convinced that these new rules will improve the supervision of these arrangements, first and foremost in the interests specifically of the outermost regions.
Â Â  â This is just to inform Mr Michel that he is very much mistaken as regards the ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which referred the decision on this case to the Portuguese judicial system.
I will be delighted to avail him of the relevant judgment of the Portuguese Supreme Court, which says exactly the opposite of what the Commission continues to allege.
It thus appears that the Commission is unaware of the reason of justice, which is absolutely clear and unequivocal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Â Â  â The Commission is seeking to amend Regulation 1453/2001, putting into practice the principles underpinning the reform of these specific support schemes for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union.
I welcome the proposed decentralisation, which grants greater responsibilities to regional representatives, given that the specific interests of each region must be catered for, taking account of different dates of accession and significantly increasing the amounts provided for.
2001 to 2003 cannot be an acceptable reference period, because 2001 was a transitional year.
The system of limiting exports of products under the specific supply arrangements to third countries and dispatch to the rest of the Community has served to choke the local agri-food industry.
This happened with Azores sugar, the production of which must be made viable, and the same is true of other livestock and food produced using local traditional methods.
Accordingly, the system must be changed.
As regards the specific supply arrangements, particular attention should be paid to Madeira vineyards and bananas, to Azores milk and to the special measures designed to help farmers buy agricultural fertilisers and pesticides.
I therefore support the report.
Â Â  Â Â Â Todayâs debate on support for agriculture in the outermost regions of the EU is a prime example of the two different common agricultural policies that are implemented.
One is applied to the old EU Member States, and another to the new Member States.
There can be no question that farmers living in the outermost regions of the EU suffer financial difficulties.
At the same time, however, the 3.6Â million farmers living in the new Member States face even greater problems.
Farmers in the outermost regions have already enjoyed the full benefits of the common agricultural policy for many years, whereas the EU has graciously âallowedâ farmers in the new Member States to receive shockingly low direct payments, thus depriving them of the chance to achieve the levels of farmers in the old Member States.
The decisions taken in this connection were not based on any economic or social grounds, and most certainly not on any ethical grounds.
They do, however, pose serious threats to Europeâs food security and to the stability of the agri-food market in the European Union, as well as acting as a breeding-ground for dangerous social tensions.
Farmers from the new Member States are still being discriminated against.
The arguments and expert opinions that have been put forward have proved meaningless for the EU authorities, as has the anticipated level of funding.
One need only be a farmer in aÂ new Member State to be deprived of any chance of obtaining support, no matter how justified such support would be.
The pretext used is non-compliance with the countless conditions imposed by Brussels.
We should put a stop to this discrimination, and we should begin this task today, by refusing to consent to the minor issue of support for the outermost regions of the EU.
By doing so, we would send out a warning to the enemies of a common Europe based on solidarity, and let them know that only those who have previously acted in solidarity can later rely on solidarity themselves.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions concerning Zimbabwe(1).
Â Â  MrÂ President, the situation in Zimbabwe is going from bad to worse now.
The latest piece of brutality, known as Operation Drive Out Rubbish, involves knocking down whole areas of cities.
The UN estimates that more than 200Â 000 people are without roofs over their heads, and many of them are in danger of dying of cold now.
The violent and systematic persecution of Mugabeâs critics is developing into a humanitarian disaster.
According to the BBC, Methodist bishops have warned of genocide in the last day or two.
The responses from the surrounding world are still too feeble, and the sanctions adopted are scarcely being implemented properly.
The worst thing, however, is that the SADC countries, and South Africa in particular, are still protecting Mugabe and accepting the huge sufferings he is inflicting upon his people.
All this was aired recently in the hearing in the Committee on Development, but there were also proposals about what might be done.
First and foremost, the EU must put far greater pressure on both the UN and the SADC, especially South Africa, and so at long last comply with the responsibility it has by virtue of its own strength.
Over and above that, it can, in entirely practical terms, increase its support for civil society both within and outside Zimbabwe with a view to developing a human rights culture and producing more documentation about human rights violations.
It can increase support for the victims of torture and of organised violence both in Zimbabwe and in exile and it can provide proper legal aid in connection with obviously unjustified legal proceedings brought against human rights campaigners and those who support, or are believed to support, the opposition.
There can be support for a free press, with news sent from Britain and neighbouring countries, partly in the form of newspapers published there.
All this will cost a lot of money, however.
In short, we are pleased about the resolution, but we should like to take the opportunity to emphasise these practical opportunities for offering help, and we hope that the Commission will look sympathetically at them.
Â Â  Mr President, as masses of people demonstrate about the situation in Africa, the G8 leaders are meeting in Scotland.
It is most apt that we should have a resolution on Zimbabwe.
âOperation Drive Out Rubbishâ: that is what Robert Mugabe calls his latest atrocity.
His government has been responsible for destroying the homes and livelihoods of as many as 1.5 million Zimbabweans.
That number will rise if we do not take the necessary action.
Just last week a pregnant woman and a four-year-old child were killed during the mass eviction of 10Â 000 people from the outskirts of Harare.
Imagine the pain and suffering, watching helplessly as your home is bulldozed, then to have no knowledge of where you are being taken.
In spite of Amnesty Internationalâs urgent appeal to exert pressure on the Mugabe regime, the African Union last week still refused to condemn President Mugabe.
The people of Zimbabwe are victims of a human rights catastrophe.
Human rights abuses can never be just an internal matter for a country.
It is up to us all to raise our voices in protest and it is even more important that Zimbabweâs neighbours condemn the atrocities.
However, we should not just raise our voices and then carry on as usual.
That is why the return of asylum seekers to Zimbabwe should be halted now.
Otherwise EU governments like the UK Government can quite rightly be accused of gross hypocrisy.
Â Â  . Mr President, in expressing its concerns about Zimbabwe, my group is not primarily thinking of the white farmers who became rich during colonial times, but of the large, black, majority who still have much lower incomes.
President Mugabe played a major role in the fight for independence, both against colonialism and Ian Smithâs white minority regime.
During and after that struggle, he always presented himself as the hero of the black majority. In practice, for many years, he did far too little to improve their lot.
He seemed to have become a moderate ruler, radical only in his aversion to homosexuality.
He was hardly recognisable as the former leader of the fight for an independence that gave the poor hope for a much-changed society, one that would make equality for all people its key priority.
Only long after he came into power did he become very radical, particularly towards anyone who threatens, or could threaten, his absolute rule.
The political opposition, the rich farmers, the poor slums and the market traders became in turn the victims of his activities aimed at intimidating and destroying them.
In a previous debate on Zimbabwe, on 16 December 2004, I expressed the assumption that Mugabe had started campaigns of this kind in order to make up for his loss of popularity, trying, through his unexpectedly decisive action, to acquire and mobilise new followers.
We now see that his approach can no longer be attributed to clever tactics but rather to the behaviour of someone who is losing his mind.
Instead of providing better housing for the poor, he is driving them away from the cities by demolishing their dwellings.
In this, he is starting to show much likeness to the demented regime that Pol Pot sought to introduce in Cambodia 30 years ago.
My group finds it regrettable that this resolution levels exhaustive criticism at Zimbabweâs neighbour, South Africa, and the African Union, while no attempt is being made to help them solve the problems.
As long as Europe gives Africans cause to see it as the coloniser that it once was, we will lack the moral authority to be able to contribute to improvement.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing, as a British MEP, my deep sorrow at the news of the explosions in London.
While a clear picture has yet to emerge, it certainly has all the trappings of a coordinated terrorist attack.
Yet again we are reminded of the fragility of our world order and the need to work together to eradicate such barbaric, mindless acts.
Freedom and democracy are the fundamental tenets of the Union.
Just as we continue to espouse these principles within the Union, we need to translate this commitment into tangible actions against regimes that are diametrically opposed to such freedoms.
That is why I am lending my wholehearted support to the resolution on Zimbabwe.
It is not sufficient for the international community to indulge in the occasional ritual condemnation of President Mugabe; rather, we need to see a strong and viable opposition to him.
If we are truly proponents of a free society, then how can we continue to stand by and allow this dictatorial oppression to continue unabated?
Why, as a Union, have we not levied increased pressure against the regime?
Why have we not tightened and enforced sanctions?
Why has the Council refused to respond to Parliamentâs consistent calls in this respect?
Furthermore, it is a great disappointment that South Africa and a number of Zimbabweâs other neighbours have chosen not to intervene in the plight of the Zimbabwean people.
We have witnessed the entire resources of a once wealthy state enslaved.
We have seen their people denied their intrinsic human rights, and yet this oppression and destruction has elicited little response from their neighbours.
I would suggest to President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa that his choice not to criticise President Mugabe is a very disturbing indictment on his views of what constitutes a fair, free and open society.
At a time when the international community is galvanised to address the endemic problems that Africa faces, it is only appropriate that we look beyond poverty relief to the maintenance of good governance, transparency, the rule of law and respect for human rights for all African countries.
I therefore call upon this Parliament to support this resolution wholeheartedly.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I first of all express my utter condemnation and disgust concerning the terrorist attacks on London today in which, according to the latest reports, over 40 people have been murdered and many hundreds injured.
I extend my deepest sympathy to the victims and their families.
The people of Zimbabwe live under a different sort of terrorism.
It is unremitting and comes from the hands of the very authorities that should protect them â the government, the police, the army.
The situation there is desperate and deteriorating.
Since fixing the election in March, Mugabe has now deliberately destroyed the homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of the poorest Zimbabweans, while millions more continue to rely on international food aid for their survival.
What does it take before the world responds to this catastrophe?
Africa is at the top of the agendas of todayâs meeting of G8 leaders at Gleneagles and of the UK Presidency of the EU.
The focus on Africa is bolstered by the massive wave of popular support for Bob Geldofâs Live 8.
All recognise the need for improved aid, debt relief and fair trade. They also all acknowledge that, without good governance, much of the value of such assistance will be destroyed.
The attitude of African governments to Zimbabwe is a true test of their commitment to such good governance, yet South Africa, the key to bringing about change in Zimbabwe, continues its quiet complicity with Mugabeâs oppression.
I have asked the British Foreign Secretary and President-in-Office of the Council, Jack Straw, to urge President Mbeki, who is at Gleneagles today, to condemn Mugabe and to use every means at his disposal to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe.
Opposition leaders from southern African countries know what needs to be done.
I have spoken to some of them here today in this Parliament, but their governments must be empowered to act and the EU itself must get serious.
The Council and Commission must have a fresh determination to get a result.
It should no longer tolerate excuses for evasion of its sanctions and those sanctions must be toughened and extended.
And they must ask themselves: what specific additional action should we be taking?
This Parliament will give them some advice in its resolution today, and I hope they will take notice.
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me first of all to express, specifically to the British Members of this House, my deepest sympathy with the victims of the horrific events in London.
I will now turn to Zimbabwe.
More than ever, Mugabe seems to be turning into Africaâs Pol Pot.
These may be big words, but I read them several times when I leafed through Zimbabwean documents yesterday and the tragedy unfolded there before my very eyes.
With his indefensible âOperation Drive Out Rubbishâ, Mugabe is destroying thousands of shelters in the poor suburbs.
All and sundry are being driven into the wintry cold, desperate and not knowing where to go.
Many of those driven away voted for the opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, during the elections in March.
What are the reactions on the international stage?
Neighbouring South Africa claims to be applying tacit diplomacy, but it is so tacit that it is not even being heard in Zimbabwe.
The members of the African Union, who met in the Libyan city of Sirte, did not feel it incumbent upon themselves to condemn Mugabeâs regime either. Their excuse is that they do not want to interfere in domestic affairs.
The Commission, represented by its President, Mr Barroso, takes the view that we do not need to teach Africa any lessons.
The Council seems to appreciate the seriousness of the situation but does little to bring about any real improvement.
Together with the United Kingdom and backed by Greece and Denmark, the United States broached the subject of the crisis in the UN Security Council.
If the United Nations really wants to do the great things to which it aspires, this is a situation in which it should do them, but sending Anna Tibaijuka, Kofi Annanâs special envoy, to that country will not be enough.
The world has been watching from the sidelines for far too long, while the dictator Mugabe has gone about his business unpunished, becoming more insolent in the process.
At the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in Scotland, poverty was at the top of the agenda.
We clearly expect more than the token appeal on the part of the G8 ministers on 23 June to Harare to adhere to the rule of law and respect human rights; an excellent starting point for these world leaders would be this Houseâs resolution, which is explicit and uncompromising.
Â Â  . Mr President, some may well have thought, following the rigged elections on 31 March, that the dictator would have had enough of repression for a bit, but, unfortunately, he had not.
In order to intimidate still more, he mounted âOperation Drive Out Rubbishâ, the ârubbishâ in question being in fact, cynically enough, people, some of whom â having already had to abandon their farms, which had been confiscated, were now losing their homes for the second time, and lacked any means of subsistence.
What is more than cynical, though, is the behaviour of the African Union, which declines to intervene, and South Africa is playing a key role in this.
To President Mbeki, who is in Gleneagles today, I say this: âYou are personally and politically responsible for what is happening in Zimbabwe, for you have for years been omitting to do what you could to put an end to this human tragedy!
If, as is evidently the case, your âOld Boy Networkâ regards the misery of millions of people as an acceptable price to pay in order to hold on to power, you forfeit the right to govern what has been bequeathed to you by a liberation movement!â
Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has at last delivered his trenchant criticism of this behaviour in an interview in todayâs issue of the .
I call on the Council and on all the Member States to make the regimeâs pariah status effective at last.
You, the Council, are not even prepared to deny this clique entry visas.
Those who terrorise their people in this fashion cannot gain the right to attend international conferences by availing themselves of international agreements, yet neither the Council nor our Member States are prepared to administer such a diplomatic slap on the wrist as to refuse them visas.
That is another scandal, this time a scandal for European politics.
There are certain Member States that are currently capitalising on other Member Statesâ progressive withdrawal from Zimbabwe by expanding their own presence there, and by so doing, they â all of them â make us this regimeâs stooges.
The people of Zimbabwe need us, so let us put a stop to this and do something effective at last.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Zimbabwe was once one of the most affluent countries in Africa.
It exported food and provided aid to the other countries in Africa that were less wealthy.
Today it is a weak and poor country, and the dictator that rules over it is a great man of narrow interests.
Unfortunately, these interests are often also dishonest and bloody.
Credit is due to the authors of the motion for a resolution for having included the following key idea.
Even if we stepped up aid to Africa, and hence to Zimbabwe, we would not be providing much in the way of real assistance unless we also ensured that this aid is backed up by good management, respect for human rights and solidarity in Africa. By this I do not mean solidarity between dictators, but solidarity among societies in support of democracy.
Our debate today is concerned with Zimbabwe, but we should also talk about Brussels.
For many years now, Parliament has repeatedly asked the Council to take action on this issue, but the Council has acted blind and deaf.
This situation is reminiscent of the Polish saying; âa beggar talked to a picture, and the picture answered nothingâ, with the only difference being that the silent Council is an ugly picture.
It is time to give serious thought to real and across-the-board sanctions, and to a boycott to be imposed by the other African countries on Zimbabwe.
The European Union, together with the USA and the Commonwealth countries, should exert a certain amount of diplomatic pressure on the African countries to this end.
The Council must not bury its head in the sand and pretend that the problem does not exist.
Â Â  Mr President, we in this Chamber have spoken about Zimbabwe many times now, and everything that could have been said has been said.
I do not now intend to repeat what out resolution says; I only wish to say that democracy is a challenging process which requires effort.
We cannot even take for granted that it exists where people have sworn to uphold it.
Perhaps we need a completely new profession, that of âdemocracy engineerâ, to examine the weak points in a societyâs structures and conduct an impartial quality control assessment of democracy.
President Mugabe, a former freedom fighter and national hero, has degenerated into a dictator, who guards his own power jealously, and a criminal, and this needs to be analysed.
When, a few years ago, we were in Zimbabwe as election observers, we could only wonder at Mugabe, who had the nerve to proclaim during the election that the government would remain, whatever the result.
How does such arrogance come about?
This former fertile African model country is now in a state of chaos.
Now its economic structures have disappeared and the countryâs plight is worsening the whole time.
What is that slow slide from democracy to dictatorship?
One keyword is law and order, a condition of the social contract.
When he incited people to occupy land illegally, instead of carrying out a controlled land reform himself Mugabe did away with law and order in the country and thus destroyed the viability of its social core.
There is also a sequel to this: now Mugabe is using hunger and misery as a weapon against his own people, and is feeding nationalism and blaming colonialism to conceal his own crimes.
What is more, by crushing the opposition he is destroying the basis of democratic society.
For democracy to function, rulers need to be aware of just how dangerous they can be.
The possibility of becoming corrupted by power comes from within.
The philosopher and theologian, Niebuhr, hit upon a reason for manâs dual nature: our capacity for good makes democracy possible, and our inclination to do bad makes it necessary.
Only true democracy guarantees that new faces will replace people who have been corrupted by power.
President Mugabe, for the sake of your people, it is time for you to go.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree more or less with what was said and with what is included in the resolution.
Obviously, Mugabeâs regime is an inadmissible one that is doing absolutely unacceptable and abominable things.
We agree about that.
That being said, I should like, all the same, to introduce a few qualifications regarding the tactical or strategic responses that are to be made, given the regime that is in place and the means available to us to move things in the right direction.
When you speak of sanctions, for example, I obviously share your point of view concerning sanctions directly affecting the Zimbabwean authorities. They definitely must be applied.
I would even add: what are we waiting for before applying them?
Obviously, I agree.
That being said, it needs carefully to be borne in mind that certain types of sanction have harmful repercussions on populations.
In general, I am not, moreover, in favour of sanctions. I tend, rather, to be in favour of political dialogue.
It has in fact been seen how, when they affect populations, sanctions generally rebound upon those who apply them, rather than target the authorities at whom they were directed.
That is the first thing I wanted to say.
What I should now like to say, I say in the knowledge that my comments make me vulnerable to criticism.
It would not, however, be right for me not to let you know my feelings regarding this debate.
It is very easy for us, as Europeans, to issue press releases almost every day, denouncing and attacking Mugabe.
You should be aware, however, that, every time Mugabe is attacked, his symbolic importance as a black hero in relation to the evil white colonisers is reinforced.
As someone â MrÂ Meijer, I think â said a few minutes ago, Mugabe is clearly making use of this vicious circle to rehabilitate himself politically and in the popular imagination.
That needs to be acknowledged.
There is something else you ought to know, too. Otherwise, you will not be fully informed.
Together with yourselves, I certainly recognise that maximum pressure has to be exerted, but it has to be exerted in a subtle way.
What also needs to be understood is that the leaders of the other African countries, whom you denounce for not daring to adopt positions, or make value judgments, on Mugabeâs behaviour are put in difficult positions in their own countries every time Mugabe reinforces his symbolic, not to say heroic image.
You need to know this and you also need to know that it is extremely difficult for MrÂ Mbeki, and I would say straight away that the old boy network âŠ
no, but of course not, there is no old boy network; I am sorry; it is an insult to the South African President to speak of an old boy network.
What MrÂ Mbeki and other African leaders in the region fear is, in reality, that the phenomenon of violence and of an anti-colonialist uprising somewhere might spread into neighbouring countries.
I have on many occasions broached this issue with the representatives of the African Union and with the various Heads of Government of these neighbouring countries.
I am able to tell you that they certainly want to put pressure on President Mugabe, but that they want the conditions to exist for doing so.
In order to bring those conditions about, it is not enough, moreover, for the community outside Africa to relaunch the debate and wave the threat of sanctions, insisting on more of these and on the need to take a harder line.
Firstly, what is meant by the need to take a harder line? Someone tell me what has to be done.
Do troops need to be sent in?
What should be done?
PresidentÂ Barroso was extremely vigorous in his condemnation of Mugabeâs attitude following the expulsions that took place recently.
I should like someone to explain to me what, apart from that and apart from the vengeful, sometimes cavalier, press releases and the routine chest-baring, is meant by taking a harder line. Alternatively, we could engage in a debate on the duty, or right, to interfere.
I personally am ready to engage in that debate.
I am not indifferent to such a debate. I suspect, however, that, on the day that the demand is made in this House for troops to be sent to Zimbabwe to bring about order there â in which case, the agreement of the African Union will still be required â great harm will be caused to Africa and to its regional institutions.
I also very much doubt that any candidates would be found in this House for assembling the bulk of the troops needed.
All I want to say is that an attempt at coherence is needed when points of view are defended.
We are not just a sounding board.
The European bodies, and I too, need at some point to be told precisely what these additional things are that need to be done.
There is no end of condemnation going on.
I met President Konare in Syrte four days ago, together with President Barroso.
Our conversation basically consisted of our saying: but, President, why do you yourselves, as the African Union, not condemn Mugabeâs conduct?
To which he would reply: but, my dear friend, every time you attack Mugabe, you make matters much more difficult for us because our peoples do not consider Mugabe to be a tyrant or dictator; they consider Mugabe basically to be standing up to the evil colonisers, embodying genuine resistance and being faithful to history.
That is what I hear, and I believe it.
Even though I know that this is impossible, there is almost a need, for a few weeks, to adopt a low profile and not to talk too much about all this.
I am almost convinced that doing so would put the African Union, the regional organisations, President Mbeki and others in a position to exercise their peer review duty.
I am almost convinced that you would be putting them in a position to do this.
As long as we continue ostentatiously to lambast Mugabeâs attitude with press releases and calls for vengeance, we shall not â and I am sorry to have to tell you this â be able to obtain the judgment we await from the African Union and the African organisations.
It is only by obtaining such a judgment that we can in the end exercise influence. That is what I believe.
I do not think that there is any other way in which we shall succeed in doing this.
That is something you should know.
I spend a lot of time in those African countries, and I am utterly dismayed to see this vicious circle whereby the more tyrannical Mugabe is and the more the European Union and other international bodies intervene to condemn him, the more popular he is.
If, however, this vicious circle did not exist, Mugabe would undoubtedly not last for long, for it is only through this mechanism that he holds on to power.
What MrÂ Meijer said is true: it is this mechanism that is the key.
To summarise, there is a need to be very careful when attacking the African Union and the African leaders in the region.
I absolutely deny that we are the poodles of Mugabeâs regime.
I can tell you that I myself am by no means any such thing, and I can say this after having tried on many occasions to get things moving in South Africa.
At one point, South Africa tried to convince Mugabe to transform his government into a government of national unity, opening it up to MrÂ Tsvangirai and his party.
At one point, things had moved in the right direction.
Then, along came the sanctions, which again created an extremely difficult climate.
I vigorously condemn Mugabeâs attitude.
I believe that the planned measures and sanctions should be applied against the Zimbabwean authorities.
There is no reason for not applying them. That goes without saying.
I agree with most of what is contained in the resolution.
I am simply trying to explain to you the limits of what we can usefully do, because the problem is, in fact, one of doing things that are of use.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, the Commissioner has had almost ten minutes to stand up and make an apologia for Mugabeâs regime and the inaction of Mbeki, the Commission and the Council.
This is disgraceful.
There is a procedural problem in this House.
How can we have a proper debate when we are limited to one or two minutes and then the microphone is turned off, while the Commissioner can stand up and make this disgraceful response?
He has denied everything that every Member of this House, right across the political spectrum, has said.
We do not have the power, you have the power, Commissioner.
I have been talking, along with other colleagues today, to members of the political opposition in many countries in Africa.
They do not share your view, Commissioner.
It is the most disgraceful outburst I have heard from a Commissioner in a long time.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Â Â  â No, Mr President, I speak to the House not, unfortunately, as an author, but as a Member of the House and as head of the EU election observation mission to Ethiopia. The elections afforded the opposition and all of Ethiopian society an unprecedented voice, which is to Prime Minister Meles Zenawiâs credit.
The presence of international observers, of which our mission was the most significant in terms of numbers and professional commitment, was a key factor in instilling confidence among the electorate, who turned out in their droves and 90% voted. The delegation sent by Parliament felt the sustained applause of voters queuing up on 15Â May and for this reason the EUâs electoral mission feels an enormous responsibility.
It is crucial that the Ethiopian people have their expectations of true election results fulfilled and the mission will do all it can to ensure that this happens.
Nobody can know for sure what the election results will be because the process got into serious difficulty at the stage of counting the ballot papers.
In addition to the delays in publishing the results, there were a large number of complaints from all parties, including the party in government.
Concern among the population with regard to those delays and complaints was at the root of the tragic events of 6, 7Â andÂ 8Â June, on which the mission immediately spoke out publicly. We called at the time for an independent inquiry and we continue to do so.
Specifically, we call on the government to release those held in breach of constitutional guarantees and of human rights; we call for elected candidates and other opposition representatives, along with human rights campaigners, to be allowed the freedom to perform their duties; we call for media freedom and for opposition representatives to be allowed access to the media; we called then and call now on the opposition to hold back and discourage others from carrying out or calling for an insurgency, from calling for people to break constitutional law and from fomenting inter-ethnic conflict, which will ultimately only help those with a vested interest in ensuring that the results of the popular vote are never disclosed, those who, in turn, would stop at nothing to force the electoral process to be disrupted, leading to a spiral of violence and economic and political chaos; we call on both sides â government and opposition â to comply fully with the 10Â June Agreement aimed at addressing complaints, which is backed by the main contributors, including the Member States.
At this point I wish to pay tribute to the representative of the Commission, who played â and continues to play â an outstanding role in Addis Ababa.
Our mission has been restructured to meet requests from both sides that we should observe this process of looking into complaints and I shall therefore be back in Addis Ababa next week.
I shall finish, Mr President, by saying that the situation is very delicately and dangerously poised.
The risk of civil war is not mere rhetoric.
I have just heard the news that the main opposition announced this morning that it is pulling out of the complaint investigation process due to its representatives allegedly being obstructed. Accordingly, any demonstrations of interest in the Ethiopian process, however constructive or well-intentioned they may be, and this is clearly the case of this Parliament initiative, could be taken the wrong way, or could be used for nefarious purposes by those who have a vested interest in breaking up the democratisation process in Ethiopia.
My duties as head of the electoral observation mission have not finished.
It is an independent mission, and the work is not yet done. I therefore ask Parliament to appreciate that I feel it is my duty not to take part in the vote on this resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have to say, in support of the speech by my excellent fellow MEP, MrÂ Posselt that, from a certain point of view, we are very surprised at what has happened regarding the SaÃ¯fi report.
I should like us to evaluate the consequences for it is, at root, a sign addressed to all those who care about the Strasbourg seat.
Everyone knows that this seat is threatened.
Let us think again about this morningâs vote.
Independently of the issue raised by MrsÂ SaÃ¯fiâs report on an important subject, namely textiles, the debate on which ought not, in my opinion, to have been postponed for two months, given that it was an urgent matter, there is, in addition, the signal we have sent out by admitting that, as from 12.30 p.m. on Thursdays, it is impossible to do anything important in the Chamber of Parliamentâs seat in Strasbourg, which I consider to be the main seat of the European Parliament. Given that our activities begin on Tuesday mornings, the fact that they cease on Thursday mornings would suggest, not to put too fine a point upon it, that the Strasbourg Parliament, in Strasbourg, only sits, roughly speaking, two days per month.
That is a consequence of which I would ask all of my fellow Members to assess the significance, and that is why I am raising a formal protest on this subject.
Â Â  .
The specific characteristics of farming and market supply in the outermost regions are evident and are rightly acknowledged by the EU. In this context, and in light of recent experience, I feel that the thrust of the proposal, which is essentially to make the process more flexible, meets Portugalâs considerable interests in this issue.
Our outermost regions â the Azores and Madeira â deserve special focus due to their specific situation, not least in the field of agriculture.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 7 July 2005.
Â Â  Please allow me next to make a statement relating to the events we have witnessed this summer.
As you will remember, on 7 July, at our last sitting before the holidays, we were taken by surprise by the terrorist attacks on London, which, as we feared at the time, caused many victims.
Europe continues to be threatened by terrorism and this is a problem to which we must attach special importance in view of the events of July and those which followed.
This summer, however, has also been marked by other tragic events: the persistence of terrorism in Iraq, horrendous natural disasters and accidents that have brought pain to many families throughout the world â particularly here in Europe and now, especially, in the United States.
You must be aware that, during this summer, whenever one of these events has taken place, I have immediately expressed our solidarity and made contact with the countries affected by these dramas on behalf of the European Parliament.
Every time they have happened we have made our voice heard.
I also believe that we should all join together today to share the pain of the families of the victims of these events, of those who have lost their loved ones in the deadly conflicts affecting the planet.
The United States deserve special mention, since they are currently experiencing a drama of extraordinary dimensions which is shocking the whole world.
It appears that there will be many many victims, thousands of people have been displaced and enormous damage has been done, both in economic terms, and to the social structure.
In Iraq, terrorism kills many people everyday, in a constant drip.
A rumour alone is enough, as was the case a few weeks ago, when panic on a bridge in Baghdad led to the deaths of more than a thousand people.
Dramatic civilian aeroplane and helicopter accidents have led to the deaths of more than 400 people in Indonesia, Greece, Venezuela, Peru and in the Baltic, and also in Afghanistan, where European soldiers have died â Spanish, on this occasion, but they could have been from any European country â following a helicopter accident.
I feel we should remember at this point the words addressed to us by the President of Afghanistan, MrÂ Kharzai, when here in this Assembly he highlighted the significant role played by the troops of European countries in defence of human rights and peace-keeping in his country.
There has been more: disastrous floods in Austria, Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Switzerland have killed dozens of people and displaced hundreds of thousands of inhabitants.
Serious economic damage as a result of excessive rainfall in one half of Europe and serious economic damage resulting from the terrible drought suffered by the other half of Europe, a drought that feeds the forest fires, particularly in Portugal, France and Spain, which have cost the lives of dozens of people, including firefighters and pilots involved in fighting those fires.
The results of this environmental damage caused by too much water, in some cases, and a lack of it, in others, will be very difficult to reverse and should remind us that the violent nature of these phenomena is the result of imbalances to which the European Union has paid particular attention and will have to continue to do so.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the majority of these dramas, the European Union has demonstrated its capacity to mobilise and to go to the assistance of the victims quickly.
We must make use of our capacity for prevention and action in order to show solidarity.
Our Parliament will have the opportunity to debate this issue today, within the context of the Commission statements appearing on our agenda and we will soon have to legislate on strengthening air safety.
Having commented briefly on these dramatic events of this summer which is coming to an end, I would like to call on you, now that we are back here again, to observe a minuteâs silence to demonstrate our solidarity with all of the victims and express our deepest sympathies to them.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 1 September, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
No amendments have been proposed for Monday or Tuesday.
The agenda you have seen for Monday and Tuesday will therefore remain the same.
As a result of a debate that took place in the Conference of Presidents, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the report by Mr Brok, on the Council Decision on the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Agreement creating an association between the European Economic Community and Turkey as a result of the enlargement of the European Union, be added.
Given the complexity of the issue, I believe that somebody should explain this request.
Mrs Frassoni would like to do so.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, my group believes it is necessary to keep this item on the agenda.
We had supported the same request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who decided, however, to change their minds, in our view for reasons linked not to Europe but to another very important event in a Member State.
In our view, there is no need to be afraid of a debate on Turkey; on the contrary, such a debate is needed, and it is important to keep the protocol issue separate from the more general issue that we will be debating in the second September part-session.
In that way we will be able to focus specifically on the topic of Cyprus, in which Turkey certainly holds some responsibility, although we must not forget that the Republic of Cyprus does as well.
