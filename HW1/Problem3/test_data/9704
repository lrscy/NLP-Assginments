According to the Commission' s estimates, the financial requirement for Albania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and also Montenegro up to the year 2006 will be EUR 1.5 billion, i.e. around EUR 200-230 million per year.
Late last year, we received a very precise study from the World Bank and the Commission regarding the financial requirements for reconstruction in Kosovo, a study which showed that, over the next three to four years, the financial assistance required will total USD 2.3 billion, and the Commission, i.e. the European Union, agreed to fund half that requirement from the EU budget, in other words approximately EUR 1.1 billion.
As I pointed out, the Commission proposal focuses particularly on the need for the regions to cooperate with one other, which is why special funding is to be provided to that end.
The Commission proposal also makes provision for including financial aid for Serbia to the tune of EUR 2.3 billion in the financial plan.
In this regard it is clear, of course, that these EU budget resources can, and must, only be allocated if there are signs of progress towards democracy in Serbia.
The Commission is convinced, however, that if we decide the financial framework at this stage, that will send an important political message to Serbia. It will make it clear that it is not just a question of making promises to the Serbian forces of opposition, but that preparations are also being made to provide immediate assistance on the ground once the necessary changes are in place.
With regard to the amounts involved, let me tell you the following: the Commission estimates the total requirement for the region at EUR 5.5 billion from the EU budget.
The financial plan in Agenda 2000, which was adopted in Berlin, already includes some EUR 1.8 billion; these resources were earmarked for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Today, the Commission decided to propose reallocating a further EUR 1.4 billion of aid from other foreign policy budget lines to the Balkans.
It therefore proposed and decided to reprogramme the budget for external actions, as I will describe in more detail in a moment.
The view of the Commission is that we will have to raise the external action ceiling here for the next few years by EUR 300 billion a year.
In this connection, the Commission made the following proposal on financing this additional requirement: in the years 2001 and 2002, these resources should be taken from resources previously earmarked for agricultural policy and reallocated to the external action heading.
I have already had an opportunity to discuss this proposal here in Parliament.
At this point let me repeat that this measure does not mean undoing the agricultural policy package decided in Berlin.
And it certainly does not mean curtailing the direct income subsidies for farmers.
Let me point out that, overall, the agriculture budget totals EUR 44 billion, which makes it clear that reallocating EUR 300 million has no impact on the overall agricultural package.
This amount will have to be financed in the year 2001, among others, from the savings resulting from the euro-dollar exchange rate.
After all, the current exchange rate value of the euro means very substantial savings for the European budget with regard to export financing.
For 2003 onwards, the Commission proposes that the decision on financing the necessary resources should be taken in conjunction with the already scheduled mid-term review of agricultural policy.
Let me point out that the Commission is also proposing to the budgetary authority that the external action appropriations should only be increased once resources for Serbia can indeed be allocated.
This is therefore a decision that establishes a framework for the years to come.
In relation to the re-programming of external action appropriations to which I referred, let me summarise the situation as follows: the Commission proposals always took account of the geopolitical importance of each region.
We did not propose any cuts in programmes aimed specifically at combating poverty in the world and the proposals also took into account whether some programmes were not fully taken up in the past, i.e. the administrative activities and the relevant administration' s implementation of these programmes in the areas concerned were examined.
The necessary redeployment is the result mainly of comparable cuts in the TACIS programme for the countries of the former Soviet Union.
But let me point out that, in relation to the Mediterranean region, the Commission proposal provides that in this coming period - i.e. up to 2006 - the resources available for the MEDA programme will be increased overall by 13% compared with the previous period.
Let me conclude by pointing out the following: there is another point where the decision on the revision of the financial perspective also responds to a request by Parliament.
In connection with the 2000 Budget, you proposed that, in future, the appropriations allocated for Cyprus and Malta should no longer appear under the external action heading but be reclassified under the pre-accession aid budget, so as to make it clear that we have a coherent plan here; that these are appropriations that will be spent with a view to the desired accession of Cyprus and Malta to the European Union.
I think that will make the financial planning even more transparent.
In many regards, today' s Commission decisions satisfy some of Parliament' s key requests; we have complied with these requests.
That is why I ask you to support the Commission proposal on the review of the financial perspective and hope you will do precisely that!
Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for that report.
There were not a great many surprises in it and, to some extent, I welcome that.
A question remains, however, in relation to redeployment in Category 4.
I heard you say there would not be cuts against the poverty lines.
You mentioned lines where there was not complete take-up and that there would be cuts in TACIS.
Can you give us some idea whether there will be any across-the-board reductions?
Last year, the Council proposed a 10% across-the-board cut in Category 4.
Is the Commission making selective reductions as you suggested or will they be making any across-the-board cuts in Category 4?
I am still unclear as to what happens from the year 2003.
If you are taking money from Category 1 for the next two years, where do you expect that money to come from in 2003?
Mr Wynn, I can give you a definite answer to your first question as to whether the Commission is proposing across-the-board cuts in the external action heading: no, it does not propose to do so.
I would regard that as the wrong approach.
We have enough criteria according to which we can carefully assess to what extent we need to shift appropriations compared with Agenda 2000.
So these proposals are entirely justified and no across-the-board cuts are being proposed.
On your second question: the Commission is proposing to shift appropriations from agricultural policy to foreign policy for the years 2001 and 2002. Let me repeat that this is simply a question of limiting the increase in foreign policy appropriations, i.e. not of cuts to the budget available today.
The Commission' s proposal for the years from 2003 is as follows: we are looking to increase the amount for foreign policy, which, in arithmetical terms, would, of course, mean raising the overall ceiling.
But the Commission is proposing that both arms of the budgetary authority should try to make savings in particular areas during the annual budgetary procedure in order to find these 300 million.
It could also be that in connection with the mid-term review of Category 1, scheduled for the year 2003, it will be proposed that these additional appropriations be financed over the entire period.
Let me stress once again that, in my view, we can finance this increase in foreign policy resources within the overall ceiling decided in Berlin and that the appropriations for Serbia should only be disbursed once we see real democratic developments there.
Madam President, I was extremely interested and curious to hear what Commissioner Schreyer has just said.
I must say that we would have preferred to be presented with a written text, but it appears that these ideas have been the subject of internal debates within the Commission and that we will therefore be given a more specific text to study at our leisure.
Having said that, I fail to see your grounds for considering that agricultural expenditure is not going to be used in its entirety, as it should, nor how you could release sums, that you describe as minimal, for the heading covering international actions and foreign policy.
During the last financial year, we instead felt palpable tension regarding market expenditure and I do not understand what intellectual grounds you have for considering that too much money is being allocated to agriculture, apart from the fact that you need money for the foreign policy heading.
Secondly, the same applies to the cuts under heading 4.
You tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity.
Fine, I can accept that, but what gives you the right - you spoke of very specific criteria, so tell us what they are - what gives you the right to think that too much money has been earmarked for other parts of the world, apart from the fact that you need that money for Kosovo.
I think that this is a genuine problem.
I will conclude with my third question.
I should like to know whether, in the undertakings concerning aid that we gave at the donor conference, we made commitments in US dollars or in euros?
Given the state of the euro, I should like to know, if it was in US dollars, how you are dealing with the resulting situation and how you plan to guarantee that there will be strict parallelism between the donations made by the European Union and those made by other donors within the international community?
Mr Bourlanges, to answer your last question, the World Bank' s estimate of the requirements in Kosovo was indeed expressed in dollars.
We had an opportunity to go into this in depth during the 2000 budget discussions.
In its proposal the Commission has now allocated EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2000-2006.
It is not therefore charging appropriations already disbursed for Kosovo in 1999.
As for your comment that you need a written document in order to analyse the proposal: you will find the proposal on the financial perspective and re-programming on the Internet tomorrow.
The Commission will decide on the CARDS programme next week, because here there were still some questions that required clarification from the legal service. The key figures will therefore be available to you as from tomorrow.
In reply to what you said about agricultural expenditure, let me point out the following: this year, given the fluctuations in the exchange rates, we will be spending about EUR 500 million less on agriculture and the estimates for next year are that we will need about 650 million less, assuming a parity euro-dollar rate.
You are also aware that the Commission will have to make proposals again next year on various organisations of the market, especially the sugar market, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, has stated that he will make a proposal in this regard, which will lead to savings of EUR 300 million a year.
Of course, I am not saying that there is too much money floating around; as Commissioner for the budget I am aware that money is always scarce, but money is also scarce for those who have to finance the European budget.
That is why, in my opinion, the Commission had to propose financing a new priority, without asking for new money, but rather by examining the possibilities of redeployment within the budget and making the appropriate proposal. And that is what it has done.
Madam President, you came, Mrs Schreyer, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, you presented your arguments there, and you were met with respect.
However, I would like to make one comment and then put a question to you.
You say there was an increase in the agricultural sector and that this increase would be curtailed.
The fact that the percentage rise is so high is a result of the cuts in appropriations that were decided earlier in Berlin.
In fact, these appropriations are urgently needed!
I think we must not give the impression that we can keep using the agriculture budget as a kind of bottomless pit whenever we are short of money in other areas.
That is why I now ask you: do we not need to shift appropriations that might not be needed in export policy to the line for the integrated development of rural areas?
We need substantial funds there, because enlargement, with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries, will generate enormous problems in these rural areas.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I fully and wholeheartedly support your commitment to the development of rural areas.
And that will also be very, very clearly reflected in the proposal I will be submitting to the Commission next week for Budget 2001.
It proposes that next year we increase the appropriations to assist rural areas by 10% compared with this year, and that will quite clearly constitute the largest increase in the draft budget.
I can assure you that the Commission did not approach the question of how to finance this new priority, this new task, by looking for some kind of bottomless pit; it simply took a very practical decision for the years 2001 and 2002.
Madam President, first I would like to express my deepest regret that we are debating a review of the financial perspective, and we have not even been presented with an initial written document.
If an issue like this is presented to Parliament, I would have thought that we might have had something in black and white, so we would know what we were talking about.
First of all, I would like to say that, not only are we faced with this bad example of administration, but that the Commission seems to take the view that wars can be waged and expenses incurred, yet the financial perspective cannot be reviewed.
The only way we can bear the costs of war and its consequences would seem to be at the expense of agriculture.
I would ask the Commissioner how this Commission proposal fits in with the decision of Parliament on next year' s guidelines that agriculture could not be the primary source of financing, as it appears that more would be taken out of agriculture than found, for example, by means of reallocation.
On the other hand, I would ask whether the Commission believes it would again be possible to use the flexibility instrument for this financing measure, since the rules forbid the use of the flexibility instrument more than once?
Mr Virrankoski, on your question whether the Commission is taking account in its proposal of Parliament' s decision that the resources needed for assistance to the Western Balkans should not come primarily from the agriculture budget, we have indeed taken that decision into account.
Let me perhaps give you a few very rough figures once again: we estimate the need at EUR 5.5 billion and, overall, 3.3 billion of that will come from the external action heading.
So it is quite clear that the redeployment here is concentrated on foreign policy.
In practice, the Commission proposal means redeploying EUR 600 million from agriculture policy for the years 2001 and 2002.
The second point is the use of the flexibility reserve.
The interinstitutional agreement provides that the flexibility reserve can only ever be used for a given purpose for one year, i.e. cannot be used on a continuous basis for a long-term measure.
The Commission proposes that, for the time being, only the EUR 40 million that are also available in the budget this year should be allocated to Serbia for the year 2001, for example, to finance the Energy for Democracy programme.
In the event of a political change in Serbia during 2001, we could also resort to the flexibility reserve.
Regarding your question of when the documents will be available, you will find them on the Internet tomorrow morning.
Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her report, although a number of points seemed very unclear and could even be described as highly ambiguous.
If I am not mistaken, the total appropriations for Serbia are EUR 2.3 billion.
These appropriations are not purely nominal; it is simply that they will remain on paper for as long as the Milosevic Government is in power.
This is neither the time nor the place for me to criticise this government, but I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission took into account the fact that neighbouring countries, as well as the Serbian civilian population, were being penalised when it decided to defer appropriations on purely political grounds.
Without direct appropriations and aid, how does it intend to resolve the issues of industrial pollution, the navigability of the Danube and the Danube' s bridges destroyed by American bombing, which drastically reduced the river traffic of as many as five neighbouring countries?
What contribution is the Commission going to make - not in three years' time but in the next few months - to resolving the issue of the vast amount of pollution caused by the bombing of the Pancevo petrochemical plant, which contaminated huge areas, seeds and harvests with poisonous gases and which, according to the latest United Nations report, even polluted the water tables with dioxins, mercury and other toxic substances?
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether there is any chance, any prospect of taking direct, immediate action on Serbian territory as well, in the interests, and I stress this point, of the neighbouring countries and regions.
Mr Manisco, the Commission regards it as most important to promote cooperation between the states and the regions with funds from the European budget, with your help.
That is why the proposal on the review of the financial perspective specifically earmarks approximately EUR 80-90 million for cooperation projects.
Secondly, as I pointed out, we have allocated EUR 40 million for aid to Serbia in this year' s budget as well, but these funds will only be used in a targeted manner in areas where the democratic opposition forces are currently endeavouring to establish a democratic system and the rule of law.
This year' s budget includes EUR 540 million for the region as a whole.
At the donor conference on the Stability Pact, Mr Patten approved certain projects and made it clear that the Commission can provide practical measures of assistance on the ground.
These EUR 540 million are available in the budget, thanks largely to the very strong support of the European Parliament and its endeavour to genuinely allocate adequate resources to this task.
In this connection, let me once again thank the European Parliament for making such an effort to ensure that the necessary funds are available in the 2000 Budget.
Madam President, Commissioner, I can be brief because, in the end, all the questions have been along the same lines.
We have heard that the figure of EUR 1.8 billion was decided on in Berlin. Today, as you said, EUR 1.4 billion has been decided on, and we keep hearing about the EUR 300 million reallocated from the agriculture budget, i.e. the 2001-2002 agricultural sector.
Commissioner, you had the opportunity to tell us about this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but my question is quite simply this: how do I then explain why the farming community is so agitated?
When you state here today that we are saving a great deal of money thanks to the exchange rate mechanisms, when you and Commissioner Fischler say at the same time that we can save money in the organisation of the sugar market, then surely the reason the farming community is agitated must be that this information has not been properly conveyed to them, that the agricultural associations did not understand it properly!
Or must we always and, on principle, begin with an exchange of blows when it comes to politics?
I would therefore be very happy if we really could allay the concerns of farmers; at the moment, however, that does not seem to be the case!
Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, let me assure you that I have worked very hard with agricultural associations and lobbies over the course of the last few weeks to discuss and explain the Commission' s proposal.
As I have announced, I will be submitting the budget 2001 proposal to the Commission next week. This will clarify the fact that there will be a sharp increase in agricultural appropriations, in line with the decisions taken in Berlin.
I therefore believe that, based on the actual figures, we can make it clear that the farming community need have no fears and that the important decisions taken in Berlin, particularly in relation to direct income subsidies for farmers, are not affected by the Commission' s decision.
This item is closed.
Vote
- (NL) Mr President, I can advise you how to vote on each of the four amendments.
As rapporteur, I have no choice but to oppose these amendments because each of them has also been discussed and subsequently rejected within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
As such, I would suggest voting against the amendments.
Thank you for that clarification.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
PesÃ€lÃ€ report (A5-0081/2000)
Mr President, your suggestion of pausing to listen to the interesting explanations of votes is not being heeded, but I am, nevertheless, pleased.
I voted for the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products because I am convinced that it represents a positive technical step.
We cannot deny the Commission the chance to intervene in such highly technical matters.
I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity afforded by the explanation of vote to remind the House that there is a need for Parliament and the Council to make radical changes to the legislation on milk quotas as well as to the legislation governing the distribution of agricultural produce, regulated within the European Community, in terms of the quantity produced and how it is marketed.
The milk quota system was full of holes and we need a new one!
Maat report (A5-0074/2000)
Mr President, I am sorry that I am only giving two explanations of vote on this occasion, but I do so with great pleasure, for Mr Maat' s report is of great significance: as we are all aware, it has ensured that the practice of giving free milk and milk products to school children will be continued.
I remember the time when an elderly person came into my father' s bar, where I worked when I was a child, and asked for a glass of milk, saying, 'I drank milk when I was born and I want to die drinking milk!' .
I therefore put it to you - and I voted for the motion - that the European Union should give a glass of milk to pensioners, as well as to students, on a daily basis.
.
(FR) I do not need to remind you how hard we had to fight to maintain the necessary funds for supplying milk to schools.
In April 1999, the draft budget submitted by the European Commission provided for a 50% reduction in that budget line!
That reduction made it clear that this financial assistance would eventually disappear, which provoked intense reactions within the European Parliament and elsewhere.
According to experts and specialists in child nutrition, milk is indeed essential to the proper intellectual and physical development of children, of all children.
Therefore, children of poorer families, who do not have access to certain milk products having essential nutritional benefits, can make up the shortfall thanks to the meals offered in their school canteens.
A proposal such as this represented a threat to the health of our children.
This was unacceptable, given that public health had been enshrined in the new Title XIII of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Furthermore, it totally contradicted the conclusions of the Agriculture Council of 14 and 15 June 1999.
Our Ministers had stressed the importance of encouraging milk consumption because of its high nutritional value, especially for children and young people.
It was only after long, intense discussions that the Commission proposed to increase the budget line by EUR 31 million, with the total amount committed to aid for providing schools with milk then rising to EUR 84 million.
This is the situation in 2000.
For the future, the European Commission has proposed to implement a cofinancing system.
A maximum of 50% of subsidies for the provision of milk to schools would be financed by the European Union, with the Member States remaining responsible for the other half.
This is an unacceptable proposal!
It was obvious that the Commission' s long-term intention was to dismantle the system of aid for supplying milk to schools.
The European Parliament' s proposal, which I wholeheartedly support, is to make the Community pay 95% of the cost of European subsidies for milk supplied to schools.
This is the only way to ensure that this system survives.
I also welcome the decision to also include drinking yoghurt and milk-based beverages in the regulation.
This must be done to take account of changes in habits and food preferences and to make this programme more attractive to consumers.
I can, today, express my satisfaction at having committed myself to this fight and at seeing that the countless letters to the relevant ministers, the countless questions to the European Commission and the countless press releases have paid off!
.
(FR) This issue of Community subsidies for supplying milk to schools goes back to 1997 and is generating an increasing amount of interest in each of our Member States, all the more so because it involves issues of public health and economics, issues which are of concern to the European public.
If you need proof of this, you only have to read the countless letters which were sent to us when it became known that the European Commission wanted to end this programme!
That is why I can only urge you to follow the recommendation of our rapporteur, who is seeking not only to maintain this type of programme, but who is also taking a stand against the proposal of 50-50 cofinancing that the European Commission is putting forward.
Such a harsh cofinancing programme could lead to certain Member States refusing to pay their national contribution, thereby leading to discrimination within the Union.
Without denying the need to improve the management of this budget line, I nevertheless feel that improvements to the system can, and must, be made gradually, and I therefore urge you to support the European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur by adopting this report.
.
(PT) We are in favour of this report because we think it is important that millions of children attending schools in the European Union continue to be given milk subsidised at a rate of 95% by the European Union.
As you will be aware, EC subsidies for supplying milk to schools were introduced as early as 1977.
In 1999, however, the Commission felt that it should put a stop to this programme.
But following considerable opposition, particularly in the European Parliament, the Commission submitted a new proposal, which, whilst maintaining the programme, would reduce Community cofinancing to 50%, with the intention that Member States would finance, wholly or partially, the remaining 50%.
To date, this system has provided for Community financing equal to 95% of the target price of milk, and in the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the rapporteur proposes that this level of financing should be maintained, rejecting the proposal of 50%.
We consider this to be very important, as we reject the idea of transferring the costs of the CAP back to national governments.
- (SV) We have voted against the Maat report which concerns subsidies for the EU' s school milk programme.
In many schools around Europe, milk is provided free of charge to the pupils in order to meet their need for different forms of nutrition.
We are wholeheartedly in favour of children and young people being offered milk, and even food, in school, as they are in Sweden.
However, we do not think that it should be the job of the European Union to subsidise school milk.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, school milk subsidies should be reduced to zero.
We therefore view the Commission' s proposal concerning cofinancing as a step in the right direction.
Since the 1950s, Swedish schools have provided pupils with milk and school dinners.
They have been able to do this without subsidies from the EU.
Sweden' s membership of the EU means that Sweden, too, was informed about the common school milk programme and, today, Sweden consumes approximately one tenth of the common budget for school milk.
For some years now, Sweden has been providing full cream milk instead of semi-skimmed milk, simply in order to meet the requirements for milk subsidies.
This clearly highlights the drawback of the system, as well as the fact that many countries which presently make use of the subsidies really have no requirement for additional resources.
We believe that export and production subsidies under the common agricultural policy must be abolished.
Agriculture ought to be placed on an equal footing with other branches of the food industry and compete in a free market.
Europe is now facing a series of challenges requiring more money to be invested.
The money which is, at present, being spent on agricultural policy, ought instead to be invested in the reconstruction of Kosovo, the enlargement of the Union to include Central and Eastern Europe and aid to the Third World.
. The reason for this intervention is to clarify why this House should oppose the Commission' s proposals to cut subsidies for school milk by half.
I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this House rejected these proposals by bringing forward these amendments not to cut the subsidies at all and I urge everyone to support these amendments.
There are several arguments for doing so.
By nourishing our schoolchildren we also support our dairy farmers who need our support.
But also we are preventing surpluses like those seen in the past.
Trans-European networks (1998 Annual Report)
The next item is the report (A5-0076/2000) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the report from the Commission to the Council [COM(1999) 410 - C5-0010/2000 - 2000/2004 (COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Trans-European Networks 1998 Annual Report pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European Networks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ELDR Group supports the Hatzidakis report.
Community policy in the field of trans-European networks is of major importance because it is not possible to have a common transport policy without a convergent infrastructures policy, as is stressed in the Maastricht Treaty.
Efficient transport infrastructures are essential for economic growth and employment, as they are for the competitiveness of companies which depend on the movement of persons, goods and resources.
According to this debate, Europe, first and foremost, is that political Europe towards which we are striving, but it is also the result of economic and social cohesion.
It is true that the European Union' s budgetary resources are insufficient and need to be increased, and it is also true that we need to increase the contributions of public bodies as well as public/private partnerships.
In this regard, my Group has drawn the Commission' s attention to the fact that the report does not contain information on sources of funding other than the Community budget and the European Investment Bank, and it has also stressed its concern that as many as seven Essen projects have not been given a guarantee that they will be completed within the timeframes envisaged.
We, too, say 'Yes' to the Brenner Pass and we, too, say 'Yes' to the use of new technologies.
However, the Member States must respect the pledges made, and the Commission must also take into account the guidelines established for the B5-700 budget line - a major budget line established in 1998 - promoting more environmentally friendly models and, above all, taking the different factors into consideration where a trans-European link passes through densely populated areas or highly industrialised regions.
For this reason, we also consider that appropriations set aside for these projects must not exceed 50% and that, after due analysis, the amounts still available for projects on which little progress has been made could be recouped and used for other projects with the same priorities, including environmental priorities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the two rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs Sbarbati, have already explained, both the competent committee and the Committee on Budgets wholeheartedly endorsed the Brenner project, a project that came at the top of the Essen list of priorities.
However, the original project did not set out a list of priorities, a major shortcoming.
I therefore consider it essential for the Commission to accept the points laid down in this report, and which have been explained by the rapporteur, as they stand.
The Brenner Pass covers a region that includes three countries and, as such, it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention.
At present, 1.2 million lorries cross the Brenner Pass every year.
The growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase.
The free movement of persons, one of the freedoms in the European Union, cannot be achieved properly either.
Good Friday saw extremely lengthy tailbacks on the Brenner Pass.
We, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Swoboda and I - as pointed out in the explanatory statement of this motion in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - tabled a motion in which we justified this initiative as being a means of achieving an innovative model and approach to project development.
It breaks new ground and can set an example to the European Union.
Under the Prodi government, the Italian legislature had already considered the possibility of cross-financing road - i.e. road tolls - and rail transport and indeed approved it.
I believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach.
That is an absolute must, especially in an environmentally sensitive area, and I hope the Commission will exhibit the necessary sensitivity.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, on his very sound report.
The report is as good and judicious as Mr Hatzidakis is in his chairmanship of the committee, for which he certainly deserves recognition and thanks.
Let me also take this opportunity to support him when he says that the financial resources for developing the trans-European networks are no longer adequate.
He proposes increasing the budget funding.
According to Commissioner Schreyer today, that will not be very easy to achieve.
That is why Mr Hatzidakis quite rightly proposed in committee that funding should also be procured from private or other semi-public institutions.
The previous Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, put forward several ideas on the subject on the basis of the activities of a working party and I hope Mrs Schreyer will be able to develop and take up some of these ideas, for without an incentive system of extra funding from the private sector too, we will not succeed in achieving what Mr Hatzidakis, the committee and, I hope, Parliament too, will propose tomorrow.
It is quite clear that in view of the additional tasks that we are also confronted with in transport, when we think of Eastern Europe and the candidate countries, it will not be possible to achieve what Mr Ebner has just called for, namely redeployment from road to rail, especially in bottleneck areas.
That is not an anti-roads policy, because it will, of course, free up the roads for the kind of transport best suited to them.
That is why we need this redeployment.
Some successes have been achieved, especially in relation to the agreement with Switzerland; in other areas, however, we have been less successful.
Let me also say a few words on the Brenner base-level tunnel. The European Commission has already financed the feasibility study, in fact financed it more heavily than other projects.
Studies alone, however, are not enough.
That is why we do not yet have any additional mode of transport, why no fewer cars are being driven and why we are not seeing a switch to rail transport.
That is why we must tackle the projects and why we need investment.
We also tabled a motion to this effect on account of our common concern in committee.
The three governments concerned and the Commission really must act now, begin with the spadework and start building, while, of course, at the same time guaranteeing the necessary funding.
I believe the Brenner base-level project is one of the most important European projects that need tackling, with a view to making north-south traffic environment-friendly and efficient.
If we combine that with the additional measures concerning the candidate countries, then, in five to ten years' time, we could see an efficient transport system in Europe, and that is something we urgently need!
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, for his excellent report.
The rapporteur has gone into the matter with great care and raised some very important issues.
Our Group supports him, for example, on the issue of coordinating regional and private funding in the Member States of the Union.
However, I would like to underline a few issues.
The annual report shows that shortcomings exist in the way money spent on the development of trans-European networks is monitored, and insufficient details are available as to the results achieved through the use of funds.
We need more precise accounts of inter alia how the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, funds from financial sources not included in the Union budget and funds from the Member States are spent to improve trans-European transport networks.
We also need a report on the effects of functional transport networks on a sustainable economy and employment.
The rapporteur has quite rightly pointed out that, of the fourteen Essen specific projects, seven still require confirmation of their funding and timetables.
In addition, the Essen projects have devoured a larger proportion of the Union' s funding for transport than was agreed.
In the future, greater care should be taken in selecting such specific projects.
At the same time, it must be ensured that the Member States will commit themselves to them, set aside a sufficiently large share of funding for them, and give them priority in their own plans.
The Annual Report shows that more money is also needed for the development of transport and traffic safety through the Union budget, since transport communications are so vital for the economy, employment and, furthermore, for social cohesion.
In the future we shall have to pay more attention to the coordination of various forms of transport.
At the same time, we shall also have to give consideration to the link between regional policy and transport.
Balanced regional development can help to slow down the trend towards centralisation and reduce traffic congestion.
In addition to addressing the problems of traffic in congested areas, we will also have to ensure that the trans-European networks are extended and that they are also developed in areas where the volume of traffic is lighter - areas where there is less traffic, remote areas, and areas where the physical environment presents greater problems.
Good communications are a vital necessity in these areas.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are agreed on one thing: policy on trans-European networks is in urgent need of reform!
The trans-European transport networks, and the 14 specific projects in particular, have not succeeded in any of the aims they were in fact intended to achieve, even though a great deal of money has already been invested.
But two of these aims really are vital to the European Union.
One is the key aim of economic and social cohesion, which holds the European Union together.
These TENs were designed to prevent the drifting apart, or the risk of a drift apart, between poor and affluent regions.
They have not done so.
On the contrary, the 14 selected projects have, in fact, driven the regions further apart, and have encouraged a trend towards increased economic activity in the prosperous economic regions, because transport links have been constructed between them, while the poorer regions have become increasingly isolated.
Secondly, it is still a mistake to think that the trans-European networks help reduce mass unemployment.
On the contrary, unemployment has risen: even in 1995, in the ten poorest regions, unemployment was seven times higher than in the richest regions, while today it is eight times higher, and rising.
So I really wonder whether we can afford to continue putting European taxpayers' money in concrete without this having a significant impact on employment.
Is there really any point in investing more money and calling for more money in this case?
Is that not an incorrect response in structural terms, because we could do far more sensible things with the money in order to regenerate employment.
I also wonder whether the value of these projects has not been offset by the environmental destruction they cause.
In fact, they have achieved nothing.
They have destroyed much of the living space of the people of Europe and we should take the mass protest movements against motorways seriously, for they often point the way to more sensible and less destructive options.
Perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right.
Europe needs a considerably more intelligent and sustained transport policy, based on a modern approach that thinks ahead to the next generation, realising that resources are finite.
As regards the 14 projects, the European Parliament' s call for a cost-benefit analysis was not heeded, whilst its call for environmental compatibility checks for all the projects was also ignored; only partial checks were carried out, which conflicts with the relevant directive.
I think we really need to improve goods transport, which must be facilitated by rail in order to be sustainable.
We must revise the TENs policy with a view to combining mobility with sustainability.
Mr President, the trans-European networks are often hailed as one of the key successes of European integration.
This is true to some extent but they also make our society more vulnerable.
They help to strengthen the cohesion between the economies of the EU Member States.
Each country is becoming increasingly reliant on imported energy and a great deal of effort also goes into consultation and legal rulings.
What effect does this have on the people in Europe?
Perhaps an increase in the number of jobs in the short term.
In the longer term, it could be that, quite unintentionally, businesses become more vulnerable owing to technical defects in a costly transport system and that jobs could, at short notice, be moved to areas with lower wages, poorer working conditions and fewer environmental requirements.
Nothing therefore to get too excited about for the time being.
Similarly, the major transport projects are not as promising as the annual report would like to suggest.
For the north-south high-speed link from Berlin to Verona, only a few minor components have been constructed.
In England, the connection of the high-speed link which runs through the Channel Tunnel has been in the doldrums for many years as a result of the privatisation and the splitting up of the railway companies in that country.
Spain has decided not to go ahead with a European standard gauge for the high-speed link between Madrid and Barcelona, which was used for the line from Madrid to Seville.
The construction of the Betuwe line through the Netherlands is becoming increasingly controversial.
Economic experts have calculated that this expensive line would never be a success.
The costs seem to increase daily, the inland shipping industry considers this line to be distorting competition, freight transport by road does not seem to have gone down as a result and environmental activists are thwarting activities on a daily basis.
All in all, a good enough reason to abandon the Betuwe line project.
There is still far too little broad-based, social debate on the priorities set and choices made.
The people of Europe are entitled to more information on the impact of the TENs, i.e. the impact on their livelihoods, the costs involved, environmental considerations and the rate of implementation.
Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to colleague Hatzidakis for a very fine report to Parliament here this afternoon.
The Commission' s 1998 annual report on trans-European transport networks gives a clear overall picture of the progress that has been made in certain specific projects as well as containing valuable information on the contributions made to these infrastructural projects by the various sources of Community funding.
Clearly, it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs.
At present, the funding is decidedly inadequate if we are to attempt seriously to meet the commitments entered into at the Essen European Summit in 1994.
I share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen Essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation.
It would be useful if the Commission, in its future annual reports, specified what funding has been provided by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, in addition to European funding, with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks.
The Commission will shortly undertake a revision of the TEN guidelines.
I hope that in these new guidelines they will accord greater importance to improving access to trans-European network funding for Europe' s island and remote regions.
It is important to place particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable transport links with these disadvantaged regions if they are to share equally in the benefits of a unified single market.
If the revision of the TEN guidelines were to concentrate just on existing bottlenecks as announced by the Commission in its work programme for the year 2000, this would focus the funding on the more economically developed central regions of the Union, perhaps to the detriment of the outermost regions.
A package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network.
The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis warmly, in particular because he has produced a genuinely realistic report, but some of his observations, which are rather disturbing, should be of particular concern to us.
It is worth remembering that the decisions that led to the choice of these 14 major projects date back to the Essen Summit, which took place in 1994, that is, already six years ago now.
Six years on from that decision, only half of these projects have made any real progress, and those projects are, by and large, concentrated in the northern half of the continent.
A positive start has been made, but the situation looks pretty grim as regards the other projects and, in particular, for the remote regions, as Mr Collins has already pointed out.
I am particularly thinking of the Southern link, which is supposed to link France, in particular Lyon, together with Turin and Trieste, to the rest of the Balkans that we would like to see firmly annexed to Europe. I am also thinking of the other part of Europe, comprising of Austria, with its specific problems mentioned by other speakers, Hungary, and the other countries of central Europe.
In this context, I would remind you that it is not only about opening up a Piedmont which is hidden away, a Piedmont stuck in the Alps. This is about connecting a whole region of the continent, the Balkans and central Europe, to the southern part of Europe, to France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and no real progress has been made as regards this project.
So, in response to what Mrs Schroedter said, I feel that we must not lose sight of the fact that what these major projects are mainly concerned with is the development of railway infrastructures.
This particularly applies to this southern axis, which would make Paris only three and a half hours distant from Milan.
There are, however, difficult choices to be made in order to avoid the huge pollution-related problems currently in the news in Austria, as well as in Italy and Germany.
Choices have to be made; there must be investment and this decision, this choice that was made in Essen, is still no closer to being taken, six years down the line.
This concerns Member States, of course, and certainly Italy in particular, which has not supported this project with sufficient vigour, but it also concerns the Commission, as the rapporteur made very clear.
It is the Commission' s duty to come up with measures which encourage both public authorities and private companies to invest in these huge trans-European networks.
I therefore consider it to be crucial that the Commission submits new proposals so that these dossiers, which are still deadlocked, can proceed as quickly as possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are serious problems with seven of the transport projects decided upon by the Essen Council.
Like the rapporteur, I am disturbed about this.
One of these projects is the extension of the north-south link, and in particular the Brenner base-level tunnel.
Through this project the European Union could demonstrate that it is not just paying lip service to the idea of shifting transit transport from road to rail.
This is an opportunity to reduce the environmental burden on the region concerned and its population.
Moreover, this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Union as a whole.
Unfortunately, however, there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation.
The subsidiary of the Austrian Brenner Railway Company and the Italian Railways, which is supposed to complete the project planning within a period of eighteen months, was only set up at the end of last year.
This means that, more than five years after Essen, there are still no concrete plans on the table.
The people of the region cannot understand that.
For it is they who have to live with the ever-growing avalanche of traffic.
The existing rules, under which a maximum of 10% of the total investment can be funded by the Union, are quite simply inadequate and unfair for projects that have enormous implications for the future of the European economy as a whole.
Member States that will benefit from the completion of the Brenner base-level tunnel cannot shrug off their responsibility and leave it entirely to the countries directly concerned, like Germany, Austria and Italy, to shoulder the financial burden.
In the end, that kind of attitude has nothing to do with solidarity.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first let me very firmly reject Mrs Schroedter' s across-the-board criticism of the TENs.
In fact she has insulted us as well, for Parliament and the Council adopted the 1996 guideline by codecision on a proposal from the Council.
If that was such a terrible thing, the Greens should have opposed it at the time.
They did not do so.
Let me just mention two projects that have been successful.
I think that, from the environmental standpoint, the rail link across the Ãresund was precisely the right thing to do.
We want railways and we want links with remote regions.
The new Anglo-Irish rail links are of great benefit to the environment and the region.
The Greens are quite simply wrong to criticise the TENs as benefiting only the central and most densely populated states.
Secondly, I agree with Mr Ebner and others that, as far as the Brenner base-level tunnel is concerned, we have to think up some new ideas.
Our committee proposes a four-sided agreement between the three states concerned and the Union.
The Brenner base-level tunnel is an unusually large-scale project, and also a project with an unusually significant impact on the environment, for the Alps cannot be compared with the lowlands of the Netherlands or Friesland in Germany.
The environmental situation in the Alps is particularly problematic.
Quite simply, the way the noise and the stench of cars remains trapped in the valleys is quite different from conditions on flat ground.
Something therefore needs to be done in this regard.
Above all, we must persuade governments not to shift the blame onto each other.
The Italians say they will start building when the Austrians build.
The Germans say they will begin building once the Austrians are building.
The Austrians say they will start to build once the Germans and the Italians begin.
So we need clear yardsticks and data on who pays what and when, and the Community must make a serious effort to get this whole project going.
Let me make two final comments.
Madam Vice-President of the Commission. Take your time with the revision of the trans-European networks!
First, you should take another look at all the projects in the light of today' s debate.
We do not want more show projects, 14 or 15 show projects, with no guaranteed financing.
In this revision, we should identify measures as priorities only if we are certain they can be financed over a period of 10-15 years.
For the citizens will lose confidence in us if we declare certain projects to be priorities and then do not execute them.
We must remind the Member States that they have committed themselves to guaranteeing the financing, committed themselves to executing the plan.
Then we really must take them at their word and say: we will only list specific projects if they really are ready to be executed and financed.
Take your time and reopen these difficult discussions with the Member States so that you, as the Commission, do not propose projects in which we make fools of ourselves in front of the citizens, but projects that are feasible!
Mr President, I shall try to speak more slowly this time because last time I gave the interpreters a hard time by speaking at a Mediterranean tempo.
I come from a country which, because of its geographical location, has major transport problems when it comes to sending goods or persons to and from European cities and markets and when it comes to giving and taking.
One can therefore quite easily understand the great interest this country and its representatives have in trans-European networks, which I wish to talk about today.
However, not only as Greeks, but primarily as Europeans, we cannot but treat these networks as an important tool in our endeavour to strengthen social and economic cohesion, employment and sustainable development in our struggle to achieve European integration. And, of course, I disagree with what Mrs Schroedter has just said.
We should indeed accord trans-European networks the real importance which they deserve.
We should ensure that the financial resources spent on TENs are increased.
What is more, allow me to say that we owe this increase since, in the last decade, the need to cut spending in view of the obligation to meet the criteria and objectives of Economic and Monetary Union also badly affected TEN funding.
We should speed up the implementation of these projects by improving procedures and facilitating their funding through flexible public and private sector partnerships.
We should see to it that we overcome any hurdles that are holding up 7 of the 14 Essen projects and leaving us exposed.
And, of course, we should attach importance during the revision of the TEN guidelines to access to island regions and to regions which have difficulty obtaining access to the sea.
The Commission has presented us in its 1998 annual report with a rough picture of the state of progress in the construction of these networks, a picture which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - which, in the report under discussion, is asking for greater efficiency in the whole network construction operation - would like to be more detailed and informative.
The main role in the whole of this extremely important operation for the future of Europe belongs to the Commission and we call on it, in collaboration with the Member States, to give absolute priority, in the full meaning and with all the implications of the word, to developing these main arteries in the body of Europe so that it can function in the way we all want it to and meet the expectations of European citizens.
In closing, I would like to thank and congratulate the chairman of the committee and rapporteur, my fellow countryman Konstantinos Hatzidakis, for the work which he has put into his report which, of course, should be adopted.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is common knowledge that, at regional level in the European Union, there is a close connection between low per capita income, high unemployment and distance from mainland Europe or geographical remoteness, which is currently a serious problem, but which has existed since the industrial revolution of the 19th century, due to underdeveloped communications.
This is a vicious circle, which can only be broken by a political and economic joint action which addresses all the issues that are causing this underdevelopment.
The trans-European networks policy is not, however, being implemented in such a way as to resolve this crucial issue, despite the fact that it was introduced with the specific aim of establishing direct links between remote countries and the Union' s central regions.
The basic aim of the specific projects and budgets of the trans-European networks, as well as those financed by the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which resulted from a policy that was greatly desired by the Member States, yet poorly accepted and supported by the Commission, was to establish direct links between those regions that have a higher per capita income. In doing so, they rode roughshod over the regulations currently in force, with the damaging consequences with which we are all familiar.
The debate on the report by Mr Hatzidakis, whom I congratulate, provides us with a good opportunity to get to grips with the political dimension of the current situation and to try to find a solution to it, in line with the decisive reform of the trans-European networks policy which is due to be implemented in the 2000-2006 period.
It is therefore the intention of our political group, as the amendments that have been presented have highlighted, to ensure that the networks are compatible with sustainable development and that the reform corresponds to the objective of uniting the whole Community by prioritising the remote regions, which have hitherto been neglected. Finally, it is our intention to upgrade the railways and to bring about the decentralisation of the networks, particularly with regard to airports and ports.
The concentration of road, airport and port networks is causing serious congestion and environmental problems which we must prevent.
I hope that we will be able to bring about the changes that the European Union needs in order to achieve the regional balance and social cohesion that we are advocating.
We must be aware that, at this precise moment, Regional Development Plans are being approved for the period 2000-2006 which will contribute to isolating even further the Objective 1 regions, which desperately need a modern connection to the whole of Europe, including high speed rail links.
Amongst these regions are my own country, Galicia, and the entire north-western Iberian Peninsula, covering both Spain and Portugal, an Atlantic region which is crucial to the whole of Europe.
Mr President, this annual report clearly shows that Europe is not providing itself with the means to implement its trans-European transport networks policy.
But apart from the simple budgetary and financial considerations, in more general terms, it is the Commission' s general guidelines in this area that are worthy of criticism.
We do agree, of course, with the principle that it is necessary to create trans-European networks for the people of Europe, for the movement of people and goods, for economic and social cohesion and for rail alternatives to the all-powerful motorway.
We cannot, however, accept the method that has been imposed or the solutions that have been proposed.
Are all the fourteen projects that have been accepted relevant or essential to the needs of local populations?
Have they been devised in association or in consultation, or is the rationale of the trans-European networks, as the report implies, only based on the free market?
It is, moreover, not by chance that out of the fourteen projects, the seven whose timetable and financing are still in doubt are precisely those which do not only answer to the demands of profit.
The most negative aspect, however, seems to be the financing.
It is based on the principle that public funds cannot be increased, which is a moot point.
It therefore proposes to have recourse to private funds, in the form of partnerships, and this, moreover, is an essential element of the project.
This approach to rail transport raises the issue of public service.
Clearly, if private operators are involved in the financing, they will aim for maximum profit.
We must make use of private companies because they profit from the infrastructures, but in the form of tax deductions and not by them having an interest in the capital of railway companies.
The idea of a European public rail service must be developed and we reject privatisation and access to the capital of rail companies, including for new projects.
Once again, Europe is responding to a genuine need on the part of the people, the need for a high-quality European rail transport network, which is outstanding for both passengers and staff, with a race for profit.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me thank our rapporteur very warmly for his report.
The European Commission' s annual report on trans-European networks once again sets out the progress made with many transport projects and emphasises the important part the TENs play in protecting the environment.
I take the view that the 14 projects decided at Essen play a very significant role in the extension of the European transport networks and, like many speakers before me, I want to stress the enormous importance of the Brenner base-level tunnel.
Alpine transit must be looked at and understood as an overall problem.
Certainly Austria, France and the neighbouring states are affected most.
To show you or make you more aware of the seriousness of the situation, let me tell you that about 30% of transit traffic round Switzerland goes via the Brenner, which means that Austria bears the main burden.
It should also be noted that in Austria, 80% of goods are carried by road and only 20% by rail, while in Switzerland the proportion is exactly the reverse.
When some people ask why Austria is getting so agitated, since surely there is a similar volume of traffic elsewhere too, for instance in the Ruhr region, I have to reply yes, that is true, but the topographical features of Tyrol, of the Inntal, simply differ from those in other areas, such as the plains.
Moreover, the Inntal in Austria is one of the most densely populated regions.
Alpine transit is an integral problem which needs to be addressed in integral terms.
We cannot look separately at Brenner, toll roads and Alpine transit.
As for carrying out the construction timetables, I can say that we already have definite construction schedules in the Lower Inntal.
Now we also need a clear political resolve, and not just on the part of the Member States.
What we need is cross-financing.
I would consider the transport costs directive an appropriate legal basis.
I think that would give us sound financing.
I call for public-private partnerships, for I think working together is the best way to succeed.
We have a massive problem with north-south transit.
I am against further studies of the Brenner Pass, for we already have enough of them as it is.
What we need is to complete the Brenner base-level tunnel rapidly, for the sake of the population concerned, the environment and a sustainable, forward-looking transport policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, let me add a few comments to what has been said today about the Brenner base-level tunnel, most of which I more or less support. The Brenner is a particularly good example of the problems besetting trans-European transport today.
Transport by rail, at least to the south of the Brenner, is not operating and the international link is not operating either.
That is why we have such major problems today and if we also need a base-level tunnel because of these mistakes and problems I would suggest that we approach the matter with great sensitivity, and that we proceed with care, for this is a project for centuries to come.
If we do decide to undertake it, we need to choose the environmentally cleanest, economically soundest option, as well as the most functional option.
That is why I have tabled a minor amendment to paragraph 7.
Perhaps we do not need another study, but we should weigh things up properly and select the best project.
I have put one of these projects before the Transport Committee.
There are few better or equally good ones.
We must choose the best because our transport policy, and therefore the EU, will also be measured by this small project.
Mr President, we support the development of a trans-European transport network which will favour rail transport over road transport, on the condition, however, that the development of the great trans-European lines does not prejudice suburban transport or so-called district lines.
Rail transport, the main lines as well as the district ones, should be a public service, which aims to meet the needs of the population, not to generate private profit.
The participation of private capital will necessarily result in a quest for profit, to the detriment both of users and of those who work in the sector.
Far too many recent disasters, particularly the one at Paddington station in Great Britain, illustrate the incompatibility between the quest for profit and safety.
As stipulated in the explanatory statement of the report, public investment is continually decreasing and in less than twenty years, has fallen from 1.5% of the European Union' s GNP to 0.9%.
This has resulted in falling standards in rail transport as a whole as well as staff reductions, which has contributed to keeping unemployment levels high.
If the Member States of the European Union do not adopt a new policy, or, in other words, if they do not prioritise investment in public services rather than endless subsidies to the bosses, any decision on a genuine public transport service operating on a European scale under the best safety conditions will remain nothing but empty rhetoric.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s report states that 1998 saw the consolidation of the trans-European networks and outlines the progress made with various projects in the area of transport, energy and tele- and data communications.
It must, however, be pointed out that the European Union' s budgetary resources fall considerably short of the requirements and the challenge generated by the establishment of a trans-European transport network.
Unless there is an increase in the financial contribution made by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, we will not see any significant progress in this area in the foreseeable future.
I should nevertheless like to stress the fact that recourse to private finance should never be an obstacle to the development of communications in regions which currently have a per capita income well below the Community average.
With regard to the future review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks, I feel I must once again draw the Commission' s attention to the need to attach greater importance to improving access to Europe' s remote and isolated regions, and to focus particularly on establishing sustainable transport networks.
The impact of such investments on the economy of these regions and on employment is a crucial factor in the socio-economic development of these regions.
The Commission' s work programme for the year 2000 lays down that the review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks must concentrate on reducing bottlenecks in order to rationalise traffic in Europe and to make it flow more freely.
As I understand it, this amounts to saying that the review currently being prepared will mainly concern the central regions of the European Union, which are the main victims of these congestion problems.
I can only hope that this hypothesis does not mean that the remote and, to an even greater extent, the extremely remote regions might only be incidentally affected by this review.
This fear, which has been mentioned several times by many of my colleagues, led me to table an amendment to this effect, which was adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and which features in Mr Hatzidakis' s excellent report.
I would be most grateful to you, Commissioner, if, today, you could allay my concerns.
Mr President, growth and employment in Europe depend to a large degree upon exploiting European infrastructure effectively.
We should therefore have already set in motion the TEN projects that have still to get off the ground.
It is no secret that I am very much in favour of a permanent link between Denmark and Germany, and I am glad that the new Danish Minister for Transport is also a supporter of the project.
However, I am a little put out that German politicians are rather less enthusiastic.
There has previously been some doubt as to whether a permanent link across the Fehmarn Belt is the way forward, but any such doubt has now been shown to be groundless.
All the inquiry reports from the Danish and German Ministries of Transport show that there are neither environmental nor financial problems with building a bridge.
With a faster and easier link between Denmark and Germany, we can build bridges to the new democracies in the East.
We are not only building a bridge in physical terms, for practical purposes. We are building a bridge between countries to help industry and for human, political, social and cultural reasons.
Building a permanent link between Germany and Denmark will create many new and much-needed jobs in the area.
There are almost always people who automatically say 'no' to anything new.
Anything which brings about change is a little frightening, whether it be EMU, the euro, environmentalism or a bridge.
One should not, however, be afraid of something good.
A link across the Fehmarn Belt is an exciting, rather than a frightening project.
Finally, I should like to add my voice to the call to increase the budget appropriations for the trans-European transport networks, as they are quite inadequate.
Improved growth and employment require sums of a quite different order.
Mr President, when, at the Essen Summit, the necessary extensive investments in infrastructure were decided upon, it was mainly a question of motorways and high-speed trains crossing national frontiers in a Europe where investments have traditionally been made principally in the individual countries.
That is precisely why this decision was so extraordinarily important. A properly functioning internal market will never, of course, be possible without extensive investment in this area.
Today' s report nonetheless raises a number of questions about how we are actually to follow up our various decisions.
A few of these TEN projects have been carried out within a reasonable timeframe.
Personally, I am very glad that one of these projects in particular has been carried out, namely the permanent link across the Sound between Sweden and Denmark which is to be opened on time in just a few months.
I am more doubtful, however, where a number of the other projects are concerned.
As quite a number of people here have said, many of these projects are being developed awfully slowly.
The rapporteur who, by the way, has done a quite excellent job, has expressed his concern about this.
It is, indeed, very worrying when these ventures are not taken seriously.
Let me give an example of this.
It concerns the Nordic triangle, designed to link the Scandinavian capitals by high-speed train and motorway.
This is something which the countries concerned have undertaken to carry out, but it is a terribly slow process.
Money is forever being transferred to other projects which are obviously considered more important than this major European project.
This happens because there is every opportunity to transfer money in this way, there being no proper deadlines for when the projects concerned are to be carried out.
Neither the road nor the railway ventures are, therefore, going to be finished within a reasonable period of time.
I should therefore like, here today, to ask the Commission' s representative a number of questions.
When does the Commission think that the Nordic triangle and the other TEN projects will be complete?
What is the Commission actually doing to make sure that they are in fact completed?
Is the Commission prepared to commit itself to establishing specific deadlines for completing the outstanding projects and, subsequently, also to ensure that these deadlines are met?
Mr President, I would firstly like to express my sincere gratitude for the work accomplished by Mr Hatzidakis, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the review of the trans-European networks which, in the coming months, I will have to present to this House.
I believe that his work will contribute decisively to the documents which the Commission will produce.
I would also like to express my thanks for the contribution made by Mrs Sbarbati, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, as well as for the interventions of the other speakers who have participated in this debate.
I believe that, as well as analysing the situation, the most important thing is to look to the future.
Accordingly, I will take this opportunity to make some observations on behalf of the Commission.
Firstly, I fully agree with Mr Hatzidakis on the importance given to Community policy on trans-European networks and I also share Parliament' s concern, expressed not only by Mr Hatzidakis, but also by the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and by other MEPs, on the need for this policy to be provided with adequate financial resources.
In this respect, I would like to thank Parliament for its support for the provision of a total of EUR 4.6 billion for the period 2000-2006 for this chapter.
Nevertheless, I should remind Members that, every year, the Commission gives consideration to projects which amount to three times the amount allocated annually in this budget.
At the same time, there is an agreement by all parties not to increase the overall budgets and, in this respect, you have also heard my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, talk of our current budgetary difficulties resulting from new needs and matters of urgency, such as meeting the Union' s main political commitments following the war in Kosovo.
In this respect, I share the European Parliament' s concern with regard to the adequate funding of transport networks, but I believe that we can jointly assume some of these responsibilities.
I would like to remind you that we know that Community support for projects carried out during 1996, 1997 and 1998 has accounted for 30% of the total, which is a very significant figure.
It is true that these include projects in Objective 1 areas and cohesion countries, which has allowed the percentage of cofinancing to be greater.
However, I must tell you that we cannot provide you with overall information, because we are not only talking about Community finance but also about finance provided by individual countries and private sectors in some cases, as well as regions and local authorities.
Therefore, we can only provide the information which is available to us and make analyses based on that data.
We therefore reiterate something that Mr Jarzembowski said, which is that some of those responsible are from outside the Commission and, of course, the will of the different Member States of the Union to promote and implement these projects is of crucial importance.
You say that some projects are being delayed.
In this regard, I would like to say that the target date is 2010.
There is therefore still time to implement them within the time limit.
Furthermore, some of the projects present great technical difficulties.
I will concentrate for a moment on one of the most talked-about projects: the Brenner base-level tunnel.
That tunnel is a symbolic project as far as the European Union' s technological capacities and its ability to act are concerned.
We are talking about 54 kilometres of tunnel in one of our most mountainous areas, with a series of unknown factors and uncertainties which require that the project be guaranteed as far as possible before we make such a huge investment as the one required for the Brenner tunnel.
In order to carry out the Channel Tunnel project, it was necessary to carry out major studies before establishing the routes and detailing and beginning the project.
This is also true in the case of the Brenner.
It is perhaps better to begin something late, but to begin with all the guarantees in place, than to find half way through that the studies have not warned us of some difficulty or other, meaning that we have to go into reverse, which would cause even greater delays.
In fact, new studies are under way, through an agreement between a group of interested parties, to determine the definitive route of the Brenner tunnel.
It has not been abandoned, it is just that it is an enormously complex project, ladies and gentlemen, and we must understand that these studies will probably take a further five years to complete.
I want to make this very clear.
We are talking about very far-off dates, but this does not mean that there is no will.
On the contrary, there is an absolute will.
This must, however, be based on the certainty that the project can be carried out in a way which will not damage our credibility.
Furthermore, I would like to point out that the level of funding in terms of the total appropriations for the 14 principal TEN projects has been 60%.
That was the percentage which you, the Parliament, considered appropriate in your most recent resolutions.
It is midway between your initial proposal and the Council' s proposal.
In reply to some of the questions raised, I would like to tell you that, with regard to the changes to the financial rules for the trans-European networks approved last year, new financing possibilities were created by means of partnerships between the public and private sectors. These partnerships will be promoted in various ways.
Firstly, thanks to the introduction of a multiannual indicative programme which will allow for private sector support with greater security and where the developers will enjoy guaranteed Community funding for several years.
That programme will cover the period 2001-2006.
Secondly, the budget line for trans-European networks will contribute risk capital financing, which could promote - and I hope this is the case - the creation of investment funds geared to the TENs and, to this end, we have already asked for expressions of interest.
We are about to review the guidelines on the trans-European transport networks.
I will be presenting this review report and an initial proposal shortly.
However, it must be said that the objectives of the trans-European networks are the development of the single market and social and economic cohesion. I would like to make this very clear.
Therefore, the remote regions, the extremely remote regions and the least developed regions must be at the heart of Community action.
However, resolving bottlenecks does not harm the remote regions. I would like to give one very clear example: the bottleneck on the railway in Bordeaux.
Does this affect France? Yes, of course it affects south-west France, but only to a degree.
Its real impact is on the whole of the centre and west of the Iberian Peninsula, that is, most of Spain and Portugal.
So when we clear a bottleneck in Bordeaux, we are in fact benefiting the development of an area of the Iberian Peninsula.
What I mean to say is that acting in a central area does not always harm the interests of the remote areas, but, on the contrary, in many cases it is perfectly interrelated.
Mr President, lastly, I would like to refer to the question of the intelligent management of traffic.
This aspect will also be included as a key element in the review of the trans-European networks.
I would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis once again and express my gratitude for his work as well as that of the other speakers.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
European airline industry
The next item is the report (A5-0075/2000) by Mr Sterckx, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The European Airline Industry: from Single Market to Worldwide Challenges [COM(1999) 182 - C5-0110/1999 - 1999/2113(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, the question you are really asking in your communication is: what does the future hold for the European aviation industry?
That is the key question approximately ten years on from the start of liberalisation within that sector.
Liberalisation, as you point out in your communication, set a growth process in motion; new companies have sprung up, new routes have opened, new air fares have in fact been put in place, and so this has attracted a new kind of public to the aviation industry.
The existing large and small national airline companies have become more profitable and have started to operate more efficiently without government funding.
All these aspects demonstrate that liberalisation has stirred the market.
We could say that passengers have generally benefited from liberalisation, but not all of them.
For example, it is evident that the benefits in business class are only minor compared to those in other passenger categories.
We now wonder how solid the basis for the European aviation industry is.
In your communication, you stated that fragmentation is still far more pronounced here than it is in the United States.
We have more or less the same number of airline companies, but their share of the global market is 38%, whereas ours is 27%, which is a huge difference.
You also stated in your communication that the profitability of our companies is considerably less than that of our American counterparts.
We also question the viability of the new companies which are appearing on the market, because how long will they last and how solid are they?
One cannot help but wonder how many of these will still be operating within the European market in ten years' time.
Also, how tenable and sustainable is the growth we have witnessed within this sector over the past decade?
We are faced with an overcrowded airspace, or should I say a badly managed airspace?
We have congested airports to contend with and this is why, Commissioner, it is of great importance that you at long last make a proposal on the management of slot allocations for airports.
I think this is a matter of life and death, especially for small companies starting out in the aviation industry.
We have also asked ourselves about social development and the rights of passengers.
This is why I wanted to ask you what the outcome was of the agreement recently reached on Gibraltar on this matter.
Is that in any way related to aviation?
These are questions which we are still left with.
Important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation.
Firstly, air traffic control should, of course, be Europeanised.
This topic is also covered in Mr Atkins' report and I will be tabling an oral amendment on this matter tomorrow, to replace 'privatisation' by 'liberalisation' .
This was agreed upon in conjunction with the large political groups.
It is clear that another aspect, namely safety, should also be Europeanised.
A European Aviation Safety Authority should therefore be set up as a matter of urgency.
It is obvious that the Member States need to take a step back as far as these two aspects are concerned.
I will now move on to the key point in your communication, namely the fact that there is no external policy for European aviation, in other words that the rights with regard to third countries have been negotiated bilaterally.
This, of course, determines the entire structure of the aviation industry in Europe.
Normally speaking, after a liberalisation process, companies tend to operate in tune with the market which has been liberalised.
This is actually quite rare in the world of aviation.
No mergers have taken place.
An attempt to that effect was made by KLM and Alitalia, but this has now been abandoned, due in actual fact to a number of problems related to nationality, if I can put it that way.
A merger between Swissair and SABENA is still on the cards, but we rely there on an agreement with Switzerland which we will be discussing this week and on a forthcoming referendum in Switzerland.
What is happening is that, although European companies join forces with their American counterparts, they play second fiddle to the Americans.
This is why I, as rapporteur, have a few questions with regard to your proposal to establish this common transatlantic air space.
I am in favour of this in principle, but I do wonder whether we are not rushing into things or whether this is not too big a step, considering there is no solid base in place for the European aviation industry.
A number of very complex problems need to be solved first before we can take the second step.
As rapporteur, I am personally quite suspicious of America' s nationalism when it comes to transport, including aviation.
Negotiations must clearly be held with a great deal of openness and reciprocity, as it is put, and the European companies must have exactly the same rights as the Americans, otherwise negotiations are bound to break down.
Only then, as things currently stand in European aviation, will we be capable of competing with the Americans within an open market.
An important question is: what do we do if we cannot pull it off with the Americans?
What do we do then on our own?
How viable is the European industry if it is confined to the European boundaries and to those bilateral agreements?
What is more - and I have skated over this aspect in my report, but Mrs Lucas has drafted a report on the environment which deals with this at length - we need to acknowledge that there are limits.
The environment too has its limits and this is an important, in fact, vital question which we may need to ask ourselves, not so much following on from my report but following on from Mrs Lucas' report.
Secondly, intermodality is highlighted in my report too.
I think that the Commission too should be clear about this and should issue proposals to promote intermodality.
Trains and planes could work together very well in a number of areas.
At all events, Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that liberalisation has been hugely important.
I am well aware of this, although we are not even halfway there.
In order to improve the current situation, we need to receive from the Commission proposals, concrete action plans and legal texts which we can debate within the very short term.
It is also clear that the Member States have a very important responsibility and that a great deal depends on them and on how much they are prepared to put into creating real European aviation and a real European aviation industry.
I think, therefore, that Parliament too, in tandem with the Commission and the Council, cannot work fast enough on this score because the world will not wait for us.
As such, we need to get a move on, otherwise we will be buried under an avalanche.
Mr President, as draftsman for the Industry Committee I just want to pick up on a couple of areas which I think need to be mentioned today.
Aviation is without doubt one of the most exciting and stimulating industries.
The opportunities for business and job creation during the last decade have played a major part in the economies of countries in Europe and worldwide.
For example, aviation in the UK contributes GBP 10.2 billion a year to the UK GDP and generates and supports 380 000 indirect and induced UK jobs.
It transports GBP 35 billion' s worth of UK exports, maintaining unrivalled access to the global market, and this is multiplied ten-fold across the European Community.
When I began my career in the aviation industry 30 years ago, very few people could afford to fly.
But today, with the liberalisation of the market, flying for most people has become a way of life.
The report covers a number of areas and outlines fairly accurately the way the aviation industry has developed over the last ten years.
But in a number of areas there is little recognition by the Commission of the benefits the aviation industry, including aerospace, have brought and I am disappointed by the negative attitude towards the industry in this paper.
One of the key factors in the success of the last 20 years has been the privatisation of the national state-owned industries which began in the 1980s.
I also welcome the Commission statement that subsidies have now ceased.
When we look at the choice of routings and so on for the consumer, air fares have come down considerably over the last few years.
Fares from the UK are amongst some of the lowest, showing what effect having three major carriers operating out of one country can have on competition and pricing.
This has produced the real benefits and other countries need to take a look at this.
The report outlines at some length the expansion in capacity which has taken place in the European aviation industry, particularly across the north Atlantic, but that is obviously quite a complicated issue.
I fully accept that there are challenges which need to be addressed such as problems with congestion, in particular air traffic control.
However, I believe that the Commission has a responsibility to put forward more balanced views which do not undermine the value and success of an industry which has made an enormous contribution, not only to the countries of the European Union but worldwide.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supported Mr Sterckx' s report in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as it will support it in plenary.
The key message, as Mr Sterckx has reiterated, is that basically liberalisation has succeeded in principle.
As a result we now have substantially more competition.
This stronger competition has also created some movement in price levels, not in all market areas, certainly, but in many of them.
Furthermore, what many people feared has not come to pass, namely job losses and deteriorating working conditions, and instead we continue to see rising employment.
In the space of about eight years, employment figures have risen by nearly 50 000 and there really has been no evidence of a lasting decline in working conditions unless we look at this in the context of what has happened nationally, which is that national airlines are in a sense being transformed into modern service industries, which is, of course, accompanied by changes in working conditions and their modernisation.
Nonetheless I am glad that the report does address the fact that we, of course, expect common rules - even if for a different reason, namely because of safety aspects -with regard, for instance, to working hours and flight times, because, at the end of the day, it is training and actual working conditions that will partly determine how safe we can make European aviation over the long term.
Mr Sterckx also made it clear, however, that liberalisation concerns only a very small area of European air transport, which can largely be regarded as successful, but there are many other areas that currently continue to give us problems, whether these are old, unresolved problems or new ones.
We are a long way from having a uniform, common European air transport market, in principle.
I think in future we will have to deal with four important points.
Mr Sterckx has already addressed some of them, and I would like to raise them again.
In my view, the Member States' airlines must, of course, be in a position to have equal access to the international market, like other airlines in the world.
At the same time, we must ensure that the airline companies really do achieve economic stability, which means we have to try to ensure, through appropriate competition on the ground, that the immense costs of, for instance, landing and ground handling charges are reduced to the kind of level that is usual in other countries of the world.
Secondly, let me emphasise that we do want to see more air transport.
It enhances individual mobility.
But, on the other hand, we must not disregard environmental conditions.
My position is fairly clear on this point.
Bans are not the right method; instead we need incentives, we need to give support for the airlines to move towards reducing emissions by using modern fleets that use less kerosene and also produce less pollution.
Thirdly, in my view we need to improve consumer protection because obviously the growing number of passengers brings increasing problems with it and, in this regard, the passenger deserves more protection than the airline.
My fourth and final point, and the one I consider most important, is that we must ensure that we also have a single European airspace and we must establish a uniform system of air traffic control in order to reduce delays and congestion.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his report.
It is the first in a series of reports on aviation which we will be dealing with in the course of this year.
We support the development of a European aviation space encompassing all aspects of aviation, ranging from delays to environmental harm.
In addition, we think that, at world level, the Union must be able to show a united front on this matter.
We also have our doubts regarding the restrictions and automatic responses generated by national sentiment which, to this day, play such a significant role in European aviation.
I would like to illustrate this with air traffic control, for example.
These national responses and preferences also hamper cooperation, as we recently witnessed in the unfortunate breakdown in cooperation between KLM and Alitalia.
We will not protest in cases where liberalisation can help achieve a more effective policy, but it is a pragmatic approach and not a dogmatic one.
Indeed, where the interests of public services or the environment so require, we will not hesitate to advocate an active stance on the part of the authorities.
We would also draw attention to the human side of developments within aviation.
This is dominated by three issues: firstly safety.
We back the setting up of a European Aviation Safety Authority which unites as many countries as possible.
Our amendment on widening the scope in this way has been adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Common standards and inspection agreements boost safety levels.
This should not be restricted to the EU.
We can and must help improve safety agreements throughout Europe.
One is led to believe that lower costs as a result of liberalisation only have benefits.
This may be the case for some passengers, but upon examination of recent annual reports of major aviation companies, this conclusion does not immediately follow.
Personnel too experience the adverse, social effects of cost reductions.
We do not want to let this situation get out of hand, especially when safety issues can be in the balance if, for example, pilots have to fly long hours.
Finally, air fares may seem low, but often the overall interests of the passengers are hardly taken into consideration.
It is no fun having to wait for hours because of a delay, on top of which you are likely to miss your connecting flight.
It is even less fun if you become the victim of overbooking.
Mr Sterckx rather feebly states in his present report that information on these situations must be made available to passengers.
A fat lot of good that will do them.
Passengers have rights and, more than anything, they have the right to be informed at the time when a problem arises.
As I understand it, airports will be installing notice boards this summer on which they will display passenger rights in the event of delays, for example.
This is a step in the right direction.
It would be better still if the amendment on passengers' right to information tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists were to be adopted in addition.
We are always harping on about consumer interests, well, here is one.
Mr President, I only have a few minutes so I want to focus on just one particular point in the Commission communication.
Let us recall that the title of this communication is 'From single market to worldwide challenges' .
Yet one of the remarkable things about this communication is that it does not appear to recognise that one of those worldwide challenges must be how the airline industry will respond to increasing environmental concerns and likely environmental legislation.
Of all the many words in this communication, just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue.
As rapporteur for a very good Commission communication on aviation and environment I know that the issue of environment and competitiveness is a very live one with strong feelings on both sides of the debate.
For example, that communication starts by saying that the growth of the air transport industry is, and I quote, "unsustainable and must be reversed because of its impact on climate and on the quality of life and health of European citizens" and it goes on to say very clearly that 'business as usual' is not an option.
It is quite obvious that aviation' s response to environmental concerns will have effects on competitiveness, some positive and some negative.
Let us not underestimate either the impact of aviation on the environment.
A report launched in the UK just yesterday by a number of environmental NGOs including Friends of the Earth forcefully made the case that one flight to and from the US could cause more pollution than the average UK motorist causes in a year.
It makes the case that the world' s 16 000 commercial jet aircraft produce more than 600 million tonnes of CO2 every year - nearly as much as all the countries of Africa put together.
It makes the case that the number of people flying will almost double in the next fifteen years.
I would ask therefore that we see a bit more environmental mainstreaming.
Rather than confining the environmental aspects of aviation to a report solely devoted to that subject, we should be seeing environment threaded through all approaches to this policy area, particularly one which purports to be addressing issues of competitiveness.
Mr Sterckx has included environment in this own report.
I very much welcome that but I would also like to see environment automatically mainstreamed through all Commission reports and communications.
Mr President, in the first half of the previous century, many opinion formers claimed that the air offered enough space for unlimited growth in international transport.
There was ground congestion and new infrastructure was very expensive, but anything was still possible in the air.
Meanwhile, the countries at the heart of the European Union have been faced with unexpected problems.
Thanks to free competition, record low prices and cheap, tax-free fuel, the airspace has become overcrowded there.
Gigantic airports emerged near Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam with a great deal of transit movement for travellers from outside Europe.
These airports continue to grow and they place a huge burden on their surroundings.
Not only do those living near the airports complain, passengers too are dissatisfied. They are increasingly faced with delays.
The air has more or less reached capacity levels in that respect.
Thanks to new navigation techniques and low-noise aircraft, it may be possible to increase the number of flights for a little while longer, but this will inevitably have an adverse effect on the environment, safety and the reliability of the service.
We have reached the limits of growth.
Further growth of freight and passenger transport will need to be accommodated by alternative means: by rail or on water.
Meanwhile, however, competition between air traffic - which is favoured by government policy - and trains and ships has become fierce.
This is why the proportion of international train traffic and freight transport by river and canal has dropped so dramatically.
There are considerably fewer international through train connections within the European Union compared to 20 years ago.
In the remote areas of the European Union, however, it seems as if time has stood still there.
People still complain there that remote regions and islands are not sufficiently serviced.
New, small airports are expected to perform miracles as they could attract rich business people and masses of tourists.
What is more, the areas surrounding the Mediterranean tourist beaches are also increasingly afflicted by accidents, noise and air pollution, and nature reserves are being sacrificed.
During the discussion on Mr Sterckx' s report, it has already transpired in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as well as from amendments tabled on this topic, that opinion is strongly divided on this matter within Parliament.
Certain Members favour an increase in the number of aircraft, the lifting of all legal restrictions in this connection and continued reductions in air fares.
I hear this opinion mainly from those Members who endlessly complain within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that their flight was once again delayed and who are very much guided by these personal experiences in their vision of transport policy.
According to other Members, air traffic has grown far too much over the past decades. In their view, the conservation and protection of the natural environment are far more important than fast or cheap transport, and air traffic has already supplanted far too much rail traffic.
It is high time that the safety and health of passengers, personnel and population on the ground were made the top priority.
My Group is very much in favour of the second opinion, relating to the environment, safety and the interests of personnel.
Air traffic cannot continue to grow endlessly and we cannot afford to subordinate all kinds of other matters to this.
We consider that Mr Sterckx' s report falls short of being able to solve the actual problems but it is a first step in the right direction.
I am pleased that the rapporteur seemed prepared to adopt a number of amendments concerning safety and the environment at an early stage.
Mr President, the Sterckx report is excellent and develops a point of great relevance in great depth.
It may not be obvious, but air transport is not an end in itself: air transport moves capital, it moves industries - be it the tourist industry or some other industry - and it brings people into contact, not merely in the pursuit of leisure, but in order to clinch business deals.
The contribution made by air transport to the European and global economies is truly great, and it should therefore be both promoted and regulated.
Regulated in that, all too often, there is insufficient planning, airports are located in inconvenient places and airlines are prevented from expanding by the presence of military corridors or restrictions.
Clearly, we must not forget that the air industry is among the most global industries, for, nowadays, an aircraft can easily fly all over the world, especially if it is a high endurance aircraft.
Therefore, while nowadays, it is an easy matter to relocate an industrial plant, it is even easier to relocate an airline, in that the means of production itself is, by definition, mobile.
Then there is a problem of competition, particularly competition from the United States in the form of those huge carriers which are governed by standardised legislation which, I regret, is lacking in the European Union, both in the sphere of air traffic control - with the result that operational standardisation is lacking as well as legislative standardisation - and as regards the recognition of professional qualifications.
For example, even today, an Italian pilot with professional qualifications obtained in Italy cannot do the same job in Belgium.
Another issue to be resolved is the age limit.
Some countries of the European Union allow pilots to continue flying up until the age of 65, but in other countries they have to stop working at 60.
I therefore call upon the Commission to adopt common legislation governing the whole of the Union as soon as possible.
Mr President, aviation is undergoing turbulent times.
The report drafted by Mr Sterckx elaborates on the effects of strong growth within the sector.
The enormous competition within the industry has led to a price war in certain sectors.
The number of passengers and, alongside this, the number of flights, is growing at an alarming rate.
The rapporteur is looking for the solution to congestion in a common airspace and European air traffic control. I support him in this.
Competition also leads to lower costs.
The pressure on personnel in the sector is increasing both socially and financially.
It is vital to guarantee their rights.
I endorse the rapporteur' s observations that proposals are required which deal with the social dimension.
Passengers also suffer as a result of the commercial war.
Although air fares have come down in certain areas, there are situations in which their rights - including those in the event of overbooking - are under real threat.
This too needs to be regulated.
The impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance.
Achievements as regards innovations in terms of emission values, noise and harmful substances cannot offset the environmental damage caused by the dramatic growth in aviation.
And this is not likely to change in the foreseeable future
It is therefore necessary to consider the position which we want to, and must, accord aviation.
In some cases, only air transport is possible but in the case of holidays, for example, the increasing demand for transport can only be met through other means.
This report should also accommodate the downside of a worldwide aviation market.
Solutions which spring to mind in this respect include a common traffic control system, stimulation of technological innovation for engines and promotion of alternative methods of transport for passengers and goods, i.e. trains for passengers and coastal navigation for goods.
In my opinion, imposing VAT on flight services and excise on kerosene, which are, in fact, levied on other means of transportation - at intra-European level if necessary - will contribute to a more balanced view of the costs generated by the different means of transportation.
In short, the aviation industry is heading for stormy weather.
It is up to us to guide it through this in the interests of society.
In our opinion, the rapporteur is steering things in the right direction.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to shed more light on one aspect of the Sterckx report, the question of airspace control, air traffic control.
I believe that paragraph 8 of the Sterckx report adopts the right approach, for we must look to the medium and short term.
I shall begin with the medium term.
In the medium term we must transfer regulative competencies for air traffic control to the European Union, something that is entirely feasible.
There is no point in people coming along and saying, well, Eurocontrol has far more members and is far better.
Eurocontrol does not work and that has been proven.
One reason is that it operates according to the unanimity principle and the principle of the lowest common denominator.
I think the European Economic Area sets a good example.
If the Community of 15 has the authority to set regulations, and if 12 countries want to join the EU in the next few years, then we will have reached the figure of 27.
If we follow the example of the European Economic Area with Norway and Iceland, then there will no problem with including Switzerland in the same system.
We therefore need EU competencies in this area, so that we can decide by a majority on the basis of Community law, rather than having to abide by unanimity and international treaties.
We also need private service companies to carry out the actual operations.
I admit that Mr Sterckx would like to see the term "privatisation" replaced with "liberalisation" .
I think we will be happy to endorse that.
But we need competition, and, of course, he agrees with us on that.
We must move away from a situation of monopolies and here I would like you to consider - although this is by no means a revolutionary idea - that if we have a single market on the ground, we could also have a single market in the skies, and that we should certainly allow different cooperating or competing service companies to control certain European aviation routes beyond the national borders, that we should move beyond the small-state mentality and offer services to airlines.
We must go further in this regard. In any case, we will be discussing this again in connection with the Atkins report.
I now turn to the short-term aspects.
We are all grateful to the Vice-President for setting up a high-level working party with a view to achieving results in the short term too.
I can only call on the 15 governments to instruct their civilian and military advisers to actually deliver solutions to the Vice-President by the end of the month, so that we will have something concrete to consider in June, and so that the Vice-President can respond to practical requests and take practical action, such as occasionally using military areas for civil aviation.
We must therefore proceed with practical solutions, for we cannot have the same situation this summer as last summer: congested airspace, stacked aircraft, the pointless, constant combustion of kerosene in the air, i.e. environmental pollution of the first order!
Let us hope that if the Member States really provide the Vice-President with what she wants, she can then present us with a good proposal that also includes short-term measures which can enter into force this summer.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx for his report which addresses an important aspect of the civil aviation industry.
There is no doubt that civil aviation has grown considerably over the last ten years and it is predicted to continue growing in the foreseeable future.
There are those who would argue that this is due solely to the liberalisation process within that sector.
Whilst I and my Group recognise that this has had a considerable effect on aviation' s growth, other factors have also contributed.
In the initial stages of liberalisation, a lot of people lost their jobs, those who remained had to work longer hours and others suffered a deterioration in their working conditions.
Also, on some routes, fares increased while others were so cheap that airlines went bust or built up huge losses.
Another result of liberalisation has been the practice of co-sharing, of airline alliances, and in some instances even takeovers.
We are beginning to see now an increase in aircraft registered outside the EU similar to the maritime sector' s flag of convenience.
At my own airport in Manchester there are Icelandic-registered aircraft and I have been to Iceland more times than they have.
The reason why I mention these points is just to lend some balance to the argument.
It is very easy to say that liberalisation in aviation has been a glowing success, without ever recognising that there is also a negative side.
My Group accepts that gradual liberalisation is a way forward but only if safety, working conditions and passenger rights are safe-guarded and strengthened.
We accept that an increasing number of EU citizens are demanding better services.
My Group welcomes the latest decision by the Commission to launch a campaign to inform passengers of their rights - something which the airlines in particular have failed to do over many years.
We believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and cancellations.
We have all heard the excuses offered by the airlines, ranging from "aircraft going technical" , which is aviation-speak for 'I' m afraid there are not enough people booked on so we are going to consolidate' . "Air traffic delays" is the next one, but of course that is an easy excuse because there is never anyone from air traffic control there to say that is not the issue.
Then of course there is the 'get them on board' scenario, irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not.
Without doubt aviation has made considerable progress, but I also believe that aviation has a responsibility to its passengers, to its workforce, and also to the environment.
Finally, my Group looks forward to receiving from the Commission its new proposals regarding slot-allocation, even though they have been a long time in coming.
I hope this document will embody the view of the fair market access for all, in particular in clarifying the present legislative position regarding the trading of slots.
Mr President, the report we are discussing today deals with the results of the liberalisation of the air transport sector in the European Union, which was concluded in 1993.
We have supported this liberalisation process so that bilateral barriers may be lifted, ownership restrictions changed, technical standards harmonised, and suitable safety standards established and so that the conditions of liberalisation may promote greater transparency with regard to how air transport development policy is framed and allow, above all, the inclusion of environmental considerations in production within the aeronautical industry, in tariff policy and in the management of air traffic.
A key point raised by the rapporteur is the current situation in which, while the aviation industry is liberalised and operates in an open European market, the authorities which control the air space, the airports and the regulating bodies, as well as the companies providing services to the air transport sector, still operate from an excessively local point of view.
The rapporteur also mentions, as an unresolved issue, the continued state presence, in certain cases, in the ownership of national airlines.
Turning in particular to air traffic control, the development of a common system of air safety is a fine challenge for the future.
We must not forget that European airspace is a mosaic made up of 15 sovereign Member States, which, for a variety of reasons, mainly military, find it difficult to relinquish part of their sovereignty in this area.
To this end, we must concern ourselves with resolving the issue of the policy of privatising the operational bodies responsible for air traffic control.
With regard to charges, we share the Commission' s opinion that the costs over which the airlines have no control - ground assistance charges, airport taxes and atmospheric costs - must be transparent and non-discriminatory.
Turning to the Sterckx report, our contribution has concentrated on the environmental aspects related to it.
Our main criticism centres on the fact that the Commission, in its overall analysis, is trying to treat environmental, safety and health aspects in the aeronautical sector as a separate debate, by means of a separate communication, when, in reality, the impact of these factors on the future of the industry is crucial.
I would finally like to mention some basic points.
Airlines' pricing policy must include the external environmental costs of air transport. The regulation of slot allocation must be reviewed according to specific environmental criteria, taking account of noise and emissions into the atmosphere, and specific actions should be taken in order to strengthen intermodality with other trans-European networks, especially with railways, in light of the conclusions of the report on aviation and the global environment, which considers that more than 10% of European short-haul air traffic could change from air to rail.
Mr President, according to the Commission proposal adopted by our rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, the main stated aim is to liberalise air transport further and make it subject to the rules of the free market.
In this way, or so the Commission and our rapporteur tell us, we will see reduced expenditure on the part of airlines, better passengers services and more innovation.
It is therefore proposed that airports, with all the strategic importance which they have for a country' s safety, should be surrendered to the multinationals, despite the negative implications this would have, and that the aspirations of private-sector airport owners to reap maximum profits should be promoted.
It is also proposed that the sovereign right of each country to control air traffic in its air space should be surrendered to the European Union, on the pretext of establishing a uniform system of air safety. At the same time, the proposal calls for the privatisation of the operational bodies responsible for air traffic control which, it says, will be responsible for all the EU' s air space and will compete with each other.
This proposal, aside from abrogating the sovereign right of each country over its own air space, will give rise to confusion and will have particularly negative and dangerous repercussions on air safety as, objectively speaking, the competition which is being vaunted here as the trump card will be competition for maximum profit and not for maximum air safety.
The proposal argues that all this will reduce flight delays and hence the expenditure of the airlines.
And maybe it will.
Nonetheless, as experience with similar cases shows, it is doubtful whether a rise in profits will mean cheaper tickets or improved services.
On the contrary, the situation will deteriorate.
It is also proposed to end state aid to airlines. This, however, will prove disastrous for air connections to and from disadvantaged areas.
Greece is a typical example.
This ignores the indisputable fact, as the experience of official organisations and trade unions for workers in the civil aviation industry around the world has shown, that constant reductions in the running costs of aircraft and ground services, together with wall-to-wall privatisation and the private sector' s goal of maximum profit, are the reason for the continuous rise in the number of air accidents.
These are the reasons why we shall be voting against the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that the aim of Mr Sterckx' s report was to guarantee security, safety, consumer protection, fair competition and environmental protection.
We agree with these objectives, but we cannot support the project to create a regulatory authority for air transport safety.
We would like to have further information, particularly regarding the formation of this authority and we would like to know who would be responsible for monitoring it and by what means they would do so.
Furthermore, paragraph 8 calls for, and I quote, "the operational bodies responsible for ATC to be privatised" .
We do not think that this is a wise suggestion.
We are totally opposed to any kind of further privatisation, which could exacerbate the already deteriorating working conditions, in this area which is so closely linked to passenger safety.
This privatisation will result in major job losses and will certainly have a damaging impact on safety.
European skies are comparatively safe, and we want to see that safety preserved.
To conclude, in order to guarantee the primacy of safety regulations over all other considerations, air traffic control must remain a public and national service.
Mr President, I would first of all like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr Sterckx on his excellent report.
It has come, I believe, at a time when the aviation industry is very much in the limelight, what with the takeover agreement between Swiss Air and Sabena, the breakdown of the marriage between KLM and Alitalia, as well as the vicissitudes surrounding Malpensa.
One could therefore say that there is a lot of commotion in the industry and this makes the report all the more topical.
Despite the many advantages described by Mr Sterckx, the liberalisation of aviation has not given us heaven on earth - or not yet anyway.
Just as Europe and EMU will need to be restored ecologically and socially, we will have to assimilate liberalisation with measures designed to better organise the airspace, increase safety and improve consumer and environmental protection.
It became apparent during the Strasbourg debate on night flights only two weeks ago that European legislation on aviation leaves a great deal to be desired.
Liberalisation without a common aviation policy and without a unified airspace will inevitably lead to problems.
It is estimated that air traffic will double in the next fifteen years.
At present, one in three flights is delayed and 450 000 flight hours are lost annually, and unless far-reaching measures are taken, the situation will only get worse.
What is actually preventing us from taking a number of additional measures, except for a powerful lobby of airline companies and a misconceived concept of sovereignty in some countries which refuse to let go of the management of their own national airspace?
We have a unified market, free movement of people and a single currency.
Why can we not move towards a single European airspace more rapidly?
Moreover, I fully endorse the idea of a common transatlantic air space, provided that this is not subject to unilateral European concessions.
This is most certainly a lesson we need to learn from the vicissitudes of the hushkits affair.
As far as the allocation of slots is concerned, I believe that more consideration should be given to environmental criteria, such as noise and exhaust fumes.
In addition, the government should invest more in measures which improve the quality of life of those living near airports.
This is often the case and is most needed at smaller, regional airports.
In summary, and by way of conclusion, I would like to advocate a pax avianautica.
The ingredients of the pax avianautica which we need to pursue are a unified airspace, a common aviation policy, viable airports in a comfortable environment, increased safety and strong, European airline companies.
My home town of Ostend, with its noisy and unsafe, regional airport, will not fully understand the meaning of the European Union until we have achieved this.
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank our colleague, Dirk Sterckx, who has put an enormous amount of work into a report which is extremely important as it is a policy document that will lead to a great deal of further discussion.
Personally, I fully agree with the committee' s report, in that there is a need to open up the European skies, and with the need to unify them, since, although roads have been unified, the railways, the sea and the skies are not yet in that position.
It is extremely important that we move in this direction, but this should not be limited to the creation of a new market.
Personally, for several reasons, I feel that the tone of the report is excessively smug with regard to the liberalisation that has already taken place.
Firstly, the competition with which we are familiar has created two air spaces: that of the major routes on which we see congestion, delays, queues and broadly inadequate consumer protection laws, although prices have, of course, fallen. And then there is the air space of the smaller routes, which is expensive and which has largely been overlooked by the market.
I live in Bordeaux, but it is more expensive for me to fly from there to Lisbon than to fly to New York via Paris, and if I wish to fly to any other French city, I have to change aeroplanes at an airport in Paris.
I feel that these effects of liberalisation should not be ignored.
Secondly, I think that it is important to point out, as certain honourable Members have during this debate, that safety is not something that should be haggled over, and that European harmonisation of air traffic control must include this aspect of safety and it must not be handed over wholesale to businessmen.
This is extremely important.
I am one of those people who think that a European system of specifications should be introduced, some kind of agency, of course, but which would not necessarily involve privatisation and competition between the various air traffic control centres that exist at the moment.
Lastly, my third reason is that the Union' s regional policy, which accounts for the Union' s second largest budget, is meaningless without an effective planning policy.
Airports are highly decisive factors in influencing the location of businesses, senior officials, management, and therefore jobs to an area.
I fail to see why subsidies should be banned both for routes and for infrastructures, when certain remote regions do not have access to airports.
I feel that this aspect of regional planning should be taken into account.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, as well as all the honourable Members who have spoken, for their active cooperation in the debate which has resulted in the report that we are discussing today.
To a large extent, the report confirms the analysis which was expressed in the Commission' s communication on the European air transport sector in the light of the global challenges, since, thanks to the liberalisation of this sector, we have been able to establish a much more competitive market than the one that existed previously. The importance of this is clearly illustrated by the increase in the number of airlines or the increase, much less spectacular perhaps, but significant nevertheless, in the number of routes where there are more than two competitors.
This gives an idea of how competition has increased over these years.
The opening up of the markets means that the sector has evolved in very diverse ways.
Airlines have developed innovative strategies in order to adapt to the growth of the market and the challenges of competition, but despite their restructuring efforts they still suffer a large degree of fragmentation and financial fragility in comparison with their principal international competitors, and I am referring specifically to the US airlines.
Ladies and gentlemen, some of you have spoken of a common transatlantic air space, and I would like to tell you that this is a very important issue.
The current situation is the result of the bilateral signing by various Member States of the European Union and the USA of the so-called "open skies agreements" which, in fact, are resulting in an internal fragmentation of the European market and making it impossible for European companies to restructure in such a way as to give them sufficient capacity to compete at an international level.
As you know, the Commission is totally against these bilateral open skies agreements.
It has appealed against them at the Court of Justice and I hope that the judgement of the Court will allow us to put an end to this situation and do what we have to do: enter into a bilateral agreement with the United States as the European Union as a whole, as a single internal market, and not divided up into different countries.
The opposite situation may undoubtedly suit the United States, but in no way does it suit European airlines and European interests.
One of the objectives of the negotiation of a common transatlantic air space is precisely to resolve, by common agreement with the United States, the current situation caused by the unilateral actions of the different countries which have signed up to these agreements.
I must point out, ladies and gentlemen, that the reality of the internal civil aviation market in Europe has been affected in a very negative way by this.
Just now some of you were talking about the KLM-Alitalia affair, which obviously involves other issues, but where, if the two companies had already merged, we would not have the problems that we are facing at present.
It is true that one trait of European liberalisation, when compared to US liberalisation, is that the granting of state aid has been authorised to support the restructuring of certain airlines.
It is true that the Commission authorised the injection of public capital - only once, as a one-off and subject to strict conditions - with the aim of helping companies to effectively carry out the transition from a regulated market to an open market.
We can now congratulate ourselves on the fact that the majority of European companies have completed the transition process and that transition can be considered to have been finalised.
I must say to those people who said that employment in the sector would be reduced, that this has not been the case and that neither has the quality of work deteriorated in any way whatsoever.
On the contrary, more jobs and wealth are being created.
Companies have been able to confront the situation and liberalisation has significantly benefited consumers, although it is true that it has not benefited all consumers in the same way; for example, it has provided less benefit in relation to short-haul business trips where undoubtedly the lowest fares are not usually adequate and cannot be used.
I would like to end by referring to some of the questions that have been raised.
The issue of Gibraltar and the agreements reached recently by the two countries involved do not affect transport.
In this regard, therefore, the situation remains as it was before that bilateral agreement between these two countries of the Union.
I would also like to say that intermodality, which is already being considered, is a key element in the balanced development of mobility and air transport.
On the other hand, the question of slot allocation must be the subject of a Commission proposal since we cannot accept the current situation, in which many slots are lost, not all of them are properly used and, furthermore, let us be honest, there is a black market in them.
We will make a proposal to the effect that slot allocation should be an administrative right granted under licence.
We will try to ensure that there is greater flexibility in this allocation without causing any companies to go bankrupt.
With regard to Iceland, I would like to point out that it is an integral part of the European Economic Area and is therefore fully affected by the legislation.
I have left two issues until the end, not because they are less important, but because I wanted to focus on them for a moment.
The environment is a key issue in the development of aviation and, of course, efficiency in the consumption of fuel per passenger is improving every day, although it is true that the growth in air transport is exceeding the improvements achieved in efficiency.
We must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernised.
The question of noise is also a serious problem.
Lastly, I would like to make it clear that our primary concern, despite the fact that I have left it to the end, is safety.
That is the main and primary objective and all initiatives relating to air transport, the single airspace, the management of air traffic, the regulation of air transport, must take it fully into account. All our actions must take account, first and foremost, of the basic objective of safety.
The Commission does not hold any position in principle with regard to whether or not operational air traffic services should be privatised.
We believe that, before we reach that point, some associated services could be privatised, such as, for example, meteorological areas, which would allow for greater flexibility.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Appointment of senior Commission officials
The next item is the oral question (B5-0218/2000) by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE-DE), on the appointment of senior Commission officials.
I would remind you that the vote on this matter will take place on 17 May 2000.
Mr President, the policy on Commission appointments is, without doubt, a key element within the framework of the reform to which President Prodi is committed.
It is a key element because this House shares the determination of Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform, to make appointments based not on national quotas, but on merit.
At the moment, therefore, while Parliament has still not taken a position on administrative reform - which we are observing with great attention and which we all hope will, this time, truly be a great success - I wish to say that it is appropriate at this stage to watch how the Commission is putting these good intentions, these projects to reform the appointments policy, into practice.
Furthermore, I believe that transparency is a good thing, not only in terms of the control which this House has to carry out, but it is also good in itself.
We should bear in mind that the appointments policy provides motivation in some cases and not in others.
It promotes some officials at the expense of others and this policy may serve as an example, in terms of solving the principal problem faced by the Community structure - I am delighted that President Prodi and Mr Kinnock agree with this analysis - which is the lack of motivation amongst officials.
It is therefore very important that we try to see that good intentions are accompanied by good practices.
We all agree on the need to make progress on national quotas, and that appointments should be made on the basis of merit, but this cannot justify certain regional imbalances.
At the moment, according to the data available to us, which I am grateful for because the transparency process is a very good thing, most A1 or A2 senior officials are of the same nationality as the Commissioner, way above the German senior officials, for example.
There are clear imbalances.
To give another example, it cannot be put down to merit that there are 22 A1 or A2 Spaniards and 16 Belgian ones.
It is important that in a procedure which needs to be transparent, merit is easily explicable and comprehensible.
Merit cannot explain overall imbalances or imbalances in certain Directorates-General, in some of which there is a clear predominance of officials of a certain nationality.
It is also important that there is success in the search for equality between the sexes.
Nobody would say - I certainly would not - that the fact that there are so few A1 or A2 women is due to an assessment of merit.
On the contrary, we are surrounded by women who are much more valuable than us, my wife to name but one.
I must tell my friends that behind every great woman there is a great man, because everybody knows that my wife is worth much more than I am.
I am grateful to the Socialist spokesperson, who knows my wife, for agreeing with me.
It is important that we fulfil the commitment to double the number of female appointments.
We will closely monitor this appointments policy, which must be open and decisive.
We are happy to accept the new appointments within the Commission, in particular that of the Secretary-General.
Many believed that new policies require new faces and, in that context, perhaps the changeover of the Secretary-General should be supported.
At least that is what I think.
I would like to conclude by saying that when you come in July to explain the changes you are going to make to the procedures for appointments based on merit, I am sure you will have the agreement and support of all the Groups in this House.
Mr President, could I begin by thanking the honourable Member for his question.
I substantially agree with the points that he very effectively made.
In fact I would only diverge on one point.
He may be right that behind every great woman is a great man - there is a debate about that.
What I am certain is true is that behind every great man is a very, very surprised mother-in-law.
The honourable Member is, I know, very clear about the fact that responsibility for employment policies and patterns in the Commission, as a separate institution, lies with the Commission itself.
However, in order to provide useful information to this House and to the wider public, I am glad to respond to the two questions which the honourable Member has put down.
In order to give full and detailed answers to his first question, whilst saving some of the time of the House, I have sent a paper to the honourable Member listing the number of appointments of senior officials made in the Commission since taking office and also giving the names, nationalities and previous functions of all concerned.
To provide comprehensive detail, that paper also sets out the total number of senior officials from each nationality in the Commission and of the total numbers of all A grade staff of each nationality in the Commission.
A copy of that paper has also been provided to the secretariat-general of this Parliament for information and, naturally, it will be generally available to honourable Members.
In this oral answer, therefore, I will summarise the situation relating to senior appointments as at last Thursday, 27 April.
Since the present Commission took office, six appointments have been made involving promotions to grade A1.
They related to three officials of German nationality, two of Italian nationality and one of Irish nationality.
There have been fourteen other transfers at Director-General or Deputy Director-General level, which did not involve promotion in grade, although in four cases relating to Spanish, French, German and British officials, the changes meant advances in responsibility to full Director-General posts.
In the same period 19 appointments involving promotion to grade A2 have been made.
These related to officials of the following nationalities: 5 British, 4 Italian, 3 Belgian, 2 German, 1 Dutch, 1 French, 1 Spanish, 1 Irish and 1 Austrian.
Eleven transfers at Director level which did not involve promotion in grade have also been made.
In addition, two external appointments have been made in this period, one of a German national at Director-General level, and one of an Austrian national at Director level.
In summary therefore, a total of 25 promotions to senior appointments have been made since this Commission took office.
Six of the officials are Italian nationals, five are German, five are British, three Belgian, two Irish, one Dutch, one French, one Austrian and one Spanish.
These figures are accurate as of 27 April 2000.
As the House will know, in an international and multinational institution like the Commission, it is essential, as the honourable Member said, that the allocation of jobs broadly reflects the diversity of the Union that we serve and uses abilities effectively.
Those principles of balance and quality are clearly set down in the Staff Regulations and the Commission is committed to applying them fully at all levels.
As in any large organisation there is continual change amongst the staff of the Commission as people move, retire, become recruited, or promoted.
As a result, a still-photograph of the staff profile at any fixed time does not, and cannot, give a complete picture.
To be properly judged, balance must consequently be assessed and be maintained over the medium term and the Commission is also actively committed to ensuring that.
In response to the honourable Member' s second question relating to the rules and criteria applied to senior appointments, I draw the attention of the House to the decisions on the subject which the Commission adopted and published last September and last December.
Those decisions constitute specific legal rules for the institution rather than a generalised code of conduct.
Copies of those rules have been sent to the honourable Member and they are available on the Internet.
Against this background the following information may be useful to the House: the guiding principle of the system which the Commission uses is that appointments to all senior posts will be determined on evidence of the merit of candidates, including managerial capacity and other relevant abilities.
In order to take necessary account of the geographical balance to which I referred earlier and to do so in compliance with the essential principle of meritocratic appointment, specific provision is being made.
The Commission has rejected the concept of quotas because of its counter-productive rigidity, and also because it would breach Staff Regulations.
It has, however, adopted a decision to ensure that all Member State nationalities should be represented by at least 1 qualified person in the most senior post, Director-General or equivalent, and consistent with that, the Commission has given fresh emphasis to assess effectively proven merit as a prerequisite of highest positions.
The effects will be to maintain high standards of quality amongst the officials who lead the staff in the Commission in its vital policy, treaty application and management tasks and to do so whilst ensuring the broad geographical balance which is central to the character of an institution serving the whole of the Union.
The system for making promotion to the highest posts facilitates these purposes of sustaining merit and balance and I will summarise its operation for the information of the House.
Candidates for A1 and A2 jobs are interviewed by a panel of senior officials which has been assisted in the lifetime of this Commission by an advisory external expert with relevant experience in executive selection.
That panel makes an objective assessment of the professional and managerial qualities and capabilities that are relevant to the post and recommends a shortlist.
The shortlisted candidates are then interviewed by the portfolio Commissioner who is most directly concerned with the post and, in the case of A1 officials, by the Commissioner for personnel, who at the moment is myself.
The Commissioner responsible for personnel then formally proposes to the College the candidate who has been agreed upon with the portfolio Commissioner and with the President of the Commission.
In the case of appointments of Directors, the agreement of the relevant Director-General must also be obtained.
At all times the panel, the Commissioners and the College are conscious of the commitment to quality and balance and therefore apply that commitment consistently in the interests of the Commission and of the Union.
I can confirm that all appointments made by this Commission have been in accordance with these rules which are themselves based on Article 29 of the Staff Regulations and that will continue to be the course followed.
I apologise for the length of time I have taken up but, naturally, I wanted to give the House the most comprehensive information.
Mr President. I very much welcome the opportunity presented by the question tabled by my colleague, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, to be able to start the debate on what will be many issues in connection with Commissioner Kinnock' s reforms.
I would like to thank him very much for the very comprehensive and open response that he has given to that question.
Today we have rightly focussed on what are the absolutely key appointments at the top of any organisation.
After all, your reform, Commissioner Kinnock, is going to have to be led from the top and we very much welcome the confirmation you have given about the way in which the top appointments have been handled.
What I would like to do in developing on Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz' question is to table one or two other points to you in connection with some of the more detailed aspects of the White Paper and the change in organisation that you have proposed.
Clearly the very ambitious reform contained in your paper is going to be a formidable task for the managers you appoint.
To achieve your objectives of moving the Commission towards a world-leading international public service, it is clear that the appointments and capabilities of your team are going to be critical.
You say in your White Paper that there is a real need to raise management skills and create a common management culture across the Commission.
I would like to know first of all how far you feel that management culture is now being developed by your new top team and how far that is starting to be communicated through the Commission' s organisation.
The important and welcome news that we have had today about the appointment of a new Secretary-General, Mr David O' Sullivan, raises the question whether he has been involved already and will that have an impact on the development that you have already set in train.
The second point I wanted to raise has to do with what you identify in your White Paper - and I agree with this entirely - about the real challenges for any service organisation which is decentralising and delegating responsibilities to reporting managers, empowering them to take decisions and to have that all-important control of budget.
I would like your assurance that the new team that comes in has those skills and also, and this is particularly important, that it also has a commitment to developing team-work in the Commission.
This is going to become more and more important as we get more information-technology driven solutions, more horizontal team-working of the type that I know is moving into areas like the information society.
Can we have your assurance that your senior team is going to be open-minded and looking at these new solutions?
Finally, your White Paper quite rightly notes that action is going to have to be taken when managers are not performing to the expected standard.
It would not be surprising, given the changes, that there are some people who feel uncomfortable with this.
Can you confirm that probationary periods, as set out in your White Paper, have been included in the contracts for the new appointments, how long those periods are and that systematic assessments of performance are included in those appointments?
Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply.
It is clear from the current debate that the European Parliament has asked the Commission to rotate senior posts and has already lent its support to this idea.
We have also asked to "de-flag" senior posts.
We want to see people appointed on merit and quality, and we as the Group of the Party of European Socialists very much welcome the action taken by the Commission so far, in response to Parliament' s requests.
We have also ascertained - and I must say that a number of the questions raised a moment ago are really starting to confuse the issue again - that the Commission is responsible for its appointments and that we as Parliament do not want to take the Commission' s place, especially not as far as appointments are concerned, because we would then be throwing everything back into disarray, and I felt that some of the questions were already heading in that direction again.
I would actually like to return to the very root cause of this discussion.
If it were to obtain these statistics, I believe that we already had them at our disposal.
If something else were going on, then we must have heard about it through the grapevine because over the past few weeks, rumour had it that some aspects were useless, that certain appointments or certain people had not been transferred and that some of them did not come up to scratch.
It has all gone quiet now. All we have now is a number of very innocent, factual issues.
If this is about the internal reforms as a whole, then we could say: OK, here is a White Paper and here we have procedures we agreed on.
This very exciting and very extensive change is something both the Commission and Parliament want, but the ball is now back in the Commission' s court.
We have precise data.
The Commission has to come up with proposals on these points.
Are we not up to speed, or is there something up with the Commission?
As recently as, let me think, seven months ago, we supported and appointed the Commission with an overwhelming majority, and now all of a sudden these questions are being asked.
Should this be seen as an attack on the Commission?
Is the Commission all of a sudden incapable or is this a sudden, inverse kind of declaration of support on the part of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and that is why this Group is asking the Commission these questions?
Those seemed to be the undertones for a fleeting moment.
Our friends from the European People' s Party have thrown us into a bit of confusion because we are fully agreed on the key points.
The rotation system is clear.
The statistical data we received in this respect does not lead us to believe that anything should be amiss.
Neither have I heard that anything is wrong with the performance, quite the opposite, in fact.
That does not, of course, detract from the fact that, if you say you want to abandon national quotas, each one of us as we are here today would like to see some geographical balance in it all.
In fact, the Commission too has admitted to this, without rushing to attach national identity to the individual figures, individual posts, because we would then be back to square one, as we would be pushing aside the merits of the case and forcing the national flags back into use, which would take each one of us some time to digest.
I am speaking up today as a Dutch national.
Despite this, I do not think we should operate at national level but should cover a wider level.
Surely this position could not be any clearer?
I would like to add one more point which has not been discussed here but which I would like to bring up.
The question came up: should someone who has held a senior post be transferred to a job in the public sector elsewhere without any further ado? This is a question which was asked originally, which has now disappeared, of course, and which has meanwhile been milked in the press.
What should we make of it?
In our opinion, we really need new standards.
This is what we asked the Commission for.
The Commission was willing to produce these new standards.
