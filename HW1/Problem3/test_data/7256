It had been warned by Parliament; it had been warned by the national regulators; it had been warned several times by the Commission, and it did not move.
The Commission had to resolve to put a regulation on the table before the first market forces began to move a little in the right direction.
I believe that it is time the Commission gave back the advantages of the internal market to the small and medium-sized businesses and to our consumers.
Â Â  I would like to join in the praise for the tough stand the Commissioner has taken, but I want to reinforce what she said about not wanting to over-regulate.
Can she confirm that she has taken real notice of the European regulators, who have, I think, been fairly critical of her initial approach and are being very cautionary about what she is proposing to do?
Would she please confirm to me that she is not intending to impose regulation in the marketplace that would require operators to deliver services below cost, because that would mean low-income users of mobile phones subsidising the premium rates of customers such as MEPs?
Â Â  . I have the impression that at the moment the low-income consumers are subsidising the consumers in large industries which are able to negotiate special prices with the mobile operators.
We would like to reverse that position and see fair prices based on markets and cost for the consumer, not the unfair prices we have now.
Most of all, we would like to give back to the consumers the advantages of the common market and promote mobility rather than being a barrier to it.
I have read the advice of the European Regulatorsâ Group with great interest and I am working very closely with that group.
It shares my objective, which is to bring about substantial reductions in international roaming charges.
Our services are meeting members of the group today to discuss with them the details of how this should be done.
That is why I am unable to give details of our regulation at the moment, because I have to see everything that is on the table â 150 contributions â and to listen to the national regulators.
Having done that, I will draw up a paper on a draft regulation for the Commission and I am sure that Parliament will discuss this paper thoroughly later on this summer.
Â Â  . The Commission is pursuing several initiatives to promote the safest possible use of the Internet in Europe.
Since 1996 the Commission has been active in the fight against illegal content such as child pornography, or racist content, as also in the protection of children from accessing legal but harmful content such as adult pornography, violent content and gambling.
Parliament is examining the Commissionâs proposal to update the Television Without Frontiers directive in order to cover all audiovisual media services.
A basic canon of rules will then apply to all audiovisual content, whatever the means by which it is distributed, including television and the Internet.
These will relate to safety, protection of minors, prohibition of incitement to hatred, and include some qualitative restrictions on advertising targeted at minors.
We also have a recommendation on protection of minors and human dignity in audiovisual and information services, which provides guidelines for national legislation about electronic media.
On the basis of this recommendation, in 2005 we launched the Safer Internet Plus programme.
That programme has established a network of 21 hotlines throughout Europe, which enable the general public to complain about illegal content found on the Internet.
These hotlines investigate and refer complaints to the appropriate organisations, police, Internet service providers or hotlines in other countries.
We also have a network of 23 awareness-raising projects, which provide advice to children, teenagers, parents and educators about the risks of the Internet and the way to deal with them.
This is done either directly with the help of brochures, websites and TV spots or through the intermediary of multiplier organisations like schools.
Then there is the filtering and parenting software, which is a key means to protect children from accessing harmful content.
The Commission will provide guidance to parents on the effectiveness of filtering software and services.
A study is under way and due to be completed by December this year.
The Commission is also actively involved with the Internet and the mobile phone industry with a view to promoting self-regulation as a means of limiting the flow of harmful and illegal content.
The Commission has taken legislative measures against spam, spyware and moleware, which are also viruses.
A full list of these will be communicated to the honourable Members.
I would also like to say that at international level the follow-up conference to the World Summit on the Information Society will tackle all these negative aspects of the new technologies.
Let me say today that I am sure that with the help of Parliament the Safer Internet Day in spring 2007 will become a real important awareness-raising day in all our Member States.
Â Â  â Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner.
I also think it is a very good thing that the World Information Summit is to be held again.
But do you think that the measures you have taken really will be enough?
What measures do you plan to take if this bad material nevertheless continues to be found on the Internet?
Are parents and guardians also being trained and made aware of these matters, by the Commission among others?
Â Â  . Mr President, I am afraid MrsÂ Schierhuber is right.
This bad material is on the Internet and it will continue to be.
We are doing all we can to get it removed from the Internet, but it is a world wide web and we do not have access to these contents everywhere.
That is why the most important thing is to provide both parents and schools with the necessary information so that they can prepare children for what they will find on the net.
With this in mind, all our information campaigns and awareness campaigns will, I hope, culminate in a very successful Safer Internet Day early in 2007.
I would also like the European Parliament to support us, with Members taking related initiatives in their constituencies.
A coordinated campaign would surely benefit our children all across Europe.
Â Â  I should like to thank the Commissioner.
However, considering that to date the prohibition of these unwanted sites has not been so successful, what confidence do you have that your proposals will eradicate such undesirable sites from the Internet?
Â Â  . As I have already said, it is a worldwide web and everybody can submit content to it.
That is why we need not only to raise the awareness of educators and parents but also to lobby internet providers, as I do regularly, to take responsibility and to establish self-regulatory measures.
I really believe in self-regulation in that field.
If many stakeholders self-regulate, there will be a result.
In the revised Television Without Frontiers Directive, the basic values of our societies will also apply to the Internet.
This will be of the utmost importance, and responsibility will lie with those working in online services.
Â Â  Commissioner, you cannot control what is on the web, but you can control access in the following way.
With the advent of broadband, the Internet is on all the time.
A lot of new computers have just one password to turn on the computer and do not have a separate password to control access to the Internet.
Therefore children can wander in, broadband is on and they can access the Internet straight away.
If there was simple control on access and more passwords on computers themselves, then parents, schools and others would have greater control.
I ask you to look at that issue, particularly as broadband means the Internet is on all the time.
Â Â  . We have a real problem with the new technologies, which is that for the first time in human history maybe children know more than parents and educators.
That is why we have to provide parents with very simple software, simple filters and parenting devices so that they can take their responsibility.
That is why we have launched a study to find out what filters and services exist for parents.
At the end of the year, when we present this study, it will be most beneficial to organise an awareness-raising campaign on those filters in order to inform parents what they can do to help their children.
Very often parents are lost in such cases because they are not very familiar with technology â at least not as familiar as the new generation is.
Â Â  Questions Nos 55 to 58 will be answered in writing.
As the author is not present, Question No 59 lapses.
Â Â  . Let me assure you that the Commission is well aware of the significant economic potential of commercial services, including financial services.
This is an important part of the WTO negotiations and it has not been ignored, even if it has received less publicity than other parts.
The Commission has highlighted the importance of access to finance in developing countries on many occasions, for example in a communication that it co-sponsored last year in the WTO.
Financial services are clearly one of the European Commissionâs priorities in the services negotiations and, therefore, figure prominently in the European Commissionâs bilateral services requests.
Furthermore, the European Community was one of the co-sponsors of the recently tabled financial services plurilateral request and is particularly active in plurilateral and bilateral negotiations with our trading partners in Geneva.
Unfortunately, the offers in financial services on the table so far are mostly disappointing.
This applies particularly to many countries in Asia.
Certain ASEAN members, with very low existing commitments, have not made any financial services offers and larger players, such as China and particularly India, also have room to improve their offers.
In short, most of our main requests in financial services have not been addressed by our trading partners.
That is why the Commission will continue to press very hard and at all levels to convince our trading partners of the need to correct the situation by submitting substantially revised offers in July this year.
Â Â  â I am very sorry that MrÂ Mandelson, a Member of the Commission, was unable to attend and I would not like to ask a question which is perhaps not in your area of expertise.
I believe that in your work you are able to say whether the Commission is considering possibilities to broaden the financial services dialogue. Because now I have an impression that everything is focused on agricultural products and textiles, whereas in fact, once the trade structure has changed, the financial services sector would be in an ideal position to help changing the trade structure.
Is the Commission devoting much time to debating the expansion and development of financial services?
Â Â  . Yes, we do that and we impress on our trading partners the need to correct this situation.
We believe that they are in a position to submit substantially revised offers concerning financial services by July this year.
We will continue to insist on it but, as you know, trade negotiations are bilateral and plurilateral negotiations: we need to receive this offer from them and we are trying hard to put pressure on them to make such offers.
Â Â  I am aware that Commissioner Mandelson has pushed financial services quite hard and I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner that he is intending to do so.
Does he agree with me that it is somewhat ironic that a country like India, which has call centres from European companies selling insurance, mortgages, loans and other financial services to Europeans, denies those very services to its own people, and will he press India in particular to reform its protectionist system for financial services?
Â Â  . We are asking the Indian authorities to improve access to these services and I hope they will comply with our request.
Â Â  â Will the European Commission step up pressure on emerging economies and on previous developing countries to open up their services markets?
This is the core question and I believe that, for the European Union, the symmetry between the Union markets which have already been opened up in the agricultural sector, on the one hand, and the corresponding opening up of other countries in the services sectors in general, on the other hand, should be strengthened.
This should also apply to access to the market for non-agricultural products.
Without these preconditions, the Doha Round will not have symmetrical results. There will be no balance as regards its results.
Â Â  . I can confirm what I already said.
We are working all the time with those countries so that they improve or strengthen the services offered, including financial services.
It is part of our negotiation strategy.
It is not that we are only taking a defensive position on agriculture; we are active in all areas that concern the trade negotiations.
We firmly believe that trade concessions should be reciprocal.
Â Â  . Biofuels are needed for two main reasons.
Firstly, our energy security depends on developing alternatives to oil.
Among the solutions that can be put into practice today, there is none with the same potential as biofuels.
Secondly, the transport sector is not contributing enough to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Biofuels can significantly contribute to this aim.
The EU has decided to achieve rapid development of biofuels use.
The Biofuels Directive, adopted in 2003, set a reference value of a 2% market share for biofuels in 2005 and 5.75% in 2010, compared with a 0.2% share in 2000.
In adopting national indicative targets under the Directive, Member States have been somewhat less ambitious, but, overall, the target is a share of about 1.4% in 2005.
In the light of this, the review of the functioning of the Biofuels Directive, which the Commission is due to carry out this year, is particularly important.
We have just launched the public consultation exercise for this review.
The public consultation poses a number of questions.
First of all, will the 5.75% objective for 2010 be achieved through the present policies and measures?
If not, what can be done to ensure that the objective will be achieved?
Should the Community set objectives for the share of biofuels in 2015 and 2020?
The Commission has taken no position on these questions so far.
Turning to the question of environmental impact, it is important to start from the basis that biofuels bring a number of environmental benefits.
However, it is also true that their production can have some adverse effects on the environment.
I believe that second-generation biofuels can have even greater environmental benefits and their introduction should be accelerated as much as possible.
The Commission will make sure, therefore, that the promotion of biofuels continues to bring benefits in environmental terms, as well as the benefit of security of supply.
For that reason, as part of the review of the Directive, the Commission is asking for views on the introduction of a certification system.
This could ensure that only biofuels whose cultivation meets required environmental standards count towards objectives in the Directive.
The initial reaction of environmental NGOs, fuel suppliers and other stakeholders has been encouragingly positive.
As regards car manufacturers' obligations, carmakers have voluntarily agreed to limit average CO2 emissions from new cars to 140g per km by 2008/2009.
The Commission does not consider that the use of biofuels should in any way reduce the objectives agreed upon with the car industry.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your response.
I am delighted that the Commission would like to further sustain our mobility as a priority.
That is absolutely vital.
While I take note of the undertakings you have given, there is something I would like to ask you.
What is at issue is not just the production of biofuels here in the European Union, but also the production and possible purchase of biofuels from outside it.
We have received reports that this production is done under circumstances which are not ideal, these include deforestation of the Amazon, social exploitation and the excessive use of pesticides.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
You have also responded to my question about the automotive industry, but what you left unanswered is the question as to whether the automotive industry should not commit to producing cars that are more economical in their use of petrol.
That is, after all, what this debate is all about.
A reduction in fuels ...
Â Â  . The same environmental sustainability standards should apply outside the Union as well.
As I said in my answer to the first question, we should look upon the issues in our trade negotiations.
The development of biofuels should not be at the expense of the rainforests.
It must also be done in a sustainable way.
I believe that we have all the means to follow that path.
On the car industryâs obligation to make more efficient engines and more efficient cars, we will follow that path as well.
It does not replace the other path, however: they are two separate tracks going in the same direction â security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.
But on the matter of improved standards for cars, the answer is the use of biofuels.
Only both combined can give the necessary result.
Â Â  Firstly, I welcome your reply, Commissioner.
I would urge you along the route of certification.
You are right, it would be quite wrong if, for example, the use of palm oil led to the destruction of forests in Indonesia.
So I would push you in that direction.
The other problem we have with biofuels is that while we are getting cars produced that can take biofuels and getting drivers willing to drive the cars, there is still a great difficulty in most parts of Europe in finding petrol stations that will stock biofuels and enable the consumer to take advantage of this ecologically friendly system.
Will he do what he can to encourage more petrol companies to have a biofuel pump in their stations?
Â Â  . We recently adopted the biomass action plan and a communication on biofuels.
Both these documents have been discussed in the Council and there is definitely a need for Member States to pursue a more proactive policy to bring biofuels onto the market.
The Commission encourages this as far as it can, but many measures could be introduced by Member States themselves.
It is not for the Commission to ensure that there are enough petrol stations stocking biofuels.
For example, I wish there were more of them in Brussels.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I am very glad that it is at last being recognised throughout Europe and the world that we need to be independent of the politically unstable regions from which the European Union gets much of its energy.
My question to the Commission is this: will the Commission also bring pressure to bear on the engine, car or, indeed, the motor vehicle industry?
We know today that biofuels can be produced without esterification, but engines have to be designed so that people can drive using both fuels.
Is any thought being given to this?
Â Â  . I do not believe we need to do anything to achieve our objectives in the engine industry at present because admixture is permissible and technically possible in small quantities.
Of course we will need more flexibility in the future.
The car industry will follow our political trend.
The most important thing at present is to show that the European Union really is prepared to do that.
In reality, only very small technical changes are required to increase the use of biofuel.
The most important objective should be to bring biofuel on to the market in as many Member States as possible, since it is not available everywhere yet.
In some States it is already.
The Commission is therefore trying hard to persuade those States that have not yet done enough to achieve their own objectives.
Â Â  . I think this will be rather a long answer because it cannot be answered in just a few sentences.
I would like to start by saying that today Russia plays a very important role in securing Europeâs energy supplies.
Currently Russia provides almost 30% of the EUâs oil imports and 45% of our gas imports.
Or, to be more exact, 25% of our consumed gas.
As a result, Russia is the largest single external energy supplier.
A considerable amount of our Iranian imports are also provided by Russia, so the EU and Russian markets for crude oil and oil products, as well as natural gas, are tightly interlinked with numerous pipelines, maritime and rail links and numerous contracts that our companies have concluded with Russian suppliers.
A broad relationship and energy dialogue was established between Russia and the Commission in 2000.
Moreover, the common economic space agreed during the EU-Russia Summit in MayÂ 2005 includes cooperation in a wide range of energy-related activities.
So the energy dialogue aims to discuss issues related to energy policy and market developments, infrastructure developments, and EU-Russia cooperation in multilateral energy fora.
I believe that Russia will remain an important supplier for the EU in the future.
Taking into account the expected growth of energy consumption in the EU, I expect Russia to continue to supply around 25% of the gas consumed in the EU which, in absolute terms, would mean an increase in supplies.
The European Union and many countries worldwide are becoming ever more dependent on imported hydrocarbons.
I would like to reiterate that in the long term there are only three countries that have a lot of natural gas resources: Russia, Iran and Qatar.
At the same time, the EU will import 70% of its energy in 2030, compared with 50% today.
Over time, the remaining fossil fuel resources will become more concentrated, as I said, in a rather small number of countries.
As a consequence, energy interdependence is becoming a global issue, with major shared concerns, such as increased demand for limited resources in the world, the lack of investment in new production and the climate change issues.
Therefore, a broad range of actions at EU and Member-State level are required to address these challenges.
It has been highlighted in the Green Paper.
I have just highlighted one of the actions in my answer to the honourable Memberâs previous question about biofuels.
That is one of the actions that we indicate.
The Green Paper emphasised opportunities, such as policies to improve first of all energy efficiency and energy savings, as well as enhancing the market penetration of renewable energy sources.
It also highlighted external policy options, such as strengthening the framework for energy relations between the EU and Russia in order to give more confidence to both sides, as well as policies and measures to diversification of the geographical sources and transportation routes of external energy supplies to the EU.
In this context, it is important to underline that the EU is making continuous efforts to improve energy relations with other energy-producing organisations â such as OPEC, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the countries of the Caspian Basin and north Africa â as well as with the consuming regions in the framework of the International Energy Forum, the International Energy Agency, G8 and through bilateral agreements and dialogues.
This policy of diversification is not directed against our current suppliers: it is a necessity dictated by the global energy security challenges and by the challenge posed by global warming and other environment-related issues.
Together with the Austrian Presidency of the European Union, I recently sent a letter to the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Khristenko, on the issue of energy cooperation and in particular gas interdependency.
In this letter we reiterated the importance the EU attributes to deepening energy relations with Russia, the EUâs most important energy supplier.
Furthermore, we stressed that the importance the EU attaches to diversifying sources of supply should not be interpreted as limiting deliveries of Russian gas to the EU market, particularly as demand for gas in Europe is forecast to rise.
In this relationship with Russia, the EU is promoting such principles as market reciprocity, fair transit conditions through Russia and third-party access to infrastructure in Russia.
Therefore, the short answer to the questions that have been asked is that we are looking for diversification, but it is extremely important to establish measures on the demand side, because only with demand-side measures, energy efficiency and savings can we actually establish our energy independence more strongly and, at the same time, look towards our goals of sustainability and competitiveness.
Â Â  Commissioner, I believe President Putinâs politicisation of Gazprom is just as dangerous as the politicisation of OPEC by a few Gulf States 30 years ago.
Energy independence is therefore very important.
Could we not therefore do more to promote heating materials derived from renewable raw materials, that is from biomass, elephant grass and even from grain?
Europe could provide for itself with these.
Â Â  . Of course.
That is one thing we are concentrating on.
I probably did not say so much about it in my answer.
We must make the best possible use of our own resources.
The available biomass, wind and water power will not of course be enough, we will still need to buy energy from Russia and the OPEC States.
But my answer today is: we must all do our homework at home, because that is the only way we will achieve our objective.
Â Â  I thank the Member of the Commission for his detailed reply.
I agree that Russia is an important energy supplier and it is definitely essential to maintain the dialogue with Russia in the field of energy.
However, there is a good Russian proverb saying that God saves those who save themselves.
And the European Union would do well to bear in mind certain official statements from Moscow.
I would like the Member of the Commission to comment on the statement made by the officials that apparently Russia will divert its energy resources to Asia, if Members of the European Union do not fulfil certain conditions.
Â Â  . I followed President Putin's last address to the nation.
He emphasised two issues that concern energy: first, he said that Gazprom has shown remarkable progress since he addressed the issue of energy efficiency.
It is very important that Russia recognised that.
He also said that Russia could play an important role in the creation of a common European energy policy.
As regards the Gazprom announcement, I consider it one of the companies that have a monopoly.
None of them would ever be willing to give their monopoly up.
As regards diversification, we should accept that Russia will look for the most lucrative market.
If the price is better in China, I am afraid it will try to sell the gas to China.
The United States has higher prices and, with the development of LNG, competition between big consumers will grow.
But, at the same time, I believe that the existing infrastructure that brings Russian gas to the European Union and highly diversified gas use in the European Union will make the European market very attractive to Gazprom and Russia in general.
We are anticipating, as a result of dialogue, that Russia will follow in the gas sector the path currently being followed in the oil sector.
That brings benefits to Russia and at the same time supplies the market well.
I hope our dialogue will be able to bring about such a result.
I know it is not easy but that is our goal.
Geographically we are the best market and historically our companies have had very good relations.
At the same time, I take very seriously the announcement by Gazprom that they would like to build a pipeline to China.
That is no big surprise.
Â Â  On the question of reducing the European Unionâs dependence on gas and oil imports from Russia, I would ask you, Commissioner, to elaborate on two issues.
Firstly, is the EU in a position to counter the Russian pipeline monopoly in the transportation of oil and gas from Central Asia to Europe?
Secondly, is the European Union able to secure reciprocity and greater transparency on the part of Russiaâs energy sector?
Â Â  . The first question was about gas transport from central Asia to Europe.
There are two paths that we are following.
One is definitely related to the Energy Charter and transit protocols under which such rights could be enjoyed.
As for the other, I recently visited Kazakhstan to find out about the building of a trans-Caspian pipeline that can independently bring gas towards the European Union, bypassing the Russian gas transit system.
As regards transparency and relations, at this stage there is some reciprocity.
In the EU Gazprom is treated as a company that has a complete pipeline monopoly in production and transport.
So it is clear that whenever a situation in the internal market is evaluated, then it is evaluated on all aspects.
We are looking for more transparency and more mutual understanding.
In October this year, we will have a conference on energy policies.
It is also fairer to the Russian side also to ask questions as to what Europeâs views are and how far Europe is going in creating a common energy policy.
It is also clear that they do not always have all the information and understanding as to what our goals are.
Our goals are fair trade in these resources and fair markets.
That, from my point of view, is beneficial not only for us, but also for Russia.
That is how I see that the best results could be achieved.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0161/2006) by MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (COM(2004)0775 â C6-0223/2004 â 2004/0270B(COD)).
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing the Commissionâs thanks to the European Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in particular to MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur, and MrÂ Schnellhardt as second rapporteur for their hard work on this dossier.
I would like to remind you that last year the Commission adopted the TSE roadmap. It served primarily as a discussion paper for future short, medium and long-term adjustments and also formed the basis for the detailed discussion of individual questions with the Member States.
I would like to repeat one of the key points again here: there will be no change to our overall policy of protecting consumers and eradicating BSE.
In view of this, the Commission is very pleased with the work that has been done so far and the compromise proposal that is now up for discussion and for the vote.
This proposal provides a reliable legal framework that will allow the Commission to continue to take action on the basis of new scientific findings and at the same time to maintain the level of protection of human and animal health in the European Union or to raise it if that is scientifically justified.
The compromise proposal is therefore acceptable to the Commission.
The proposal also brings European law into line with the international rules, according to which countries are categorised according to their BSE risk.
Â Â  . Madam President, the rapporteur, MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, has asked me to present her report here today because she is ill.
We hope she will be back with us soon.
The directive on TSE basically has two parts; firstly, the question of transitional periods and secondly the operational or substantive part.
To allow us to discuss the substantive part at greater length and more extensively, it was suggested that we divide the report, which we did with the Commissionâs agreement.
In the middle of 2005, we decided to extend the transitional provisions at first reading, giving us sufficient time for the second part, which we are debating today and which we have also discussed in a large number of working groups and roundtables, including with Europeâs veterinarians and colleagues in Parliament.
As Commissioner Verheugen has already indicated, we are determined not to weaken the directive but to put the emphasis on health policy.
UnderÂ Mrs Roth-Behrendtâs leadership we managed that splendidly.
She has called on the Commission to develop a kind of roadmap, which, while it has not been discussed in this house officially, will nevertheless guide us in tackling the difficult topic of BSE and TSE in the future.
It is a very welcome initiative.
Let me say something about the contents.
Up until now, we have had five risk categories.
That was good, it was right and it was helpful.
We found, however, and became convinced that in order to be compatible with what is being done in other parts of the world, including the World Organisation for Animal Health in Paris, it was better to scale this down to three factors, which came more easily after much discussion.
We found that many non-Community countries know relatively little about this animal disease and that the European Union and the OIE in Paris, too, can get much better information that is easy to compare using this new classification.
That was the compromise after the rapporteur â and I strongly support her â agreed to this proposal.
It is in the end also a factor in consumer protection and for farmers, because these questions can now be better coordinated and also policed across the globe in the developing world.
It is again made clear that checks for BSE are an important part of it.
Healthy, conspicuous and changed animals will continue to be tested.
But if the surveillance shows a sustained positive development in particular areas, then things can be relaxed a little in line with scientific evidence.
One contentious issue I will be pleased to talk about is the question of fishmeal.
As a farmer, I am convinced that fishmeal should not be fed to ruminants.
Some countries in Europe evidently see it differently, however.
I have to respect that. Parliament said a clear No back in 2004.
With the backing of many experts, the rapporteur took this subject up again and made clear that this fact â namely that herbivores should not be given fishmeal â will be included in this report.
As an exception â and that is part of the compromise â it will be permissible to add it to feed for animals up to a certain age.
I think we can agree to this compromise.
One tricky and very sensitive area is the question of mechanically separated meat.
How meat is stripped from bones is a very complicated issue.
Anyone who has ever seen it will never eat it again.
The Commission itself has said it will review it and make us an appropriate proposal for dealing with this problem.
The minimum list of special risk materials is a matter of particular concern to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt.
Brain and spinal cord, for example, will now appear in a genuine list and not in the Annexes as before.
That is right and it is a good contribution.
An equally good contribution is the question of how cohort animals are treated at present.
These are siblings of animals that are sick.
Earlier, all these animals were most brutally slaughtered. Now a good way has been found and the animals are kept.
They cannot of course be eaten themselves.
All in all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and everyone involved.
They have done some very important work.
And I am very glad that MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt was able to accompany us through this difficult terrain and I hope she will be here again soon.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament and the rapporteur, MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, in particular have shown great dedication in coping with the BSE crisis, they have played a good part, and they have also been able to put the Commission on the right track with the various instruments like the committee of inquiry and the conditional motion of censure.
We are pleased that we are now no longer having to deal with the start or the height of the crisis but with its tailing off.
This was a man-made crisis and if we remove the causes of it we will find a way out.
The Committee on Agriculture does in fact believe that we should have the courage to begin to move out of it.
The end of this development will therefore again be that high-grade animal protein can be fed to non-vegetarian animals if it comes from animals that have been released for human consumption.
What troubles us about this movement is that the Commission is now very much taking over the action in the comitology procedure and is taking the decisions.
We believe the European Parliament should be involved.
We are all somewhat concerned that in taking over the administrative and regulatory process the Commission is leaving the European Parliament out in the cold.
We have therefore strengthened the decisions of principle to ensure that questions of consumer protection and environmental protection must play a major role.
Overall, we believe that on the question of codecision in the comitology procedure the European Parliament like the Council must have the right to enter a veto if things are decided in the Annexes that really should be dealt with in the European Parliamentâs codecision procedure.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, I feel I must spend a little of my time sending warmest greetings to MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, together with best wishes for her recovery.
My group considers many parts of this report on the amendment of the Regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies an extraordinary success.
In the hectic days when the BSE problem was at its height, we had to take very quick and very harsh decisions on many things, and science has advanced in the meantime.
That is why we can now speak of a good proposal.
What are the advantages I see?
Firstly, comitology has been limited to the necessary amount.
The original proposal involved much more comitology, MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringdorf!
That makes for clarity and reliability in the implementation.
Secondly, the introduction of three risk categories simplifies risk assessment without jeopardising safety.
It brings an internationally agreed programme of measures to prevent BSE/TSE into force throughout the European Union, based on the proposals of the World Organisation for Animal Health.
The results of risk assessment in all countries can now be compared.
Among other things, that also makes exporting and importing easier.
Thirdly, the age from which animals must be tested for BSE is now the same for all the European Union, because the rule has been laid down in the main body of the Regulation.
For animals that will be used for food it is now a uniform 30 months.
We know that a lot of countries have adopted quite different rules.
This new rule will make it possible to compare Member Statesâ statistics.
We will be able to get a much better overview of the situation.
Fourthly, I also welcome the fact that the general cull of the herd when BSE appears is abolished.
That is scientifically based and that is how it should be done.
Fifthly, the introduction of tolerance thresholds for animal proteins adventitiously and unavoidably present (I want to stress that) in plant-based feeds takes account of reality and removes problems in the sectors concerned without affecting safety.
I expect the Commission and the Council to approve the agreed value of 0.5%.
I consider this figure to be just about acceptable, although the tolerance limits can be expected to differ greatly in this measurement range and the tolerances can be expected to be very high.
Sixthly, the scientific prohibition on the use of animal proteins in cattle feed will remain.
I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed on a rule allowing some fishmeal to be used for young bovine animals.
All right, it is a compromise.
I would have preferred it to be clearly separated. There would then have been a clear separation in the feed industry, too, and we would have had much more safety.
All the same, this rule is to be welcomed.
I really must also mention, and remind the Commission of the fact, that it promised to include the question of feeding kitchen and food waste to animals when revising Regulation 1774/2002.
I consider that to be very important and I would like to stress that once again.
In this connection I believe we can agree to this proposal with a large majority without more ado.
Â Â  . Madam President, I endorse the congratulations to the rapporteur on her good report and also on the good work she has done in this field for many years, and I wish her a speedy recovery.
I would also like to deal with a subject that for years has been close to MrsÂ Roth-Behrendtâs heart.
I am referring to the clarification in ArticleÂ 7, which several speakers have already mentioned, that animal proteins should not be fed to adult ruminants.
Cattle are vegetarians, and they only take in animal proteins when they are young, in the form of their motherâs milk.
That really goes without saying.
However, the BSE crisis showed us that this principle had been anything but self-evident for a long time.
It is therefore all the more important, now that we are revising the basic BSE/TSE regulation, that we should underline the ethical principles of animal nutrition and stress that this is important for the protection of human and animal health and also from the point of view of the precautionary principle.
At the end of 2004, on the rapporteurâs initiative, the European Parliament blocked a comitology decision to allow fishmeal to be used in feed.
Since then, this question has again been very hotly debated in this House.
It is repeatedly pointed out that there is no TSE risk from fishmeal.
It is not for me to answer this scientific question and I have no wish to do so.
We in the European Parliament simply do not want fishmeal or any other animal products in cattle feed.
I can agree to the compromise in as much as it provides for the possibility in future of feeding fishmeal to young calves as a substitute for milk when they have just been separated from the mother cow.
The strict conditions and controls are to be welcomed.
Apart from that, I think we should have learned from the experiences with the BSE crisis and we should be sending a clear signal for more animal ethics and better health and animal protection.
Â Â  . The new case of TSE, confirmed yesterday in Austria, has illustrated the soundness of the longâterm precautionary policy of the European Union to prevent, control and eradicate certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
MrsÂ RothâBehrendt had clearly taken good note of the views of Member States when, during an exchange of views before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, she referred to the draft amendment to the 2001 regulation, and her comments also sparked active engagement on the parts of the British and Austrian presidencies.
The outcome of that commendable work is a text on which MEPs agree in principle.
We are unanimous both in our overall opinion that the transitional period should be extended by a reasonable amount of time and in our adherence to the principle of a consistent ban on the feeding of animal protein to ruminants.
We support the Commission in bringing the existing legislation into line with new international requirements.
Draft amendments, proposed jointly by several political groups, have highlighted inconsistencies and in certain parts they constitute a compromise which is not otherwise ideal, but which is practical at this stage.
An example of this is the issue of feeding fishmeal to cattle.
Fish are, in fact, not a risk factor, as fishmeal is not a vector for TSE.
The problems with fishmeal lie elsewhere.
Fishmeal is unnecessary to the physiological development of ruminants, whether old or young, and, as they are the only animals which can produce protein from grass, they satisfy their protein needs in other ways.
Notwithstanding ethical reservations, this issue is also connected to questions of the medium-term orientation of the common agricultural policy and, amongst other things, the advisability of the prevention of protein aggregation in milk.
We have opted for the solution of feeding fishmeal to young cattle under Commission supervision, for practical control reasons, as a compromise solution, with the aim of ensuring that there is not even a theoretical chance of instances arising on farms where fishmeal can be mixed with bonemeal.
This is the reason for our support for the compromise solution, even though the unanimous view, backed up by expert opinion, is that there is absolutely no justification for feeding fish protein to young animals.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the past decade, the European Parliament has played a decisive role in the political response to BSE, which, although this disease emerged in the United Kingdom as long ago as the 1980s, was given another dimension when the British Health Secretary stated in the Parliament at Westminster that there is a probable link between BSE and a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.
Parliament was quick to give its political response in the shape of an inquiry committee under the leadership of MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, which carried out excellent research into the state of affairs and the Commissionâs and Member Statesâ shortcomings.
This was followed by a conditional vote of no-confidence and one of the key results was that food safety was taken away from DG Agriculture and became an area of policy that falls within the codecision procedure.
Since the adoption of BSE legislation in 2001 and 2002 and the detailed regulations about animal by-products, quite a few controversial measures have also been approved under the comitology procedure.
Since June 2001, BSE legislation has had no fewer than 19 updates on comitology decisions, and so vigilance on the part of this House must be the order of the day.
Let me give you just two examples.
The Commissionâs proposal to reintroduce fishmeal as a feed to ruminants was only withdrawn following strong protests in this House.
The second example is about feed provisions described in AnnexÂ 4 to the Act which were changed by comitology decisions, without Parliamentâs involvement, from detailed descriptions taking up half a page to no fewer than 9 pages of detailed provisions and exceptions.
The comitology procedure remains a huge problem, therefore, and one that we failed to resolve in this negotiation round with the Council.
We are pleased though, that, from now on, consideration must be given to a scientific risk analysis in respect of the impact on man and animal, and this is certainly a good thing.
The agreement reached with the Council at first reading, which is reflected in Amendments 41 to 56, receives our groupâs unqualified support.
The key areas in this respect remain the ban on all animal proteins as a feed for ruminants, the stipulation that fishmeal can only be fed to young ruminant species following scientific assessment and sufficiently strict control measures, as well as regulations about separator meat, which should finally be laid down.
It is particularly regrettable that the rapporteur, MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, cannot be present for this debate.
I wish her much strength, a speedy recovery and I look forward to her resuming her role here in this House very soon.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating my honourable friend, MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, on her exceptional work and to take this opportunity to hope that she will soon be well and back here with us, so that we can continue our very good cooperation.
I endorse, on behalf of my political group, all the compromise amendments which we prepared following discussion, except for two: Amendments 41 and 48.
My political group cannot support these two amendments, because we believe that the ban on the use of animal proteins should remain, even for young ruminants, for two reasons.
The first reason is because we must oppose cannibalistic phenomena; we are talking here of herbivores being fed animal proteins.
The second reason is because we are not fully convinced that the risks of this specific diet being linked to the risks of spongiform encephalopathy have been eliminated.
I would remind you that years ago there was no established link between phenomena of spongiform encephalopathy and sheep and goats and yet recently we have had such cases, which are being carefully examined by the competent laboratory in the United Kingdom; for the moment the specialist scientists are not in a position to assure us that there is no such danger.
With my congratulations once again to the rapporteur and my warm personal wishes, that brings me to the end of my statement.
We say yes, except for Amendments 41 and 48.
Â Â  . Madam President, profit-driven, unnatural methods of animal husbandry, together with the feeding of livestock with bone meal and mechanised meat separation have led to the recent increase in the risk of BSE spreading.
Meat which still contains elements of periosteum, fragments of spinal cord tissue and other nerve tissue is more likely to be infected with prions dangerous to humans and animals.
The positive aspects of the current solutions include prevention, the implementation of a variety of control tests and a return to using traditional feed.
However, fishmeal fed to livestock still poses a threat.
If the afore-mentioned practices had not spread to Poland as well, all farm animals would eat natural feed and meat would be processed using traditional methods.
Fortunately, our agricultural sector is still organic, and there are no demands to introduce innovations for economic reasons.
We are critical of excessively expanding the phytosanitary administration, implementing an unnecessary number of programmes, and also of unnatural compromises, driven by the financial lobby groups, all of which increase costs and increase the threat of diseases, not just spongiform encephalopathy.
Â Â  Madam President, having experienced not just the trauma of BSE but the very protracted and painful recovery until we recently secured the return of British beef exports, none of us wants to see that happen again.
Thus I support the essence of the TSE structures endorsed in this report.
I wish to raise one concern, however, with regard to beef imports into the EU.
It is correctly suggested in one of the amendments that we legislate for acceptable feeding regimes for the cattle whose meat is imported.
But my question is: how do we police those regimes so that the consumer can be truly satisfied that cheaper imports are subject to the same tough control as indigenous produce?
Not only must we lay down the same standards for imported produce as domestic produce, we must be sure that those standards are demonstrably met.
That is the issue I invite the Commissioner to address when he replies in this debate.
Â Â  Madam President, in 2001, during the BSE and CJD scares and outbreaks, the Commission implemented a temporary ban on feed of animal and fish origin being fed to ruminants, pending thorough scientific risk assessment of the regulation.
In accordance with the precautionary principle and as a measure to promote consumer confidence, a policy of zero tolerance of processed animal proteins and meat and animal bonemeal in animal feed was put in place.
And although no case of TSE in fish had ever been discovered, the feeding of fishmeal to ruminants was also subjected to a temporary ban.
This initial six-month ban has been extended on a rolling basis ever since, despite a categorical Commission announcement in 2004 that there was no risk of TSE occurrence, let alone transmission, from fishmeal fed to ruminants and that the policy of zero tolerance of meat and bone spicules in animal feed should be lifted.
The Commission argued that this zero tolerance policy could not be implemented, since the technical detection methods for identifying processed animal protein had not previously been sufficiently accurate to take account of the so-called adventitious presence of small amounts of protein from small birds, mammals and rodents accidentally caught in the harvesting process.
The impossibility of distinguishing these proteins and bone spicules, which do not pose a TSE risk from proteins of ruminant origin which could contain BSE-carrying prions, resulted in a number of high-profile, extremely costly, wasteful and unnecessary withdrawals from shipments and, more controversially, beet-based animal feed, owing to this harmless and unavoidable adventitious presence of non-ruminant proteins.
The proposal before us is intended to amend and update the regulation.
In particular, the categorisation of countries according to existing BSE risk, surveillance and monitoring, specified risk material, giving a permanent legal basis for breeding programmes for resistance to TSEs, giving Member States the option to keep BSE cohort animals in their herd and of course revising the feedback.
Given the protracted uncertainty that the failure to come to a decision on lifting the feed ban has caused to farmers and industry, I sincerely hope that this dossier will be adopted at first reading.
I welcome the compromise reached and support the provisions relating to the possible lifting of the feed ban, because the provision is based on sound science.
I believe that there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect all interests.
Furthermore, I feel it is important to underline that protein is a necessary component of animal diets and the current feed ban is placing us in a precarious position regarding protein supply for animal diets.
In Europe, we are only 23% self-sufficient in proteins.
Most of our higher quality proteins, for example Brazilian soya, are shipped vast distances from countries where the sustainability debate is now raging.
While there is a debate on the ethics about how animals are being fed, it must be borne in mind that the alternatives sometimes pose even bigger ethical questions.
The fact remains that the food industry in the EU is protein deficient.
I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on feeding fishmeal to young calves that have high protein requirements.
We cannot be driven by emotion; otherwise our credibility as legislators will be severely undermined.
Scientific rigour is at the core of this regulation.
We should respect the undisputed scientific consensus that fishmeal poses no risk of TSE.
In conclusion, as regards setting the tolerance thresholds for adventitious presence of bone spicules and technically unavoidable contamination, it is imperative that we apply scientific rigour through standing committees under the comitology procedure.
This procedure is not perfect, but it is more responsive than codecision and ensures informed scientific analysis and risk assessment, rather than risking emotive concerns guiding European decisions in technical areas.
For this reason, I cannot support Amendment 57, which I believe would threaten the chances of reaching a hard-won first reading agreement in the interests of all concerned.
But having said this, as parliamentarians, we should exercise fully and vigilantly our right to scrutinise the outcomes of comitology meetings and to hold the Commission to account when their standing committee expertsâ decisions exceed the powers conferred on them by the TSE regulation.
Madam President, may I send my best wishes to MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt for a speedy recovery and thank her for her long-term interest in this important issue.
Thank you for your patience.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Roth-Behrendt. She has drawn up a balanced report based on common sense.
Turning to the issue of fishmeal, maybe I am a bit emotional, but I tend to agree with those who say that we should not go back to feeding animal protein to ruminants.
We moved away from that a number of years ago.
We continue to feed ruminants and eat them in our countries.
Therefore I believe that is a step backwards.
I wonder what the public would say if we asked them about this.
Would they want us to go back to feeding fish discards to ruminants?
Is that what the public wants?
I can accept the compromise that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has put before us, because it makes sense and it would help us achieve a first reading agreement.
The second issue is the policy shift on tolerance levels for small amounts of animal protein.
In concrete terms, that means that, in my constituency for example, a feed plant which at the moment is producing feed for ruminants will be able at the same time to manufacture feed for pigs and poultry.
At the moment they have to transport feed from other parts of the country at greater expense, with more of an environmental impact because of the transport.
It is a common-sense idea to have the tolerance thresholds to make sure that we have proper clean-up between the different kinds of feed manufacture.
I send my good wishes to Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I hope she will be back soon.
She has produced a very good report and I know that she has worked very hard on TSE and BSE for many years on behalf of this Parliament.
Â Â  Madam President, I wish Mrs Roth-Behrendt a speedy recovery.
She has produced an excellent report, dealing with the subject matter under discussion most diligently.
Consequently I voice my support for her position on almost all aspects of her report except one: the issue of fishmeal.
Fishmeal is a rich source of protein and it is extremely nourishing to animals, including ruminants.
Such animals are able to metabolise the proteins contained in fishmeal and use them for their structural and energy needs.
Therefore the use of fishmeal to feed animals provides the farming industry with an efficient low-cost diet supplement.
There are two main issues concerning feeding fishmeal to ruminants.
The first is how ethically correct it is to feed animal protein to animals that do not normally eat such protein.
That is indeed controversial.
It remains, however, an ethical issue and not one that concerns the aim of the regulation at hand today, which is to prevent, control and eradicate certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
The second â and most relevant â question is the following: can certain TSEs be transmitted from fishmeal to ruminants?
The answer, based on scientific evidence so far available, is ânoâ.
To my knowledge, there has never been a documented case of TSE being transmitted from fishmeal to a ruminant, even though fishmeal has, in the past, been used extensively by farmers and the practice continues today on many farms outside the EU.
Of course we have the precautionary principle to consider.
But how far can we take that principle when we have no hard evidence that TSEs can pass from fish to ruminants?
We know that, in the highly unlikely event of such evidence being found, we could halt the practice straight away.
The precautionary principle works well only when used with caution.
Otherwise it can be a severe impediment to our existence.
For example, why do we not ban travelling in order to prevent transport-related deaths and injuries?
After all, we humans eat fish, and we are not worried about contracting fish-derived spongiform encephalopathy, something that is far more likely than for a cow to contract it from fishmeal.
Had she been here, I know I would not have managed to convince Mrs Roth-Behrendt of my point that fishmeal is good as a ruminant food, but I hope that I have provided the rest of my colleagues with food for thought.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, warmest congratulations to MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, best wishes for her recovery and many thanks for her excellent report and the good negotiations with Council and Commission.
I am very confident that we will reach agreement here with the first reading.
It affords an excellent guarantee of consumer protection.
We fully support the stricter measures the rapporteur calls for.
We consider the rules provided by Parliament, namely TSE checks for cattle over 30 months slaughtered for human consumption and for all cattle over 24 months that have died or been sent for emergency slaughter, to be sufficient and correct.
This measure will save the small of Schleswig-Holstein alone 4 to 5 million euros a year without prejudicing the safety of consumers.
The adaptation to the World Organisation for Animal Healthâs three risk categories is also logical and necessary.
The definition of active and passive surveillance categories safeguards epidemiological monitoring and preserves its quality.
I believe the limited ban on feeding animal proteins to ruminants is correct, even if not totally adequate.
Nature did not envisage ruminants eating animal proteins, except for calves in the form of motherâs milk.
The argument that cleaned proteins from fishmeal are no different may well have a scientific basis, but in my opinion it is not correct.
From an ethical point of view, I find the feeding of fishmeal problematical and undesirable.
Periods of up to eight years in doubtful cases are sufficient for the ban on the sale of animals from third countries.
The abolition of zero tolerance for the presence of animal proteins in feed as a result of accidental contamination is a quite crucial and logical step forward.
In my country, zero tolerance resulted in tens of thousands of tonnes of sugar beet having to be destroyed because animal protein was found in it when it was delivered.
The up to 0.5% protein admixtures that will now be tolerated come predominantly from small animals that were killed in the process of harvesting or had died in the fields long before and are certainly free from TSE.
The new limit here is a real step forward towards sensible legislation.
I agree to the proposal, but cannot refrain from making one small remark in conclusion, namely that life for Parliament would surely be even better and even more democratic if there were less or no comitology.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even ten years after the outbreak of BSE, prevention, control and eradication of certain spongiform encephalopathies are still necessary and still under discussion.
The regulation on this, which we are also discussing today, is intended to bring EU law into line with international requirements and the standards of the World Organisation for Animal Health, particularly important among which are all the precautions.
Food safety and consumer protection are both priorities, but it is equally important to take a measured approach.
Wherever possible, action should be based exclusively on scientific evidence.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I endorse the results and compromises achieved so far.
I should like to express my particular thanks to all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who have been working on this issue for their constructive cooperation and their practical handling of this important issue.
It has proved possible to push through pragmatic simplifications that reduce bureaucracy.
Three aspects are important in this regard.
The first is that we really want to see three instead of five risk categories. This will make it possible to take nationally coordinated action against BSE, and will bring greater safety overall.
The list of specified risk materials also forms part of this.
Secondly, a point on which we are undoubtedly in agreement is that animal proteins should not be fed to ruminants now or in the future.
However, it is right to allow young calves â and by this I mean very young calves â to be fed fishmeal in some cases, subject to appropriate controls.
Young calves do not yet have fully developed ruminant stomachs, and they need animal protein.
The third point is that there should really be a tolerance of up to 0.5% for animal protein accidentally present in feed; be it a mouse, bird, small animal or bone in the field.
Zero per cent tolerance is rarely achievable in this world.
One of the most important points as far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned is that the EC regulation significantly restricts comitology powers.
Together with the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, Parliament decisively influenced risk management in the legislation in the first version of the regulation.
Since then, Parliament has been bypassed and numerous amendments made through comitology.
This does not seem very democratic and often impedes cooperation and acceptance.
Let us take an approach to the beginning of the end that is characterised by moderation and responsibility.
I should like to express my particular thanks to MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt for her good work.
I send her my sincere good wishes and hope, for her sake and ours, that she is soon back among us.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, âbetter regulationâ has already become a catchword that no longer needs translating.
It is important to review acts, regulations and directives on an ongoing basis, and it is right to then incorporate into the legislative text any amendments that new findings render necessary and possible.
Consequently, I, too, welcome the Commissionâs proposal to amend EC Regulation NoÂ 999/2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
I am obliged to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, for her report.
The improvements it introduces reveal a great deal of knowledge of practical necessities and possibilities, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will follow our recommendations.
When we set this regulation in motion in 2001 â with inner uncertainty and without sufficient scientific evidence, and prompted by contemporary events â it was a good measure that pointed the way ahead.
In the present day, we can see that there has been a change â indeed an improvement â in our sensitivity in dealing with animals, animal husbandry and feeding animals, at least.
We support an internationally agreed system of measures to tackle bovine and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies at the level of the World Organisation for Animal Health.
This will also make it possible to gather more information from countries that, unfortunately, do not yet have any data available.
As Konrad Adenauer once said, there is no law against becoming cleverer.
Our knowledge is now much greater as a result of the increased efforts in the field of research, too.
Yet we have also been confirmed in our old knowledge of nature.
Our measuring procedures have become so refined that it is possible to detect a sugar cube in Lake Constance.
Zero tolerances can be measured, but they naturally entail problems â which some Members have just described â because zero tolerance does not exist in nature.
That is why we need a tolerance for natural contamination of feed with animal protein, a practicable limit, which we should like to fix at 0.5% today.
I think that this is a compromise that all parties can support, and for that reason I would also ask the Council and the Commission to support AmendmentÂ 57.
Finally, I should like to remind the Commission that a loophole has emerged as regards the recycling of swill.
The deadlines are about to expire.
We are anxiously awaiting a proposal from the Commission on this, with a view to optimum, safe use and recycling of these materials, which are not waste products but recoverable materials that, if properly processed, can also be properly used.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, MrÂ Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to join in wishing MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt all the best and a speedy recovery, and I should also like to thank her for her excellent report.
We should not forget that there is no prophylaxis or treatment for transmissible and bovine spongiform encephalopathies in either humans or animals, that these diseases are always fatal, and that the impact chain with regard to the formation of these deadly prions has not yet been fully researched by scientists.
I should also like to remind the House that the last few days have seen the discovery of a case of BSE on an organic hill farm in Upper Austria, and that the entire herd of 40Â animals has had to be culled â which, of course, has entailed a loss of livelihood for the farmer concerned.
Nevertheless, adjustments should be made in the way we deal with these justified precautionary measures.
We can also note that there has been a fall in the overall number of cases of illness and that, therefore, the measures have obviously taken effect.
On the other hand, these controls, or the measures taken, are very expensive and represent a real threat to the livelihoods of many farmers.
Yet, in essence, the chain of measures should not be broken.
In particular, the ban on animal protein in feed must be retained.
The compromise reached, that is, that ruminants may be fed fishmeal until they are one year old, is an absolute maximum, in my opinion, and is really most accommodating to the fishing industry.
I consider the adjustments contained in this proposal absolutely necessary, particularly if we consider that the measures have now been extended to all animal species and, in principle, are no longer limited to sheep and cattle.
It is also important to extend these measures to the controls and export bans.
The alignment with the requirements of the World Organisation for Animal Health, namely the reduction of the five risk categories to three, is justified; provided, of course, that this does not result in the measures as a whole being watered down.
Another thorn in my side is that the comitology procedure is being fostered to a certain extent.
Parliament as an institution should make a real effort to keep this to a minimum, so that these measures, which are after all very technical, remain subject to democratic control.
Â Â  Madam President, I was a journalist at the height of the BSE crisis, so I have very vivid memories of the unfolding of that story and its impact not just on politicians but on consumer confidence.
It was story of the century in its impact on farming and how we do our business and on the animal feed industry.
I recall interviewing a feed compounder at that time who had no idea where most of his ingredients were coming from, because the word traceability had not been invented.
I think perhaps we forget how serious the situation was.
In Ireland now, we are looking forward to not slaughtering cohorts when we discover a BSE case in a herd on farms, but many farms have suffered as a result of our more stringent policy in this regard.
Fishmeal is an important protein source and I think that fear alone should not keep it out of the food chain.
As has already been said, Europe produces only about one-fifth of its protein needs and we import soya to fill that gap.
Much of that is genetically modified and it is ironic that European consumers are concerned about GM and yet we have to rely on GM protein for much of our animal feed.
Zero tolerance is a big issue for the feed industry and for farmers.
It has caused huge problems and is unworkable.
In my view, AmendmentÂ 50 is better than AmendmentÂ 57 when it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable contamination of feed ingredients.
We need science to rule here and we need scientific risk assessments of the level of adventitious protein sources in feed.
I think the feed industry itself would welcome clarity on that, because too often zero tolerance has given rise to huge costs as well as concern and confusion within that industry.
We are ten years down the road.
I think it is good that tonight we are debating in less emotive terms than we would have ten years ago, but I would urge that people look at the science of the debate, rather than the emotion of the past, when they are voting on this very important report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0107/2006) by MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the financing of European standardisation (COM(2005)0377 â C6-0252/2005 â2005/0157(COD)).
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking your House, and in particular your rapporteur, MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡, the members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and MrsÂ Herczog, for their prompt advice and this sound report.
The adoption of this proposal by the European legislature creates a new, solid legal basis for the financing of European standardisation.
European standardisation has already played an outstanding role in supporting European policy for more than 20Â years.
For example, it has made a major contribution towards the completion of the internal market.
As part of the New Approach, standardisation complements European legislation and contributes to technical harmonisation, enabling unrestricted trade in goods within the EU.
More than 20 directives have been adopted that follow this approach, a concrete example of which is the Machinery Directive.
Standardisation is also an important tool for realising the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
In view of the positive experience with standards in connection with internal market legislation, there are plans to use the approach of reference to voluntary standards in other areas of law, too, within the framework of what is known as âbetter lawmakingâ.
Examples are legislation in the fields of environmental protection, control of foodstuffs and the energy and transport sector.
In addition, standardisation has the potential to play an important role in strengthening the competitiveness of European industry, as it facilitates interoperability between different technologies, paves the way for the introduction of new technologies and promotes innovation.
Currently, European standardisation receives financial support from the Commission on the basis of legal acts from the 1980s.
In view of the development of budgetary rules, it is imperative to update the legal basis for the financing of standardisation.
The budgetary resources for financing European standardisation must be approved annually within the framework of the budgetary procedure.
These currently amount to EURÂ 19Â million.
The beneficiaries of Community financing are the European standardisation organisations CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, which are listed in AnnexÂ I of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations.
Under special circumstances, support may also be given to other authorities in respect of activities necessary to support European standardisation.
In the course of the discussions, many parties called for European standardisation to take sufficient account of all the relevant interests, such as those of consumers, environmental protection and small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Commission shares this view and is working towards improving the present situation.
This decision is not intended to guarantee the financing of the individual interests concerned, however.
I should like to point out in this connection that support is provided for the participation of experts, for example from SMEs, within the framework of our SME programme.
The same goes for the involvement of consumer and environmental protection and occupational health and safety stakeholders.
It is also the responsibility of Member States to guarantee sufficient participation of the relevant stakeholders.
The Commission expressly welcomes the amendments drawn up in cooperation between Parliament and the Council.
We can support all of Parliamentâs amendments.
I should like to express my particular thanks once again to Parliament and the rapporteur for their efforts to make agreement possible at first reading.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen. Why does aÂ sheet of A4 fit into an envelope?
Why do SIM cards work in all mobile phones?
Why would it be helpful to have identical power points throughout the European Union?
Once things like this function smoothly, they are so self-evident that we hardly notice them.
For such apparently simple things to happen, however, requires serious thought on somebodyâs part, and this âsomebodyâ is the European standardisation system, which is made up of three European and 29 national standards organisations, and more than 60Â 000 experts.
They draft European standards, which are agreed by consensus and are based on voluntary agreement.
Because the main function of common European standards is to remove technical barriers to trade and to promote the internal market, standardisation policy should be regarded aÂ cornerstone of EU policy for meeting the targets of the revised Lisbon Strategy.
For 20 years now European standardisation has, thanks mainly to the directives known as the ânew approachâ, greatly streamlined European legislation.
Directives drawn up in the context of the new approach apply only to basic safety requirements, consumer protection and environmental protection.
Technical requirements are set out in detailed technical standards.
This, Commissioner Verheugen, is the correct way to achieve good European legislation.
When IÂ worked as an architect, standards were a tool I used in my work.
They provided me with aÂ point of reference in designing, assessing and approving buildings.
This was one of the reasons why IÂ accepted the assignment of reporting to the European Parliament with aÂ proposal to the European Commission on financing European standardisation.
The aim of this decision is to put in place aÂ consolidated legal framework for providing this financing.
Even though European standardisation is necessary for the functioning of the internal market, there has as yet been no legislative basis dedicated specifically to financing it.
The EUâs contribution towards financing European standards is currently 2%, while national organisations contribute approximately 5%, and enterprises 93%, primarily by providing expertise.
The Member States have their roles to play in technical standardisation, in that they have to ensure the adoption of European standards by the national systems.
IÂ am pleased that my country, Slovakia, has been among the quickest to transpose European standards thanks to the Slovak Technical Standards Act.
IÂ am convinced that European standardisation is aÂ system that will help to create aÂ favourable business environment.
Business representatives and other interested parties are becoming increasingly aware of the role technical standardisation plays in the business world.
It must be aÂ priority for Parliament to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises, and in particular micro-enterprises and trades enterprises are able to effectively use European standards.
It is in the interest of the Union to contribute financially to the translation of these standards into all official languages, to make them equally and transparently accessible, in particular to small enterprises in the new Member States which lack the financial and human resources to translate specialist standards.
It would be helpful for handbooks to be available to SMEs explaining the standards to them.
The seven-month discussions between Parliament, the European Commission, the Council and other interested organisations have convinced me that this problem has taken its rightful place in EU policy.
In the approval process IÂ supported all proposed amendments which helped to improve the Commissionâs proposal.
IÂ am pleased with the enormous amount of assistance from all rapporteurs, and in particular the shadow rapporteur EditÂ Herzog and PaulÂ RÃŒbich, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy rapporteur who was asked to give an opinion.
Please allow me also to thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission for their exemplary assistance and their wish to find aÂ consensus right from the outset, allowing aÂ financial framework for European standardisation to be found at the first reading.
In conclusion IÂ would like to express my conviction that my report and the support that Parliament has shown for it will lead to adequate financing for European standardisation, which will contribute to aÂ simpler and safer life for all European citizens.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, although, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I generally support the approach taken by the Commission, I should like to emphasise the political dimension of this matter and to point out, if I may, two shortcomings.
For two years now, the European Commission has been seeking to develop standardisation in the context of health, social, societal and environmental services.
It proposes to make wider use of standardisation work in the field of services, while preserving the monopolistic nature of the bodies mentioned in the report â which is, in my opinion, regrettable â even though standardisation has been mainly focused up to now on industrial products and nothing else.
Standards, when viewed in the specific context of services, tend to be substituted for the harmonisation of European legislation, which is worrying.
However necessary, indeed essential, standardisation may be, it cannot take precedence over legislation.
These standards are required in all European invitations to tender but, until now, they have been drawn up exclusively by manufacturers, without any democratic control, and may accordingly constitute an obstacle to market access, which is something that we cannot accept.
That is why it is important to ensure, in particular, that all of the parties involved can actually participate in the work of these bodies.
That obviously includes manufacturers, but it also includes consumer associations, clients, local authority representatives or even environmental protection associations.
The compromise amendments certainly address this concern, but only to a very small extent.
On the other hand, I felt that, insofar as public funds were involved, the European Parliament had to be informed each year of the standardisation process that had actually been implemented.
European standards organisations are actually associations of general interest in receipt of public aid from the Community.
As such, they must obviously meet obligations with regard to transparency.
The compromise amendment regarding this issue makes provision for a Commission assessment of standardisation activities to be carried out at least once every five years, which is clearly not often enough.
So there you have my observations summed up in a few words, MadamÂ President.
I should like wholeheartedly to congratulate the rapporteur and the coordinators on the quality of the work done, but I deplore the insufficient efforts made to encourage greater plurality and regret that the assessments of standardisation activities should be so infrequent.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡, for her excellent cooperation â which cannot be faulted â with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the impressive results.
I should also like to thank CommissionerÂ Verheugen, however, as he has managed, by way of better regulation, to create a new instrument â namely European standardisation â to enable the objective to be achieved faster and more efficiently.
For example, we are currently addressing the issue of mobile TV: the problem of Nokia versus LG standardisation.
European standards should be created for this as quickly as possible to enable us to take the lead in the global market.
Another example is the allocation of frequencies in the linear-digital field.
If carried out quickly, efficiently and well, standardisation offers prospects of gaining market shares in this field.
A further example is mobile-telephone chargers: here, too, there is a lack of standardisation.
The need for action on this is tremendous, and dramatic progress could be achieved by means of economies of scale.
For this reason, I am also pleased that particular attention is being paid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and I believe that the next thing we need is a Green Paper on standardisation.
This would enable our economy to achieve the Lisbon criteria significantly faster and more efficiently by means of standardisation that is accepted worldwide â one of the best examples of this being the GSM system.
A Green Paper in this field could give us the opportunity of demonstrating where our future opportunities lie.
This represents a challenge.
Parliament is already pleased to note that its cooperation with the Commission on this is as constructive as ever.
Â Â  . Madam President, it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of my group and as the coordinator for the committee, to congratulate Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡ on her first report in Parliament.
I am sure that it will be the first of many.
I am really delighted that she has taken on this role.
It is entirely appropriate that, coming from one of the new Member States most active in the field of the internal market, she has not only blazed a trail for Members from Slovakia, but also has the moral authority to carry this forward.
If you look at the internal market scoreboard, you will see that top of the list of countries that have transposed internal market legislation and adopted European standards are the new Member States.
They are putting all the old Member States to shame in that respect.
So I believe that she has done outstanding work here.
I am also delighted that we have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission in pre-conciliation to get this important package through at first reading.
Let me turn to some of the issues.
I have to take issue with the spokesman from the Committee on Budgets, who has totally misunderstood what this is all about.
As you said, Commissioner, it is largely about the development of effective technical standards for products.
That is one of your crucial responsibilities in the new allocation of portfolios in the Commission.
But we must not forget that this is all part of the total development of the internal market.
We are now on the verge of a very important review of the future of the internal market.
I share the view of my colleague, Mr RÃŒbig, that the role of standardisation bodies is crucial in making that market work better.
We still have problems where those standards are not being recognised by Member States.
It is still too difficult for manufacturers to take advantage of the single market.
I have to ask the limited number of people here how we are going to create jobs and growth in the European economy if we cannot get the internal market to work properly; if we cannot engage all the tools and weapons at our disposal.
I was really pleased that the President of the Commission, in the statement that he made this week about delivery for our citizens, put the completion of the internal market absolutely at the top of the list.
That is where it should be.
If we cannot make the internal market work, what else have we got to do to achieve success in the global economy?
Standards are part of that, not just in Europe but also in the world as a whole.
As the rapporteurs say in one of their amendments â and I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Herczog, for her work â we want to ensure fair and transparent access to European standards for all market players throughout the Union.
That is what this proposal is all about.
Â Â  . â Madam President, we may soon be able to form a club of those who spend their evenings in this Parliament.
It is interesting that the questions raised here are always those that have been followed by the same MEPs every night.
I, too, would like to start by congratulating MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡ on her first report.
Like MrÂ Harbour, I, too, hope that she will draft many more reports in the next three years, during the time that we are MEPs here together.
I would like to thank her for the very friendly environment she created both in the Committee on the Internal Market and in the course of the talks and negotiations with the Council, enabling us to reach an agreement.
This environment enabled us to reach an agreement on every issue following the first reading, and hopefully everyone will be able to support the amendment proposals.
I need to make another brief comment.
MrÂ Harbour said that new Member States are at the top of the list in transposing internal market regulations.
At this point we need to remember the work of Commissioner Verheugen in this area, because without him we would never have been able to do this so efficiently.
At that time he was responsible for the enlargement of the internal market.
Returning to the report, I think that the most important result we have achieved is that by starting this European financing, we are better able to ensure the improved operation of the internal market and clean competition for each market player and interested party; also, we have managed to achieve this without creating too much bureaucracy or, God forbid, a new institution, which we are so keen on doing.
I personally like the approach of trying to increase the efficiency of the work of existing institutions that already operate efficiently, and making it available to everybody, using a relatively low amount of resources.
The law in the process of being adopted ensures equal opportunities for companies in respect of Community assistance allocation and the handling of public funds, also ensuring an open and transparent procedure, while â and I emphasise it again: this is extremely important to us in view of the Better Regulation Programme â it prevents unnecessary bureaucracy.
Personally, I feel that this is the greatest result achieved by this amendment proposal.
It is very important to mention that the appropriate and competent Community assistance provided for standardisation is not an expenditure, but a clear investment.
It is an investment in the better operation of the internal market, in the enhancement of European competitiveness, in the information, protection and increased safety of consumers using standard products and services, and in the improvement of the market situation and chances of small and medium-sized enterprises, even if â and I completely agree with the Commissioner here â this law is not meant to support small entrepreneurs individually.
I would like to express my gratitude once more for the cooperation of all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work together in connection with this law, and my wish is that we will have many other laws like this, and that REACH, in particular, will follow along the same lines.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the mid-1980s, European standardisation has made it possible to achieve both the free movement of industrial products in the European Community and a high degree of protection for consumers and workers.
European standardisation complements key European policy objectives by establishing a consensus between economic operators, and has now managed to establish itself in approximately 20 industry sectors.
This has considerably simplified the process of making goods and services on the internal market both comparable and compatible, and so the Commissionâs financial support and continuing development of European standardisation warrants our support.
The catalogue of the three European standardisation bodies, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, now numbers more than 15Â 000 standards and other European specifications.
This standardisation work has often rendered detailed Community legislation in the areas concerned superfluous, and it is sometimes possible to avoid legislation altogether.
For this reason, standardisation should be seen as an integral part of the continuing efforts towards better lawmaking and thus as part of a policy for growth and employment.
In addition to the internal market aspect, European standardisation has the potential to support a whole range of Community policy measures capable of increasing the competitiveness of European enterprises.
This applies in particular to the fields of trade policy, transport, the environment and security of travel documents.
In the field of research and technological development, clear common standards are needed as a source of technical expertise and as a market instrument.
As with GSM and Galileo, which have already been mentioned by some fellow Members, it is thus possible to create a common trading language.
Despite this positive assessment, European standardisation and its institutional framework need to be improved and strengthened.
The provisions of the new Financial Regulation require the creation of a clear, complete, detailed legal basis for European standardisation.
I believe that the compromise proposal is capable of meeting these requirements.
All the actors involved deserve thanks for their constructive cooperation, particularly the rapporteur, MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡.
I shall be recommending that my group support the compromise reached, and am confident that agreement will be reached here as early as at first reading.
Incidentally, I believe that we should be holding this debate, too, in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, technical harmonisation is not only eliminating the technical obstacles to trade and everyday life, but is also ensuring a high level of consumer protection across all Member States.
Following the introduction of the European standard for playgrounds in 1997, for example, the rate of childrenâs injuries fell by more than 25% in Austria.
The aim of this directive is not to set up a new office, but to introduce a legal framework for systematically financing standardisation offices and agencies.
There are many reasons for proper financing, but I would like to mention just one.
The offices for standardisation have very limited national budgets in the new Member States compared to Germany, France or the United Kingdom, and they must also carry the burden of translation costs.
This is because standards are incorporated everywhere into national law, but for the new Member States they are available only in English, German or French.
Small firms, of course, do not have the resources for time-consuming translations.
So if we want to ensure that all businesses make use of these worthwhile standards, they must be made available in all of the official languages.
You will surely agree that it is in the interests of the European Community to contribute financially towards the cost of these translations.
I value the Commissionâs proposal highly.
The rapporteur has, moreover, made some valuable additions to it which will, for example, assist small and medium-sized enterprises.
She also proposes measures that will increase control and transparency in respect of the new financing.
I would therefore like to thank MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡.
I appreciate in particular the care and attention that has gone into the preparation of this report, and I would note that she has played an important role in the drafting of a well thought-out and non-controversial proposal that will serve the citizens of Europe well.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is already rather late, and my fellow Members have already made many good points.
First of all, therefore, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteur, and wish to offer her my sincere congratulations on the difficult work she has done.
As deputy coordinator, I believe that this represents an important step.
Tomorrowâs vote is the result of an informal trialogue aimed at bringing the issue of the financing of European standardisation to a successful conclusion at first reading.
I believe that the compromise that the rapporteur has achieved is a respectable one.
In spite of all the positive aspects pointed out here by various Members, however, I would venture to make a criticism, an objection.
Frequent experience has shown that the economy, which is the main beneficiary from the harmonisation of the EU internal market, participates in these rules, and indisputably has urgent need of them, and therefore we MEPs must support this process.
Yet experience has also shown that many citizens â and many mayors or other economic actors â are not seeing these rules the way they were intended.
There are some rules, such as the pre-standard on the prevention of crime by urban planning and building design, to which mayors are objecting â not entirely unjustifiably, in my opinion.
That was why I welcomed the rapporteurâs original proposal for the costs of standardisation to be oriented to a much greater extent towards the costs actually incurred.
Owing to past experience, however, this proposal could not be pushed through in the agreement with the Council and the Commission.
Nevertheless, I believe that it is perfectly appropriate for us MEPs to ensure that standardisation really has parliamentary legitimacy where the public is affected, and can also really be achieved by self-administration where only economic actors are concerned.
In this respect, I hope that we can make progress with these issues, too, within the framework of the Internal Market Strategy â with which not only the Commission but undoubtedly Parliament, too, will be concerned in the coming months.
Â Â  â IÂ would like to start by thanking my colleague, the Slovak Member MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinska, for her work in creating this thorough report.
European standardisation has an important role to play in removing technical barriers to trade, and thereby promoting the development of the European single market.
Technical standards replace detailed legislative provisions and simplify the rules, which will at the end of the day make the entire European economy more competitive.
Defining mandatory basic requirements will also ensure a high degree of protection for consumers, health and the environment.
Standardisation is indispensable in sectors such as health care, transport, telecommunications or electrical engineering.
In the health care sector, for instance, there are some 10Â 000 different medical devices, and in this field European standards play an important regulatory role.
Whilst setting out detailed definitions of the requirements for ensuring aÂ high level of patient safety, they also encourage innovation.
More than 80% of companies operating in this area are SMEs, which is why we appreciate the rapporteurâs efforts to ensure equal access to European standards for this group of players.
Since 1985, when the ânew approachâ to European standards was adopted, more than 15Â 000 standards have been issued.
The European Union, however, makes only aÂ minor contribution to the overall financing of European standardisation, even though studies have shown that the benefits to the economy far outweigh the costs.
For this reason it is important for the EU to provide a sizeable portion of the finance for the entire system not just within the European Union, but also on an international level.
Â Â  â As the revised Lisbon Strategy makes clear, Community-wide rules underpinning a uniform understanding and implementation of technical standardisation constitute very important tools for creating and sustaining the conditions for policy implementation, and hence ensuring the competitiveness and constant sustainable development of the Community.
We can regard technical standardisation as aÂ binding component for development in many fields, such as research, industry, the economy and health care, and above all in the common interest, as it serves everyone, even if that is not immediately obvious.
We only realise how important standards are when something does not work properly.
IÂ remember how the new Member States recently had to rebuild their technical systems.
In Slovakia that meant revising more than 25Â 000 technical standards, scrapping almost half of them and incorporating 15Â 000 national standards into the remainder, all of which required a lot of investment.
We must underline the great contribution to this made by the internationally recognised and long-established Slovak Standards Institute.
We now face the considerable task of improving the financing for European standardisation in support of the competitiveness of European industry in particular, and of European policy on global competition.
For this reason this decision is of the utmost importance.
To construct, coordinate and further refine aÂ complex and extensive mechanism of technical standards which functions dynamically requires clear, rational and adequate financial support.
In conclusion IÂ would like to draw attention to the praiseworthy and constructive efforts of MrsÂ PleÅ¡tinska, who has succeeded in building a consensus over this important issue.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my particular thanks for the very constructive spirit that has characterised this debate, and for the consensus that has emerged from it.
This is very important, as technical standardisation is something that, astonishingly, is frequently entirely misjudged in the mind of the European public.
We have all seen how certain standards have been seized on in the public political debate as bizarre examples of âexcessive European regulationâ.
It has been rightly pointed out this evening that the European public would be very surprised if this instrument did not exist, as our daily lives could no longer function without it, nor could most economic sectors.
It is a very modern instrument and, from a legal point of view, a very flexible one and the instrument of choice.
Indeed, the question should be asked â and here I refer to a remark by the rapporteur from the Committee on Budgets, with which I disagree â whether it is always necessary to bring in the legislative big guns â laws, in other words â straight away when we want to regulate something, or whether putting responsibility for technical standards in the hands of those who need them, and merely laying down a policy guideline stating that a rule is necessary, would perhaps take much greater account of our own societyâs right to freedom.
I should like to announce to you once more this evening my political intent to use the experience we have gained with the New Approach over the last 20Â years to extend this modern instrument of European legislation to other fields of the internal market and to other policies, too.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0136/2006) by MrsÂ BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on appointment of an Executive Board Member of the European Central Bank (C6-0071/2006 â 2006/0801(CNS)).
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament attaches a great deal of importance to the issue of the democratic control of the European Central Bank.
On behalf of all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I imagine, but also on behalf of the Commissioner, I should like, if I may, simply to deplore the fact that this debate is being held at such a late hour.
If we want the issue of monetary dialogue to be taken seriously, then it seems to us that a decision as important as the replacement of a member of the Executive Board should not be taken at such a late hour.
All the more so given that, for us, it is a question today of defining our position on the issue referred to us by the Council concerning the last replacement of a member that has sat on the Executive Board of the Central Bank since the outset and of the last appointment that will be made before 2010.
This appointment is therefore important with regard to the content of monetary policy.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I must point out in this House that, following a vote within the ECOFIN Council, the candidate put forward by that body, whose appointment must be validated by the European Council, required a majority vote in order to be presented as the candidate supported by our Parliament.
In that consultation procedure, the profile expected of the candidate is one of possessing the necessary authority and professional experience in the finance or banking sector.
Those are the terms of the Treaty.
The candidate proposed to us clearly meets those criteria.
The issue that was, in fact, very much the driving force behind the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was a certain anxiety with regard to the circumstances in which the debate was conducted in the Council.
At a time when everyone acknowledges that monetary policy is an independent policy, when the political power does not have much to say and when practically all of the members of Eurogroup and ECOFIN have criticised the monetary policy when it came to raising interest rates, this appointment has not been the subject of any debate whatsoever.
That is why, at the same time as assessing this candidature, we sent a letter to the President of ECOFIN, MrÂ Karl-Heinz Grasser, the main points of which I should like to go over in this House.
We looked into the selection procedure of members of the Executive Board and we therefore question the Council on two aspects of that procedure.
The first concerns the system of rotation of membership on the basis of nationality.
I, for my part, understand that the main economies of the eurozone must be represented on the Executive Board, but that opinion is not shared by all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
In any case, the issue of how members of the eurozone are represented on the Executive Board was raised by members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, while that of the size of the Executive Board was not, for its part, mentioned.
Next, the issue of the diversity of backgrounds represented on the Executive Board was also a matter of concern for the members of our committee, based on this idea that we perhaps need people within the Executive Board of the Central Bank who come from different backgrounds so that, when the monetary policy of the entire eurozone is at stake, all of the different points of view can be expressed.
Our committee felt that, in the long run, the Council should be able to hold a genuine and open debate, with guidelines, on the profile that should be proposed by the Member State, which would have the opportunity to appoint a member by respecting the diversity of the member countries of the eurozone.
We believe that the European Parliament should have the right to a vote of approval, as the members of the Commission do.
That is the spirit in which we composed this letter to the President of ECOFIN.
I believe that all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with the entire institution behind them, are open to dialogue with the Council, thanks to which we will have a better and totally satisfactory procedure in 2010.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ Stark, the Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, is a convincing candidate for the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.
He was involved in the creation of the framework conditions for the euro as State Secretary of the German Ministry of Finance and is, so to speak, one of the founding fathers of the euro.
Furthermore, something revealed by the hearing that is very positive is that he is a committed European.
That should also be mentioned at this point.
He stands for continuity in the European Central Bank, and for the objective of independence, which is particularly important at a time when increasing attempts are being made to subject the European Central Bank to external requirements.
He stands for a low rate of inflation, for a stable currency, for the Stability and Growth Pact â which is very important at this particular time, when Member States are finding it hard to make savings.
With the enlargement of the euro area around the corner, continuity is the overriding consideration.
Speaking of the enlargement of the euro area, I should like to say that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats warmly welcomes CommissionerÂ Almuniaâs decision today in this context.
The issue of Parliamentâs role has also been debated.
I, too, should like to see a strengthening of Parliament, and wish to emphasise that MrÂ Stark stated explicitly that the role of Parliament is very important to him.
I hope that, in future, he will intervene accordingly on the Executive Board of the ECB when the CESR external expert group on clearing and settlement is engaged again, as it was just recently: we shall be looking at whether he really gives Parliament top priority.
That was just an aside.
Something that should play no part in Parliament in future, however, is screening of fundamental attitudes, and that is why we should think carefully about how to do things in future.
What we need are candidates with a good image, with the relevant experience, like MrÂ Stark.
It must not be a case of who shares our personal political views and who does not.
That is not Parliamentâs job, and I would not follow this course.
I support the objective of ensuring that there are no national fiefdoms in the European Central Bank.
We must also ensure, however, that both large and small economies are equally represented on the Executive Board of the ECB.
In conclusion, I wish MrÂ Stark very great success with his new job, which we hope he will take up â for the sake of the euro and Europe, and an appropriate, effective, significant portfolio in the Governing Council.
Â Â  . Madam President, in leading business circles there is a growing recognition that it is imperative to provide for diversity in management and supervisory boards.
Diversity in educational backgrounds, work experience, age, gender and nationalities guarantees more sensitive, alert and creative cooperation than just adding more of the same sort of people.
Replacing one Bundesbanker with another does not promise much diversity and creativity.
If it had been a company operating in a fast-changing environment, I would have advised the ECB, when it was drawing up a profile for a new board member, to look at this aspect of diversity.
But the ECB is not a company and its policy is kept static; it is apparently deemed that it should eternally remain as it was at its creation.
I will not hide my criticism of this lack of dynamism in the development of monetary policy, although I agree that it is not only the ECB that should be addressed but also the political decision-makers, the Ecofin Council and the governments of Member States, which nowadays do not seem to be very inspired by macroeconomic coordination at European level that complements their common monetary policy.
But in this debate tonight we are not dealing with the policies of the ECB and the eurozone as such, but with the appointment of a new Bundesbanker to the Executive Board.
The strict remit of our ECON Committee is to assess the capabilities and competences of the nominated candidates and we do not have much to say in this debate, because the candidate meets the criteria and performed well in the hearing that we had with him.
In my political group, the PSE, we are more interested in discussing the procedure leading to this appointment.
Originally we proposed to do that in the report that we are dealing with now and we were disappointed that a majority of the committee did not support it.
That was why we abstained in the vote.
In the coordinatorsâ meeting following that committee meeting, we jointly agreed to write a letter to Mr Grasser, as well as starting a more fundamental debate about the nomination procedure, particularly the upgrading and reinforcement of the role of the European Parliament in such nomination procedures.
It is very important for the European Parliament to counterbalance what I see as a strong renationalisation and non-integrationist trend in the way Member States deal with these issues.
It is clear where our criticisms are focused: there is apparent evidence that large Member States have âreserved seatsâ.
There is a lack of debate about profile and portfolios and this diversity of backgrounds, and a lack of choice.
The issue of appointment is taken as an âAâ item in the Council debate and the European Parliament has a very limited role.
We hope that if we have the opportunity to present more proposals, the Commission, the Council and the ECB will ready to discuss with us a change in this appointment procedure.
But we hope to cooperate very well with any candidate put forward by MrÂ Radwan.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the proposal to appoint Professor JÃŒrgen Stark as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.
The report presented by MrsÂ BerÃšs clearly expresses this positive assessment, and therefore has the support of our group.
MrÂ Stark gave convincing written answers to the questionnaire presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
At his hearing in committee on 18Â April, he then proved himself once more to be an excellent candidate for membership of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.
He is convincing on account not only of his personal integrity, but also of his wide-ranging experience and his competence, particularly in matters of monetary policy.
He played a substantial role in shaping the process of monetary union from 1988 until the introduction of euro notes and coins in 2002.
Thus, he ranks among the architects of the Stability and Growth Pact, and he has spoken out consistently and clearly against watering it down.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcome the fact that MrÂ Stark is a well-known advocate of the independence of the European Central Bank and attaches the highest priority to price stability.
He has declared his unequivocal belief in the cornerstones of monetary union, and as a result we can be sure that he will endeavour, as a European, to act for the benefit of all.
In addition, MrÂ Stark has given assurances that he is prepared to engage in an open dialogue with Parliament.
We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs shall take him at his word.
I should like to conclude with a few critical remarks, which are of an exclusively procedural nature and have nothing to do with the quality of Professor Starkâs candidacy or with him personally.
Although all the previous speakers have already pointed this out, I consider it sufficiently important to emphasise it once more: this nomination is not the result of a competitive process in which several applicants present their candidacies, but of political deliberations on the part of the Council.
In addition, the large euro countries appear to look on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank as a fiefdom and exclude the representatives of other Member States from the outset.
The Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, MrsÂ BerÃšs, has written a letter to the Austrian Council Presidency proposing procedural improvements, as she has just stated.
The ALDE Group expressly supports this proposal.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to MrÂ Klinz for distinguishing so clearly between the assessment of the candidate himself and the procedure, because we must not give the impression that our demands and desires as regards the procedure interfere with our assessment of the man himself.
Today we are assessing the candidate himself, and, in MrÂ Stark, the Council has put forward a strong candidate to succeed MrÂ Issing.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Executive Board Member MrÂ Issing once again for his work and constructive cooperation.
MrÂ Stark represents a strong signal for the Stability and Growth Pact, for the Maastricht criteria, for the independence of the ECB, for a strong euro and for continuity and calculability â and continuity and calculability are preconditions for confidence.
We need not only greater confidence in the EU, but also great confidence in the independence of the ECB and in the euro as a strong currency.
For that reason, I ask all my fellow Members to demonstrate our great confidence in MrÂ Stark tomorrow.
I would also ask that we refrain from sacrificing these facts, which are also set out in the report â committed European, competent expert, champion of the value of independence, advocate of prioritising price stability, firm conviction in monetary policy, openness with regard to the rights of Parliament, and commitment to stepping up the dialogue between the two institutions â to party political small-mindedness, because this attitude has no place in either the EU or the European Central Bank.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0162/2006) by MrÂ Rosati, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on public finances in the EMU (2005/2166(INI)).
Â Â  . â Madam President, the state of public finances has a real influence on the rate of economic growth, employment and macroeconomic stability.
It is also an important indicator of the health of the common European currency.
This is why the Treaty on European Union clearly states that developments in the public finances of the Member States are of interest to the bodies of the Union, including the European Parliament.
Exercising its powers under the Treaty, the European Parliament has once again reviewed the state of public finances in the European Union and will adopt a report on the matter.
The main message behind this yearâs report is the conclusion that public finances in the majority of the Member States are still not balanced and that this situation has not improved significantly since last year.
This calls for continued efforts to improve tax policy.
The total deficit of the 25 Member States of the European Union increased in 2005 to 2.7% of GDP. In the eurozone it rose to 2.9% of GDP.
In effect, public debt has systematically grown in the last few years in relation to GDP and by the end of 2005 rose above 70% in the eurozone.
Since 2003, 11 European Union Member States have been running deficits in excess of 3% of GDP, and 10 countries have been subject to excessive deficit procedures.
Most worryingly of all, four of the largest economies in the European Union, namely Germany, France, Great Britain and Italy, also find themselves among those offending against budgetary discipline rules.
This situation clearly shows that some Member States are experiencing considerable difficulties in restoring the balance of public finances.
There is a lack of political will and determination to implement the necessary changes.
This state of affairs also shows that the preventive and corrective procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact have not been very effective to date.
One of the main reasons for this unfortunate budgetary situation has been the persistently low rate of economic growth in Europe.
Failure to implement indispensable structural reforms, increasing international competition, uncertain job prospects and a lack of certainty regarding future demand mean that, for a number of years, Europe has been developing more slowly than other parts of the world.
The policy hitherto implemented has not succeeded in changing this state of affairs.
An expansive tax policy and a restrictive monetary policy have produced an unfortunate âpolicy mixâ and slowed economic growth.
The situation is made worse by insufficient coordination of tax policy in the eurozone.
This coordination is vital in order to increase the effectiveness of economic policy and in order to maintain confidence in the common currency, which requires tax reforms to be synchronised and measures that result in budget imbalance to be avoided.
One of the reasons behind the tendency towards stagnation in Europe is the insufficient progress of structural reform in many Member States, and especially a lack of action to increase the flexibility of the labour market, to promote professional activity, to remove barriers on the services market, to promote innovation and to support entrepreneurship.
In this context, the slow progress made in implementing the Lisbon Strategy gives particular cause for concern.
Madam President, in the report we suggest a list of measures aimed at improving the state of public finances.
First of all, it is necessary to adhere strictly and rigorously to the tax regulations set out in the modified version of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This will help the Pact to regain credibility and strengthen its disciplinary role.
We call for faster structural reform, and in particular for the decisive implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
We also propose measures aimed at streamlining fiscal procedures, increasing coordination and improving the effectiveness of tax policy.
We call on the European Commission to assess the likely effect of increased tax policy coordination on economic growth in the Union.
We recommend measures to improve the quality of tax statistics, the introduction of transparent rules for the assessment of assets and future pension obligations, the taking into account of the economic cycle in drawing up budget deficit estimates and an extension of the budget forecast timescale to two years.
We suggest that a single set of macroeconomic assumptions whose source could be the European Commission should be accepted as the basis for drafting the budget in the Member States.
Finally, we recommend that measures be taken aimed at strengthening motivation for the implementation of tax reform by Member States, including the publication of reports on the dangers associated with a failure to balance public finances.
The measures mentioned are necessary in order for tax and budget policy to contribute to faster economic growth and increased employment in the European Union.
The European Parliament should send out a clear and unambiguous political signal on this matter.
That is why I turn to you, my colleagues, and ask you to endorse this report.
Â Â  Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank MrÂ Rosati for his excellent report and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having taken the initiative to reflect on the situation of public finances in the economic and monetary Union.
They have enriched this very necessary debate on how to conduct economic policy â particularly budgetary policies â so as to enhance economic growth and promote job creation, aims that we all share.
I must begin my brief speech with two comments that set my position apart from the statements contained in MrÂ Rosatiâs report, probably because some time has passed and has brought some positive results.
Since last year, when the Commission drafted its report on public finances, the figures in which served as the basis for the Rosati report, we have received new information both on economic growth and on the balance of spending or public deficit situation in the countries of the European Union, which improves the outlook.
I should like to discuss that briefly.
On 8Â May I had the chance to present the Commissionâs spring economic forecasts and, in doing so, I was able to publicly state that, in our opinion, according to the Commissionâs analysis, growth in 2006 in both the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole will approach our potential growth: in the euro zone it will exceed 2%, specifically reaching 2.1%, compared with the 1.3% achieved in 2005, and in the European Union as a whole it will be 2.3%, also clearly higher than the growth recorded in 2005.

We are therefore entering a phase of much more evident recovery than we could envisage when we in the Commission presented the report on public finances for 2005, and that in itself is a positive sign.
I hasten to say, however, that it is not enough, because growing at the rate of our current growth potential is not enough to meet all of our citizensâ demands or, above all, to create sufficient jobs to produce a clear, sustained fall in unemployment rates, which are still in excess of 8%.





We have to increase our growth potential â and in that I agree with the ideas expressed in the Rosati report; we have to persevere along the path sketched out in the revised Lisbon Strategy; we have to continue to put the national reform plans into practice within the framework of that strategy; we have to continue reforming the product, service and labour markets; we have to correct budgetary imbalances wherever they persist, achieve greater sustainability for our public finances and, of course, improve the quality of public spending; in particular, we have to make a greater effort in all of our policies aimed at skills enhancement, research and development, innovation and education in general.
The second comment that I should like to make relates to the particular subject of public deficits.
The report notes that the situation worsened in 2005 and attributes that to the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The final figures for 2005 refute that statement; the public deficit in 2005 both in the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole was well below what we estimated a few months ago: it came to 2.3% in the EU as a whole and 2.4% in the euro zone, several points, therefore, below our forecasts at the time when the Commission published its report on public finances for 2005.
According to our forecasts for 2006 and 2007, this situation will continue and, if the Member States adopt additional measures, we will see a clear improvement.
In my view, I do not think one can say that the new Stability and Growth Pact has been incorrectly applied, but rather that the new Stability and Growth Pact has been successfully applied to correct the excessive deficits: there were seven countries with excessive deficits of 3% at the end of 2005, compared with 12 countries currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure, which will probably leave the procedure once those improvements in public deficits are confirmed.
The stability and convergence programmes, which have been approved under the guidelines and parameters of the new Pact for the first time, show a qualitatively clear improvement in the Member Statesâ medium-term budget strategies, with greater attention to sustainability and a greater effort to improve the quality of public finances and to link budgetary and fiscal policies with the growth strategies included in the Lisbon Strategy and in the national growth plans.

Apart from these two comments, there is considerable convergence in everything else between the proposals and statements in the Rosati report and the Commissionâs opinions and criteria.
We agree on the need to avoid pro-cyclical policies, on the need for a reorientation of public expenditure towards greater physical, human and technological capital accumulation, and on the need for greater efforts to make the Member Statesâ budgetary procedures more uniform, particularly in the euro zone; we obviously agree that we must place the accent on how to address the challenge of an ageing society.
Now that economic recovery is beginning, now that we have defined the Lisbon Strategy, and now that the 25 Member States have defined their priorities for structural reforms aimed at growth and employment, I believe â and here I share the view of this report â that we have a unique opportunity to close the door on a period of low growth, economic pessimism and lack of confidence among economic operators.
We have a unique opportunity in our hands to use Europeâs institutions and the European dimension to meet the peopleâs demands and aspirations.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, MrÂ Rosati, who, together with all the shadow rapporteurs and others, has been at pains to draw up a report on which a consensus can be achieved.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supported this draft by an overwhelming majority â I would almost say unanimously.
Naturally, it has also been endorsed by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
We shall naturally assess the amendments tabled critically, and so I am very grateful that the Commissioner, too, has criticised two or three aspects of these amendments.
Sound public finances are the most important aspect of Economic and Monetary Union as a whole and beyond.
These are the only way of effecting a lasting economic upturn in Europe.
Unfortunately, this idea is not popular with all European governments, who often lack the political will to make budgetary reforms.
They have to clearly observe the criteria laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact rather than repeatedly attempting to circumvent them.
In 1997 â several of us were present at that time â these were termed âstability criteriaâ, as they lend stability to the financial area and economy in Europe.
European governments should not now view these criteria as a scourge or obstacle to their development, therefore, but as a sustainable path to a healthy economy.
Large budget deficits have an adverse effect on economic developments.
Indeed, as we have just heard, there have been some changes in this regard.
Increases in these deficits only perpetuate this spiral, and it is imperative that they be stopped.
Naturally, we must increase expenditure on the correct channels: on innovation and on developments with a promising future; but this does not change the fact that there is still expenditure that needs to be included in macroeconomic calculations.
In this connection, I welcome the independence of the European Central Bank â something that others have already made clear today â with regard to its interest-rate policy, which must continue to pursue price stability as its primary objective.
The write-down in the case of special expenditure on innovation, such as in company accounting, that has been called for by some of my fellow Members, would open the way for further new debt and weaken the European economy dangerously in the long term.
A long-term policy of balanced public finances is needed in the current euro countries and must also be made an indispensable requirement for all future accessions to the euro area.
To do so does not require the creation of any new national bodies to monitor public finances, as stated in the amendments, however, as these would only result in an increase in bureaucracy and in a heterogeneous system in a single monetary area.
The Stability and Growth Pact and the monetary policy of the European Central Bank provide a reliable, satisfactory framework, and all we need to do is to stick to it.
Â Â  . â Madam President, I should first like to respond to what MrÂ Almunia said about something that is included in paragraph 8 of the report with regard to the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I agree with him that we did not claim either that this would be a case of incorrect application.
That is why we have tabled an amendment to correct this wording.
I would also ask the other groups to look into this.
Our Amendment 7 tries, in fact, to remove this wording altogether from the text.
With regard to the statistics and prognoses, your remark that the content of the 2005 report has seemingly been superseded underlines once again how relative these prognoses and statistics are.
I would also like to stress this in the light of what you said today about Lithuania, a Member State that wants to join the eurozone and in respect of which comments can indeed be made if one considers the figures.
Only one figure matters, in fact, namely that of inflation, while many Member States would envy that country for its achievements in other areas of public finance.
I only say this to illustrate the relative nature of the figures.
We consider the recommendations that are issued to the euro group in a bid to improve the procedures another important element in this report.
I think we are well on our way in this respect, in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy to joining forces with national parliaments and to seeing how a number of public finance procedures in the Member States can be streamlined in terms of timing, but also in terms of assumptions that are made about the oil price development and other parameters that are important for the planning of policy.
I think that in this respect, there is much room for improvement in order to make this more predictable and more comparable in a European context.
While I would, once again, like to bring those recommendations to the Commissionerâs attention, I think it is also necessary to bring them to MrÂ Junckerâs attention, as chairman of the euro group, to ensure that we make serious headway there too.
I think it is crucial that this be flagged in this report.
The same also applies to the quality of the statistics.
That is another important point we have raised several times, and we would like to support the Commissioner in his attempts to make improvements in that area too.
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to, and at the same time underline, the last paragraphs of the report.
Â Â  . â I thank the Member of the Commission for the good news about the European Union's improving economic situation â this is one of a few pieces of good news for Lithuania today.
However, I would like to talk about the public finance policy.
According to the Treaties this should be formed at the national level, but the stability of the common currency â the Euro â and growth in the competitiveness of the entire European Union is dependent on its successful implementation.
Therefore we must determine reference points in the public finance policy which would help to reconcile the Member States' interests with the objectives of the Community.
It must be emphasised that the report presented by MrÂ Rosati reflects to a degree the endeavour of balancing both these viewpoints, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for this.
It is the ALDE Group's opinion that the following measures could ensure more effective coordination of the European Unionâs public finance policy.
Firstly, measures of organisational nature, that is, forecasts of basic economic indicators made at the Community level, which would increase the reliability of the Member States' financial forecasts.
Secondly, preparation of coordinated timetable of budgetary procedures of the EU Member States, preferably for at least two years.
Thirdly, we would encourage public statements and transparent obligations of the Member Statesâ governments, proving that they are striving for fiscal balance, as this would ensure public supervision.
Measures of an economic nature, which we would support, first of all include the need to define a European macroeconomic policy which is outward-looking and competitive.
In this respect there could be more coordination in ECOFIN Council meetings.
Appropriate tax initiatives, which stimulate modernisation of the economic structure and citizen activity, should also be a priority.
The third priority should be the fostering of fiscal discipline, based on the best practices of the Member States.
We use this method rarely, but some countries have actually achieved rather good results by solving fiscal administration management problems, and the Commission could prepare a report or document summarising the best examples, instead of shall we say, reproaching one country or another all the time.

The fourth measure is extremely important â we believe that attention should be turned from encouraging private investments to encouraging savings, as this is one of the basic macroeconomic initiatives.
Â Â  . â As this report states, and as the recent spring economic forecasts demonstrate, there continues to be weak economic growth throughout the EU, along with high levels of unemployment, and more than 70 million people living in poverty, who tend to be forgotten by the Commission.
The time has come to rethink the level of priority that continues to be attached to the monetarist, neoliberal policies of the Lisbon Strategy and to the guidelines of the European Central Bank.
No matter how much the truth is muffled, it cannot be denied that the monetary and fiscal policy based on the Stability and Growth Pact and the priority attached to price stability has a negative impact on economic growth and employment growth, a phenomenon that has been evident in Portugal.
What is therefore needed is a monetary and fiscal policy that will boost economic recovery and help combat unemployment.
Furthermore, the Stability and Growth Pact should be repealed and replaced with a proper social development and progress pact.
We emphasise the need for an expansionist policy coordinated jointly by the EU and its Member States, which will be aimed at strengthening internal demand, public investment, research and education, high-quality public services in areas such as health and housing, including infrastructure and equipment, which promotes high rates of employment with rights and which guarantees economic and social cohesion and balanced environmental development.
We feel that these are some of the vital proposals that will also help us gain the trust of EU citizens.
Without that trust, we will certainly continue to live in this atmosphere of pessimism arising from policies that do not address the problems currently facing people in the EU.
Â Â  Madam President, public finances have a huge impact on economic growth, the creation of new jobs and on macroeconomic stability.
The Maastricht Treaty clearly stated that the course followed by public finances in European Union Member States should be carefully monitored at European Union level.
The main and most pertinent point of this yearâs report is the unbalanced budgetary positions in the majority of Member States.
Four of the largest EU economies, France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain, are among the countries subject to excessive budget deficit procedures.
The basic causes of the problems are still an excessively slow rate of economic growth in Europe, as well as failure to implement the structural reforms required to strengthen public finances for the future.
The rate of economic growth in the European Union is significantly slower than its potential would suggest, and significantly slower than that of other global economic powers, such as the United States, Japan, China or India.
The reasons for this situation also lie in the low level of internal demand and uncertainty concerning job security, social protection, salaries and pensions.
High energy prices, unstable fuel markets and constant current account surpluses in the majority of Asian countries have all shaken the faith of many businesses in Europe.
A loose fiscal policy has proved to be ineffective and has not encouraged growth in our economies.
The indicators show rising levels of debt which pose a real problem, especially in terms of long-term budget stability, across the whole of the Union.
The initiation of attempts to implement the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 was supposed to ensure a comprehensive programme of reform.
Bearing all these problems in mind, I think that we should take decisive steps to increase the effectiveness of preventive measures, as well as implementing corrective measures to strengthen and consolidate public finances.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, paragraphÂ 11 of the report states the following: âStresses that in the context of an EU with low consumer and investor confidence, it is vital to correct public deficitsâ.
I would underline this statement, especially as the Lisbon Strategy is calling for more money and greater investment, including from public finances â I need only mention education and research.
We have committed ourselves to increasing our Official Development Assistance to a minimum of 0.7% at long last, we face the challenge of globalisation, and we find ourselves in a situation in which demographic developments represent one of the nails in the coffin of the European continent.
If we do not put our social security and pension systems in order, we shall be the losers of globalisation at all events.
I am pleased that there has been a trend reversal in the public consciousness with regard to public deficits in recent years.
Prior to the introduction of the euro, public budgets tended to be the preserve of experts.
Since the introduction of the euro, of the Maastricht criteria, of the Stability and Growth Pact, there is a public interest in a discussion on the structure of public finances, on the causes of the annual deficits, on the impact of public debt.
We have achieved a reduction in public deficits, and we must continue on this path, as we need to increase our scope for the future.
For that reason, I also congratulate the Commission on the decision it took today, as it makes it clear that we take our rules seriously.
This decision is not aimed at anyone in particular, but rather at ensuring that we take the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact seriously.
That is why I am pleased that the public debate has intensified and that we have thus contributed to making the structure of our budgets more future oriented.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, I shall begin by thanking the rapporteur for his contribution to our debates.
I should like to point out three factual elements.
The first is the cyclical conditions that place a strain on the public finances of the European Union.
Given the rise in oil prices, this is an exogenous factor that we must take into account in our public finance strategies.
The second element is, for its part, practically exogenous with regard to our public finances: I am referring to the policy of the Central Bank and, in particular, to the policy of raising interest rates on which it has embarked.
The third element is undoubtedly more political, and is also an aspect that my political group holds dear, namely that the plea that some people make for structural reforms without accompanying it with a strategy for boosting growth is likely to fail, as there can be no structural reforms without genuine support for growth.
That is why I should like to point out two lines of action that I consider to be absolutely crucial.
The first line of action is an investment strategy to help genuinely implement the Lisbon Strategy.
From that perspective, I am surprised that my fellow Member, MrÂ Karas, can, on the one hand, speak in favour of an increase in the allocation for the Lisbon Strategy and, on the other, be getting ready to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the financial perspective as it is proposed to us in the compromise drawn up between our institutions.
I believe that there is an inconsistency there for which I hope our fellow citizens will not have to pay a heavy price tomorrow.
The second line of action concerns the issue addressed by MrÂ Rosati at the end of his report with regard to the conditions for growth and coordination of economic policies within the eurozone.
A large number of commitments have just been made under the responsibility of the President of Eurogroup, with the Commissioner's agreement.
I believe that we are on the right track, particularly with regard to the harmonisation of the timetable and of the macroeconomic data on the basis of which the Member States evaluate and draft their budgets.
That being said, we still have a great deal left to do and, to that end, I believe that work carried out between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament should make it possible in the coming months and weeks to come up with practical proposals that would enable the European Union to have a eurozone that is more in line with the kind of prospects for growth that we have a right to expect from having a single currency in our favour.
Â Â  Madam President, I take the floor in the debate on the report by MrÂ Rosati concerning public finances in order to draw your attention to the following issues.
Firstly, the sanitising of public finances cannot be an aim in itself, but must be a means of generating higher economic growth and creating new jobs.
Secondly, measures taken in this field by the European Union Member States are unfortunately not yielding satisfactory results, as is reflected in the falling rate of GDP growth from 2.4% in 2004 to 1.5% in 2005.
This fall has been even more marked in the eurozone: from 2.1% to 1.3%.
Unemployment has remained high at around 9%.
These indicators confirm that the European Union is not only failing to catch up with the United States and other developed countries, but is actually falling behind.
Here we should add that GDP growth in the United States stood at 3.5% in 2005 and was therefore more than twice as high as in the European Union.
Thirdly, a low level of economic growth and continuing high unemployment make significant reductions in budget deficit and public debt difficult.
In the European Union of 25, the budget deficit has fallen from 3% of GDP in 2003 to 2.6% of GDP in 2004 and from 3% to 2.7% in the eurozone.
However, public debt rose from 61.4% in 2002 to 64.1% in 2005.
In the eurozone it rose from 69.2% to 71.7%.
Fourthly, as the figures above show, budget deficits, and public debt in particular, are significantly higher in the older Member States than in the new, and yet it is unfortunately to the latter that the warnings and recommendations of the European Commission are mainly addressed.
Finally, the new Member States are implementing very difficult reforms based on fundamental changes to pensions systems.
In spite of moves from a budgetised system to a capitalised system, as has been the case in Poland, for example, the European Commission (Eurostat) wants to treat the contributions to this system as budgetary spending which increases the budget deficit.
It thus, in fact, wants to punish these countries for implementing far-reaching reforms of their public finance systems.
I would like to voice my strong objection to this manner of dealing with the difficult reforms being implemented in the new Member States, especially Poland.
