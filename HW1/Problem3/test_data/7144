I do share the views of Mr Oreja, who stated a moment ago that what matters now is to take concrete action, and to give priorities to concrete action points in the short term.
The President of the Council may be able to elaborate on this.
I would in any case like to mention one of my personal priorities, one I have mentioned before.
It is unacceptable to me that, following the attacks in New York and Madrid, we hear the Justice and Home Affairs Council say that we will now automatically start exchanging information about possible attacks without delay.
It is inconceivable that this has not happened to date, that the urgency has sunk to that level again, while we noticed once again that there may be international links in the case of the political assassination and subsequent events in the Netherlands.
I would also like to make a brief comment about the Lisbon strategy.
It is the only way, according to Mr Balkenende, and he is right.
It is the only way, and we will need to continue on this path.
What matters is the way in which we negotiate it.
Not with the âsuper-Commissionerâ, as proposed in the past by Chancellor SchrÃ¶der of Germany, but by learning from each other.
Does he think it possible that innovation councils chaired by himself would make for a more effective way of exchanging good examples?
Does he also think it possible that national parliaments might be called to account much more emphatically with regard to delivering on their share in responsibility for this?
Finally, communication in Europe is also an important item.
Indeed, Mr Balkenende, it is essential that the statute should come into being, for as long as we do not have one, we will have a negative image at every election.
I thank you.
I am interested to see how far you will take this point.
Â Â  The Council has received the Kok report on revision of the Lisbon strategy.
The progress made with this strategy lags a long way behind the objectives set in 2000, something which is down to the fact that far too many priorities were set.
Advances have been made on all aspects relating to the Community method, or liberalisation, whereas no progress has been made with any aspects which required the commitment of the Member States and which depended on the open method of coordination, such as investment in research, innovation, training, the quality of social dialogue and human capital.
Greater national ownership has also not been achieved, and much remains to be done in this field.
We are delighted that the need to maintain a balance between the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy, the economic, social and environmental dimensions, has been reiterated, and it is our belief that the European economy needs a higher level of growth and competitiveness in order to preserve the European environmental and social model.
Yet we must continue to discuss the links between these dimensions and the conditions required for sustainable growth in Europe.
There appears to be a growing temptation to take the easy way out, namely to have recourse to liberalisation in an ever increasing number of areas, including services, the labour market and welfare systems.
If we carry on down this path, there will soon be little left over of the European model, of its uniqueness, its strengths and its advantages, which lie not in a downward adjustment towards the social level of some of our new international competitors â and here I have China and India in mind â but in competition to achieve excellence, quality, top-of-the-range products and innovation.
This is why we are sure that investments in human capital, in a high standard of lifelong employee training, in quality of public services, in European environmental standards and in good social dialogue are all productive factors, competitive factors and prerequisites for ensuring that reforms are adopted as and when they are needed.
This is why these things do not merely entail costs, expenses and inflexibility, but instead provide support to ensure the success of a new growth and development strategy for the European Union.
We want growth and jobs to be a priority, and I believe that this also involves better links between all European policy instruments, or in other words a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact to ensure that it has tighter links with the broad outlines of economic policy, the new financial perspective and, indeed, the revised Lisbon objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to start with the Lisbon process.
I think that Mr Kokâs report is very welcome and that it identifies where things are wrong.
Indeed, the remedy is already well enough known; what is lacking is action.
Slowly but surely, I am growing a little despondent when I see that we have said this so many times and we still have not found a way of galvanising the Member States into action.
I should like to hear from the EU Presidency what it intends to do about this.
Secondly, from time to time, I hear that a false dichotomy is being created between competitiveness and solidarity.
Those elements complement each other; they certainly do not contradict each other.
We all agreed in Lisbon that liberalisation is necessary, and liberalisation does not undermine our European socio-economic model but in fact strengthens it.
If we examine the facts â and here I am particularly addressing the Left of this House â liberalisation and free markets have brought more products and more services within the reach of more people.
That is the reality, and I think that we should not have recourse to the old instruments of protectionism or state support, which is an inefficient way of spending taxpayersâ money, and monopolies.
Secondly, I should like to comment on the Hague Programme.
That is extremely welcome and cannot, of course, be seen in isolation from the events in the Netherlands.
It is not a Dutch issue, but a European one.
What is more, freedom and a peaceful society are the of the European Union, and so we should fight extremely hard to maintain them. That means, on the one hand, that we will work very hard on security, and in that light, I should like to underline that I cannot comprehend the way in which the Member States, over the past few years, have cited national sovereignty as a justification for their unwillingness to step up cooperation.
Human lives, our democracy and social cohesion are at stake.
Finally, alongside this unilateral approach towards repression and terrorism, we should also consider the other side of these phenomena.
A unilateral approach on its own is ineffective; we might as well be fighting a running battle.
It follows that we must also fight hatred and racism.
And I should like to conclude by drawing your attention to the tone of this debate which contributes greatly to the solution of this problem.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate represents a really crucial stage in the development of the European Union.
We have put such emphasis on the Lisbon Strategy and, like Mrs Lambert, I welcome the Council's recognition that there has to be a real balance between the economic, social and environmental dimensions.
But the cultural dimension also needs to be addressed more effectively, especially if we are to celebrate our diversity, as the Minister said earlier.
I also welcome the emphasis that was put on communication in this meeting.
Within the European Free Alliance parties we have different positions on the Constitution, but we all agree with the urgency of improving the relationship and communication between the EU and the peoples of Europe.
There is no more effective way of doing that than by using people's own languages and this is why I take the opportunity presented by the Bureau Decision of 13 October to allow the use of other languages in this Chamber.
I conclude by saying this in Welsh, even though there is no official interpretation.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to comment on the Councilâs decisions on Iraq.
I believe that the package adopted is expensive and pointless, and Fallujah is its failure foretold.
Fallujah is not only a further human tragedy â with 1Â 500 more deaths, thousands more people wounded, tens of thousands more people made homeless â it is also the graveyard of the January elections.
Because of Fallujah, neither the Sunnis nor the Shiites, who oppose the occupation, will go to the polls.
Nothing is guaranteed in the January elections.
There is no guarantee that voters will be able to register, nor that opposition parties will take part, nor that the candidates or the voters will be able to move freely and safely.
Iraqâs electoral platform must not be US or British tanks.
This is not the way to rebuild hope or restore confidence.
Elections must be Europeâs priority in Palestine, however.
Arafatâs death points up the urgent need for a new leader who is the indisputable embodiment of the will of its people.
Europe must therefore be on hand to monitor the entire electoral process, so that no doubt is cast upon its transparency.
That is not all, however.
Europe must tell Israel that what is required is a return to political dialogue and a respite from hostilities â no suicide bombs, on the one side, no collective punishment or selective executions, on the other.
Signals must be sent out that voter registration can take place in Jerusalem and that restrictions in the Occupied Territories will be lifted, so that mobility can be guaranteed during the campaign and, most importantly, that Marwan Barghouti can be freed.
Contrary to what George W. Bush thinks, the road to Baghdad passes through Jerusalem.
This should constitute the European difference.
Â Â  Mr President, Parliament will be pleased to know that the UK Independence Party were the lead players in the recent 'No' to the North-East Regional Assembly campaign in Britain.
Seventy-three per cent of people in that region said they did not want any more Euro-bureaucracy.
I wonder what percentage would vote to get rid of the already-existing regional assemblies, with their awful appointees and their corrupt practices?
We will shortly have the opportunity to say 'No' to the EU Constitution and I mean any European Constitution, because the gap between Euro-rhetoric and reality has never been wider.
The pretence here is that there will be no further integration until there has been a referendum.
The reality is that the referendum is being pushed ever more backwards, while integration is being speeded up, with, for example, a common visa policy by 2006 and a European evidence warrant by 2005.
I could produce 25 other examples, the most important being the common asylum system, which will be introduced in 2005, with coordination in place by the end of that year.
All these things will be in place before a referendum takes place.
As Members of this Parliament we are therefore entitled to ask what the effect will be of a nation saying 'No' in a referendum.
Does it mean we will remain members of the Fourth Reich?
Does it mean we will just be associate members, or will we be out?
In particular, does it mean that any prior legislation will perish?
We need assurance on this point.
In fact, Europe cannot tell us what 'No' means.
Britain will vote 'No' in the referendum by a massive majority, and will show you what 'No' means.
Â Â  Mr President, the coordination of the economies of Europe is vital for the development of the EU.
The European Union must complete the internal market, improve the European regulatory environment and make the whole European Union less complicated.
All new EU legislation must be subject to strict tests to measure its impact on enterprise and competitiveness.
The European Union leaders have set the goal that the EU must become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
A strong and well-functioning internal market is necessary if the European Union is to become the most competitive economy and meet the objective of the social cohesion strategy.
The internal market has helped to create 2.5 million jobs in Europe over the last 10 years alone.
Europe needs better regulation.
That does not mean more regulation; as a matter of fact it means less.
A new corporate governance and action plan must be supported, ensuring that European business practice operates at the highest international standards.
A new Community patenting system must be put in place within the EU and the Community customs codes must be changed to strengthen and modernise EU customs policy.
I support the action for growth initiative, which will ensure that the research and development investment target of 3% of GDP within the European Union must be met by the year 2010.
These are not easy challenges, but they must be prioritised.
The European Union economy is lagging behind that of our counterparts.
We must improve our methodology.
These are key challenges now facing Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
We must ensure that we work together.
Like Mrs Evans I should like to say in Gaelic, a language which I hope will become a working language of this Parliament:
There is strength in partnership.
Let us get on with it and work together.
Â Â  Mr President, this House talks about Lisbon, but even after the changes proposed in the Commission you are still faced with electing to offices of great power politicians whose primary qualification is that they failed at home.
Few, if any, bring aptitude and experience to their portfolios, except of course the Competition Commissioner, who has been mixed up in corruption and the manipulation of major commercial contracts for her personal benefit and that of her friends for almost 20 years.
I have seen proof of this, and also proof that Mrs Kroes grossly, persistently and deliberately misled her hearing.
More than a thousand pages of evidence are now undergoing forensic investigation and we, a handful of MEPs, will finish the job that the nominating governments should have done in the first place.
Assuming that it survives tomorrow, the Council and Mr Barroso should know that his team of Commissioners is unlikely to survive intact for long.
Â Â  Mr President, while I should like to devote the time that is allotted to me to the Lisbon agenda, I would also like to make one comment beforehand.
I have great admiration for the fine results that have been achieved with what is known as the Hague agenda.
Unfortunately, these have remained virtually unnoticed in the Netherlands amidst the commotion and unrest in recent weeks.
I would nevertheless like to say that it is thanks to Mr Donner, and to the many sound agreements in the area of home affairs, security and justice, that we are one step closer again to freedom for our citizens.
I would now like to turn to Lisbon.
I could not agree more â and the Dutch Presidency has certainly played a part in this â that the three pillars of the strategy, namely economic reforms, social cohesion and sustainability, remain the guiding principle for the Lisbon process in terms of balance and coherence.
Social cohesion and sustainability, however, can be achieved only if we can again make Europe a true player in the world market.
Economic improvement, incidentally, is not a goal in itself, but a necessary condition if we want to retain for generations to come the European social model that was built on solidarity between the working population and those entitled to benefits, between the young and the old.
The presidency was also successful in another area.
As Mr Kokâs report mentioned, the key goal of the presidency was to cut back on the pressure resulting from rules and regulations.
Allow me to remind you of Mr Doornâs report of April 2004; we are reportedly the very first parliament that is also prepared to subject its own amendment proposals to an impact test.
That is an example that deserves to be followed by other parliaments.
Finally, Lisbon.
The goal is clear.
I truly hope that in March 2005, we will be able once again to make the Lisbon strategy into a strategy for opportunity, but then with simpler procedures and tighter agreements, especially for the Member States, as Mr van Nistelrooij rightly points out, where that process is now too strategic, with a consequent lack of positive outcomes.
Parliament is happy to lend a hand in this respect.
Â Â  It is hard to accept that of all the founding ideals and principles that hold together the European Union, there remain shortcomings even today regarding the implementation of human rights, and that fundamental human rights are being infringed.
It is therefore appropriate for the European institutions to try from time to time to place human rights in their social context when examining and defining future goals.
This task is not easy.
Our whole life is defined by a network of human rights ranging from the inviolability of human dignity to equal opportunities for individuals, communities and generations.
Therefore, after the two examples of Tampere and Lisbon, we should be thankful to the Dutch presidency for the Hague Programme and their examination of these questions in their social context.
I would like to highlight the section in the document and in the related European Parliament resolution that tries to bring together the decisions on the protection and exercise of human rights into a complex system and suggests that these decisions should be interconnected and build on one another instead of just following each other.
And if this is to happen, then we must think back from The Hague to Lisbon when it comes to human rights.
Why?
Because today the strategic programme for competitiveness and social cohesion also sends us messages concerning human rights.
People living in a united Europe will only become European citizens if they do not become marginalised, if their security is not breached by the threat of war or terrorism, by the evils of unemployment, the danger of homelessness or the grim prospects of unassisted old age, and if they are not threatened by discrimination and labelling.
While welcoming the Hague Programme, therefore, I believe that the forthcoming Luxembourg presidency will also have a lot of work to do in this area, and I would like to wish them good luck with it.
Â Â  Mr President, the Hague Council took place 48 hours after the election of a new American President â I repeat, a new American President.
This is the best way for us to regard that presidency if we want to preserve the transatlantic relationship.
It is very important for Europe now, under the leadership of the Council and the Commission always acting together, to manage at least two very important concerns.
If we do that, we will preserve the transatlantic relationship, or at least we will not be blamed for damaging it.
First, we must look to the future and stop thinking about how we got to this point.
We must stop thinking about the past and all that has happened in the last four years and must now look to the future in a creative and pragmatic way in order to do our best to solve the different problems on the international agenda.
Second, the Commission, and in particular the Council, must do everything to prevent the United States â willingly or not â from dividing Europe to its own advantage between pro-American and anti-American, pro-Bush and anti-Bush.
Our strength will be based only on our unity.
If we are united it will strengthen us and then we can solve many problems on the international agenda based on strong cooperation with the new, democratically elected leader of a democratic country, whether we like him or not.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to return to the issue of the Hague Programme and to ask the Council a number of questions relating to this Programme, which undoubtedly represents a major innovation in its introduction of a move to qualified majority voting for TitleÂ IV.
Some Members have expressed reservations with regard to legal immigration, but I should like to ask more detailed questions on the external dimension of asylum and immigration policies, something that is acquiring an ever greater significance.
It is apparent that these policies are becoming increasingly dependent on the EUâs ability to conclude Partnership and Cooperation Agreements on returns, readmissions, the strengthening of capacities, border control and police and judicial cooperation, or in other words on a set of agreements with third countries which are not subject to codecision.
We are doubly concerned because we have absolutely no trust in people such as MrÂ Schily or MrÂ Pisanu, who have put forward various proposals such as those on the establishment of camps, immigration gateways or checkpoints outside the EU.
Despite the fact that these high-flown ideas have mainly been rejected, that they do not form part of the Hague Programme and that they have aroused the fierce opposition of hundreds of NGOs and of a great many members both of national parliaments and of this House, we remain concerned, because the Hague Programme includes a reference to a feasibility study on the processing of asylum applications outside the EU and because we are also aware that EURÂ 1Â million has been released to enable the High Commissioner for Refugees to strengthen its capacities for dealing with asylum seekers in North African countries.
The question we are therefore asking ourselves is whether this does not represent both a violation of this Houseâs democratic powers and a relinquishing of the duties incumbent upon this House and the EU in the field of asylum and immigration, with these duties being handed over to third countries whose capacities are a great deal less developed than our own.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate that President-in-Office Balkenende should have begun with the dramatic events in the Netherlands, which have disturbed that tolerant country.
The Netherlands of integration, even if that word was completely absent from todayâs discourse by the President-in-Office.
I did not appreciate at all, however, the fact that today no mention was made of the grave events in Iraq.
Yesterday, devastating images of American marines killing injured Iraqis were bounced into our homes, as if all this barbarity and horror were routine business not even worthy of mention.
I believe that Europe cannot stand idly by at these events, nor can it confine itself to voting appropriations for reconstruction â as the Council did recently â nor limit itself to meeting MrÂ Allawi or placing confidence in the forthcoming elections as the event that will resolve the conflict.
As regards the Hague Programme, I do not consider there to be continuity with Tampere; on the contrary, I note a qualitative leap based on a misapprehension.
The fact is, the issues of organised crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and immigration cannot all be thrown into one big pot, as if they all constituted a single problem.
What this is in reality is a scheme for limiting Europeâs sphere of action to that of security, leaving out justice and freedom.
I believe that Islamic terrorism should be combated by dialogue between cultures and religions.
That is not what was done by your deputy, Mr Balkenende, who the day after the murder of Mr Van Gogh declared war on Islam, or what your country does in financing faith schools.
I believe instead that we must build a school where Catholics, Muslims, Protestants and atheists can all live together.
In conclusion, trafficking in human beings and immigration are not the same thing.
We need to punish the criminals, but above all we must satisfy peopleâs needs: the needs of those who flee from wars and from hunger, who come onto our territory, seeking shelter in our sympathetic and integrated Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that it has not escaped your attention that the Council of the European Union has already approved one of the most controversial ideas contained in the draft Constitutional Treaty, namely qualified majority voting on immigration and asylum.
What does this mean in practice?
What it means is that by resorting to a qualified majority, the European Union will be able to force a country to accept asylum seekers, even if that country does not wish to do so.
By resorting to a qualified majority, the European Union may decide, for example, that my country, Poland, is ethnically too homogenous, and that it should be sent some Asian or African asylum seekers, as there are already too many of these in other Member States.
We would be unable to object to this.
Countries accept immigrants because of their proximity to various neighbouring countries, their former colonial policies or their labour market requirements, and each country must make its own decisions on whether it is prepared to grant asylum and, if so, to whom.
It is also for each country to decide on who should be allowed to immigrate.
Depriving Member States of the right of veto on such matters is a violation of sovereignty on an extremely important issue.
The Constitutional Treaty will be rejected in the referendums, and yet the Council of the European Union is already forcing us to implement one of its most controversial ideas.
There is no consensus on this.
Â Â  Mr President. IÂ acknowledge the first coordination act of the enlarged 25-member group under the Dutch presidency.
You have carried it out without any significant problems.
Permit me to mention something negative, however.
In spite of the fact that all the key documents concerning equality have in their preamble equality between men and women, IÂ regard it as aÂ disgrace to the 21st century and all strategies that the Council you lead was composed (particularly in November) of 25 men and two invited guests, messieurs Chirac and SchrÃ¶der.
We have all criticised Mr Buttiglioni for his views, but this is the reality in this key European Union body.
You have not succeeded in adopting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, thereby perpetuating the virtual division of Europe and discrimination within this body as well.
We are working under different conditions here.
In spite of this, we state in the Lisbon Strategy, as a very important chapter, that we should be equal in both rights and responsibilities.
It is aÂ good thing that you have considered immigration into Europe from the security point of view.
It would, however, be aÂ good thing, and IÂ would welcome it, if you also looked at emigration in relation to the future.
The most valuable people are leaving Europe and are directly assisting our competitors in other countries.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider it very important that the European Council confirmed the validity of the Lisbon process and the need to promote it, and it is a fortunate coincidence that this objective is at the forefront of the political platform of the new European Commission, which I believe will obtain a vote of confidence from the European Parliament tomorrow and will take up office.
We are therefore waiting for the European Commission's proposals in the run up to the interim review of the Lisbon strategy with great interest.
This interim review, which will be carried out at the spring European Council, will be a good opportunity for honest evaluation and intervention on our part, in cooperation with the Member States, the national governments and social agencies at all levels, because this strategy lies at the heart of all present and future economic and social challenges.
It includes all the policies which directly concern citizens: unemployment, poverty, job insecurity, the standard of education, health and social protection.
An important tool in our work on this interim review and the new impetus which we need to give will be the report by Mr Wim Kok.
We certainly need to find ways to bring this strategy close to the citizens and organised social agencies because, without their participation, we cannot succeed in such complex policies.
This issue relates directly to the broader presentation of the Commission to citizens and it is important and encouraging that the European Council in November turned its attention to the subject of an essential information and communication strategy policy for the policy of the European Union.
We must not forget the results of the European elections, which prove that citizens are alienated from the development of the European venture.
This is not the first time we have noted this, but the time has come for us to take it on board.
The time has come for us to understand that the communication and information policies which we applied every year in the past did not perform well.
We need to take action because we face major social and strategic choices, enlargement choices which require both information for and the participation of citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, we harbour great concern at the worsening situation in Iraq.
The attack on Fallujah and the way in which the civil population has become embroiled are feeding the spiral of hatred, besides being the umpteenth violation of international law and the Geneva Convention.
I should like us here to turn our thoughts to poor Margaret Hassan, who was brutally murdered yesterday.
Both terrorism and war in response to terrorism make the prospect of pacification and democratisation of the country still more remote.
We therefore call for the Union to play its part in the Sharm el Sheikh conference on 23 November and to make its weight felt, in the light of the unity we have attained, in insisting on full acceptance by all sides of UN Resolution 1546, based on respect for international law and human rights.
In these circumstances, it is valid to harbour strong doubts about the real possibility of holding the elections in January 2005.
The result of the US elections and the replacement of Colin Powell may give even greater encouragement to the extremists, both in Iraq and in the Middle East.
As far as the Middle East is concerned, I am less optimistic, as it does not seem that Mr Sharon has conceded more to Abu Mazen during the period of his Prime Ministership than he conceded to Yasser Arafat.
On this question, besides renewing our solidarity with the Palestinian people in the loss of their historic leader, we demand that the Union commit itself by political and financial means to ensuring fair local and presidential elections in Palestine, and resuming progress on the currently stalled Road Map.
That would make it possible to replace, I repeat replace, the unilateral actions of the Sharon government with honest and proper negotiations, which, by resolving the more controversial issues, such as the settlements and the right of return, would lead to the birth of the Palestinian state and the coexistence of the two peoples.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these Decisions of the European Council come at a time of delicate transition for the institutional life of the Union, following the historic signing of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome and in the excitement of a new interinstitutional dialectic, emanating from Parliamentâs refusal to vote in the new Commission.
The text of the Councilâs conclusions finds a Parliament that is more aware of the new era of parliamentary democracy that has opened in Europe and deserves some reflection.
First and foremost, the goals set at Lisbon must be pursued with more momentum and rigour and with the courage to choose, as Mr Kok maintains.
The challenge of global competition forces us not to draw back from our ambition and requires a strong sense of political responsibility and determination from governments in order to carry through the structural reforms and to sustain the change in the field of social security.
A reasonable balance is necessary, however, so that the Lisbon Strategy can remain a fundamental political element of the Commission, as President Prodi has ensured.
This is also important in order to achieve progress on the fundamental European Pact for Youth, the lodestones of which are education, training, jobs and research.
Such issues require wise, generous and coordinated policies, but above all the certainty of investment.
Finally, the strategy for Communicating Europe and making people familiar with the Constitutional Treaty also requires similar investment, but, until now, it does not seem to me that an adequate amount of expenditure has been allocated to this head.
Â Â  Mr President, I consider the Hague Programme for fighting terrorism to be insufficient and hamstrung, with measures that in the end should have been effective.
Besides, this phenomenon is never called by its name: Islamic terrorism, for that is what is terrifying Europe.
Various measures are called for, the need to counter money laundering as a means of financing terrorism is indicated, but there is no clear statement of the need to police banks and financial institutions, because European banks are also used to launder funds originating from the apparently legitimate activities of Islamic fundamentalism â butcherâs shops, and ostensibly religious networks and support centres.
The Netherlands is learning!
I call on the European Union to adopt severe measures against terrorism, measures foreshadowed only after the barbarous murder of the film director, Mr Van Gogh.
Europe must follow the good example of the Netherlands, which has had the courage to recommend the most important measure: the closure of all mosques and Islamic centres that have been infiltrated by extremist and terrorist propaganda.
These are places where such propaganda is broadcast and funds are collected to fuel the barbarous murder of innocent people, as in Madrid.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this European Parliament, there is a lot of talk of human rights across the world, but last week in my own country, my own party, the , was outlawed by politically appointed judges, a spectacle applauded by the parties who consider themselves to be democratic.
Following a legal comedy that lasted four years, the Court of Cassation outlawed our party â which is the largest opposition party â after a political centre for the fight against racism, at the request of the Prime Minister, and with public money, instituted legal proceedings against it on account of what was purely the offence of giving an opinion.
Politically appointed judges have, no doubt in exchange for some future appointment, dutifully complied with this request from the Belgian state to outlaw Flandersâ largest party.
I therefore hope that within Europe, if this institution wants to retain its credibility, there will be loud protest against the totalitarian methods that are being used in a Member State of the Union to outlaw political parties.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I welcome the ambitions of the Council of Europe and particularly those of the Netherlands regarding the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, but at the same time, with a certain amount of disquiet, I have to agree with the Council of Europe that this strategy has not brought the expected results during the last four years.
I also agree with the findings of the Kok report on the feeble level of implementation on the part of the Member States.
I am not talking about the problems of distant galaxies, but about a key project of the Union which would bring about the most dynamic and competitive economy by the year 2010, together with a balanced respect for the social and environmental aspects of development.
We have fewer than six years ahead of us.
I am convinced that we will not achieve success by repeating what are clearly acceptable goals, but by supplementing, from the technical point of view, a strategy which is essentially a good one.
What is genuinely lacking is political will and a European spirit.
It would appear that at times of crisis everyone thinks of themselves first, but the history of the Union tells us that it has made progress in the past when it has acted in a spirit of solidarity and with a collective will.
Thus, the lofty ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy will not be achieved through discordant, disunited and partial activity with different rules of the game for different Member States.
What is important is the simultaneous action of the key players on all the important fronts and at all levels.
I would like the European Parliament, as the most legitimate representative of the interests of the citizens of the Union, to accompany the responsible implementation of the Lisbon Strategy with a contribution to a more powerful political will on the part of the Member States and to the leadership of excellence on the part of the participating collective institutions.

Of course I understand that the global economic context is unfavourable, nevertheless I would not like to perceive it as an excuse, but rather as a stimulus for an enlarged European Union to find the answers to those questions which others cannot answer.
Â Â  On behalf of my group, I too should like to comment on the spring meeting and the Kok II report.
Economic and social policy and sustainability policy are the hallmarks of the Lisbon strategy, and it is right that the report and the Councilâs conclusions do not interfere with the coherence of them.
Even if growth and employment take centre stage, objectives in the social and environmental areas should in no way be made subordinate.
It is unfortunate that the mandate of the High-Level Group to develop a consistent strategy in a bid to achieve the Lisbon objectives does not focus more on common macro-economic policy at European level.
After all, in that respect, there are no longer any economies in the plural, and there have not been any for a long time, but only one European economy.
We were pleased to find out about the intention to involve the European Parliament more effectively in the preparations of the spring meeting and the Lisbon strategy.
Mr Balkenende was interested to learn about our plans to set up a standing committee.
I can tell him that indeed, we are carefully considering how we would give this shape, but I, in turn, would like to ask him to take into account the timeframe for the various reports, including the planning we need to draw up here in this House.
In our experience, there is often too little space to make adequate use of this.
We also intend to involve national parliaments more obviously in the strategy.
I think that this is also a very important aspect.
Along with the Luxembourg Presidency, we would like to examine how we, together with the national parliaments, can prepare the spring meeting.
It is evident that making the Lisbon strategy more effective depends, first and foremost, on the willingness of the Member States to work truly at EU level.
In my view, we are heading for a change from mutual competition among the Member States towards a focus on stronger, common, European strategy.
That is where our strength lies compared to other economic blocs, including the US and China which also work as unities.
In that light, we should therefore not only consider the balance of revenue and expenditure of Member States in the framework of the Stability Pact, but, as Commissioner Almunia said in the on Monday, we should also consider the quality of public finances.
The Council, the Commission, national parliaments and the European Parliament should all join in the discussion about national budget policy.
The economic policy could then be more than the sum of the 25 constituent parts.
That is the challenge we are facing.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Council for having turned its attention to Ukraine, the EUâs largest neighbour to the East.
This is a country of 50Â million inhabitants that covers an area greater than France.
At present presidential elections are taking place in Ukraine.
The Council is to be commended for highlighting the irregularities that occurred during the first round of voting, but I do not believe it has gone far enough in highlighting what is really happening in Ukraine.
A civil society is coming into being in that country.
There is no sign at all of anything of the kind happening in Russia or Belarus at present.
Tens of thousands of people are demonstrating every day in Ukraine, with the aim of making their country democratic and honest, and of ensuring that links are built between Ukraine and the European Union.
I do not believe it is enough merely to reprimand the current Ukrainian authorities for their failure to enforce democratic electoral rules.
It is essential to boost the hopes of the people of Ukraine and open the door to their European ambitions.
Â Â  Mr President, it is perhaps a sign that I am speaking on the Lisbon strategy when the member of the Commission with responsibility for development aid is present.
Although there is no argument about the fact that the goal of making Europe the worldâs most competitive region is the right one, we have to look to see who, in Europe, is responsible for what, and I can tell Mr Balkenende that it is when I look at the Council that I find it intolerable that, every month and every year, heads of government and ministers of the economy meet together, agree upon exalted objectives, make Europe responsible for meeting the goals of the Lisbon strategy, then go home and fail to do their homework when they get there.
Indeed, they go even further and stand in the way of those things that Europe has to contribute.
Take, for example, the European patent: that would be a step ahead as part of a European initiative.
Think of the moves towards deregulation, and how the French President and the German Chancellor delayed them for end-users.
What Europe achieves is frustrated in the Council, and what ought to be done by the nation states does not get done.
The bottom line is that it is Europe that fails to make a success of the Lisbon strategy.
I am grateful for the Kok report; what we now urgently need â as the Lisbon strategy is the right one â is an orientation for it.
The goal, although perhaps too ambitiously defined, is the right one.
With Member States like ours in Europe, we can now be happy that the gap between us and America is not widening.
We have to put forward a concept for this in Europe, one that compares the nation states, providing a transparent view of which European government is failing to implement this strategy and which is good at it, in order, by way of this transparency in the political process, to make the public aware that we cannot do this other than together.
Apart from that, I hope that the presence of the Commissioner with responsibility for development aid is not an indication of the direction in which Europe will be drifting in future.
Â Â  Mr President, we are undoubtedly at a crucial moment in the development of the Union.
Wherever we look, whether it is at the Lisbon Strategy, or the security question and the demand for greater police and judicial cooperation, or even this week's report of the Court of Auditors, we see time and again that Member States that talk about European cooperation do not put it into practice.
We cannot continue with a system where Member States pick and choose which bits of decisions they are going to implement and when â and these are decisions they themselves have agreed.
This is undermining political support in the European Union.
I hope that once we get a full-time President of the Council he or she will regard this as an absolute priority, but in the meantime, in order to keep the Lisbon process on track, the Commission should publish a regular annual scoreboard outlining which Member States have done what and when.
We can then judge, name and shame the villains.
My colleagues Mr DÃ©sir and Mrs van den Berg have set out many of the key elements that we would like to see emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy.
I would like to add to that the need for more active labour market policies at national level.
We seem very happy to pay out money to keep people on the unemployment scrap heap, to pay people to be written off and marginalised, when we should be investing in helping them back into work.
There is not enough emphasis on this, although it was originally in the Kok report and I hope will continue to be.
The President-in-Office said that Mr Barroso is to be applauded for drawing the appropriate lessons from last month's debate on the Commission.
It is a pity that the same cannot be said about the Dutch presidency.
Mrs Kroes undoubtedly has the experience and expertise that will be of benefit to the Commission, but given the concerns that are being raised it is wrong for her to retain the competition portfolio.
Whenever she has to adjudicate in a controversial matter, rightly or wrongly her integrity is going to be called into question.
The presidency should act in the interests of the European Union, not from narrow national concerns.
I fear that the Dutch presidency has failed in this respect.
Â Â  Mr President, the words of the Prime Minister about the situation in the Netherlands were loud and clear, and Members of this House have also said a great deal since.
I nevertheless regret that the Council has not made use of the European Council of 4 and 5 November to forcefully distance itself from the appalling events in the Netherlands.
It was, in my view, the ideal platform for us, including as a Union, to take a hard line against radical Muslims with a fundamentalist interpretation of the Koran.
Unfortunately, European cooperation in the fight against terrorism is currently typified by the well-known sacred cows of the Member States.
The declaration that was adopted following the attacks in Madrid, the appointment of Gijs de Vries or the Hague Programme, all of them are of little consequence if Member States do not translate fine words into action.
This is where decisiveness, on the part of Europe and of the Member States, is an absolute must.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office, and the Netherlands presidency as a whole, on the very clear orientation given on the whole issue of competitiveness and delivery of the Lisbon Agenda.
I wish to thank you in particular, Mr President-in-Office, for the lead your government has given on the whole question of tackling the regulatory burden and improving the climate for business in Europe.
I was delighted to see in the presidency conclusions the substantial commitment that you, together with other governments â I know the British Government is associated with this â have made to improving the business climate.
I was disappointed you did not mention it in your speech, because this is one of the really important parts of your presidency.
It is quite clear â and this is highlighted in the Kok report â that cutting back on regulatory costs and encouraging new business start-ups is crucial to delivery of the Lisbon Agenda.
We know about the very effective work you do in Holland, where I believe you set your ministers targets on cutting the cost of the regulatory burden every year.
That is an example of best practice that should be copied not only in all the Member States but also within the European Commission.
I say to Mr Nielson, the Commission's representative today, that we expect the Commission to deliver on this.
It is one of the commitments set out in the Council's conclusions.
Our side of the House strongly supports this and wants to encourage it, and I would say to all Members that this House has a role to play here.
You asked us, President-in-Office, how we were going to respond to the challenge of the Kok report in becoming more engaged in the Lisbon Agenda.
We need an effective committee in this House to look at the Lisbon Agenda.
Not one that substitutes for committees like mine, but one that tackles issues that cut across Parliament's work, such as improving the regulatory agenda and acknowledging that we can sometimes be responsible for making life more difficult for European businesses.
These are the real issues which I hope Parliament will tackle in future, and I congratulate you and your government on the foundations you have laid for helping us to move this vital agenda forward.
Â Â  Mr President, in adopting the Hague Programme on 4 and 5Â November, the Council has set new priorities for Europe with regard to strengthening the area of security, freedom and justice.
We are pleased to see that the Council has heeded this Houseâs demands, in particular those relating to the move to codecision and qualified majority voting in such areas as asylum, immigration and the fight against terrorism, not to mention, of course, civil justice.
Yet we regret to see that this Programme appears to be yet another example of the Council doing little other than stating its good intentions.
It is all well and good for it to congratulate itself on progress made during the past five years, particularly with regard to the establishment of a common asylum and immigration policy, the harmonisation of border controls and improvements to judicial cooperation, yet it would have only been fair to include references to the obstacles which certain Member States have placed in the way of progress in the field of justice and to note that only a minimum level of harmonisation in the field of asylum has been achieved.
Although the Council expresses its regret that not all objectives were met, it has made no provision for specific measures to ensure that this does not happen again in future years.
Finally, we are particularly concerned at the parallel drawn between the fight against terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.
This implies that illegal immigrants are assumed to be potential criminals or terrorists, an assumption which is entirely unacceptable.
These are people who have been forced to leave their country of origin as a result of unbearable living conditions or persecution.
Whilst it is true that we need a global approach to policies relating to asylum, immigration and external border controls, I am sure you will agree that such an approach should not be adopted at the cost of migrantsâ basic rights.
Â Â  Mr President, today provides a welcome opportunity to thank Mr Nielson and his team for the splendid work they have carried out during his time in office as Commissioner.
It is also very good to hear from the President-in-Office of his successful meeting with President Allawi.
I was in Iraq last week.
I have a suggestion to make as to how our aid might be most effectively targeted.
As we all know, security is the major issue.
European Union support, carefully targeted, could make all the difference in the training and the equipment of the Iraqi police service.
Security is what the Iraqi people need and the lack of a strategic plan may already have cost many lives and will cost many more if we do not address this effectively.
We need a strategic plan worked out with the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and, as a matter of urgency, proper forensic capabilities.
Westernised tactics should be adopted for the use of those capabilities and we should provide advanced surveillance equipment and the right training.
Then there is a real need to train senior Iraqi police officers to plan and manage strategically, and that must be combined with an ethos of service and fairness within the Iraqi police service.
In other words, we must move on from a reliance on countering insurgency by military tactics alone to a mixed plan.
The police should no longer be treated as a second-rate military force but, with European Union funding, commitment and training, given a real chance of becoming a proper police service.
Finally, the Iraqi people want the election to be held in January.
A properly trained and effective police service is integral to its success.
With our funding and our training competence, we in the European Union can make all the difference.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us call to mind our strengths, put our money where our mouth is, do away with the blockages within ourselves, and stop making ourselves ill with worry.
Let us fashion a single European policy on Europe rather than several from each nation state!
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe it to be a matter of urgent necessity that you should make the Lisbon objectives concrete and workable.
Everyone must know who is to do what and by when; you should see to it that, after every spring summit, every Head of Government makes an official statement in his own country and that the parliaments debate the action plans specific to their own countries and vote on them, that you reinforce the Commissionâs prerogatives of monitoring, coordinating and taking initiatives where the Lisbon process is concerned.
Let us introduce at European level, in the national governments, and in the national parliaments, a Lisbon Steering Committee with an interdisciplinary approach!
We are not a carbon copy of America.
We Europeans do not play off competitiveness against social cohesion, both of which express the European model of the sustainable social market economy.
There is a second point I would like to make about the Constitution.
Everyone has signed it.
Is that it then?
What about a joint publicity campaign by the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Committee of the Regions?
What about a Week of the Constitution, in which all the Member States would ratify it?
Why were you so opposed to a Europe-wide referendum?
There is more to be done, and more is possible, provided that we have the political will and more determination.
As you have mentioned the Membersâ Statute, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me tell you that you need only to accept Parliamentâs resolution, and then we will have a Membersâ Statute, and new rules on expenses.
There are some â but in fact only a few â Member States that are engaging in tactical games; put a stop to them!
Â Â  Mr President, YasserÂ Arafatâs death means the start of a new era for Palestine, and one which is filled with uncertainty.
Under the Palestinian Constitution, presidential elections must be held within a period of 60 days.
If elections were to be held today, however, they could be hampered by a number of obstacles.
The first of these obstacles relates to the freedom of movement of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, something which is essential both for the electoral campaign and for election preparations, the holding of elections and the counting of votes, but which is far from guaranteed.
East Jerusalem poses the most problems, as the Israeli authorities there refuse to allow Palestinians to be registered on the electoral roll.
I am therefore calling on the Council to take joint action with the United States in bringing pressure to bear on Israel so that it withdraws the troops currently deployed in the occupied territories.
The second obstacle faced is that of challenges to the eligibility of a candidate.
It is up to the Palestinian authorities, and to them alone, to decide who is eligible on the basis of their own criteria.
The third obstacle relates to practical organisational issues and ensuring that the vote is fair, and this is an area in which the EUâs practical experience and support will be essential.
The fourth obstacle is that of ensuring that the elections are safe, something which should be guaranteed for candidates, voters and observers alike.
Palestinian police officers do not carry arms, and struggle to ensure the safety of civilians.
Political security is dependent on the extent to which extremist groups are kept under control.
The recent attempts by Fatah to include Hamas in a government of national unity, as long as it renounces the armed struggle, are something which should be monitored very closely by the EU.
I should like to know what plans have been made at this stage with the Palestinians to ensure that the elections are safe.
I am sorry to have to say it, MrÂ President, but to date Europeâs voice within the Quartet has been almost inaudible, and we should take this opportunity to make ourselves heard.
We must now provide Palestine with staunch support to ensure that elections at any level are held freely, and we will of course always do the same for Israel to ensure that the indiscriminate attacks which plunge entire families into mourning are brought to an end.
It is my firm belief that, more than ever before, the future of one nation is inextricably bound up with the future of other nations.
Â Â  â I would like to speak about the present state of the Lisbon Process.
I remember the time when Soviet dictator Khrushchev declared that the Soviet Union would catch up with the USA in seven years.
I also remember that he failed.
Although the European Union has every opportunity of accomplishing its aims, the Lisbon report is nevertheless a cause for concern.
As Wim Kok has said, the dreams of catching up with the USA have been put on the back burner.
Instead, the European Union is dealing with the question of how to halt economic decline.
I would join with my colleague Mr Radwan in giving credit to the Dutch presidency, and its bold and vigorous leadership.
This is promising.
However, in order to regain lost time, we need to concentrate more on one aspect â the motivation of the Process.
Indeed, clear and strong motivation, together with an emphasis on results, has been the driving force behind the success of our competitors, USA and Japan.
Second, the European Union should aim for a systemic approach to research and development activities and innovation.
Wim Kokâs report stresses the need to give top priority to research and development, but special emphasis ought to be placed on the applied side of research in particular.
So what is required is not less research, but more development work.
Third, it is especially important to base all our planned activities on the needs of innovation as a whole, and to motivate business leaders accordingly.
Fourth, the present funding schemes for innovation in research are unfortunately too administration-centred, and do not promote the practical application of results.
One of the biggest problems is that funding is often directed into closed and ineffective systems.
Therefore it is our task today not just to rely on attractive plans, but to show the political will to actually implement those plans.
This is our responsibility to our voters.
Thank you.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ Balkenende, I should like to offer my condolences on recent events in the Netherlands.
Up until now, we had associated the name of VanÂ Gogh with art and bold colours.
The painting symbolises sun, warmth and freedom.
Is it not an irony of history that a person bearing the same name should die because he exercised his freedom of speech and of thought, and because he sought the truth?
Against this background, it is particularly significant that it was the Dutch Presidency that raised the complex issue of security for the EU, its Member States and its citizens.
The public expects, and rightly so, that the EU, an institution that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, will adopt effective solutions with regard to the area of freedom, security and justice.
These expectations are to be met by the Hague Programme.
I should like to stress that this programme sets out objectives that were already included in the Constitutional Treaty.
Indeed, it meets the majority of those expectations.
The announcement that this programme is to include an anti-drugs strategy is also to be welcomed, as is the fact that the Council Presidency has chosen to make information on Europe its priority.
It is clear that awareness of Europe must be heightened amongst its citizens, especially given the turnouts in the last elections.
The EU must be brought closer to its citizens, but will this be achieved by broadcasting public debates on European issues before Council meetings, an idea contained in the conclusions?
Will that be enough to bring the EU closer to its citizens?
I am also concerned at the announcement that we will have to wait until June 2005 for a full information strategy.
Why should this take so long?
We need such a strategy now, especially in view of the fact that the campaigns to inform the public about the European Constitution began immediately after the Constitution was signed.
Finally I should like to turn to one last issue which relates to our future.
The leaders of four Member States were quite right when they highlighted the importance of demographic factors for the EUâs future economic and social development, and when they called for a European Pact for Youth to be drawn up.
This is a worthwhile initiative.
Young people have a different view of Europe.
They are well educated, full of energy and free of the fears and prejudices of the older generation.
This is a good sign for Europe, for the EU and for all of us.
The Pact for Youth should therefore be drawn up as quickly as possible, with the participation of young people.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to pay tribute to MrÂ Kok, the former Dutch Prime Minister.
With the support of a team, he drafted the report on the Lisbon strategy.
This coincided with the Dutch Presidency.
We all agree with the findings of the report.
The European Union is lagging a long way behind, and the responsibility for this lies mainly with the Member States and national governments.
I agree that we need to draw up national strategies for the Lisbon process and implement them consistently, but these strategies must be coherent, and not developed separately.
We must create added value on the basis of regional cooperation between neighbouring EU Member States, and I can provide three examples of ways in which this could happen.
Poland has a particularly large number of extremely well-educated young people, whereas the neighbouring countries of Germany and Sweden have well-developed high-tech industries.
There are opportunities for development if we were to join forces.
The Baltic countries have particular opportunities for cooperation in the field of secure energy supply, an issue that is important for Europe as a whole.
The Czech Republic, Germany and Poland can make the greatest contribution to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
To this end, European clean coal and carbon dioxide capture technologies must be developed.
Regional cooperation also involves cooperation with the EUâs new neighbours, and the position taken by the Council on the issue of neighbourly relations with Ukraine is therefore key.
We should assure Ukraine that the doors are open to its European ambitions, and we should promptly put in place an action plan for Ukraine with a view to promoting the development of civil society.
Indeed there is also a need for measures to improve civil society within the EU.
If this does not happen, we will not achieve our ambitious goals and crucially, millions of citizens will fail to understand the Lisbon process.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, a Greek friend who recently visited Holland told me that what had impressed him most was that the police on the streets of Amsterdam gave the impression that they were there to protect citizens and their diversity, not to watch and suspect them.
The tragic events with Van Gogh and the extremists from the other side illustrate, unfortunately, that terrorism is working and what it is seeking: to ultimately suppress the obvious.
Racial violence deserves zero tolerance, but the victory of the terrorists will be that we in Europe, unfortunately like others elsewhere, also consider that, in order to combat violence, war means peace and restricting personal freedoms means protecting them.
Consequently, congratulations are in order for the Dutch presidency for the fact that, on the very days when these horrendous incidents occurred, it organised an informal conference for the 11 common authorities on the subject of integration. You have got the right emphasis.
Integration. Not policing.
I have just three comments to make on the foregoing:
First, the Hague five-year programme which we are debating today makes provision for special funds to return immigrants and guard borders, but it makes no provision for a special integration fund, even though integration is one of the basic actions.
We are asking for a commitment that the financing for integration be given the same priority, so that we get beyond words.
Secondly, when we lay down policies for integration, we cannot ignore the fact that we have millions of European citizens in countries the world over who are themselves immigrants.
Their experience cannot be ignored.
From this point of view, we must be prepared to grant immigrants who settle in the countries of the European Union a similar level of treatment to that which we demand for European immigrants in third countries.
Otherwise we are not being consistent.
Thirdly, attention to personal rights when dealing with terrorism.
Biometric data in passports and other similar measures may be important; on the other hand, however, they may add little to security in relation to what they take away in civil liberties.
Only if they are absolutely necessary and effective in addressing very clearly predefined objectives can they be the subject of discussion in my opinion.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have here the conclusions of the November Council on the Union's foreign policy.
I have to say that, while I consider it a good thing that the Council turned its attention to four European foreign policy issues, events lead us to prioritise at least two at the moment.
The first is the situation in Iraq.
War is being waged again and the war is condemnable just as, of course, the terrorist action and kidnaps are condemnable.
Armed conflicts and operations do not resolve problems; on the contrary, they increase the obligation of the European Union to submit, at long last, a full and integrated programme on the subject of addressing the crisis in Iraq.
The first step in this process must be elections.
Elections in Iraq must be held and as many forces as possible must participate, so that the elections really are not an end in themselves but a means which will allow Iraq to shortly become a progressive democracy.
The second parallel and related issue is the situation in the Middle East.
The post-Arafat era is, of course, a new page in the history of this area.
Over and above all, the European Union has an obligation here to intervene so that the political testament of Yasser Arafat is respected, because it is certain that the crisis in the Middle East will be addressed through the political testament left by Yasser Arafat.
Â Â  Mr President, on 4 and 5 November, as we all know, on considering how to communicate Europe to the citizen, the European Council made a very lucid analysis of the situation facing us.
Europe still lacks its own personality; it does not have a face of its own; knowledge of Europe reaches the citizens with difficulty and it therefore has a long way to go in terms of selling the idea of European political union.
The Council was naturally extremely concerned, given the very imminent challenges we are facing, including the ratification of the European Constitution by each of the Member States.
And it made a very specific recommendation, taking a practical approach that I would like to praise, which is to promote television debates in each of the countries in order to stimulate interest in this process of ratifying the Constitution amongst the citizens.
I would like to draw the attention of the honourable Members to a problem facing us: the first country to have called a referendum on the ratification of the European Constitution is Spain.
Spain is governed by the Socialist Party, which is the Party of the President of this House, Mr Borrell, as we all know, since he does nothing to hide it.
Although, given his role as arbitrator, he should take care to keep his ideological positions rather more hidden.
We are facing a dilemma: this Parliament, which should occupy a vigilant position, can either promote party positions or promote institutional positions.
From that point of view, Mr President, I would like to call on everybody to bear this in mind, and not to abandon that vigilant position, and we should make it very clear that this European institution must also put aside sectarian or party political behaviour and think of the common project we have before us.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate the Dutch Presidency on developing the area of freedom, security and justice.
It is vital to ensure the general publicâs security and fundamental rights, mutual trust and the primacy of law throughout the EU.
I congratulate the Council particularly on its decision to implement in full Article 67 of the Treaty, so that qualified majority voting and a process of codecision can be applied for a range of topics under Heading IV.
This is a step forward not only in terms of efficiency, but also in terms of democratic legitimacy, as it reinforces Parliamentâs key role in adopting standards on topics as sensitive as asylum and immigration policy and all policies involving the general publicâs fundamental rights.
The five-year post-Tampere period has come to an end, with significant achievements in the area of freedom, security and justice.
Not all of the objectives have been met, but progress has been made.
The balance is clearly in the black, something to which Commissioner Vitorinoâs work contributed greatly.
An impressive body of legislation has been built up, but we regret that, as regards its transposition into national legislation, major shortcomings have come to light, in terms both of meeting deadlines and of the quality of transposition.
I welcome the Hague Programme for the next five years.
It is now up to the Commission to table practical initiatives and to set out a timetable for adopting and implementing those initiatives.
I welcome the Hague Programme, but I should point out that, here too, if we are to construct Europe we will need the necessary financial resources.
There is no point in stating our priorities if we do not allocate the necessary resources.
I particularly welcome the fact that the second phase of creating the European asylum system is underway.
It is only by means of a common European asylum and immigration policy that we will be able to address problems such as illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.
In view of issues such as civil and corporate justice, cooperation in the area of criminal justice and, lastly, EU security, which remains one of the major priorities â the importance of condemning any kind of violence, but especially terrorism, cannot be over-emphasised â it is essential that Europol and Eurojust work in close cooperation.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  First of all, I would like to congratulate the committee on its report and I will comment on only one aspect, the Lisbon strategy.
The Wim Kok report is undoubtedly an important step on the bumpy road toward achieving the goals set forth in Lisbon.
It is apparent today that it will be almost impossible to adhere to the original schedule without deeper political commitment and serious effort.
The submitted report makes a valuable contribution to accelerating the Lisbon process and every, and I would like to stress , recommendation in the document is worthy of consideration.
The holistic approach suggesting a direct correlation between the question of job creation, the need to increase employment and developments in the macroeconomic environment is especially valuable.
It also points out the important role of slowdowns and acceleration in economic growth trends.
Nevertheless, a few of the statements connected with this in the Report should be treated with caution.
I am sure the few sentences adopting a critical tone with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact did not escape your attention either.
As far as sustaining economic growth is concerned, the report paints a rather negative image of such an important instrument of public finances and budgetary discipline.
We must not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact plays an important part in ensuring economic stability and consequently in ensuring that money retains its value.
It must be emphasised that the assumption that reforming the Stability Pact and slackening economic discipline would in themselves create jobs through additional expenditure is something of an oversimplification of economic logic.
It is evident that this assumption would only be true if governments used their budgetary expenditures only for development purposes. This, however, is far from the truth.
Therefore, I do not believe that fundamental reform of the Stability and Growth Pact would be in the economic interests of the Union; quite the contrary: it would reduce competitiveness even in the short-term.
Nevertheless, the criticism of the Stability Pact expressed in the Wim Kok report undoubtedly addresses real concern, namely the key role of economic growth in creating and increasing employment.
I, for my part, would suggest a different approach to solve this problem: I am thinking primarily of creating an enterprise-friendly economic environment.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should first and foremost like to thank your Members of Parliament warmly for their contribution.
You have dealt with issues that affect the European citizen directly at great length.
I have also noticed that there has been support from many quarters for the keystones discussed by the Council, namely more cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, working on safety in Europe, working on more balanced economic growth, the Lisbon strategy, and promoting public involvement.
Let me start with the Hague Programme.
Mr Schulz was right to draw attention to Commissioner Vitorinoâs important role, because the excellent result has been achieved partly thanks to his input and influence.
I think that now is an appropriate time to thank Mr Vitorino for this.
Mr Mayor Oreja was right to talk about the importance of priorities being set in the programme for freedom and security.
For example, these priorities are in place for the first item, being asylum and immigration.
We are working on better decision-making.
Qualified Majority Voting is being introduced and an asylum procedure will enter into effect in 2010.
With regard to terrorism, we need to take decisive action to fight it and that is exactly why, as Mrs in ât Veld already stated, cooperation between police, justice and intelligence services needs to be stepped up.
Terrorism will also be discussed in more detail at the meeting of the European Council in December.
For the rest, I would draw your attention to the action plan to be compiled by the European Commission.
Mr Schulz was right to indicate that certain ingredients should always be present, namely security for the citizen, together with the promotion of safety on the one hand and respect for basic rights on the other.
I think that the Hague Programme succeeded in striking the right balance in this respect.
Mrs KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs has drawn our attention to the need to do justice to fundamental rights in Europe, in which context she defended the Hague Programme.
Mr Alvaro spoke about a good combination of scope for investigations and doing justice to basic rights.
Subsequently, the subject of what is meant by QMV, Qualified Majority Voting, has also been raised.
This is already in place in many areas, but not in respect of illegal immigration.
That will change when the new Constitutional Treaty enters into effect, for then QMV will apply across the board.
Mr Giertych mentioned the fact that Member States are given compulsory immigration quotas.
It so happens that asylum immigration, in terms of procedures, is a joint responsibility.
That is why the Hague Programme is also so important, but that does not mean that in respect of QMV, immigration quotas can be imposed on Member States.
Mr Eurlings spoke wise words when he talked about the meaning of values and tolerance in society.
Particularly in Europe, people should approach each other with respect, but that presupposes two things.
On the one hand, due account must be taken of respect for the different values which typify Europe; on the other hand, boundaries must be set when people resort to hatred, intimidation and humiliation.
This is exactly how we want to build on freedom and a peaceful society.
That also means that we must watch the place hatred and racism take in the debate.
Respectful cooperation and co-existence are precisely what is required.
In that respect, you also have to choose your words carefully.
I have noticed, also in my contacts with representatives of the Islam community, that extremism and terrorism are unequivocally repudiated in the Islam community too.
That is why it is dangerous to immediately associate Islam, for example, with terrorism.
It is precisely the terrorists who take advantage of religion in order to commit immoral deeds, which must be emphatically repudiated.
That is why it is also so important for different groups, whether they be Christian, Humanist, non-religious or Islamic, to join forces in order to put a stop to violence and extremism.
In this Parliament, the importance of aid to victims was mentioned, and rightly so; this was a question raised by Mr Mayor Oreja.
There is a European action plan against terrorism that was laid down in the European Council of March, which contains a section on solidarity with victims of terrorism.
The Dutch Presidency plans to elaborate on that aspect in the December European Council.
Mrs Lambert mooted the idea of a human rights centre.
The Commission published a communication about changing the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna to a European human rights centre.
That is currently being discussed in the Council and decisions in this respect will be taken under the Luxembourg Presidency.
Finally, with regard to the Hague Programme, Mrs Flautre has spoken, and expressed her concerns, about reception in the region.
It is useful to note that when we mention reception in the region, this will always be done in consultation with the UNHCR.
I should now like to turn to the Lisbon strategy.
I have noticed that there is much support for the strategy within this Parliament too, which is geared to strengthening Europeâs economy, and the need for reforms has been underlined.
In that context, I would also refer to Mr Kokâs report, the report of the Employment Task Force, that was discussed some time ago.
In addition to these favourable comments, though, some voices of criticism have also been heard.
Mrs Lambert and Mrs Zimmer spring to mind.
They claim from time to time that there is no alternative to the Lisbon strategy.
Is that true?
I should like to note once again that the Lisbon strategy combines economic dynamism, social cohesion and doing justice to sustainable development.
It is the combination of those three components which has also come to the fore in the conclusions of the European Council.
I therefore beg to differ with those who claim that Mr Kok, along with his high-level group, has paid insufficient attention to the social and environmental dimensions.
The environment has been sufficiently covered, particularly since it is based on the idea of a win-win situation.
In the European Council, Mr Kok maintains that we need growth precisely in order to retain the European social model.
Finally, I would refer to Paragraph 5 of the conclusions of the European Council in which it is stated, and rightly so, that a balanced strategy with economic, social and environmental dimensions is needed in order to strengthen competitiveness.
Mr Blokland claimed that Mr Kok put the ball back in the court of the Member States, and went on to enquire after the Dutch Presidencyâs agenda for the near future.
I should like to draw your attention to three things in this respect.
First of all, we have analysed the remarks, suggestions and opinions of the Heads of Government during the informal working lunch.
Secondly, we will be consulting the Luxembourg Presidency about future conclusions and needless to say, we will be in contact with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, provided he and his team receive your consent.
I have also noticed that you demand concrete action.
What is needed is not only declarations, but also that we simply examine what the matter in hand is and deal with it.
In that framework, the suggestion made by Mr Eurlings is interesting.
He states that different Member States boast innovation platforms and that those should, where possible, join forces.
Mrs van den Burg was right to draw the attention to cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
Mrs in 't Veld also re-emphasised the need for action.
We will convey this message to the Luxembourg Presidency.
It is useful to remind ourselves that liberalisation, the very element we need in order to strengthen market forces, does not have to be at odds with the European social model.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was right to point out that the actions must be concrete and that national responsibilities must, in fact, be taken.
It is also for that reason that I, as President of the European Council, have opted for a different working formula, namely for a very in-depth dialogue during the working lunch to exchange experiences with regard to the reform policy in the different European Member States.
I think that that was a sound formula.
I also think that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was right to talk about the need for better regulations and an easing in the rules with a view to strengthening the entrepreneurial climate in Europe and economic growth.
I agree with you that there, too, the European Parliament can play an important role.
Finally, Mrs Staniszewska mentioned the Lisbon objectives in relation to the financial perspectives.
These objectives will obviously be given a prominent place in the new financial perspectives and needless to say, we have yet to agree on the level of those amounts.
I will now turn to the third item, that of communication.
People from different political persuasions have pointed at the need for good communication.
Mr Eurlings was right to point out that a prompt solution must be found to the problem of the statute, and that of your provision of income, because continuous discussion of this subject does not create a good impression.
Mr NicolaÃ¯, my European Affairs Minister will also commit to this matter for that reason.
Certain Members have raised the subject of language, and we had the pleasure of hearing Welsh and Irish.
I have understood your message.
The Constitution was also mentioned.
In this context, the idea of a referendum week was mooted.
It so happens that referendums deal with different situations in the Member States.
Legislation is not the same everywhere.
There are a number of practical and legal objections to having the referendums in the space of one week.
Mr NicolaÃ¯ discussed this with your Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, and this produced three elements.
First of all, it is recognised that this primarily concerns national matters.
Secondly, the European character can be emphasised by, for example, joint and simultaneous action, which also accommodates what you stated here before.
We will also be working on subtle coordination by, for example, ensuring that consultation between the European Affairs Ministers is good in terms of planning campaigns, and suchlike.
Mr Knapman raised the possible issues that could arise when the referendums and decisions made at Member State level have a negative outcome.
You know what the deal is.
It has been agreed in the European Council that, if ratification has been completed by 4/5 of the number of Member States and if a few Member States were to have issues at that point, the situation will be discussed.
A treaty cannot be signed and ratified if not all countries sign.
However, I urge you to do what we can in order to have a positive outcome and in order to receive support for the Constitutional Treaty.
In all honesty, I have high hopes and high expectations.
Let there be no mistake, though, it does require excellent communication.
Finally, also in the framework of communication, Professor Grabowska mentioned a youth pact.
She supported us in this and I am pleased with what she had to say.
Finally, different remarks have been made about external relations, foreign policy and the concern that exists about various developments in the world.
This brings me to the remarks made by Mr Catania, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mrs Napoletano concerning the situation in Iraq.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the events in Iraq.
Obviously, international legal rules will need to be adhered to.
We assume that the US authorities will be mounting an in-depth investigation straight away further to the images we saw yesterday and will take measures in order to prevent similar events in future.
I would also like to express my abhorrence in respect of the persistent attacks and hostage takings in Iraq, the recent low being the killing of aid worker Margaret Hassan.
We sympathise with the relatives of the victims of the atrocious violence in Iraq.
At the same time, we must all contribute to stability in Iraq.
The conference to be held in Sharm El Sheikh next Tuesday offers the neighbouring countries and major international actors a good opportunity to send a joint message to Iraq and the Iraqi people.
I hope and trust that this will be a clear message in support of the Iraqi interim government, together with democracy, freedom, security and justice in Iraq.
Mrs De Keyser expressed concerns about the Middle East.
I should like to emphasise that the Union will pull out all the stops to ensure that the Palestinian elections are a success.
That was also the reason for the short-term programme that we in the European Council have approved.
Mr Bot and the High Representative, Mr Solana, are in consultation with Arab countries and with the members of the quartet of the party involved.
We in the Presidency are also working in close consultation with Javier Solana on a package of direct measures to support the Palestinians, particularly in the run-up to the presidential elections.
Let me finally turn to Mrs Staniszewskaâs observation about Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the Union is offering Ukraine a prospect for the future, and it is not for nothing that we developed an action plan, with and for Ukraine, in the framework of the European neighbourhood programme.
Hopefully, this will be laid down formally in December, which will give us a fresh basis for future cooperation.
In this respect, we will not be considering who will win the elections, but the way in which those elections are being held.
Only by fair and free elections can the Ukrainian Government demonstrate that it observes European standards not only in words, but also in deeds.
This brings me to the end of my speech.
On behalf of the Presidency, I should like to thank the Members of this House for their in-depth and interesting contributions.
You have sent out signals that are important for future international policy-making.
Europe means a great deal to the public.
Communication will be tremendously enhanced when Europe contributes to employment, to a prospect for the future for the economy, when Europe helps reinforce security and if Europe succeeds in achieving results in these areas.
I will naturally convey your opinions to the Council, and would thank you again for your input.
Â Â  .
Mr President, during the debate it was said that to talk about there being no alternative to the Lisbon Strategy was questionable, but that reflects an incorrect perception of what it is really about.
It is not a simple and easy fix that drew us to defining this position in Lisbon, it is a more complex and broadly defined strategy.
It is not an list, available for selective political shopping, but one balanced menu.
Of course it is complex, and that is why we needed to re-evaluate where we are and how we can improve performance.
If we did not have it at all, we would have to invent it.
One aspect links the challenge of the ageing population in Europe with the challenge of increasing competitiveness.
In a broad sense, that aspect is education.
In my view, we are not entitled to life-long earning without life-long learning and this has to be very broadly defined.
It is not just about elevating the elite in Europe, it is also important to look at the broader definition of education for the labour market.
Here, the challenge for Europe to improve its competitiveness is not to say 'work harder' but to say 'work smarter'.
This is the only way forward and is also why increasing the focus on education is essential.
Money is also essential.
One per cent is not enough!
It does not make sense to talk about ambition and to define and identify with the ambition of Lisbon without doing something to the budget.
This is not just about the Community budget, but it does include it.
We cannot have a credible ambition for Europe without a credible budget for Europe.
Mr Titley suggested a scoreboard to show the performance of Member States' implementation efforts.
I see the Kok report as an initial step along those lines.
I am totally convinced that President Barroso and the incoming Commission will do its utmost in this respect.
Mr Harbour mentioned the need for the Commission to reduce red tape and to simplify procedures.
An important point on the European agenda should be to look again at the existing of directives and find out whether they could be simplified by transforming them and clarifying things to have more regulations and fewer directives.
This would make it easier for economic players in Europe to find out what the existing legal situation is by reading it in a regulation instead of having to find out how directives have been implemented in all the different Member States.
To mention just one example, the Prodi Commission has reduced the different ways of tendering from 48 to 8.
This is not the answer to all the problems and I would say that the Financial Regulation is still a monster.
We have not reached the point of simplification that we had hoped for.
One reason for this is that in reacting to the problems of the previous Commission, we perhaps added too many layers of futile controls.
I hope the Commission and Parliament will continue to look at the Financial Regulation.
Confidence-building between our European institutions is necessary, but it is now necessary to build self-confidence.
We can do better.
Let me turn now to some final remarks on external relations.
I add my voice to the sympathy being expressed to the family of the aid worker, Margaret Hassan, particularly because we in the Commission have been funding her work and the work of her organisation in Iraq over many years.
It seems to be perpetually necessary to remind the strongest power in the world about the need to respect international humanitarian law.
I was totally shocked to learn the other day that Red Crescent aid workers were not given access to Fallujah by the United States Army there.
This is very, very bad and the international community â if we have one â should react very strongly against this type of behaviour.
We, as Europeans, cannot create a credible basis for our relationship with an emerging democratic Iraq if we do not invest and do not clarify that it is possible for our views to differ from those of others on some points.
On the issue of the readmission problem I would also say that confidence-building is necessary.
It is not just about telling our neighbours and some developing countries far away from here that they have to take back refused asylum seekers from their own country or maybe their neighbouring country.
We have to consider Europe's image in this.
We have to offer some burden-sharing when we do these things.
We must make it clear that we should not fund these activities with money earmarked for development cooperation.
We have to talk about additionality, because we are adding to the list of things to do.
This is the last time I will address this House.
I want, on a personal note, to thank you for five very good years, both on the level of the results we have achieved together and on a personal level.
Thank you, and good luck.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MrÂ Nielson.
On behalf of Parliament, I should also like to thank you for your work.
I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, and a vote will take place on these at 12.30Â p.m. today.
The debate on the Council and Commission statements is now closed, and I should like to thank all speakers, as well as MrÂ Balkenende and MrÂ Nielson.
The sitting will resume at 12Â noon, when we will examine the issue of ..., when there will be a formal sitting on South Africa.
Â Â  The European Council of 5Â November was the first since the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed in Rome on 29Â October.
It is therefore important that we highlight our opposition to this Treaty and our criticisms of economic, monetary and competition policy.
The Treaty contains a profoundly neoliberal slant, to the detriment of social policy, and a narrow outlook on social rights and fundamental freedoms, with the emphasis placed on centralism and federalism in their various forms.
As highlighted in the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European United Left, the conception of a European security policy in the Treaty contains a major military dimension, and provides for close cooperation with NATO and an increase in Member Statesâ military efforts.
As regards the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy, we strongly criticise the Kok report on the interim review of the Lisbon Strategy, particularly in view of its emphasis on âcompetitivenessâ, on further increasing the flexibility of labour markets, on structural reforms in the internal market and on the liberalisation and privatisation policies, despite the disastrous impact that those policies have already had.
We strongly believe that the Stability and Growth Pact must be revoked and replaced with a Growth and Employment Pact, as stated in our Groupâs motion for a resolution.
Â Â  Mr President of the Republic of South Africa, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and pleasure for me to welcome Mr Mbeki, President of the Republic of South Africa, on behalf of the European Parliament.
I would also like to welcome Mrs Mbeki and the Ministers and Members of Parliament accompanying the President, who are seated in the gallery.
Mr President, the European Parliament has always followed events in your country very closely.
During the apartheid era, not so long ago, we adopted numerous resolutions condemning those practices and supporting the humanitarian aid that the European Commission provides via numerous NGOs.
A delegation from this Parliament also participated as observers in the first democratic elections held in your country in April 1994.
On this 10th anniversary of your country's freedom, it is truly extraordinary to see the profound changes that have taken place in South African society in less than ten years, between apartheid and your Presidency of the Republic.
Mr President, we know that your life has been characterised by your fight for freedom and democracy.
Since you were 14 years old you have been linked to the activities of the African National Congress in South Africa and in many foreign countries, then as Vice-President of Nelson Mandela's government, and now as President of your nation.
Yes, we should all be amazed and delighted by the incredible development of your country over these last ten years of democracy, the improvements in living conditions, access to housing, running water, education and health.
The economic results are also very positive: you have recovered sustainable growth, controlled inflation and a significant increase in your currency reserves.
Apart from these achievements, however, the most important thing you have achieved is national reconciliation.
It does you honour, not just you but the whole of humanity, to have put an end to racial separation, not just in a physical sense but also in your citizensâ hearts and minds, where it is surely more difficult to make changes, moving from apartheid to an interracial society, which is more egalitarian, in which there are no gender inequalities either.
Of course, a decade is not long enough to resolve these problems completely.
We know that you are facing difficult challenges, particularly in relation to combating Aids and security amongst your citizens.
Our relations have developed significantly by means of the multilateralism represented by the Cotonou Agreements and also by means of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa in the field of trade and development, which is now fully in force following ratification by all the States of the Union.
Finally, I would like to refer to the important role your country is playing as a mediator in the regional and civil conflicts afflicting your continent.
Your country, and yourself personally, have demonstrated this in the Great Lakes region and you are doing so at this very moment in Ivory Coast.
Mr President, believe me that this Parliament has followed the creation of the Pan-African Parliament with great interest, which is now in the Republic of South Africa and with which we hope to maintain close relations in the future.
For all these reasons, Mr President, it is an honour for the European Parliament to have you here today, and I am sure that what you are now going to say will be of the greatest interest to all of us.
You have the floor, Mr President.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, on 31 January last year, the published an article by a David Harland, described by the newspaper as 'a senior policy adviser on humanitarian affairs with the United Nations in Geneva'.
Headed 'Talk of emergencies misses the point', the article discussed the situation in Africa.
In part it said: 'Overshadowed by the Iraq crisis, quite a lot has been happening in Africa recently.
Ivory Coast, having first taken a step away from war, may be edging back towards the precipice.
Sudan is walking a fine line between war and peace, with an agreement possible to end what is now Africa's longest-running conflict'.
It said: 'Civil wars in Burundi and even Congo may be a little closer to resolution than they were a year ago.
Sierra Leone seems to have put its horrible civil war behind it.
As has Angola, until recently the scene of Africa's Thirty Years' War.'
It said that the peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea is holding and then asked the question, 'Is Africa rejoicing offstage while the world worries about Iraq?'
In reply it said, 'Not at all'.
It said that despite the small flashes of good news, Africa remains in a horrible mess.
It said that Pliny the Elder said that 'out of Africa there is always something new.' .
Mr Harland said that these days it seems the opposite is true: out of Africa there is always something depressingly familiar.
Africa's weak states need long-term assistance.
Six months after this article appeared, on 13 July, published yet another opinion about Africa.
This one, entitled 'An invitation to disaster' was written by one Arnold Beichman, described as 'a Hoover Institution research fellow'.
Returning to Pliny's famous expression, Mr Beichman wrote, 'Pliny the Elder, Roman naturalist and philosopher, wrote in his multivolume 'Natural History': '', or for those who have forgotten their high-school Latin: 'There is always something new out of Africa'.
He asked what could be more new than Africa south of the Sahara, supported by the United Nations, pleading with Europe and America for a return of western soldiers to bring peace to Liberia?
Pleading, if you please, for American troops to oust Liberia's President Charles Taylor, since it was American slaves who had been freed and sent to form their own country in 1847.
He said how strange it was for Europe's one-time African colonies to have made such a request, even if it could mean many years of occupation of Liberia by once-hated western armies.
From African emancipation to African reoccupation.
He said, 'So what am I yakking about?
No American troops in Liberia or any other part of Africa.
Not one.
We've done our share, more than our share in Afghanistan and Iraq.
And we're still not finished in those two countries and we won't be for years to come.
Let Europe - Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, all one-time colonial powers - send in their troops.
Enough already.'
Arnold Beichman's response to David Harland's observation that Africa's weak states need long-term assistance was to suggest that rather than the United States, the countries of Europe represented in this esteemed Parliament should reoccupy Africa, and be prepared to stay on for some time, just as the United States, according to Beichman, is prepared to stay on in Afghanistan and Iraq.
If indeed this were the eventuality with which all of us must contend, that to solve the problems of the developing south the developed north has to resurrect old colonial empires, then the well-used expression '' would necessarily have to be rewritten to extend beyond the African shores.
I am certain that you will understand that as Africans we have absolutely no desire to entertain Arnold Beichman's wishes, and have no wish to have it said that the newest thing out of Africa is its recolonialisation.
I am equally certain that neither do you, or the peoples of Europe that you represent, want to impose on yourselves what the British writer, Rudyard Kipling, arrogantly described as 'the white man's burden'.
But before I go any further, let me return to Pliny the Elder.
The motto of the South African Museum, the premier museum in our country, says in Latin: ''. This translates into 'Africa always brings forth or contributes something new'.
You may question why this corruption of a famous Latin saying, that is seemingly so beloved to observers of African actuality, has come about.
If I may digress briefly into the world of the study of ancient languages and literature, let me explain how the South African Museum arrived at this particular rendition of the famous saying by Pliny the Elder.
It transpires that Pliny translated into Latin what had originally been written by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle.
Referring to what he described as a common Greek saying, Pliny wrote, ''.
The expression '' is a later adaptation of what Pliny actually wrote.
It is for this reason that, for its motto, the South African Museum reverted to the original Pliny.
As a repository of extraordinary exhibits that contribute something new to our understanding of the evolution of our common universe, the earliest being the first fossils of prehistoric animals to be found in our country, the Museum chose a motto that says Africa always contributes something new to human knowledge.
I want to argue that as you are doing in Europe, Africa is today involved in an extraordinary and creative endeavour that might contribute something new to the understanding of the capacity and ability of human beings to overcome adversity and build a new world of hope.
I come from an African country whose future was highly uncertain a mere decade ago.
As we approached the end of three-and-a half cruel centuries of white minority rule, many in the world held their breath, foreseeing a cataclysmic clash of races that would transform the streets of our towns and cities into rivers of blood.
However, because of what the black and white Africans of South Africa did, understanding that the taking of even one life would neither remove the great harm that had been visited on millions for centuries, nor create the possibility to repair the damage that had been done, Africa's South Africa is today at peace with itself.
Black and white South Africans, and others from elsewhere in the world who have chosen to join in this effort, are hard at work, striving together every day to build a new African country that will, in all respects, truly belong to all who live in it.
Many across the globe who feared for the worst describe what has been achieved as a miracle.
If it is, it is, remarkably, a human miracle brought about by the triumphant resurgence of everything that is good and noble in the human soul.
As Africans, we are proud that this, in addition, is an African miracle.
Ten years ago, a mere 21 days before South Africa held the first democratic elections that gave us our freedom, the most terrible genocide began in the African country of Rwanda.
In a hundred days a million Africans had been butchered by other Africans in a barbaric and savage manner that would have been difficult to imagine and is still difficult to understand.
The Government and people of Rwanda have left some of the places where the slaughter occurred as they were when the murderous insanity was brought to an end.
So today, a decade later, you can see the skeletons with cracked or punctured skulls of those who were butchered mercilessly and for no reason except as an expression of the same criminal hatred for other human beings that resulted in the annihilation of millions of Jews in the Holocaust that took place in Europe, as Nazism gave meaning to its vile project.
But even as a South African, well educated in the unbridled savagery of human beings towards other human beings, I have wondered at what could have driven the to commit the high crimes that were visited on the people of Rwanda.
But, much more than this, I have marvelled at the unfathomable depths of forgiveness that have allowed the people of Rwanda to sit together in village assemblies to discuss what happened, the killers, together with those who carry the indelible scars of the savagery or who lost relatives and friends as a result of the blood-letting orgy.
I have marvelled that simple African folk could convene under the African sky, without even the sophistication of a simple village hall, the hunters and hunted together, and decide to forgive, choosing the path of national reconciliation rather than angry vengeance.
In the end, I have felt proud that other Africans, the Rwandans, could give our continent and all humanity the priceless gift and the miracle of understanding what it means to say 'let bygones be bygones'.
Because the thunder of the guns broke the uneasy silence in Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi, in Algeria and the CÃŽte d'Ivoire, in Sudan and Uganda, it has seemed to some that Africa is defined by the chatter of the weapons of war rather than the striving for peace, exemplified by what the African peoples of South Africa and Rwanda have, within the last ten years, sought to do, to address some of the grossest injustices that have occurred on African soil or, indeed, the peace that has prevailed in the overwhelmingly majority of African countries.
Nevertheless, as an African, I will make bold to state what I believe are some incontrovertible truths about my continent.
Under the leadership of African Algeria, the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea came to an end.
Whatever Africa needs to do to ensure that these two sister African countries do not go to war again to resolve border disputes, Africa will do.
As Africans we rejoice that peace in this part of our world is holding and will hold.
Under African leadership the wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Burundi have come to an end.
As Africans we again rejoice that peace in this part of our world is holding and will hold, and that these two sister countries continue to advance, despite the odds, towards the formation of new governments that will be elected by the African masses in democratic elections, which will be held during 2005.
Under the leadership of the African Republic of Kenya, Sudan is about to end the long drawn out war between the Northern and Southern parts of this sister African country, and proceed to the formation of a new Government of National Unity.
Similarly, under the leadership of the African Union, and whatever the current difficulties, the conflict in Darfur and other parts of the Sudan will be resolved, leading, among other things, to the redesign of the Sudanese system of governance to entrench the principles of tolerance and unity in diversity.
The terrorist wars in Algeria and Uganda are also coming to their conclusion.
Difficult as this may be for some to understand, as Africans we have no doubt that the people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire will find one another and will together establish a stable peace, reunify their country and join together in electing a government representative of the people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire as a whole.
The commitment of the leadership therefore to the holding of elections by October 2005 is an important signal of their common commitment.
You will have recognised the fact that what I have tried to communicate exemplifies the new Africa that is striving to be born.
This is the new Africa defined by the African Union and its socio-economic programme, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD.
Accordingly, I am talking about an Africa that is using enforceable legal instruments to commit itself to the fundamental objectives of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, good governance, development and a better life for all.
This is a new Africa in the process of birth, which has established or is in the process of establishing such institutions as an African Commission similar to the European Commission, a Pan-African Parliament, a Peace and Security Council, Pan African Criminal and Human Rights Courts, an Economic, Social and Cultural Council representative of African civil society, an African Peer Review Mechanism specifically dedicated to the objective of promoting good political, economic and corporate governance and, of course, the NEPAD programme.
This is a new Africa that has taken firm steps to give concrete meaning to the goal of the political and economic integration of Africa, in pursuit of the objective of African unity that is based on the understanding that, as Africans, we share a common destiny.
It is a new Africa that has finally made the statement to itself that it must take responsibility for its destiny, that it must take ownership of its own future.
In that sense I speak of an Africa that is saying it must be its own liberator from the ills of war and conflict, dictatorship, corruption and the regression that have characterised much of Africa over the last few decades.
In this context, we therefore contest the assertion made by David Harland that 'out of Africa there is always something depressingly familiar.'
I also contest the argument advanced by Arnold Beichman, that Europe must dispatch expeditionary forces to our continent to rescue the hapless African masses from weak states.
A long history of interaction and interdependence binds Europe and Africa together.
That history, as well as current realities, dictate that our two continents should build a mutually beneficial partnership for change.
The Africa you know so well is poor.
Yet it is committed to engage in a struggle to eradicate that poverty.
It is underdeveloped.
But it is determined to extricate itself from this terrible condition.
It continues to suffer from such conflicts as you experienced not so long ago in the Balkans.
Nevertheless, it is resolved to act firmly and consistently to guarantee itself the gift of peace.
It exports some of its best-prepared human resources to your countries to your benefit.
It is obliged to receive back into its borders those driven by hunger to undertake hazardous journeys out of Africa, to enter Europe illegally, and whom you catch and expel.
Current global realities that threaten us all, concerning failed states, seemingly unbridgeable ideological differences and international terrorism, are other factors that communicate the message that during this period of globalisation, no country or continent can be an island.
In the end, the European Union will not succeed in its noble objectives if neighbouring Africa fails to achieve the same objectives.
As you have worked to build the new Europe after the costly Second World War and the end of the Cold War, you have taken firmly on board two related and critically important objectives of cohesion and solidarity within the EU.
On this basis, you have made the determination that you are one to the other your brother's and sister's keeper.
Through what you have done and are doing through your Regional Policy, you have succeeded to combine what is practically necessary with what is morally correct.
As a consequence of this, millions throughout the Union have had their human dignity restored, guaranteeing the possibility for all to thrive in conditions of peace, friendship, mutually beneficial cooperation, and prosperity.
We would like to believe that your experience, stretching over many centuries, will have communicated the message to you that were these ever to be built, the walls of a 'Fortress Europe' would always be easy to breach.
We would also like to believe that as you act to help the millions of Africans who are working to help themselves, you would understand that, as you come to help us as Africans secure our own human dignity you would guarantee for yourselves, as well as ourselves, the possibility to thrive in conditions of peace, friendship, mutually beneficial cooperation, and prosperity.
Simply put, it is difficult to see how Africa can extricate itself from its terrible condition of poverty and underdevelopment without resort to the development model epitomised by the EU Regional Policy, which has recorded the successes it has with regard to the poor and underdeveloped regions within the EU.
In this regard, I believe that we should engage in a serious dialogue between ourselves, to answer the question of whether the existing framework of cooperation between Africa and the EU, to address a challenge of poverty and underdevelopment greater than that experienced within the EU, is informed by considerations akin to those that inform your own internal regional policy.
Perhaps the European and Pan-African Parliaments could take the initiative to begin this dialogue.
It would seem obvious that we should avoid a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby, because of what was not done, we would say that David Harland was correct when he said that 'out of Africa there is always something depressingly familiar.'
I would like to thank you most sincerely for the opportunity you have given us to speak to you, fully aware of the heartfelt importance of this gesture of solidarity.
I would also like to take this opportunity to wish you the best as you grapple with the challenge, among others, of making a success of the enlarged Union.
I am certain that you understand this better than I do, that the more you succeed to establish a strong, effective and successful European Union, the more your responsibilities will increase to contribute to the realisation of the goal of a better world for all.
Success breeds its own responsibilities.
And one of the greatest responsibilities of our time is to end the obscene reality of endemic poverty for millions when the means and know-how exist within human society to achieve the goal of a better life for all.
As I end and thank you very much again Mr President and Members of the European Parliament for having us, and salute you for what you did to end the system of apartheid, a victory of which we celebrate the 10th anniversary this year, I would like to assure you that regardless of what the sceptics might say, '.
Something new, Africa will always contribute something new.
I thank you very much, Mr President, and thank you all for your attention.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your words, Mr President.
I am sure your presence here today has satisfied our expectations.
I would also like, Mr President, to thank the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, Mr Balkenende, for being here today.
Parliament appreciates his presence.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
(1)
Mr President, I would like to point out that there has been an error by the services of the House and that this amendment has not been presented by the PPE-DE Group.
Naturally, we are against.
Thank you for pointing that out, Mr Salafranca.
I note that it is not a PPE-DE Group amendment.
(2)
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . â The proposed directive also privatises the certification of seed for sowing, which has been turned into a speculative commodity.
In other words, certification has been awarded to private individuals by the state, which will check them randomly and, more importantly, in a very small ratio.
The report finds that this new procedure will not significantly downgrade seed standards.
In other words, they are expected to fall, but not significantly.
The question which arises is, why propose replacing a system when the new system not only does nothing to improve the existing system but is worse and more costly?
The objective is to extend the profitability of private capital which, in addition to production and sales, will also have certification, and to reduce the corresponding public spending by the Member States, which will be passed on to farmers many times over.
The sanctions provided for in the directive for private individuals are irrelevant to farmers, because they neither protect them from losses nor compensate them.
In my country, horticultural seed, which is supposed to be guaranteed by the manufacturer, has deteriorated to the point that the farmers using it have gone bankrupt, have not received compensation and have become embroiled in fruitless and costly court proceedings.
For these reasons, we shall be voting against the report and the proposal for a Council directive.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the proposal for a Council directive on seed produced in third countries, because I feel that this proposal â aimed at simplifying procedures in the area of official certification of seed, at widening the scope of field inspections to all crops producing certified seed and at widening the scope of equivalence of EU seed to all types of seed produced in third countries â is a positive step and I believe that it does not harm the interests of Portuguese farmers and consumers.
Â Â  . Following a long period of experimentation in the sampling and testing of seed, aimed at ascertaining whether such techniques may constitute alternatives to the official certification processes, it was concluded that it would be possible to simplify the procedures without significantly reducing the quality of seed.
Accordingly, the proposal for a directive, which covers four sectors of production (fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and the seed of oil and fibre plants), might contribute to the desired move towards simplification, and widen the scope of field inspections under official supervision to all crops and increase the scope of âequivalenceâ of EU seed to all types of seed produced in third countries.
Given that the legislative amendments tabled in the proposal are intended to remove bureaucracy and that they are conducive to development, I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the reports by Mr Gauzes on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (Andorra and Liechtenstein), because I believe that by promoting the internal market and fair competition, it does not harm the general publicâs freedom, and by means of these and other mechanisms, helps in the fight against money laundering.
Â Â  .
We are aware of the pressure to accord tax sovereignty â the ability to raise taxes â to the EU, and are firmly opposed to this, because sovereignty in this area is an essential element of a countryâs sovereignty.
We are similarly aware of the dangers of progressive tax harmonisation, the aim of which is to move gradually along the path towards a federal Europe.
We would never, however, oppose greater tax coordination aimed at taxing the unbridled circulation of capital, at combating tax fraud and tax evasion, at putting an end to tax havens and at stopping money laundering.
The savings directive, which forms part of what is known as the Monti package, contributes, in spite of dangers and shortcomings, towards a system whereby Member Statesâ tax administrations exchange information â including lifting banking secrecy â so that they can tax their citizens on interest accrued in another Member State.
Accordingly, the Council has authorised the Commission to negotiate agreements with Switzerland, the USA, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino on implementing measures to prevent flights of capital.
We welcome those agreements, not, as the rapporteur claims, due to barriers to the internal market, but because coordination is needed to tax capital and to combat tax havens, not least when the
Â Â  .
This proposal is the result of the authorisation conferred by the Council on the Commission (decision of 16Â October 2001) to negotiate agreements with Switzerland, the United States of America, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino aimed at preventing cases of individuals and collective entities managing to avoid any form of taxation in their State of residence on interest accrued in another State.
This proposal fosters mechanisms for combating unfair tax competition and will naturally lead to an improvement in the running of the internal market.
Furthermore, it establishes another effective instrument in the fight against money laundering, in this case in relations with Andorra.
The fact that it received a unanimous vote in the relevant committee is ample proof of the desire to press ahead with all of these objectives.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .
The ARGO programme under-performed in 2003, due to the under-implementation of funds, which occurred firstly because the programme is not sufficiently well-known to national administrations and secondly because they have difficulties in mobilising the necessary co-financing.
The purpose of this funding programme is primarily to promote cooperation between Member States in the areas of asylum, immigration, crossing external borders and visas.
The aim of the proposal before us is to amend the ARGO decision, so as to make funding possible for projects undertaken by a single Member State that do not involve direct participation by other Member States.
Given that such projects concern the EUâs external borders, which form part of an area of free movement, they are naturally of common interest to all Member States.
I voted in favour of the proposed amendments, because whilst this is not an ideal solution, it is, however, as much as we can do at this time â before the new Financial Perspectives for the post-2006 period â to contribute towards burden sharing in integrated management
Â Â  Various points should be raised with regard to the objectives of the ARGO Programme, which is a programme that we believe should be rejected outright.
The aim of this programme is to foster the communitarisation of the management of Member Statesâ borders, and of the policies on visas, asylum and immigration, with funds from the Community budget that require national cofinancing.
In other words, this is yet another tool used to construct a âfortress Europeâ built on restricting the fundamental competences of Member Statesâ sovereignty.
It strikes me that the implementation of this programme is one of those instances in which the overbearing eagerness of the most federalist plans is at variance with reality.
This is firstly because there is no evidence that there is any actual need for the departments in the Member States â along with partners from other Member States â to organise and mobilise the resources required to carry out those projects and secondly because, as we have stated, given the monetary policy and the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact by the European Central Bank and by the governments of the 12 countries of the euro zone, Member States have not been able to mobilise the national resources required to obtain funding for this programme.
As the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining.
Â Â  The report is aimed at amending what is known as the ARGO programme by enabling financial contributions to be made to national projects concerning the EUâs external borders.
The June List supports the idea of cofinancing surveillance of the external borders, especially when enlargement eastwards has meant that financially weak Member States are hit by high costs for such surveillance.
The ARGO programme nonetheless contributes to achieving the EUâs objective of setting up, step by step, an âarea of freedom, security and justiceâ.
This means implementing a common policy of measures concerning visas, asylum and immigration, something to which the June List is opposed.
These issues should be dealt with by the Member States themselves in their own national parliaments.
We are thus voting against the proposal.
Â Â  . â The ARGO programme, which was decided in June 2002 in the run up to the Seville summit (renowned for its anti-immigration and repressive decisions), made provision for EUR 25 million to finance joint actions by at least three Member States in the field of guarding borders over a period of four years.
The appropriations were not taken up, not because there was disagreement on the orientation of the programme, but because the ruling order of each Member State of the European Union wishes (for the moment at least) to retain responsibility for its borders and to decide on the basis of its own interests how many immigrants it is in its interests to squeeze dry.
Nonetheless, the Commission proposal to the Council under debate makes provision for doubling the original amount and even for financing the initiatives of each country individually, which clearly demonstrates the persistence of the European Union in armouring a European area of repression and policing.
The pilot purpose of the programme is clear: to pave the way for everything being set in motion more clearly today in the light of the new, more reactionary Hague programme which succeeded Tampere and was decided at the recent summit.
The parliamentary report is fully in keeping with the decision by the EU institutions and the Commission proposal.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the report on the ARGO programme, firstly because border management is one of the most important issues involved in implementing a genuine area of freedom within the EU, secondly because the resources of the programme have been under-implemented whilst the Member States should be paying closer attention to these issues, and lastly because Portugal has been advocating simplifying the programme in recent years.
Â Â  .
The practical implementation of the ARGO Programme â an action programme for administrative cooperation in the fields of external borders, visas, asylum and immigration, established by Council Decision in June 2002 â has suffered a number of setbacks, particularly because the proposed actions were found to be excessively bureaucratic.
Another problem was the difficulties experienced by Member States, along with their partners from other Member States, in organising and mobilising the necessary cofinancing to carry out the projects.
In order to promote the general objectives of the ARGO programme, the Commission therefore proposes to increase and diversify the various actions proposed on external borders.
The award of financial aid to national projects in the area of external borders, aimed at offsetting certain structural shortcomings that have occurred at strategic border crossing points, fulfils a wish, often expressed by both the Council and Parliament, for greater coordination between the various Member States as a crucial response to the challenges posed by todayâs world.
I wish to point out that the recent enlargement virtually doubled the length of the EUâs land border.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
The main purpose of the proposal for a directive before us is to take account of the recent EU enlargement and the specific situation in new Member States as regards meeting objectives of recovery and recycling, by giving them more time to adapt their national systems to Community targets.
We have no objection to this in principle.
Despite the fact, however, that the Commission has agreed to draw up a report on the implementation of the Directive by 30Â June 2005, we must, once again, emphasise the importance of reuse and prevention when it comes to packaging and packaging waste.
Priority must be given to reuse and prevention over recycling.
To reduce the impact of packaging on the environment, prevention must be the first course of action, reuse should be the second and anything that cannot be reused should be recycled.
As such, the current Directive may have adverse effects on existing reuse systems.
Greater incentives should therefore be introduced to set up new packaging reuse systems when existing systems offer no benefit to the environment.
Â Â  .
On behalf of the VVD delegation in the European Parliament, Mr Manders has voted against Mrs Corbeyâs Amendment No 4 to the Packaging Directive, because that amendment does not call for examining the manner in which packaging material is reused which is best suited to the Internal Market.
By doing this, the VVD delegation in the European Parliament is not voting against the environment, but it fails to see how this amendment offers any additional environmental benefit, it being unclear, in the case of single-use packaging being refilled, what costs are incurred for such things as extra transport, use of cleaning products and the associated water pollution.
Moreover, 80% to 90% of single-use packaging is already at present being recycled successfully.
Furthermore, extra environmental measures may not lead to a disruption in the Internal Market, as did the deposit system for single-use packaging in Germany.
This system, which is still before the Court of Justice awaiting a final ruling, has, since its introduction, resulted in some EUR 0.5 billion worth of damage to the customer, industry, and has, last not least, dealt a devastating blow to employment.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Corbey (A6-0027/2004) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.
On 31Â December 1994, Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste entered into force.
At the time when the proposal for the revised packaging directive was submitted to Parliament and the Council, accession negotiations with ten countries were ongoing.
The new Member States have now acceded to the EU as of 1Â May 2004.
At the time of the adoption of the revised packaging directive, however, the transition periods for the original directive were not yet finalised for all acceding States.
Furthermore, information on the conditions for further increasing the recovery and recycling targets in the acceding States was insufficient.
The revised packaging directive does not therefore contain specific proposals for the acceding States in its operational part.
The current proposal lays down a deadline of 31 December 2012 by which the ten new Member States must fulfil the targets for recovery and recycling of packaging waste.
I feel that this entire report is crucial because it fosters systems of reusing packaging with the aim of ensuring
Â Â  .
As I have said on a number of occasions, the recovery and recycling of packaging waste must be stepped up throughout EU territory, in order to reduce its impact on the environment.
The positive results achieved by the EU Member States in the Union of 15 can and must also be achieved by the new arrivals.
The proposal before us accords the acceding States temporary derogations with respect to the targets set in the âRevised Packaging Directiveâ, which will allow them to make the step soon.
I welcome the rapporteurâs proposal based on the idea that all Member States should still be encouraged to implement packaging reuse systems, with the aim of achieving a high level of environmental protection and giving the new Member States a period in which to adapt properly.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, permit me first of all to congratulate you on your Presidency.
In particular, I notice that your English is perfect.
Next, I shall explain why I voted in favour of the Samuelson report, which establishes the European Agency for Reconstruction.
A few days ago, I was in Venice, at the theatre of La Fenice, at a performance of the opera , with my dear colleague, Mr Karl von Wogau.
Near us in the audience there sat a very old lady from Serbia, and I asked her how I should vote on this report, which provides among other things for the reconstruction of Serbia.
She answered, âYou must vote for it, of course.
It is a good thing to reconstruct what was destroyed in our country by Communism and by MiloseviÄ, but you who have a Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, who has even reconstructed his face, could you also reconstruct the faces of us old people, as that would give us so much pleasure?â
Â Â  .
This proposal for a Council regulation amending the Council Regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction has political implications for the Republic of Cyprus that we feel are extremely serious.
As has previously been stated, what is being proposed is to use an EU agency to manage future Community financial resources earmarked for the Turkish Cypriot Community, when that agency was created to manage Community financial resources earmarked for the Balkans, following the break-up of Yugoslavia.
In other words, the plan is now to use the agency, which administers financial resources earmarked for third countries, which obviously does not apply to Cyprus, to provide âassistanceâ to the Turkish Cypriot community living under occupation by Turkish troops.
This measure will in fact result in the tacit recognition of the occupying authorities and of the illegal Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is only recognised by Turkey.
What is thus being proposed is a financial aid package to the Turkish Cypriot community, which completely overlooks the fact that part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, an EU Member State, is under Turkish military occupation, and that is unacceptable.
I also wish to highlight the paradox of voting on the use of the agency for the practical implementation of a regulation
Â Â  There are reasons for questioning the setting up of new EU bodies for supporting regional economic development.
We see the risk of these bodiesâ becoming permanent and of this, in turn, creating a growing, and ever more expensive, bureaucracy.
We therefore believe that the European Agency for Reconstruction should be phased out by 2008.
Financial incentives should be used to promote peace and stability.
There must therefore be an overall solution bringing about peaceful and stable development in Cyprus before the EU contributes funds, through the European Agency for Reconstruction, to support Turkish-Cypriot population groups.
We thus support the Commissionâs original wording in this part.
Â Â  . We are in favour of the European Agency for Reconstruction and we are in favour of giving aid to the Turkish Cypriot community.
However, we do not want to give any form of recognition to the so-called government in the occupied territories of Cyprus.
Cyprus is a Member State of the European Union and even though the are suspended in the occupied area this does not cease to be territory of the Republic of Cyprus.
This is the reason why we have to abstain in the final vote on the Samuelsen report.
Â Â  . â The European Union, through the European Agency for Reconstruction, which is the vehicle for the economic and political spoon-feeding of the states to emerge from the dirty interventions in the Balkans, is taking another step towards the euro-partitioning of Cyprus.
The Commission, following the Cypriot people's refusal to accept the partitioning Annan plan, considering Cyprus in practice as a third country, is putting the financing of occupied Cyprus under the European Agency for Reconstruction of the Balkans.
This revealing decision proves that the integration of Cyprus into the ÎU is being used for the essential acceptance of the direct or indirect partitioning of the island.
With the financing decision, the northern part of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish army is being recognised by the EU as an independent state.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the two reports on the financing of the pseudo-state of occupied Cyprus and support the set position of a united, sovereign, independent and demilitarised Cyprus.
Â Â  .
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Samuelsen (A6-0031/2004) on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction.
I feel that the Agencyâs work is essential, particularly because South-Eastern Europe is a key region for the EU.
Parliament must not fail, however, to carry out its responsibilities as a budgetary authority, and must ensure a structured and stable future through the competences and activities of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
Broadly speaking, it would appear that the Agency is effectively performing its work of managing the main Community aid programmes in the region.
Parliament looks forward to the Commissionâs report clearly dividing the tasks and responsibilities between the Agencyâs operational centres and the Commissionâs delegations, and containing an analysis of how the regulation will operate.
Â Â  .
The European Agency for Reconstruction has, according to recent assessments, proved amply capable of carrying out the policy of assisting development in the Balkan region that is enshrined in the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation regulation (CARDS), and has achieved the objectives of its mandate.
The Lisbon European Council of March 2000 confirmed that the fullest possible integration of the Balkan countries into the political and economic mainstream of Europe remained a key objective and that the stabilisation and association process was the cornerstone of its policy in the Balkans.
The Vila da Feira European Council of June 2000 conferred on these countries the status of potential candidates for EU accession.
We must therefore follow up the assistance policy, which has been implemented and whose relevance and effectiveness have been proved, by extending the Agencyâs mandate, given that there is a stable Community financial framework until 2006.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . â The European Agency for Reconstruction is an EU mechanism for the control, economic plundering and political spoon-feeding of the peoples of the Balkan states formed following the reversal in the former socialist countries, with armed intervention by the USA, ÎÎÎ€Î and the ÎU, which resulted in the carving up of Yugoslavia and the bloodshed of the people.
This sort of 'assistance' is a mockery and an alibi for political spoon-feeding, strengthening big business and imposing capitalist restructuring on the states in the area.
The criminal bombings with depleted uranium in Yugoslavia by the USA and ÎÎÎ€Î, with the participation of Member States of the European Union, with thousands of civilian victims, the destruction of monuments and the across-the-board destruction of the environment, are having painful consequences for the peoples of the Balkans.
The problems in the Balkans and in the area as a whole cannot be resolved where the imperialist powers themselves have incited ethnic hatred in order to justify their interventions and continuing military presence in the area.
The rise in unemployment rates and the misery and poverty in the countries in the area as a whole, are a time bomb which the USA and EU are ready to ignite by encouraging the expansionist intentions of Albanian nationalists in the Balkans as a whole.
We believe that all foreign interference must stop and the foreign armies must withdraw from the area.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago, I was wondering whether the appropriations intended for the Turkish Cypriot community, which amount to EUR 114 million in 2005 and EUR 139 million in 2006, would go, at least in part, to the pensioners living in the Turkish part of Cyprus.
While I was pondering this, I closed my eyes and, in my reverie, I clearly saw Mrs Mechtild Rothe, who said to me in reply: âBut what are these doubts of yours, Mr Fatuzzo?
Most of this money will go above all to the old and the pensioners on the island.â
How could I thus not vote for this document?
Â Â  .
One of the key questions discussed in this proposal is respect for the complete integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.
Parliament cynically asks the Council to take an âimpartialâ decision.
From whose point of view would such a decision be impartial?
We need to ask this question.
Can one ever demand impartiality between the occupied and the occupier, or between the attacker and the victim?
Parliament seeks a âfairâ decision.
We wish to state that there is no genuinely fair resolution that does not involve condemning the occupation of Northern Cyprus by Turkey and calling on Turkey to withdraw its troops and to comply with UN resolutions.
Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus must, therefore, be a prerequisite for any solution aimed at the âeconomic development of the Turkish Cypriot communityâ.
It would not be acceptable for the EU to pursue direct business relations with occupied Cyprus, detrimental to and bypassing the Cypriot Government.
As the Cypriot authorities have claimed â entirely legitimately â EU business with occupied Cyprus must effectively involve the Cypriot Government.
Hence our vote.
Â Â  We have not forgotten that Cyprus suffered military invasion 30 years ago, at a time when the international situation was admittedly tense.
We have also not forgotten that it was, and still is, split in two, nor that the Greek population was driven out of the north of the island and robbed of its property and land.
Nor have we forgotten that the north of Cyprus is still occupied by a foreign power which brought tens of thousands of its citizens to the island and, in doing so, followed up military occupation with colonisation on a huge scale.
We do not object in principle to either Turkey as a country or the Turkish community, which has held Cypriot nationality for several generations.
We believe, however, that as long as the problem of military occupation has not been resolved, it would be inappropriate for the European Union to grant significant amounts of money to Turkey, the occupying country and yet a country which it is preparing to welcome into its ranks.
We cannot support such a state of affairs, and we will vote against the Rothe report.
Â Â  . âI am voting in favour of the reports by Mrs Rothe and Mr Samuelsen because I believe that the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus needs economic and development aid with the objective of reuniting the island.
However, I am obliged to justify my vote because there are certain ambiguities, which have already been touched on in public.
The first ambiguity concerns Amendment No 3, Article 1, point 5 of the Samuelsen report and the other concerns paragraph 5 of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets attached to the Rothe report.
I voted in favour on the basis of the following criteria: first, that the final decision by the European Council will not leave any grey areas, nor will the sovereign and other rights of the Republic of Cyprus be eroded and that assistance to the Turkish Cypriots will not sow seeds of division but will result in the reunification of Cyprus.
Secondly, that the decision by the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament will state that financing for Turkish Cypriots will be provided under heading 3, from which money is paid to Member States, and not from heading 7 or 4 relating to candidate countries and external aid.
Â Â  .
After 40 years of separation and 30 years of Turkeyâs military presence in the North, there was finally an opportunity at the beginning of this year to reunite Cyprus as a federal state.
The solution essentially provided guaranteed self-governance for the Greek-speakers and Turkish-speakers each in their own part of the country, based on the successful model with which Belgium managed to solve the tension between the Flemish and the Walloons.
Unfortunately, the Greek-speaking majority, in a referendum, rejected this peace solution, which had been presented by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
No solution differing greatly from this one will ever receive the approval of both population groups separately.
I have sympathy for the Greeks and Greek Cypriots who would prefer Turkey to resign itself to a minority position in an overwhelmingly Greek-speaking country, as was the case between 1960 and 1964, but that remains impossible.
The division will therefore continue to be in place for the time being.
I welcome the fact that the European Commission has looked for ways to prevent the Turkish-speaking minority, who wanted peace and conciliation and voted in favour of the peace plan in the referendum, from being penalised for the fact that it was impossible on 1 May to include their area in the EU.
As long as the present situation persists âŠ
Â Â  . Irrespective of the result of the referendum held in Cyprus, the EU must continue to provide financial support for the Turkish Cypriot community, given that this would clearly not jeopardise compliance with the EUâs position on this matter.
I therefore voted in favour of the report by Mrs Rothe (A6-0032/2004) â Instrument of financial support (Cyprus).
Â Â  .
The proposal for a Council regulation before us is intended to promote the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, thereby giving practical form to the intention expressed in the Council Statement of 26Â April 2004 âto put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot communityâ.
Indeed, the Turkish Cypriot community expressed a clear wish to ensure that its future lies within the EU in its referendum held on 24Â April 2004, a wish that has similarly been expressed by the EU on a number of occasions.
Nevertheless, the overall framework, as we know, ultimately made it impossible to use the amount provided for in the Financial Perspectives for 2004-2006.
I therefore agree that the EU should provide assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community, particularly in the areas of economic development, the economic integration of the island and improving contacts between the two communities and with the EU, in order to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus, which is also proposed in the Regulation.
I welcome this important proposal and voted in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, I was in Reggio Calabria catching a plane to come to this session of the European Parliament.
The local organiser of the Pensionersâ Party in Calabria, Carlo Rositani, had accompanied me to the airport.
We were early, and so I was talking to him about this document, which seeks to limit and regulate arms exports from the European Union.
Spreading out his arms, he said to me: âMr Fatuzzo, you must not only vote in favour of this regulation but also demand that no more arms be exported at all, with or without regulations.
