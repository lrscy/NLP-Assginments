Furthermore, in the current international context, the success of the conference is a positive sign of international solidarity and confidence in the positive development of the world economy.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in order to convey a realistic impression of what the Doha agreement means for agriculture, I would like to very briefly touch upon the individual points of the Doha declaration.
The first part of the declaration concerns the general objective of agricultural negotiations within the framework of the WTO, that is to say the creation of a fair and market-oriented trading system.
At the same time it also acknowledges the work that has been done since the beginning of 2000 under the 'Article 20 negotiations' .
The next section deals with the traditional three pillars of trade: market access, exports, and competition and domestic support measures.
In the case of market access, the text settled on was "comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access".
This reflects the conclusions of the Agriculture Council on 27 September 1999, in which the importance of further liberalisation of agricultural trade as a contribution towards sustainable economic growth was recognised.
The term 'comprehensive negotiations' means that all agricultural products can be covered by the negotiations, and also that all issues should be covered.
In this connection we also made it clear that geographical information should also be included here.
With regard to export subsidies, the declaration talks about reductions in all forms of export subsidies, in other words exactly what this House called for in its resolution in October.
It is also stated that the negotiations should aim to phase out all forms of export subsidies completely.
However, the text also clearly indicates that none of the statements on the three pillars should anticipate the outcome of the negotiations.
There is therefore at present no commitment to negotiate the total elimination of export subsidies during this round.
However, we also know that there is a broad coalition against continuing export subsidies.
The Cairns Group, the USA and the 77 Group of developing countries all spoke out against continuing export subsidies.
As regards domestic support, the text refers to substantial reductions in competition-distorting domestic support.
This is also in line with your own resolution, which called for the rejection of competition-distorting measures, and it corresponds to our own mandate, which commits us to negotiate on domestic support while retaining the concept of the blue box and green box.
We consciously chose the word 'concept' to indicate that we are perfectly willing to negotiate on the details of the blue box and the green box.
The extent of distortion of competition will be a key element of all discussions relating to domestic support.
Another important point is the special and differential treatment of the developing countries.
I know that one of your own priorities is to integrate the developing countries in international trade.
The wording of the Doha declaration is in accordance with this objective and it also matches the Council mandate of 1999.
Lastly, the text deals with non-trade concerns.
The proposals that the WTO Member States put forward in Geneva in this area are specifically recognised.
As you know, the European Union too presented a raft of proposals on the most important non-trade concerns, such as the environment, the development of rural regions, food security, consumer affairs, labelling and animal protection.
By specifically recognising non-trade concerns, the Doha declaration allows us to pursue these objectives further in forthcoming negotiations.
The last section contains the timetable for agreeing on methodology, 31 March 2003, and the deadlines for presenting the comprehensive drafts.
This is to take place before the next WTO ministerial conference, so that agreement on agriculture can be reached at the same time as the overall package, by 1 January 2005.
Apart from the purely agricultural part of the text, I would also like to point out that the section on the TRIPS Agreement also deals with the issue of geographical information.
This will enable us to pursue our objectives in the negotiations on geographical information and in the agricultural negotiations, and also in the TRIPS negotiations.
Finally, in parallel to the decision on the start of the Doha development round, agreement was also reach on the ACP waiver, which allows us to conclude the solution negotiated with the USA and Ecuador to bring an end to the banana war.
This means that the proposal the Commission has already put forward can be accepted, as soon as you here in the European Parliament have adopted your position on this, which I hope will happen in the course of this week.
I would like to conclude with the comment that the satisfactory outcome of the Doha Conference does not necessarily mean that the forthcoming agricultural negotiations will now be straightforward.
The objectives of the other major WTO members are in some cases very different indeed from our own, but we will do our utmost to secure the European agricultural model and at the same time to negotiate a fair and more market-oriented trading system for agricultural products.
Things will very much depend on our continuing success in achieving a common approach on the part of the Member States, and your support will assist us in this respect.
Another thing that will help us is continuation of the excellent cooperation that we have had with the Council and also within the Commission on this issue.
We are going to have to interrupt this debate.
I propose to try to finish the list of political group speakers and then break.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Members of the Commission, the launch of the new, comprehensive, three-year round of talks at the Doha Summit is a very positive signal for both the World Trade Organisation and the present world economic situation.
The Doha development programme, which includes the liberalisation of trade as well as elements of new rules, stressed the commitment of the developed countries to capacity building in respect of the less developed countries and to helping them implement already existing WTO rules.
I am firmly of the opinion that the small but boisterous anti-globalisation groups have now had a clear response from the less developed countries represented at Doha.
We want to be involved in liberalising world trade and clarifying its rules, as that is also in the interest of the less developed countries.
Every country had the opportunity to torpedo any collective decision - nobody did so, however.
The presence of China and Taiwan at the WTO was also a significant milestone.
We must hope that Russia will be able to clarify its own internal structures in such a way as to allow her also to take part.
The Union' s own goals at Doha at least were successfully achieved.
Commissioners Lamy and Fischler deserve our thanks for succeeding in seeing through to the end some tough negotiations that lasted a good number of days.
Furthermore, the Council' s internal cohesion remained firm the whole time, something that was obviously necessary for the Union to be able to approve the outcome of the talks.
In addition to being involved in the negotiations process itself, Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, together with Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck also, kept us Members of Parliament, who were following the events, well aware the whole time of where things were going.
Sustainable development and the inclusion of environmental considerations in trade policy decisions were agreed to be an all-embracing objective in future talks, something that is certainly of crucial importance to us, the countries in the Union.
As talks on the trade in agricultural products are also to be conducted in accordance with a comprehensive agenda but without any predetermined conclusion having been reached concerning forms of subsidy and timetables, this difficult matter, too, can now be negotiated peaceably whilst the Union' s common agricultural policy is being reformed.
Our parliamentary group, which held talks with several delegations that were present at Doha, thought it regrettable that the US Congress did not send their representatives there.
As we continue our efforts to develop WTO transparency and parliamentary monitoring of ministerial conferences, the presence of the US Congress is essential.
It is also realistic to state that we will only be able to move forward in this matter with the approval of governments.
Hopefully, Germany, as we unofficially heard at Doha, will before very long take the matter up formally in the WTO bodies.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the WTO meeting in Qatar was a landmark achievement, especially for all those who realise that globalisation is one of the twenty-first century' s greatest challenges and that it is a challenge to bring it under democratic and political control.
In the view of my group, globalisation desperately needs worldwide rules and global institutions.
This means that globalisation can also be at the service of people, and not the other way round.
As Commissioner Lamy said, Seattle two years ago failed on all kinds of fronts.
It was not transparent, the groups were imbalanced and participation was not well organised.
There was also a great deal of fear that, due to this failure, a number of matters which affect all of us greatly, including development, the right to adopt one' s own domestic policy, workers' rights, and the environment, would suffer badly as a result.
It is actually a real achievement for us to have witnessed true change in Qatar after those two years.
It constitutes a first step towards a new WTO, in a fight to equip globalisation with rules which are at the service of human values.
My group is therefore delighted with the outcome of this Fourth Ministerial Conference.
Not because we are pleased with all the aspects, far from it.
We shall continue to apply pressure and a whole host of things are still missing, but in essence, we made a significant step forward.
This fresh step is certainly also of importance in the removal of inequalities between North and South.
This is one of the most important things in the globalisation phenomenon as a whole.
It is certainly striking to note what we have achieved on the WTO agenda, both in the way in which all kinds of developing countries took part jointly in the debate in a well-organised manner, and with regard to the agenda itself.
We wanted a development round, and at least we can now say that there is a development agenda.
And needless to say, it will be specific results which will soon be at issue.
In this respect, the TRIPS account and public health care are of huge importance.
It has been recognised that when it really matters, public health care and the need for the same sometimes transcend intellectual property rights, and that allowance is made for this within intellectual property rules.
It is clear that this requires further elucidation, but what is important is what happened there at political level.
The recognition as such will persuade many to join a modern and new worldwide WTO.
Needless to say, the agreements involving the waiver for the Cotonou Agreement of the ACP and EU countries are of crucial importance, for this has helped us bring about an enormous breakthrough in our relations with the ACP countries, a breakthrough which we might not have had otherwise.
In the field of environment and trade, we managed to put a number of items on the agenda of which we feared right up to the last minute that they would not make it.
This is an enormous leap forward, a taboo has been shattered. It should not become green protectionism, but it is of the utmost importance for us that we have managed to bring it about.
According to our group, it is a sad state of affairs that we have not actually made any real headway on the score of democracy and transparency, as already stated by Commissioner Lamy too, and on the score of workers' rights.
We may have prevented certain things from reverting back to the old ways, but we have a desperate need for more success in this area.
Allow me to conclude by saying that our group has greatly valued cooperation with Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, as well as the President-in-Office, and that the Commissioner' s statement that this House must ultimately approve the Doha results, places us in a fully-fledged, grown-up democracy and a fully-fledged democratic role.
We greatly appreciate this, and we rely on a very fruitful campaign in the years to come.
On behalf of the Liberal Group, I would also like to extend our thanks and congratulations to the Council and Commission, especially to Commissioner Lamy.
In our view, without the effective work of the Commissioner and the Council, in cooperation with Parliament, the new round would never have been proposed, let alone launched, and for that we are grateful.
It seems to us that the summit at Doha represented the coming together of two themes or two trends within the WTO.
The first theme is the first concerted attempt to accommodate the needs and legitimate complaints of developing countries.
We have referred already to the TRIPS Agreement, the text on implementation, US movement on anti-dumping, a chink of light in the European position on agriculture - these to us are very significant developments.
The second theme or trend is that the talks extended well beyond traditional market access preoccupations and moved towards the development of new rules, competition, investment and, above all, the environment.
That again seems to us to be a very welcome development and we are very pleased to see that a balance seems to have been struck - a sensible and workable balance between the needs of developing countries and the need to develop new rules within the World Trade Organisation.
Some have suggested - I think my Green friends and other critics of the WTO - that somehow these two things are incompatible with each other and that developing new rules on the WTO is anathema to the interests of the developing countries.
We found it particularly bizarre that Green Members of this House and Green campaigners rejected talks on the environment within the WTO, in the name of the developing countries.
To us, there is no trade-off between sustainable multilateral environmental disciplines and multilateral attempts at poverty alleviation.
Now is the time for delivery.
Some of the news over the last few days is a little mixed, particularly from the United States, over the concessions which were extracted from the Administration in the fast-track debate and the debate on trade and steel in Washington.
We must keep the pressure up to make sure that the momentum that was established in Doha is maintained in the years ahead and we will certainly strive to do so.
Mr President, it is no secret that the Green/EFA Group does not share the majority view of Parliament over the outcome of the Doha meeting.
For us, with a few exceptions, it was not a success.
It was an unedifying example of the richer countries bullying the poorer ones and has prompted many to assert that the so-called victory in Doha was a failure for democracy.
While it is certainly true the developing countries asserted themselves in a much stronger way than ever before - and that is to be commended - it is also true that the outcome from Doha falls far short of the development round which was promised us.
That is not only the view of the Green/EFA Group, but also of the vast majority of NGOs from both north and south, and of many of the southern representatives there as well.
Let me remind you of some of the interventions in the Doha plenary debate.
The Indian Minister of Commerce, Mr Murasoli Muran, said that the only conclusion that could be drawn is that developing countries have little say in the agenda-setting of the WTO; it appears that the whole process was a mere formality and we are being coerced against our will.
Let me remind you of what Jamaica said.
Ambassador Mr Randsford Smith said that we regret that the draft texts presented to this ministerial conference, as at the outcome of the Geneva preparatory process, do not sufficiently reflect or capture the position and proposals of developing countries.
I could give you many more similar quotations.
Let us have a look in a bit more detail at what they really mean.
There was only a very brief acknowledgement of the need to review implementation issues: that was a key agenda issue for the developing countries going into Doha.
The language on the phasing out of agricultural exports subsidies has been substantially watered down, due to EU objections.
As a result, farmers in the south will continue to have their livelihoods devastated.
As Tanzania's Trade Minister, Mr Iddi Simba, said, the wrong policy on agriculture might lose elections in France, but it loses lives in Africa.
There is no commitment to an early phase-out of textiles and garment quotas because of strong resistance from the United States.
Demands for development linked to the promotion of food security, which is being promoted by many developing countries, were completely ignored.
Commissioner Lamy, I do not expect you to agree with this analysis, but at the very least you should acknowledge the very real anger and frustration of the developing countries throughout the conference and pledge that in the negotiations that are now beginning their interests will genuinely be at the forefront of our priorities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, good work was done in Doha.
I believe we have three good reasons to appreciate the results.
The first is the real involvement of the southern countries and the evidence that multilateralism is effectively beginning to happen.
Before Doha we did not have a pre-negotiated agenda; after Doha we have to deal with a whole range of claims put forward by the southern countries.
As a result, the WTO, still fragile but better recognised, is therefore strengthened.
Of course this is not yet the kind of democratisation the NGOs and European parliamentarians had hoped to see, but there has clearly been progress and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is right to emphasise the transparency and improved method seen in Doha.
Unlike Caroline Lucas, I was not aware of general anger or frustration; on the contrary, I noted a sense of relief all round because this method enabled us to finally reach some degree of consensus.
Let me add, and I was surprised that this was not mentioned in the opening statements, that we are committed to negotiating the reform of the instrument for settling disputes.
Secondly, a window has been opened for examining the coherence between social questions and trade rules.
Liberalisation is indeed continuing, in particular in order to respond to the southern countries' interests with regard to market access.
Thanks to the European Union, however, and here I believe we can thank Pascal Lamy for his firm stance, we have the beginnings of a broad agenda - the environment, investment and competition can be negotiated on the basis of an explicit consensus.
In substance, this is still not much and we can understand why some of the NGOs wanted a more ambitious agenda, one that included the social aspect in particular.
If we are to achieve that, however, they and we will have to overcome some major inconsistencies.
Indeed we must not conceal the inconsistencies between different interests and claim to always speak in the name of the south.
Differences must be expressed if they are effectively to be overcome and that is how we managed to make progress on the question of medicines, when the north-south conjunction proved effective.
Similarly, we can make progress on the social aspect only if we carefully reflect on how to help strengthen international trade unionism.
Thirdly, for the first time, as much importance was attached to implementation as to the new subjects introduced.
Here again, I did not interpret the results in the same way as Caroline Lucas.
We made progress on the method and thanks to India we had a system not of prior evaluation but of ongoing evaluation during the negotiations: textiles, agriculture, anti-dumping measures, subsidies and even intellectual property were negotiated - with the possibility of renegotiation.
To conclude, we still have to make great efforts for the future to ensure that the process runs smoothly and in the right directions and here I have two points to make. The first is that there is a strong risk that the Union' s trade policy will be handicapped by the absence of a common policy.
We have a certain lack of cohesion here and it is up to us to clarify our agricultural and industrial social model.
My second point is that the social question is emblematic.
There is no question of giving up and adhering to the ILO.
The European Union must demand the establishment of multilateral social dimensions for development and solidarity.
So we still have a lot of work to do on this subject, but this should not frighten us.
Mr President, the current World Trade negotiations are important to the future development of the EU, particularly in the context of enlargement.
I am satisfied that our negotiators understand the extent of this challenge and - I hope - draw on the benefit of hindsight resulting from our experiences with the current regime.
From an agricultural perspective, we must not allow the United States to dictate agricultural policy.
On the last occasion they insisted on dismantling agricultural support and then proceeded to provide support for United States farmers at a level three times greater than that received by European farmers.
I am very pleased that in the preparatory talks we seem to have reached a satisfactory agreement on export refunds.
From an Irish perspective, export refunds are crucial because of our dependence on exports to third countries.
Equally we need to take a strong stand on food imports from outside the EU.
We are investing heavily in the implementation of food safety measures and have banned the use of growth promoters.
Yet EU farmers are expected to compete with imports from countries where those products are used.
Equally, in relation to sheepmeat, important to European, and particularly Irish, farmers - badly managed arrangements with New Zealand mean there are no controls to prevent a deliberate New Zealand policy to flood the EU market at peak production periods.
Mr President, I consider Doha a success, but I did think before Doha and I still feel now that the European position of the strategy of expanding the agenda was a serious mistake.
Indeed, overloading the WTO now and in the future with too many expectations for too many sectors will jeopardise the achievement of the organisation' s single, fundamental objective: market access, revitalising the stagnant situation of international trade, in the interests of both rich and poor countries.
Lastly, Commissioner, with regard to agriculture - let us not forget, before we start to feel too pleased with ourselves, that, ultimately, Europe' s negotiating position, as Mr Fischer explained, was actually an attempt to defend the indefensible, to defend the common agricultural policy.
We concern ourselves with working standards in Africa, Asia and South America, and yet, at Doha, we defended the wealthy French peasant farmers against the poor peasant farmers of South-East Asia, Africa and Latin America.
This is the bottom line.
Therefore, the agenda should not be expanded. Let us concern ourselves rather with the opening up of the markets, especially our rich agricultural and textiles markets.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the delegation for relations with the South Caucasus, I would like to inform you that a member of the Commission's diplomatic staff has been the victim of an insidious murder in Georgia.
I wish to ask the President, on behalf of the European Parliament, to send a communication to President Shevardnaze calling upon him not only to do everything in his power to solve this crime, but also to make sure at long last that constitutional means are used to ensure that people who work in Georgia and for Georgia are guaranteed appropriate protection, so that this essential work can be done effectively.
I regard this incident as a very serious one. We want to do everything to help the South Caucasus, but the South Caucasus itself must also make efforts to protect people entrusted to its care.
We have taken note of your request, Mrs Schleicher, and I am sure it will be accepted.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
Does the Commission wish to take the floor?
Mr President, it was agreed with the Commission that before the final vote on the legislative resolution the Commission would tell us to what extent it is willing to accept our amendments.
Commemoration of the tragedy in the United States on 11 September 2001
Ladies and gentlemen, at the request of a number of Members we have decided very briefly to commemorate the tragic events that occurred three months ago.
With your agreement, I will therefore read out a message.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three months ago today, at 8.46 a.m. New York time, the entire world was shaken by the horrific attacks that struck Manhattan and Washington.
At this moment, when I would ask you to reflect and remember, my thoughts, our thoughts, go first of all to the thousands of victims and their families, to the emergency services, to the military and civilian employees whose lives were suddenly shattered.
They also go to the American people, who, since these events, have been living in terrible fear of further attacks.
The European Union is playing its full part in the efforts we have made in solidarity with the United States to combat international terrorism.
The same is true of our commitment to finding urgent solutions to the conflicts that threaten world peace, especially in the Middle East.
Only if we show the necessary resolve and cohesion can we prevent such tragedies ever happening again.
My thoughts are with the victims of all acts of terrorism and war and I ask you to observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
(The sitting was suspended at 12 noon and resumed at 12.35 p.m.)
Vote (continuation)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly rather unusual to comment on a report that has already been voted upon.
Nevertheless, I am happy to make it clear, to avoid any possible doubt, what the Commission's position is on the report that has already been adopted.
Quite apart from the excellent work done on the preparation of this report, we are all agreed that by the end of the year the Council needs to reach a decision on amounts of subsidy and on the budgetary stabiliser, to ensure the necessary degree of certainty.
I support the substance of the proposed amendments to the compromise.
Firstly, I accept the possibility of being able to introduce compensation between the Member States as regards guaranteed quantities in the context of the Community maximum guaranteed quantity.
Secondly, I am in favour of an implementing system which makes it possible to give niche products from small producers a sufficient degree of flexibility.
Thirdly, in view of the results of an in-depth study of the functioning of this market organisation and of the supply of the common market with various types of seed, the Commission will submit appropriate proposals to the Council and Parliament under Article 37, which will include a reference to the setting of the maximum guaranteed quantity.
We will do this in good time to provide a basis for the successor system.
Furthermore, with reference to the way in which the budgetary stabiliser is applied, Parliament's proposal to reduce the amount of subsidy in the year after which the maximum guaranteed quantity is exceeded has a number of advantages and we shall therefore carefully examine this proposal.
(Parliament adopted the joint text)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0416/2001), by Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety
[10880/1/2001 - C5-0414/2001 - 2000/0286(COD)]
Mr President, one word of explanation.
This report now has a series of agreed amendments which we believe will be carried.
There is one unusual procedure - the House has voted already on the criteria for the site of the European Food Safety Authority.
The Council was not prepared to admit that as a part of the report.
We, however, believe that it was necessary to state what the criteria should be and to insist upon that.
The best way we can do that without going to conciliation is to vote it as a legislative resolution, binding therefore only on Parliament.
We hope that the President of Parliament will convey that information and our view on the matter to the Laeken Summit in two days' time.
Would the Commission now like to tell us its position with regard to the amendments?
I would like to reiterate the Commission's gratitude to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the effective and constructive way in which they have participated in the discussions between the institutions over recent weeks.
We are close to finding an overall compromise that will enable the regulation to be adopted without a requirement for conciliation, which will enable the European Food Safety Authority to be established early next year.
As regards the Commission's position on the amendments, it is as follows. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21 to 24, 26 and 29 to 44.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 to 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 25, 27 and 28.
On the issue that has been raised by Mr Whitehead, as I indicated in the debate yesterday evening, I believe strongly that the seat of the authority should be chosen on rational and operational criteria that will facilitate the smooth functioning of the European Food Safety Authority.
As such, I can support the principles expressed in the resolution referred to by Mr Whitehead.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Report (A5-0422/2001) by Mr Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council: Growth and Employment Initiative - Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)
[COM(2001) 399 - C5-0459/2001 - 2001/2183(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Graefe zu Baringdorf report (A5-0442/2001)
- (FR) Some 30 000 farms in the European Union cultivate grass and pulse seeds, the main species involved in this common organisation of the market. This is, therefore, most important to employment, producers' incomes, the socio-economic balance of many regions, biodiversity and security of supply.
On the one hand, however, the market prices received by the producers have fluctuated markedly in the last few years, while, on the other, the European Union still has a shortfall of about 15 000 tonnes.
We should, therefore, welcome the fact that aid for seeds will be maintained at the current level, knowing that this is necessary to maintain the balance between production and the market. Under these circumstances, I do not think there is any need to introduce a budgetary stabiliser, since the market has shown that it is capable of regulating itself, all the more so as the Commission proposal on this stabilisation mechanism is general and vague.
Lastly, I also find it inappropriate to model it on the mechanism set up for rice seed, which can be adjusted to the food consumption market.
Finally, and above all, it would be unwise to share a guaranteed maximum quantity amongst the Member States, given that these seed producers often have branches in several countries.
That is the tenor of the amendments I tabled in committee, where they were adopted unanimously.
I am happy to note that the European Parliament proved equally wise in plenary.
Cunha report (A5-0425/2001)
. (NL) The fisheries agreements which the EU concludes with developing countries are bad for the environment and bad for those countries.
The fact that EU fishermen ostensibly feel forced to move their activities from EU waters to elsewhere indicates that the fish population in EU waters has apparently decreased by these activities, so much so that the yield is now no longer sufficient.
This environmental problem must be tackled at source, namely by reducing the fleet capacity, not by overfishing elsewhere now.
In addition, the agreements are bad for the local economy, since modern EU ships rob local fishermen of their catches.
It is absurd that as part of the agreement, the EU should pay money to the governments of those countries in order to help the fishermen to find other jobs.
The amendments which the Committee on Fisheries and the ELDR have tabled to the Commission proposal are an improvement on the text of the agreement.
D66 has therefore supported these amendments.
Since we are opposed to the agreement as such for the above reasons, we have voted against the legislative resolution.
Lage report (A5-0402/2001) and Cunha report (A5-0425/2001)
We abstained on the reports on the fisheries agreements with Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde because although they provide these states with a certain amount of revenue, the large-scale fishing by European countries merely formalises the plundering of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde' s natural resources.
The only reason we voted for Amendment No 7 to the Lage report and Amendment No 5 to the Cunha report is because at least they have the merit of formally specifying the amount of financial compensation, without making any advance judgment on the question of whether this sum really makes up for the loss of this natural resource.
Gargani report (A5-0428/2001)
Mr President, this report is on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and therefore on what animals eat, and animals include fish.
As you know, Mr President, I am famous among fish, particularly pensioner fish, and I therefore could not fail to ask them, especially the pensioner fish of Morocco, what they think of this directive on the contents of feedingstuffs.
I am not joking, Mr President, I am only telling you in my customary manner why I voted for the motion.
Breaking their usual silence, these fish told me that they support this document but that they would like me to tell Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, when he comes to amend this directive again, to ensure that there is a choice of feedingstuffs on the menu as well, so that animals do not always have to eat the same dishes.
They get tired of having soup for lunch every day as well!
Whitehead report (A5-0416/2001)
Mr President, I would like to explain why I voted for the document on the European Food Authority.
This second subject is a subject which takes us to the kitchen as well, Mr President - nothing to do with me.
Maybe it is because it is lunch time that the next topic is also food-related.
I voted for the motion because, clearly, we have to have good food on our tables.
However, I feel that it would be a good idea for inspections to be carried out on these directives on the monitoring of foodstuffs too.
I regret to say that our Member States do not want inspections, and so I call for the food authority to be given the power, in the future, to genuinely carry out unannounced inspections on public canteens, school canteens, company canteens and canteens in the institutions where elderly people live when they are no longer able to live with their families.
Food is extremely important!
Mr President, I should like to say very briefly that it was a great pleasure for me to vote for the amendments to the common position on food safety, for which Mr Whitehead was rapporteur.
I wanted to express gratitude for his major efforts, for thanks to his work, we have managed to reach clear and sound agreements across the political divide, and that is why we are now where we are.
Today, we only adopted those amendments which met with complete approval by the Commission.
In addition, agreements have already been concluded with the Council.
This means that the Food Authority can become operational in 2002, which suggests that we are completely on schedule.
In my view, we can safely say that this is thanks to effective cooperation, across all groups of this House.
We have created a framework which should work.
If the right people are now also deployed in the right places, and the Authority is accorded a location which will give it the opportunity of establishing external contacts easily, then I believe that all conditions are in place to turn this Food Authority into a success.
It is now down to the Authority itself, and I wish it every success.
It could be useful to the consumer to set up a European Food Authority to see to food safety at Union level.
We agree with the principle.
Yet we would point out that unlike similar authorities in other countries, especially the United States, the European Food Authority will only have an advisory role and no power.
What value can its recommendations have under these circumstances?
I ask this, in particular, because a series of recent food scandals, from mad cow disease to dioxin in chickens, has shown that food safety and the quest for profit are a contradiction in terms.
This means that the European Food Authority is liable to be a purely decorative body.
. (PT) Whilst some advances in establishing the European Food Authority are positive, I still maintain that it cannot act as a panacea for solving food safety problems or as a smoke screen for public opinion.
It is important to ensure that there is an Authority which guarantees risk evaluation for the purposes of food safety, enshrined in solid scientific opinion, but it cannot free from responsibility or replace the Commission in terms of risk management of the Community food policy or the competent authorities of each Member State.
The underlying principle of any legislation on food is the protection of human health, and for this very reason, it is vital to introduce the precautionary principle in risk management when scientific data is insufficient or inconclusive.
However, it is questionable whether such a structure that is so cumbersome from the administrative and budgetary standpoint is necessary, but the need to ensure that one representative from each Member State takes part in the Administration should be highlighted.
In any case, it is worth emphasising once again that the food issue can only be resolved by means of a thorough change in the CAP and a genuine food policy that is not based on the interests of the agro-industrial multinationals or the liberalisation of agricultural trade.
I voted in favour of this report.
We have been trying for years to restore consumer confidence and the European Food Authority is one way of doing so.
There is no such thing as zero risk and we know what consequences a bacteriological problem (not linked only to terrorism) can have for a large number of our citizens.
Safety must therefore lie at the heart of the proposed system.
Yet we must not give way to panic, for let us not forget that the European food chain is one of the safest in the world. If it is to be effective and credible, however, the Authority will have to be supported by top scientific experts, while also drawing on the network of existing national agencies.
Another important aspect that needs emphasising is that we must separate the evaluation of the risk, which falls within the scientific domain, and its management (the measures that are decided), which falls solely within the political domain.
Let me remind you that whatever measures are decided must be proportionate to the level of the risk incurred.
In the event of a perceived risk, but which has no foundation, for instance a rumour, we should respond by informing the consumers.
In the event of a potential risk, we must take precautionary measures. Lastly, in the event of a real risk, we have to take preventive measures.
If we want the European Food Authority to be as effective as possible, it will have to be completely independent, its composition will be a determining factor, and its decisions will have to be highly transparent.
Lastly, the penalties imposed for serious errors or fraud must not only be considerable but, above all, applied.
. (NL) For years, quality and public health in the production of food were secondary to the pursuit of ever lower production costs.
A cheap food package had to keep the costs down for the public at large.
Governments and private business shared the same view about this reduction in costs, which was achieved, inter alia, by economies of scale, the use of artificial raw materials, intensification of the use of space, the import of animal feed from the Third World and an enormous number of redundancies.
For that purpose, slaughter waste and dioxin-poisoned grass were fed to animals, or animals were gathered in pens and lorries where disease was able to spread readily.
After all, if one wanted better food, there was a separate distribution circuit for those in a higher income bracket.
Only when it transpired that people can contract fatal illnesses from contaminated food, did an increasing number of people want to know what they were eating.
Once again, it is demonstrated that accidents need to happen first before the incentive is there to look for a solution to the problem.
The solution does not lie in enhancing the European bureaucracy, or squabbles about the location and management of a new institution.
Food safety can only be achieved if cost reduction and company profits are no longer paramount and if maximum openness is created in the field of complaints, minority verdicts, composition and safety measures.
I look forward to the revolutionary effect which Mr Staes envisages, but it remains to be seen whether it will materialise.
I voted for this recommendation because I believe that the common position as amended is a great improvement on the Commission' s original proposal.
I fully subscribe to the strong wish expressed by the European institutions: the future European Food Safety Authority must be set up very soon and be operative as from the beginning of 2002.
With that in mind, I agree with the rapporteur in wanting to see a text adopted to which the Council is likely to agree, so as to avoid a conciliation procedure, which always takes too long.
The European Food Safety Authority will be strong and will, I hope, help us counter any food-related risks throughout the European Union.
The Member States will continue to be responsible for monitoring and checks, while risk management and the rapid alert system will remain in the remit of the European Commission.
Finally, I am in favour of adopting criteria for selecting the best location, in the general interest, for the European Food Safety Authority: I believe that the town of Lille fully satisfies the conditions laid down in the recommendation.
. I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague which calls for the establishment of general principles and requirements of food law and for a European Food Authority.
Food Safety is of great concern to the majority of the European Union's citizens and it is therefore vital that this Authority will be efficient, democratic and transparent once it is fixed.
In such a way, the role proposed for Parliament will ensure that this body will remain under close scrutiny and that it will prove to be as legitimate as possible.
Moreover, it is highly desirable that the future location of this Authority should be physically independent from other EU institutions.
This will ensure that it remains independent and thus more credible in citizens' eyes.
Finally, the call for close cooperation with the relevant bodies is pertinent: when there is a suspected food risk it makes sense that the Authority should capitalise on the knowledge available in other related associations.
. (NL) The group encompassing the Dutch D66 Party has endorsed the Whitehead report on the European Food Authority.
D66 is pleased with the timing of this report, immediately preceding the European Summit in Laeken.
After all, the question of EFA' s location cannot be seen in isolation from the as yet unresolved issue of the EP' s location and the ludicrous shuttle between Brussels and Strasbourg.
We assume that the Heads of Government will look into these issues at length in Laeken.
Bushill-Matthews report (A5-0422/2001)
Mr President, Mr Bushill-Matthews' report is on financial assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises.
A Genoese 70-year old pensioner, Mr Guido Facchinetti, who is an expert cook and has worked in restaurants all his life, asked me to vote for this document for the reasons I have already given, namely that it is appropriate for small and medium-sized enterprises to be financed by Europe.
He said to me: "If I had the financial where-with-all, despite the fact I am 70 years old, I would open new restaurants throughout Europe serving trenette with pesto, Genoa-style chick pea flour, Recco focaccia and Camogli pan-fried fish" - apologies to any of my fish-loving friends who are listening - "for these are excellent dishes and I would like to take them to the whole of Europe.
All I need is the money!"
I hope that this document will make it possible for him to continue to exercise his outstanding abilities as an Italian and a Genoese cook.
. (PT) The launch of the Growth and Employment Initiative is a very positive step in terms of increasing and improving employment prospects in the EU.
In the last few years, SMEs and micro-companies have been responsible for creating the largest number of new jobs.
The report submitted by the Commission provides an objective analysis of the development of the three financial instruments for SMEs: the Start-up Facility (ETF), the Joint European Venture (JEV) Programme and the SME Guarantee Facility.
However, the critical observations set out in Mr Bushill-Mathews' report, which I share and voted for, are highly relevant.
I would like to stress, firstly, the need for the Commission to indicate clearly in future the degree to which forecasts of job creation actually materialise.
Secondly, the Commission should carry out an in-depth analysis of the reasons which lead some countries to make extensive use of the different programmes and others to record a low or nil rate of use.
I would like to point out in this respect that Portugal is one of the Member States not included in the ETF-Start-up Facility, aimed at initial-phase investment in high technology projects.
Indeed, as far as the SME Guarantee Facility in the 31.12.2000 reference period is concerned, the rate of use is quite low.
According to preliminary data supplied by the financial intermediaries, only eight Portuguese SMEs benefited from a guarantee under this mechanism, whereas in Spain there were 2 812 beneficiaries.
That analysis will be a very important indicator for the definition and adoption of regulatory measures, particularly in terms of transparent access to information, simplification of the procedures for submitting applications and speedy allocation of funds.
. (EL) The policy being applied by the European Union and the Member States is forcing hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into bankruptcy every year, because they are unable to withstand the onslaught of the monopolies.
With the signs of a slump in the economy becoming more and more marked, SMEs and jobs are the first to go and the generally limited and short-term jobs linked to the occasional subsidy do nothing to counteract this.
The Commission proposal merely serves the objective of reinforcing the European venture capital market by setting up financial intermediaries, who are neither controlled nor operate on the basis of job-creating criteria.
In most cases, SMEs do not receive direct funding, in that applications must be addressed to intermediaries, generally conventional 'risk and investment capital funds' which are guaranteed by the EIB and which receive credits and guarantees from it.
Thus, in the final analysis, no one apart from the European Investment Bank, knows which SME is being supported and what funding plans and jobs will result.
These intermediary financial organisations, which have signed contracts with the European Investment Fund, tend to favour early stage investments in high technology sectors such as information technology, communications and the biosciences.
So exactly what aid and which SMEs are we talking about, given that traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, small handicraft enterprises and tourist and commercial enterprises fall outside the funding framework, despite the fact that they are able to promote innovative products?
The highly important specific weight of SMEs in the economy of each country is being ignored, despite its having been proven that they represent the backbone of the business sector in Europe and are the only enterprises to have created any jobs over recent years.
The unequal geographical distribution of this aid is also typical of growing regional inequalities between the Member States, in that over half this funding (be it in the form of start-up aid or the guarantee mechanism) will go to France and Germany, while in Greece, for example, this aid is non-existent because there is no venture capital market to speak of.
We harbour no illusions as to the nature of the EU's employment policy or its policy on SMEs, which is basically non-existent, or the interests which that policy represents, which is why we feel that any reference to employment, to fighting unemployment and to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises within the guidelines for this policy is pure hypocrisy.
Faced with these choices, the workers and small and medium-sized businessmen are joining forces in their fight and struggle to overturn this policy and promote a different policy which takes account of man and his present-day needs.
. (NL) Small enterprises used to be a very common phenomenon.
In the last 150 years, they have been systematically bought up and forced out of business by large newcomers.
Only in the last few years has there been a surprising, renewed interest in small enterprises.
Unlike before, the big ones now stand to gain from their existence, since they can pass on tasks which they are unable to carry out at a cheaper price.
They involve outsiders in low-wage countries or sell vulnerable parts of their enterprise to the staff or management.
The business risks, including absorbing the peaks and troughs in transport and repair activities, are then borne by a third party.
In most cases, costly collective wage agreements and schemes for better conditions at work fall by the wayside.
In order to survive, people in such small enterprises must work harder and longer hours than they used to in the large enterprises.
The small ones may think that they are independent, but they rely completely on the bank and on the larger enterprises with which they have outstanding contracts.
Consequently, their existence can come to an unexpected end very quickly.
Chances are that ultimately, government aid for small enterprises invariably benefits the large enterprises.
However, I do not dismiss this aid just like that, for there are also situations where small enterprises can offer sound, fresh opportunities to groups of workers, notably to migrants and pioneers in the field of technical innovation.
. I wholeheartedly support this report which endorses the Commission report on financial assistance to SMEs through the Growth and Employment Initiative.
Since it is presently the case that most SMEs have some difficulty in breaking into the technology market, this financial assistance can often symbolise the make or break of a potentially very successful SME.
It is all too often bemoaned that the EU has failed to foster a culture of innovation and enterprise: the European Investment Fund (EIF) is a vital way in which this imbalance can and should be redressed.
The call for the close evaluation of projects is also welcome: in such a way there will be a vital element of accountability in the scheme.
To bolster this, the call for the involvement for the European Parliament is also vital.
That concludes voting time.

Draft general budget for 2002 (as amended by the Council) and Letter of Amendment 2/2002
The next item is the joint debate on the following four reports, tabled on behalf of the Committee on Budgets:
(A5-0400/2001) by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 as modified by the Council (all sections), and Letter of Amendment No 2/2001 to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002;
(A5-0427/2001) by Mr Colom i Naval, on financial programming 2002-2006;
(A5-0447/2001) by Mr Wynn, on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument;
(A5-0439/2001) by Mr Turchi, on Trans-European-Networks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to be meeting you here again in order to shed light on the salient points of the second reading of the EU' s draft general budget, as drawn up on 22 November.
It is one of the last, but also one of the most important stages in the sometimes complicated process in which the Community budget is brought about.
I greatly value the fact that I am able to make this statement before the MEPs who, as representatives of the European democracy, are meeting here in plenary session.
According to the rules of the interinstitutional agreement, this second reading of the Council was preceded by a consultative meeting of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which took place on 21 November.
I believe I can speak on behalf of all participants in this lengthy meeting, which did not finish until the small hours, when I say that it was not only a success from a budgetary point of view, because the general budget for 2002 will now soon be established, but also politically speaking, for we managed to agree on a number of new elements which presented themselves to us since our first reading and which need to be discussed, as well as a number of priorities.
On behalf of the Council, I should like to express a word of thanks to the Parliament' s delegations and Mrs Schreyer, who went out of her way to achieve this result.
I should first of all like to focus on the new elements.
Needless to say, there were the events of 11 September.
Entirely in line with what was decided at the consultation meeting, the Council wanted to set up a scheme to finance the effects in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries after these tragic events.
In our jargon, this means that the geographically oriented budget items are increased, and by these we mean the items for Asia and TACIS of the external policy.
For example, at second reading, the Council decided to pledge a total amount of nearly EUR 488 million in commitment appropriations for Asia.
The Council also wanted to leave open a wide margin under the maximum of Heading 4 'External action' with a view to meeting possible future needs in those regions.
This margin is also in line with the agreement that was reached with the European Parliament to maintain a minimum margin of EUR 70 million for any needs in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries.
Moreover, I should like to remind you that it was also agreed to earmark a minimum amount of EUR 35 million in reserve for emergency aid of Heading 6 for possible needs of this kind.
These elements formed an important part of the discussions we held.
Another new element that came up in the discussions, is the conversion programme of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleet following the failure to set up a fisheries agreement with Morocco.
In this respect, the Council has included EUR 170 million of commitment appropriations under Heading 2 of the draft budget and has decided to use the flexibility instrument for the corresponding amount.
In this connection, may I remind you that the Council, by way of accommodating the EP' s wishes, has approved a specific allocation of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 2 for the regions which border the candidate countries, and has also approved the use of the flexibility instrument for the corresponding amount?
In the framework of the agreement with the European Parliament on an amount of EUR 20 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 3 for those border regions, the Council has approved the trial project: 'Effects of enlargement in the border regions' .
This agreement was unquestionably one of the key points of the 2002 budgetary procedure.
In order to give this more lasting form, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have decided in favour of inclusion in the 2003 budget, taking into consideration the maximum amounts established in Berlin, together with EUR 27 million that were not placed on the 2002 budget which form part of the EUR 197 million which the Commission had proposed in the financial statement pertaining to the fleet conversion programme, as well as EUR 15 million for the border regions.
As far as the priorities are concerned, I would remind you that the Council officially adopted conclusions concerning the budgetary guidelines for the forthcoming budgetary procedure in March of this year for the first time.
In doing so, the Council wanted to indicate its budgetary procedures for the year 2002, as is the European Parliament' s and the Commission' s wont.
During the negotiations, the Council continually pointed at these principles and priorities, and adhered to the same.
In my view, this is a sound method, for it indicates more clearly what it is about and what the goal is, and it enhances transparency.
I therefore believe that we all stand to benefit from the Council' s continued efforts in this direction.
Let us start with the priorities which are close to the European Parliament' s heart.
I am delighted that an agreement has been reached in the framework of the joint declaration on the management of the commitments outstanding (the RALs) and of the elimination in the medium term of what people started to refer to as 'abnormal RALs' .
I would point out that abnormal RALs, which we defined as sleeping obligations for which no payments have been made over the past two years, as well as old obligations which have been on the budget for at least five years, cannot only be reduced by increasing the appropriations for payment, but also by causing obligations to lapse to a large extent.
I believe that the measures announced by the Commission will ensure that this matter be resolved satisfactorily in due course.
Moreover, we managed to agree on a statement regarding the implementation profile for the 2002 budget.
This statement means that the implementation of the budget will be spread over the course of the year as equally as possible.
The so-called December fever must be avoided in this respect.
In order to achieve this, the Commission has envisaged the following measures.
It aims to implement the 2002 budget, taking into account the implementation of the 2001 budget, and make the necessary changes.
The budgetary authority will be notified when the implementation profile deviates considerably from the proposed profile.
Furthermore, an implementation plan for the 2002 per heading of the financial perspectives will be sent upon submittal of the preliminary draft budget for 2003.
I am convinced that these measures correspond to the horizontal amendments which the European Parliament approved at first reading, so that we can look forward to the budget approval with confidence.
The Council has also devoted special attention to the priorities which the European Parliament had listed at first reading, inter alia by agreeing to the additional appropriations for e-learning and immigration.
Needless to say, I am pleased with the post-ECSC regulations and the pledge by the Spanish Presidency to redraft the Financial Regulation.
I should like to conclude this last list of priorities to be taken into account with one of the Council' s essential priorities, namely the controlled increase of payment appropriations.
I shall come back to this in due course.
At second reading of the budget, we took account of the agreements concluded during consultation.
We have tried to adopt a budget which can accommodate all the EU' s priorities, on the one hand, and which can take into consideration the points which were brought up after first reading without losing sight of the real needs and scope for spending the appropriations, on the other.
I should like to outline the other results to you for each heading.
As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, letter of amendment 2 has been adopted in its entirety.
Moreover, the Council has restored the proposed amounts in the preliminary draft budget for the budget lines which were cut at first reading and to which the letter of amendment refers.
An additional EUR 4.5 million has been included, as agreed during the consultation of 21 November, whereby Parliament' s observations were taken into account.
In a joint declaration with the European Parliament, special attention has been paid to the protection of animals during transport.
I am also delighted that our institutions can reach agreement on the points of this letter of amendment which pertain to expenditure for rural development, fisheries agreements and the inclusion in the budget of the surplus available from the previous budget year in the sum of EUR 1.2 billion.
I believe I have already outlined the key results in connection with the structural measures, namely the inclusion of EUR 170 million by way of commitment appropriations and EUR 39 million in payment appropriations for the conversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleet, and the amount of EUR 30 million for the regions which border the candidate countries, whereby use is made of the flexibility instrument in both cases.
With regard to internal policy, the Council has kept most points of its first reading and has also partially adopted a number of major amendments of the European Parliament, including e-learning, which entails EUR 5 million, and the European refugee fund, which entails an increase of EUR 5 million.
The rapporteurs have tried to convince us and they have succeeded, but the Council' s willingness to cooperate should also be highlighted here, in my view.
It is under this heading that quite a considerable proportion of the measures will be funded for the benefit of the regions which border the candidate countries.
As far as the external policy is concerned, the Council has not only increased the budget items covering Asia and TACIS by EUR 66 million compared to the draft budget, it has also adopted letter of amendment 2 concerning international fisheries agreements.
Concerning the common security policy, an amount of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations has been included, in accordance with the results of the consultation of 21 November.
As for administrative expenses, the three institutions agreed to hold extensive discussions about the report of the Secretaries General regarding the multi-annual development.
In my view, quite a few options are still left open.
As far as the EP' s budget is concerned, the Council has adopted draft Supplementary and Amending Budget 5 for 2001, by means of which expenditure for buildings can be forecast in the framework of the 2003 budget, with the obligation to reduce the expenditure in 2003 by an equal amount.
For a number of years now, the Council has adopted a comprehensive approach during its reading, which means that the main issues in the draft budget are the set priorities and the extent of the expenditure category.
Thanks to this approach, the Council has managed to remain under the existing annual maximum amounts of expenditure, established in the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999.
Additionally, in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement, it has managed to ensure that within the maximum amounts of financial perspectives, margins remain available, as a result of which different Community measures and policy lines can be prioritised.
When the second reading was drafted, the Council aimed for a budgetary discipline, so much so that the budget increases are in line with those of the national budgets.
The total increase of payment appropriations is therefore restricted to 2%.
As you know, agreement was reached during the consultation of 21 November in the framework of this general agreement with the help of the Commission.
The Council relies on the fact that the European Parliament will carry on in this vein during its second reading, so that the percentage increase does not exceed the agreed maximum amounts.
Before you have a final discussion on the budget, I should like to emphasise that the Council has endeavoured to take account of certain budgetary rules and basic provisions concerning the inclusion in the reserve of appropriations, the make-up of expenditure, legal bases, preparatory actions and trial projects.
That is why the Council would state once again that it is opposed to Parliament' s use of conditional reserves, which is in contravention of the Financial Regulation.
Furthermore, the Council has once again opted for the outcome of the first reading of the draft budget for heading B7-1 concerning the European Development Fund, since the increase of a funding or even of a margin in the budget lacks the necessary legal basis and is therefore not possible.
Moreover, allow me to remind you that this is intrinsically about compulsory expenditure.
I should like to conclude this brief outline of the second reading by the Council by highlighting that the budgetary procedure been conducted in a good atmosphere.
As in the past, emotions sometimes ran high during the discussions.
Everyone has put forward their view in clear, concise, sometimes lengthy, yet forceful terms.
However, the aim of the consultation procedure has not been overlooked: namely to bring about agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority with the help of the Commission.
In that way, we can adopt a budget which enables the European Union to face its challenges, and also to accommodate the circumstances and the developments which can be anticipated during the 2002 budgetary year and programme in the best possible way.
On my own behalf and that of the Council, I should like to thank in particular Mr Terence Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the two rapporteurs, Mr Carlos Costa Neves and Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg, as well as all the members of the Committee on Budgets, with whom I have had the pleasure of working over these six months of the presidency of the Council, in which I have not only become familiar with the European budgetary procedure, but have also learnt to appreciate it.
I thank you for your attention.
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the constructive attitude of both branches of the budgetary authority, the European Parliament and the European Council, and with the support of the Commission, it has been possible, throughout the different phases of the complex budgetary process, to find an answer to a series of new challenges, ensure that previous commitments are fulfilled and deal with most of the priorities defined for 2002.
In the light of a markedly balanced end result, it is only fair to single out the work of the members of the Budgetary Commission, the vital contribution of the draftsmen of the opinions of other committees, the responsible involvement of the political groups, the negotiating skills of the Belgian Presidency demonstrated by Minister Vande Lanotte, whom I congratulate, the competence of the Commission departments, which I hereby single out in the person of the Director-General for the Budget, Mr Mangasson, the work of the entire College of Commissioners and the particular endeavours of the Commissioner for the Budget, Mrs Schreyer, whom I would also like to congratulate.
I would also like to make a special personal reference to the invaluable support and contribution of the secretariat of the Budgetary Commission for the excellent results they achieved.
They went far beyond the call of duty.
In a rapid assessment of the results achieved, we should mention the establishment of better conditions for continuing to improve the performance of the budget and make it more effective.
The joint declarations issued by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are very important.
For the first time, the Council accepted amendments adopted at first reading by Parliament within the framework of the common agricultural policy, thereby opening up promising prospects for cooperation.
It was also possible to meet new needs deriving from the failure to sign the fisheries agreement with Morocco and the impact of enlargement through the financing of a restructuring programme for the Portuguese and Spanish fishing fleets, and specific support for certain border regions.
Fourthly, financing was agreed for three new agencies with competence in the area of maritime safety, air safety and food quality.
There is also an initial response to new challenges relating to the situation following the attacks of September 11, in particular in the areas of policing, justice and external action; here again special reference should be made to the financing of humanitarian and reconstruction actions in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries.
I would further stress the strengthening of the ability to act in terms of e-learning and the special importance given to the response to the tragic situation of the refugees.
Support for the Commission reforms and progress in preparing for enlargement are also envisaged.
Compliance with commitments entered into previously, whether in the context of Agenda 2000 with regard to the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds, or with regard to programmes arising from codecision or even concerning the policy on external action, are also matters which should be addressed.
Of course, it is only normal that new challenges are appearing for the future.
I would single out the following: the endowments needed for expenses of Headings III - Internal Policies, IV - External Policies and V - Administrative Expenses are subject to enormous pressure and the fact that the situation is under control for the time being should not delude us.
The problems will arise again in the next few years and it will become increasingly difficult to find solutions.
In this context, I would mention with regret the rigidity of the budgetary structure deriving from the Financial Perspective in force, which means that in some categories there are substantial balances and in others the situation is becoming increasingly complicated.
It is incomprehensible that with the current difficulties in various sectors, such as external action, there was a balance of EUR 11 billion outstanding in the year 2000, which is around 14% of the total expenditure.
We must have the courage to adopt in good time the solutions that in this case are so obvious.
At the same time, it must be stated again that the division of budgetary expenses into compulsory and non-compulsory is a completely outdated concept and, in the light of the most elementary principles of democracy, it is unacceptable for the effective competence of Parliament to be limited to non-compulsory expenses (around half of the budget) and it is incomprehensible that it has no competence as regards the revenue system.
The 2002 budget is ready and I believe it merits your approval.
As for the tasks for the future and the new role of the European Parliament in the budgetary process, we will be here to deal with them.
Once again, thank you all very much.
Mr President, words of thanks have already been addressed to Mrs Schreyer, the Belgian Presidency for its commitment, and to all fellow MEPs and co-workers.
I would particularly like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Costa Neves, for all the work he has done over the past year.
For the equanimity and meticulousness which he employed, his willingness to take the contribution of other, also smaller, groups seriously and the way in which he managed to persuade everyone to adopt the same line, which was no mean feat.
At the start of the budgetary procedure, it looked as if the pain for the 2002 budget was mainly concentrated in heading 5.
Needless to say, I was delighted with this as rapporteur.
However, now, having reached December, we could say that Mr Costa Neves has yet again assumed the leading role, for Heading 4 is now also showing cracks again.
For the third year running, we have had to supplement the budget by 200 million by calling on the flexibility instrument.
We therefore continue to scrounge in order to fund the political tasks of the European Union.
Despite this, it was once again possible to reach agreement with the Council.
However, as far as my group is concerned, our support is not really heart-felt, and this has everything to do with the tragic rituals and traditions which typify the budgetary procedure.
The President-in-Office of the Council has praised the Community budgetary method and although, admittedly, this method always ultimately culminates in agreement, more than anything, the annual budgetary ritual is a rather irrational process.
The Commission presents a proposal, the Council takes a huge slice off the proposed amount, Parliament adds a bit more, and we are then supposed to come up with something wonderful in the renowned consultation.
It did occur to me to break up the cycle and to simply leave a number of Council cutbacks in heading 5 where they are, including the cutback at the Court of Justice.
It did seem like a healthy exercise to let the Council come face to face with the effects of its actions and its unilateral obsession to remain well below the ceiling of the financial perspectives.
Unfortunately, I did not do this.
I have had feedback that that is what I should have done.
I decided against it because otherwise the wrong people would yet again be penalised.
This view about assuming one' s responsibility fits in well with the idea that we also mooted at first reading, namely that political promises made by Heads of Governments and Ministers should be accompanied by a financial picture.
We have drawn the necessary lessons in the reconstruction of the Balkans, and it seems fairer to me if it is indicated whether new tasks also require new funding, and - that is at the same time a promise - whether aid to a region in crisis will require cutbacks in peace projects in the Middle East or in projects against sexual violence in South Africa.
What is at any rate a bonus is that this time, aid to Afghanistan featured as a prominent part of the consultation and, unlike in the Balkans, external pledges were not made at donor conferences first, upon which we were expected to pick up the pieces, but these were discussed during the consultations.
I hope that this was not simply a question of good timing, but the start of a positive development.
Another bizarre aspect of the budgetary procedure is the implementation of the budget, and we as Parliament are also guilty of making empty promises.
We want tens of millions of euros more for South America, for instance, without knowing exactly why only 60% of last year' s funding was spent.
And each year, we intend to better monitor and adjust the Commission' s budget, which is no reason not to do it this year.
My group will therefore grant priority to this aspect during the preparation of the 2003 budget.
However, my group is pleased with the minor changes in the Council' s budget in the area of foreign policy expenditure.
Not a great deal of money is involved, but it is significant nevertheless.
It is now clear that Parliament will from now on give its verdict about the Council' s budget in terms of operational expenditure, which is an improvement.
The budget is a means, not an end.
It funds our activities for citizens in Europe and elsewhere, and if there is one slogan of which the European policy-maker cannot get enough, then surely it must be that Europe should be closer to the citizen.
And you cannot get much closer than the people of Elsene, our neighbours in Brussels, and I am therefore delighted with the paragraph in the present resolution which urges us to draw up a sound inventory of what we need, and how we can provide for it, and also to take account of the interests of the citizens in the immediate vicinity, before we start making plans for new Parliament buildings.
I would thank the Bureau for all its efforts and I hope that the planned hearing will lead to positive results, also with regard to the conservation of the quaint little station.
It is important to put forward great visions, but it is just as important to face up to the practical implications of these.
Mr President, I would firstly like to apologise to the House because I must leave, since I have obligations in my capacity as Vice-President in a few minutes time and I will not therefore be able to attend the whole of the debate.
The report which I have just had the honour of presenting deals with an important contribution to the Community' s budgeting and programming system.
We had an agreement, based on the joint declaration of 20 July 2000, in which we established a system for programming and verifying the activities of the Commission in relation to the Financial Perspectives.
Its objective was to serve as a guide for the decisions of the Budgetary Authority, offer a vision of the margins available in each heading, taking account of the contributions already approved during the codecision procedure, and facilitating the application of the new assessment procedure originating from the aforementioned joint declaration.
We are now in an important financial year and, for the first time - we will thank the Commission for this - it offers us this opportunity to see the programming of Headings 3 and 4, in relation to our activities.
There is an issue which interests us, a very methodological issue, on how to plan, in the future, the programmes which are already under way, and there is just one point which interests us: for certain programmes, for certain budget lines, future inflation is included, by means of what the Commission calls a budgetary deflater, and, in our opinion, it ought to be a budgetary inflater.
There is a technical contradiction here.
The Financial Perspectives are expressed in standard euros, while the programming works in current euros for each year.
The result is that we do not really know, when we reach an agreement, what value we may have for the previous year because it will depend on real inflation.
Anybody who has been a trade unionist knows that one can lie through statistics in many ways and this is one of them - by mixing current prices with standard prices; and I will not therefore insist on this.
I am going to give you an example - by hiding future inflation in the framework programme, the Commission reaches the conclusion that, according to its figures, between 2002 and 2006, we will have an increase in annual contributions of 14.3%.
Inflation is hiding the fact that, basically, we really only have an increase of 4.9%. This is the real increase.
The rest, which brings it up to 14%, is inflation. That is what we do not like.
The other day, the Commission told the Committee on Budgets that, with the euro, inflation is dead. Praise the Lord!
I accept that, but I am from the school of Saint Thomas and prefer, when it comes to these things, to see before believing.
When I have seen that inflation has disappeared, I will accept the removal of this type of differentiation between standard prices and current prices and, therefore, this is the main issue from our point of view.
All the rest of the Commission' s work we believe to be excellent.
Our concern is really to prevent a situation where, through this technique, the higher real inflation is, the greater the margin available will be.
It makes no sense and therefore our request, included in the motion for a resolution, is very simple: if it suits the Commission to continue working, for whatever reason, in terms of current euros, it should do so, but the information it offers Parliament must also be expressed in standard euros.
This is the key point of our report.
As for everything else, I would like to thank the Commission for the effort it has made to offer us this information for the first time.
Mr President, I am a somewhat unexpected rapporteur for this report.
The report is in my name because the person who has done all the work on this, the standing rapporteur for the financial perspective, Mr Colom i Naval, decided after a lot of consideration that he could not present it to Parliament.
I know his reasons why. I have spoken to him about them.
I can respect those reasons but I am somewhat saddened that he is not giving this report instead of me.
For the last three years the flexibility instrument has been the main aspect of the budget and it has overshadowed everything else.
On this occasion we are using it for two programmes, as has been said by speakers before me.
I do not have to outline what that is, but I have to outline one small problem which we have not yet resolved, that is, how the remaining money - the EUR 27 million for the reconversion of the Spanish fisheries fleet - will be found for the budget after next year.
That remains an issue on which I am sure the Commission will be creative and inventive when it comes to next year's budget - to make sure that money can be found, because it is certainly expected.
When the interinstitutional agreement was agreed, the flexibility instrument was one of the items which was reluctantly agreed by both sides - reluctantly from our side because there was a lot of resistance to the IIA anyway.
Do not forget that it was passed in this Parliament by a simple majority, not by a qualified majority.
That was an issue in itself.
The Council did not really like this idea anyway.
If I remember correctly it was the Commission that proposed it as a way out of the impasse.
It is a good job that it was proposed because it has 'saved our bacon' for the last three years.
In the first instance it was the great debate on how to fund Kosovo.
The Council did not want to use it and we went to the wire, if you can remember that famous occasion in this Chamber when we each had two voting lists.
Then last year it was on how to fund Serbia.
That in itself was a problem and now on this occasion we have how to fund the reconversion of the fisheries fleet and also the cross-border initiatives.
These last three years have shown the creaking structure of the financial perspective.
I am sure that this is a point that Mr Colom i Naval would have made.
We have a situation where the financial perspective has great problems with heading 3, heading 4 and certainly heading 5.
Unless Parliament and Council begin to get some sort of agreement on how to fund these categories in the future, the consequences will be there for all to see.
It is the consequences of pre-enlargement.
It is not necessarily enlargement itself.
The preparations for pre-enlargement will be as big a headache as the enlargement issue itself.
We also have the needs of Afghanistan, or perhaps I should say the unknown needs of Afghanistan.
What are we going to do about that?
What are we going to do if we get a hoped-for peace agreement in the Middle East?
Where is that money going to come from?
There is no room at present in heading 4.
I have heard rumours that the Commission may be proposing an extra flexibility instrument for heading 4.
If it does, it will be a welcome addition, but whether it would be agreed by the Council is a different matter.
This head-in-the-sand attitude cannot prevail if we are trying to be serious about how we manage the Union's budget and the taxpayers' expenses in the future.
The negotiations with the Belgian presidency at the second conciliation were 100% better than the first conciliation, which was a waste of time, as I made known last time.
At least this time it was good to do business with the Belgians, as it was last time when I was general rapporteur for the 1994 budget.
There are areas where we have our differences, such as in heading 3 where we have always had difficulties.
In heading 5, one of the main areas where we differ is in our support for the Commission on the reform programme, especially on the establishment plan and the posts that are needed.
However, whilst we have agreed on the establishment plan, the Committee on Budgets voted for one third of those posts in reserve, albeit by a one-vote majority.
The coordinators and the rapporteur are working very hard to try to ensure that we can get a position which will deliver a qualified majority on Thursday because if we do not, we may end up with the Council's position which would not aid the Commission's reform process as we would want it to do.
I have seen the letter that Commissioners Schreyer, Kinnock and de Palacio have written, where they state that the conditions for release of the reserve have been met.
If I was not the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I would say that I agree with those sentiments, but since I am the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I could not possibly say any such thing.
I would like you to know that hopefully, between the vote on Thursday and the not-too-distant future, we can all be in a position where we can see the Commission's proposals coming to fruition and we can get on with the job of making Europe the place that the citizens expect it to be and not associated with the great mystique that it represents for too many of them right now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s annual report on Trans-European Networks provides a general outlook on Community assistance in the three main areas of TENs (transport, energy and telecommunications), which are financed either through the general Union budget or through other Community sources such as the EIB and the Cohesion Fund.
I believe that, overall, it is a good report, if one also takes into account the fact that 1999 was a pivotal year for this sector, in fact, 1999 saw the modification of the financial regulation, the approval of the financial framework for 2000-2006 and the creation of ISPA; this year, 50% of the funding was devoted to transport infrastructure works and the emergence of Galileo as a new and priority TEN project.
This does not mean, however, that there are no criticisms to be levelled at the Commission; these derive above all from the type of report it has given us and not from the implementation of the Trans-European Networks.
The first criticism I intend to make about the report concerns the lack of references to the qualitative development of TEN projects.
Very often, the initiation and completion of projects have taken much longer than expected because of procedural differences and a lack of coordination.
In several cases, Member States have had different priorities, while the notion of public or private partnership is not yet well developed.
In future, therefore, the Commission should attach additional information on the projects to its reports, such as, for instance, the original plans, timetables and the results achieved.
This would, first and foremost, increase transparency and thus also permit more effective and productive monitoring of the situation.
Secondly, the financial evaluation of TENs should include information on funding through local, regional and national budgets and also through private resources, since roughly 80% of the total funds comes from these sources.
It would thus be possible to obtain an overall view of the state of funding and to check that the commitments undertaken by Member States are maintained.
Thirdly, I believe that the financial resources available for TENs are too limited in view of the continual challenges faced by the transport sector.
The percentage of TEN activities funded by the general budget is constantly falling, while EIB loans cover more than three-quarters of the funding in this sector, and this is highlighted.
My view is that the funding package for transport TENs should be reviewed and adapted to actual needs, especially in light of the reductions in other sectors, such as the environment.
Lastly, I believe we must properly address the problem of road traffic, the constant increase in which runs contrary to the objectives that were proposed when TENs were created.
I think this is due to a lack of cross-border cooperation, which necessarily undermines the interoperability and promotion of rail networks.
To get round this problem it will, I think, be necessary to gradually shift the emphasis away from the Essen priority projects and national infrastructure projects towards transit and cross-border projects, so as to strengthen the policy of sustainable transport and promote integration between different modes of transport.
In conclusion, I should also like to mention the budget that we are about to vote on.
I believe we have come to the end of two not inconsiderable political problems which reflect the additional needs which have emerged in view of the changed international situation.
In second reading, we have left an ample margin for assistance to Afghanistan and neighbouring regions, and with the Council we have agreed on the figure of EUR 488 million for cooperation with developing countries in Asia.
Once again, then, we have given evidence of our political sensitivity and lent our support to the common foreign and security policy.
It was unthinkable that the Union might absent itself at a time like this, and it was also unthinkable that Parliament might default after the explicit request by the Council.
This does not, however, mean that everything is fine and that no criticisms should be made.
Nevertheless, I must especially congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, as well as all the Secretariat staff who have helped and supported us through both good and difficult moments.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the result of the budget negotiations that we have before us is self-evident.
During the period of the budget negotiations, that is to say from the time the preliminary draft budget was submitted to the present day, many new demands on the EU budget have arisen.
World events, the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the war in Afghanistan, and the crisis in the Middle East have all given rise to new budgetary requirements.
The crises in the agricultural sector that we have witnessed this year have meant new budget requirements in the coming year, and the public's changing expectations also need to be reflected.
Together, we have succeeded in adapting the 2002 budget to these new challenges and given how often the European Union is criticised, we should make sure that this positive outcome is heard loud and clear.
We have succeeded, and this is thanks to the well-balanced and reconciliatory way in which you, Mr Costa Neves, have approached the negotiations, and we wish to thank you very sincerely for that.
We have also succeeded because of the exacting approach of the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, who also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, and we have succeeded because of the skilful way in which the negotiations were conducted at the crucial point by the President-in-Office - by you, Mr Vande Lanotte - and I would like to sincerely thank all of you, together with the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Colom i Naval, the entire committee, and also you, Mr Turchi, on behalf of the entire Commission, for this very fruitful cooperation.
I would also like to mention Mr SeppÃ€nen.
He had the historic task of presenting the report on the last budget of the European Coal and Steel Community.
And we can also describe the level of the EU budget as well-nigh historical, that is to say the EU budget share.
The budget as a proportion of Europe's GNP is lower for next year than at any time during the 1990s.
It will amount to only 1.03% of Europe's GNP.
The EU budget is accordingly EUR 4.6 billion lower than the amount provided for next year in the financial perspective.
EUR 4.6 billion is almost 5% of the entire budget, or to put it another way, it was envisaged in the financial perspective that the budget for 2002 might be 5% higher than is now actually being agreed.
I am stressing this point firstly because it reflects the budgetary discipline that prevails at European level, and, Mr President-in-Office, because the EU budget is therefore below the average growth rate for budgets in the Member States.
That is also worth emphasising.
Secondly, this result also demonstrates that scope for action has been created to allow the EU to take on new financial tasks, and I am referring here, in particular, to the debate on the costs of enlargement.
That therefore means that Europe, the European budget, is prepared to assume new tasks.
Aid to Afghanistan for peaceful future development of that country is a new task for which the European Union should, and will, assume responsibility.
An initial provision has been made for this in the 2002 budget, with EUR 130 million in addition to the funds already earmarked for humanitarian aid.
This is a positive result, particularly in view of the fact that it would be disastrous if we were to reduce our commitment to the Balkans.
That cannot be allowed to happen, and for that reason the same amount is being made available for the Balkans as this year, with a part being brought forward to the end of the current budget year.
Further aid is also needed for Palestine.
Together with other donors, we are making good some of the loss of income that the Palestinian Autonomy Authority has suffered because Israel is holding back tax and customs receipts because of the escalation of the conflict.
The use of this money in Palestine is subject to strict controls.
It is supervised by the International Monetary Fund, and there are no indications that this money is being misused to purchase arms.
That would of course be totally unacceptable.
The European Union is supporting public health and it is supporting education.
We want to use our contributions to give the peace process a chance.
That is our aim, I am very glad that at yesterday's Council press conference the Minister, Mr Perez stressed that Israel, too, regards financial support for Palestine as being important.
The European Union is in the process of shouldering more responsibility on the world political scene, and that is a good thing.
This involves a greater commitment to civil crisis management, which in turn requires financial means and, as you know, and as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets has stressed once again, the budgetary rules are such that funds released elsewhere cannot simply be used for additional expenditure on external policy.
Of the EUR 4.6 billion that the 2002 budget will be below the amount provided for next year in the financial perspective, we cannot just use EUR 400 or 500 million for coping with external policy crises.
Nor can we simply use money from the budget surplus to finance new requirements.
That is why the Commission has proposed that by means of an agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, an extra reserve should be created for additional external policy actions, and I believe that this is in fact the ideal way to avoid unravelling the financial perspective whilst still addressing the new challenges facing the Community in a Community-oriented way. It would be a good thing if the Laeken Council could also express its support for this approach.
A new feature of the 2002 budget is the commitment of funds for measures in the area of judicial cooperation, including the development of the new information system for Schengen and for Eurojust.
The Commission's estimate of funds for this area is something quite new.
Another new item is the programme to restructure the Spanish and to some extent the Portuguese fishing fleets which up to now have been able to fish in Morocco's waters.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the budgetary authority accepts the Commission's proposal both with regard to the level of this special programme - EUR 197 million - and also concerning the specific shape of the programme and the proposal to finance it by mobilising the flexibility instrument.
The compromise solution of making additional funds available in the 2002 budget for the regions bordering the candidate countries was really not easy to achieve.
However, the compromise of entering part of the additional amount in the 2003 budget for these two requirements is acceptable, and I can assure you that the Commission will make the necessary financial proposals for 2003, so that the funds for the programme to restructure the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets will be available.
It is now up to Spain and the border regions to implement the programmes being allocated additional funds as rapidly as possible, and the Commission will support this.
I say this because it is evident that the public and the fishing industry in Spain expect this now, as do small and medium-sized enterprises in the border regions.
Parliament has this year once again very strongly supported the Commission's reform process during the discussions on the budget.
I would like to express the Commission's heartfelt thanks for this.
However, I nevertheless wish to touch on one point, and a very important one at that, regarding the reserve for the 105 new posts envisaged up to now.
In the Committee on Budgets you agreed two conditions for lifting this reserve. The first is that the Commission should bring forward a proposal for a permanent early retirement scheme.
The Commission has already included this in its guidelines for personnel policy, and will consult on a proposal for amending the statute.
The second condition was better matching of budgetary decisions and the Commission's work programme. This was also the subject of this morning's debate, and the Commission undertakes that, as from next year, it will present the most important initiatives with an impact on the budget at an earlier stage.
I can also assure you personally that I will support this request for the budgetary implications for the coming year of new legislative proposals to be made clear at the appropriate stage of the budget process.
I hope that we will also reach a satisfactory outcome on this point.
Two thousand and two is an important year for agricultural policy.
The interim review of the agricultural policy has to be presented.
Next year the agricultural budget will rise by only 0.5%, which is less than the average, and that is despite the fact that, for example, there is EUR 400 million in the budget for the reimbursement of expenditure to Member States because of foot and mouth disease and that a total of EUR 8 billion is available for the beef sector.
The reform process, the mid-term review, not only has a financial dimension, it is also about setting objectives in agricultural policy, and the second pillar, the promotion of rural development, has an important role to play here.
However, with regard to the Sapard programme of pre-accession aid for agriculture, the Commission still considers that the proposal for a new programme is not the right way to go.
Two thousand and two will also be a very important year for the enlargement of the European Union.
Negotiations should be concluded for the countries that have made the greatest progress, and in concrete terms this means that budget-related negotiations on agricultural policy, structural policy and on the budget itself will be completed.
The Council intends to have determined its common negotiating position for the budget chapter by the end of next June.
The budget chapter is, of course, the crowning achievement of the accession negotiations.
The Commission has already agreed to present a proposal that will not go beyond the amounts set in Agenda 2000 for new Member States for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.
That was also laid down in the interinstitutional agreement.
The Commission accordingly expects to receive the support of the budgetary authority for no more and no less than these annual amounts being made available.
Two thousand and two is also the year in which the convention on the reform of the European treaties will start its work.
We are now virtually on the eve of the Laeken Summit and of having to agree the programme of work for the convention.
An important subject for the future to be dealt with by the convention will be the Parliament's budget rights.
The outcome of the 2002 budget negotiations is evident and this outcome will once again enable the challenges to be met.
Nevertheless, it should be clear for the future that the European Parliament finally deserves full budget rights.
This is a touchstone for the democratic development of the European Union.
Mr President, I should like to inform the House that an agreement was reached on the European arrest warrant at the end of the meeting between Prime Minister Verhofstadt and Prime Minister Berlusconi.
Italy will sign the proposal, but the measures needed to change the Italian Constitution have been referred to the Italian Parliament, because, as certain emeritus judges of the constitutional court have observed, the European arrest warrant conflicts with the Constitution.
The Italian Prime Minister has therefore asked Parliament itself to amend the Constitution.
The press conference at which the news will be given is just starting.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
This is good news for everyone.
Mr President, I would like to thank the general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Costa Neves, for the efforts he has made to achieve a balanced and reasonable budget which respects the competences and prerogatives of this Parliament.
We now have to ensure maximum efficiency in its management and I therefore call on the European Commission to spend the money in a balanced fashion between all geographical areas, since I do not believe it is correct to undermine the priorities set by the European Parliament by redistributing appropriations at the end of the financial year.
To this end, the Commission clearly needs to be provided with the necessary human resources, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs has asked, particularly with regard to the management of external aid, for the Commission to have those human resources which will allow it to carry out the efficient management we are referring to.
Finally, Mr President, I share the concern expressed by other Members, because, in order to fund new priorities in subsequent financial years, new resources will be required, so as not to jeopardise the European Union' s external action commitments.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who is nearly at the end of the second reading.
I need to remind him, from a control point of view that we anticipate and look forward to him taking a keen interest in how the budget is implemented by the Commission next year and how he drives it forward from there.
The Committee on Budgetary Control tabled a number of amendments to the budget to gain extra information and evaluations from the Commission.
We are actually getting somewhere this year. It is a tactic we have decided to use in future years as well.
We would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets for allowing us to have a say on transfers, in which we are particularly interested.
Finally, I thank the rapporteur again for taking a keen interest in the amendment concerning the European Court of Auditors.
We on the committee will be looking at this carefully because we understand that the Court of Auditors will be coming to us for more money, staff and resources in the future.
We are very interested to see how this year's situation develops over the course of 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, I would also like to congratulate the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves.
I also want to offer congratulations and thanks to all my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets.
It is a rare privilege - and I can measure its worth as a committee rapporteur - to be able to say that the Committee on Budgets accepted all the demands we had made, they were, of course, legitimate and carefully considered, and which were put forward in Parliament at second reading.
So I want to thank the general rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Budgets.
That said, I would like to address the Council more directly, address the intelligence of the Council, if I dare put it that way, knowing that Mr Vande Lanotte is bound to understand what I mean.
Four years ago, the European Parliament proposed setting up a European fund for refugees, an idea that the Council angrily struck off the list at second reading.
No European refugee fund.
Four years have passed and now the Council has just proposed more money than we ourselves had even asked for the European refugee fund it had refused to create.
It took the Council all of four years to understand, to become responsible and, with respect, to show some intelligence.
Another example: for several years now we have included a Schengen list at the budget' s first reading, because for several years we have wanted some of its aspects to be communitised and financed from the Community budget.
Each year the Council would angrily strike off the Schengen heading at second reading.
This time, the Council needs the Schengen heading we had introduced because it has to finance SIS II and has decided to finance it on a Community basis.
That brings me to the third problem.
We decided - Parliament did so at first reading and will do so at second reading - to vote to enter EUR 5 million under the Europol heading to combat terrorism.
The Council did not accept this at second reading.
I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to do the impossible and to create the necessary legal basis and agreements.
I would ask it to use this money without waiting four years, because the terrorists for their part will not wait that long.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to make a number of basic points with regard to the agencies.
The decision to deal with the agencies on an individual basis was an important one.
I have very carefully read through the amendments proposed by the specialised committees, and to those of you who sit on them I would therefore like to send out a signal.
I ask you, firstly, to take a close look at the agencies with a view to seeing whether or not they work well, and then read the report of the Court of Auditors.
Something else, too, about the new agencies.
I think policy is tending in the direction of creating even more agencies, something, which also appears to be the Commission's strategy.
In general terms, this is not to be rejected out of hand, but it becomes objectionable when it comes to finance, as the Commission does not include their funds in the calculations.
So if, in future, the Commission or the agencies, as the case may be, come wanting more resources, then heading 3 will not be able to take the strain.
I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs on their budget reports and thank them for the collaborative approach that they have adopted.
We have had a tough budgetary procedure especially in relation to the priorities of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
This will present my committee with problems in meeting obligations on a number of programmes.
These programmes are not just crucial to achieving a dynamic knowledge - based Europe but, in the light of the tough current economic climate that the European businesses and organisations are facing, our key to achieving our aims of creating new jobs and supporting businesses.
However, I appreciate the constraints that we are working under and, as someone who in the past has emphasised the need for prudence, efficiency and economy, I know that my committee will do its utmost to deliver growth and prosperity for the EU.
The issues that I really want to raise concern the implementation of the budget.
First, there is the Commission habit of ignoring some of the priorities of this budget authority and I want to give you an example from my committee in relation to the synergy programme.
It is a small programme, but nevertheless an important one.
However, it did not actually suit the particular director-general to implement this programme last year and so it was just ignored because they believed it did not have a big enough impact.
Secondly, there is the use of transfers, which I believe are open to misuse because often these happen very late in the budgetary process and the Commission will transfer money from areas which are priorities for Parliament to those that are priorities for them.
We must have mechanisms in place to stop this recurring year on year.
Thirdly, there is the lack of synchronisation between the budgetary process and the launch of legislative programmes.
It makes a mockery of the budgetary process and the authorities when you have the launch of the budgetary process in February and the launch of the legislative programme in November.
Very quickly, I wish to move on to the other institutions budgets.
This concentrates largely on preparations for enlargement.
I understand that Parliament has made plans for new buildings to incorporate the new Member States.
However, if we are increasing buildings in Brussels, it is important that we learn from the lessons from Strasbourg and that we do not make the same mistakes as we did with this building which generated a lot of negative publicity and reflected very badly on Parliament.
Therefore, for the future, it is important that we have a clear explanation of what these buildings are going to be used for and that these buildings are environmentally friendly, user-friendly and cater for people with disabilities.
I must express surprise that we are already negotiating on new buildings in the absence of major decisions in a variety of areas including the language regime.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate both rapporteurs on the result achieved and also on the speeches they gave here this afternoon.
However, I have to admit that I still feel slightly resentful about the Council' s result.
I am pleased with the final, positive result, but on the other hand, why did the Council present such an unacceptable initial proposal?
It truly seemed as if the members of the Council were, once again, behaving like little boys running riot with cap pistols, as I expressed it a number of years ago.
Fortunately, everything got straightened out, for we would have had major problems with the whole of the budget on account of heading 3.
I really fail to understand how the Council dares present proposals of this kind.
In my opinion, we have made a rather considerable concession with regard to payments.
I believe that we should monitor this more closely in future.
The Council seems to have taken an interest in this, and it may be wise to be a little less generous next time than we were this year. But that is a matter for next year.
I should like to highlight that, in future, we will be extremely short of cash in Headings 3, 4 and 5.
We subscribe to what the Commissioner referred to, namely how relatively little the Union is currently spending.
We must, of course, also bear in mind that as soon as new Member States join, the outlook will change immediately.
We are therefore putting some savings away for the future.
Another point which causes great concern, in my view, is the Council' s attitude towards projects which could improve employment.
The issue surrounding Galileo springs to mind, which has caused great difficulty.
All other points which cost money from the EU budget and which can contribute to better economic performances in the coming year - and there are quite a few of those - have been systematically discouraged, and if we do not sufficiently appreciate this, we will really end up in a recession.
If we see what the Americans are currently doing, how much money they are prepared to pour into their recession, we do not have to copy all of this, but we can move slightly in that direction and manage our funds wisely.
Mr President, I again would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission and even, to some extent, the Council for the work they have done this year.
This has been a budget procedure which has so far run with remarkable smoothness.
We recognise the pressures on the budget - whether it is the Balkans, Palestine, enlargement, Afghanistan or the demand for action in new fields of activity.
Balancing these pressures has been quite a performance, particularly on behalf of the Commission, and for that we say thank you.
In those sectors that are the concern of the Environment Committee I particularly welcome the establishment of frameworks and long-term funding regimes which have certainly stabilised our work in the area of consumers.
I welcome the developing framework in the area of health where it is certainly going to encourage the development of steady progress in that field.
It is equally important to say that those kind of stable funding regimes assist our work enormously.
I am pleased that they have been, in the most part, respected.
I also welcome the decision that was going to be taken, but has not, not to withdraw money from the Life Programme for the environmental projects that are so important.
We can only develop our work in guaranteeing the future rights of the consumer, the health of the public and the safe, clean environment if we put our money where our mouth is and spend the cash that is needed.
Mr President, my warm thanks to Mr Costa Neves, Mr Wynn and all the members of Parliament's team in the conciliation negotiations. There was nothing else to be done.
The Commission's amending letter being as modest as it was, one could hardly build up anything great on it.
As we know how little room there is for change when it comes to compulsory expenditure in the agricultural sector, I think we have to give you credit for having fought and won a few points.
I would like to single out one point, one, which makes very clear the dilemma as regards the agricultural budget.
We all know that our hands are more or less tied when it comes to compulsory expenditure, that they are tied, too, when it comes to outlining compulsory expenditure and thus outlining the common agricultural policy.
Where we could make headway - the second pillar, which is a no more substantial beanstalk than it was before, where we have more obligations than we can meet - we are unable to transfer funds from the compulsory expenditure.
Our self-imposed captivity must at some point come to an end.
Not for the first time, I claim for Parliament not only the unhindered right to set a Budget, but also I claim for it the full right of co-decision in the area of the common agricultural policy.
If these rights are not granted to us, then this dilemma will remain unresolved.
Mr President the reform of the common fisheries policy on 1 January 2003 will change this important economic sector for the better.
Of that I am convinced.
It was for that reason that the committee did not want to bring in any new Budget lines at the present time, with the exception of the flexibility reserve because of the Morocco disaster, which has been a heavy blow for the fisheries sector and raised many issues.
We did, though, seek a few small changes.
A: on food safety, especially with regard to genetic engineering, where there is an urgent need for scientific underpinning.
B: on the monitoring of fishing activity.
We need rigid controls and, perhaps, financial sanctions to deal with the black sheep.
C: genuinely to include the sector in discussions and in the legislative measures in accordance with the bottom-up principle.
Dialogue must be put on a formal basis.
To sum up: We thank the Commissioners and in particular Mr Costa Neves for their constructive and wise collaboration.
The Committee on Fisheries felt itself to be in good hands.
We wish to maintain fisheries for our benefit and for the benefit of the generations that will come after us.
I seem to have another minute to go, so I would like to touch on another subject.
I refer to Mr Turchi and Mr Prodi's statements about Galileo this morning.
I appeal to all of you not to block the road to further development.
Mr Dover, the amendments proposed to Mr Turchi's report on TEN 1999, above all by our British colleagues, should be rejected.
The justification for them is false, as the enterprises had, in a 'Memorandum of understanding' , taken a positive line on their financial participation as early as the beginning of 2001, without the political will having been present at that time.
Mr Dover, please think of the many jobs involved, as Mr Prodi has done.
Mr President, I am now focussing just on sport, or more accurately, its absence from the draft budget that has been adopted by the Council.
A statement has been made in many consecutive summits, most recently at Nice, on the social importance of sport.
Despite that, sport is hardly taken into consideration in the work of the Union.
The situation has become more critical as, unfortunately, the EU had to withdraw from WADA funding.
The Committee on Budgets has repeated the proposal by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which was agreed in Parliament' s first reading, for an appropriation of five million euros for preparatory actions for a Community policy in the field of sport.
The appropriation would be used, for example, to help the work of sports associations to prevent exclusion amongst youth. I hope that the motion will receive Parliament' s support in the vote on Thursday.
It would also be very much in harmony with preparations for the physical education theme year.
Mr President, my speaking time is limited, but I nonetheless want to address a couple of important issues.
There has definitely been a breakthrough this year in the area of aid, on which I have been working.
We have reached an agreement with the Commission both on how the reporting is to take place and on the direction our assistance is to take in the future.
I would thank the Commission for the constructive spirit in which our discussions have been conducted.
Parliament' s scrutiny and control of aid money will substantially increase.
The conditions are now much better than they previously were for bringing order and method into an activity which is unfortunately often characterised by anything but those qualities.
The fact that the Commission has accepted as a benchmark that a third of the aid must be used as social assistance also definitely represents progress.
The agreement guarantees greater focus upon programmes and activities of special importance in combating poverty.
I also wish, of course, to thank Mr Costa Neves for the way in which he has taken care of the work.
His approach to a very difficult job has been characterised by openness, friendliness and efficiency.
Mr President, Commissioner, the report presented by the Committee on Women' s Rights was approved by Parliament at first reading, practically in its entirety.
A new line, A-3037 N, was added to the amendments in this report, for women' s organisations which do not belong to the European lobby, but which do effective work for the equality and promotion of women.
Both this and certain other proposals by the Committee on Women' s Rights have been removed by the Council, and therefore Parliament, making use of the rights afforded it by the Treaties, since they are not obligatory expenses, is presenting them once again for approval.
We are thereby acting coherently, presenting the amendments which Parliament approved on first reading.
Amongst these amendments I must also highlight line B5-331, Information Society, which is so important for the future, especially for women and their full incorporation into the labour market.
I would lastly like to warmly thank Mr Costa Neves for the very important work he has done and his sensitivity in responding to the needs we had raised.
I hope that the House will approve it by a large majority, because, as you all know, since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, all Community programmes must include the objective of promoting women and achieving greater equality, not only in the European Union, but also in the countries with which we have cooperation agreements, particularly in the Euro-Mediterranean area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft budget for 2002, both in its Commission section and in the sections relating to the other institutions, deals directly with the financial challenges of enlargement.
The two rapporteurs have budgeted for the structural, administrative and logistical needs which the immense challenge of enlargement will very soon present us with.
For 2002 we are basically faced with two new structural needs originating from the Nice Summit and not foreseen in Berlin.
The first one is caused by the failure of a Community policy, the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which obliges us to convert part of Portugal and Spain' s fishing fleets, with the great social impact of that conversion on many regions of those countries.
The other structural need derives from the very fact that enlargement is imminent.
We must respond to the needs of the border regions of the Union, whose competitiveness is being weakened by the imminent application of the freedom of circulation of persons, goods and services.
I would like to highlight the fact that the great majority of this Parliament understood both structural needs and supported a joint solution from the outset.
However, it has not been simple to respond to both demands.
Until the conciliation meeting of 21 November it was not possible to agree on a satisfactory solution, and that means living with an excessive degree of risk.
It is therefore very important that we improve the degree of implementation of the appropriations agreed.
Issues such as the entry into force of automatic failed commitments and the achievement of a level of payments which allows for the absorption of the leftovers are priorities which this Parliament is happy to have obtained.
We do not know which new structural needs we will have to deal with between now and 2006 and a degree of flexibility is therefore necessary within the spending categories, while always respecting the principle of maintaining the current financial perspectives which are now entering the third year of their difficult and eventful life.
This acceptance of the financial framework must not, however, lead us to forget how tight it is.
This year Afghanistan and the Middle East are the issues which have once again created tension within heading 4.
The problem is not the ends, but rather the means used by the Council to achieve them.
Nobody disputes the needs of Afghanistan and the Middle East, as well as other international crises which may arise.
But this Parliament does not agree with the Council' s way of doing things.
The Council is once again making financial commitments in external policy without taking account of Parliament' s political priorities, and furthermore it is doing so with non-obligatory expenses, which complicates even further the task of those Members who want to maintain the current financial framework.
We would ask the Council whether it is really so difficult to establish a prior consultation system for external priorities in heading 5?
We take very good note of the words of the Commissioner on the possibility of improving the suitability of the legislative and budgetary procedures during next year and we truly welcome what he has said.
I would like to congratulate Carlos Costa Neves and also Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg, as well as Francesco Turchi on his report on the Trans-European networks.
We would also like to congratulate Terence Wynn on his work as chairman.
We believe that Commissioner Schreyer has found a good ally in this Parliament and that we have received good help from the Commissioner.
We believe that it has been a good marriage of interests.
I would finally like to thank the Council for making the most difficult thing look easy, and that is being here when necessary.
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves, Mrs Buitenweg etc.
They have not only sought broad solutions within Parliament but have also persistently maintained our positions in relation to the Council, something which has been especially important.
I also want to thank the Council and the Commission.
We have sometimes been critical about the forms, especially in connection with the first conciliation, but we nonetheless came up with a constructive approach in the end.
It has been possible to solve a number of difficult issues.
It is, of course, incredibly important that we have been able to produce substantial additional aid for Afghanistan, given the enormous needs that exist.
Personally, I am delighted that we have been able to direct a portion of this aid to women' s involvement in constructing the future Afghanistan.
In the same way, there is satisfaction to be found in the fact that we came up with solutions both for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets and for aid to the border regions.
In spite of the fact that work on the budget has, then, proceeded well, we see a number of problems for the future.
One of the biggest problems is that the EU budget is not flexible enough.
Each year, we are witness to events in the world around us which require the EU to contribute resources without delay.
In 2000, this was the case with Kosovo and in 2001 with Serbia, and now this year it is the case with Afghanistan.
We have released funds for these unexpected situations, for example through the flexibility mechanism, but the process has been extremely difficult.
Now, moreover, we are seeing its shortcomings for, this year, we had to use the flexibility mechanism for other, heading-2, aid.
When, at the same time, a crisis like that in Afghanistan occurs, the problem becomes clear.
Obviously, we ought, therefore, seriously to discuss the approach laid down in the interinstitutional agreement, namely that of revising the ceiling in the budget.
The Council is steadfastly saying no to this, in spite of our having a budget, large amounts of which are never used.
The problem, then, is that all that Parliament can do is account for every single krona in the budget, right up to the ceiling, and not allow for any margins for unforeseen events, or else cut back on other of its high priorities and thus let recipients of aid in other parts of the world in practice pay for our new needs in the Balkans or Afghanistan.
We can naturally solve such a dilemma once, perhaps even twice, but when such initiatives tend to become permanent and when the situations in Kosovo, Serbia or Afghanistan give rise to multiannual programmes that pile up without the other needs disappearing, then the situation becomes untenable in the end.
I believe that one of the major issues for next year will be that of finding new ways to increased flexibility.
I therefore welcome the Commission' s ideas as a starting point for this discussion and hope that the Council will show a corresponding open-mindedness.
Another fundamental error is, of course, the poor implementation of the EU' s budget.
We have now launched a number of new methods, which are not only about increasing payments. Instead, we are trying to identify those areas we think of as lagging abnormally behind.
We are trying to specify what is required of the implementation profile. We have conducted extensive discussions as to which services are required if we are to be able to implement initiatives in different policy areas.
Finally, we have also, as Mr Wijkman pointed out, launched a new benchmarking method in the area of aid. These are important areas of progress, but I believe that they need to be developed further in future if we are to be able to win back people' s confidence in how we handle taxpayers' money.
As next year's rapporteur, I naturally see a number of important areas that have to be worked through.
Enlargement is drawing ever nearer.
During the preparations, we must, quite simply, consider not only the short-term perspective but also the long-term perspective when enlargement seriously makes itself felt in the budget too.
Finally, we must also take a genuine look at reforming the Commission.
If we do not succeed in this - and it is not only a question of reviewing the regulations but, above all, of looking at evaluation, follow-up and how we use taxpayers' money - then I do not believe we shall succeed in changing people' s view of the EU.
We must have effective administration and make sure that people regain their confidence in the European Union.
That is one of the most important tasks for future work on the budget.
Mr President, first I would like to heartily congratulate and thank the budget' s main rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, with regard to his excellent draft budget and his constructive cooperation.
Likewise, I wish to thank the second budget rapporteur, Kathalijne Buitenweg, and also, in particular, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terrence Wynn, for his skilful and constructive leadership of the Committee.
The budget for 2002 now being debated is a moderate and disciplined one.
Appropriations have grown by just 2%, which is clearly below the figure for the financial perspectives.
The European Parliament has shown an enormous sense of responsibility, which our group values highly.
This budget is a considerable improvement on the Council' s first proposal.
The agricultural budget is realistic.
There are more funds available to cover outstanding commitments under categories 2 to 4, and there is a common call to use them to clear arrears.
The reform of the Commission proceeds, and any expenditure that should not in fact arise, has been cut.
We particularly appreciate the fact that no negative reserve, that is to say, no uncovered appropriation, has been adopted.
In the first reading of the budget some cuts were made to external actions, such as the western Balkans CARDS programme.
Now we have been able to prevent most of these cuts.
A total of 206.4 million euros is being proposed for the Balkans.
Furthermore, the CARDS programme had already been given 63 million euros out of this year' s budget transfers, so all in all the programme is returning to what was proposed in the Council' s draft budget.
This was immensely important for my group.
For the Commission' s reform 317 posts are being reserved, which guarantees that the reform will proceed. Of these, 105 are in reserve, and our group hopes that at least the majority of them may still be released.
A flexible instrument had to be adopted once again this year.
A compromise decision was reached on its use, according to which Spain and Portugal will see the structure of their fisheries fleets revitalised with the aid of 170 million euros, plus another 27 million in 2003.
Thirty million euros are to be spent on solving border problems associated with new Member States, with a further 15 million being spent on this next year.
Our group supports all these decisions.
Mr President, in the conciliation meeting between the Council and Parliament most of the time was spent discussing the use of a flexible instrument.
The Commission would have promised 197 million euros for the reconversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries fleets, which is a lot of money.
In the same connection, the Nordic countries are demanding 50 million euros to resolve problems on their eastern borders.
It was decided to finance these new needs with a flexible instrument under section 2, but over a period of two years.
This new interpretation of the use of a flexible instrument shows that if there is the political will to finance something, the rules can definitely be bent.
The EU does not have a money shortage.
That is evident from the financial statements for 2000.
Furthermore, there will be a surplus of billions for this current year.
There is 40 billion in outstanding commitments - the so-called 'RAL' s - in the accounts, and it is to be supposed that most of it will never be spent.
The Commission has saved money but it is questionable as to whether it has made any political decisions regarding savings.
As there are such huge budget surpluses, the Commission has not implemented those budget decisions Parliament has made.
To be perfectly frank, the Commission high-handedly invalidated the decisions of Parliament.
If the next EU year is evaluated from the point of view of the budget we might say that things are on an even keel, no rises and no falls.
There are no special areas of focus, only running costs are funded from the budget.
When the Council lacks the ambition to tackle the problem of unemployment, it also shows in the Commission' s draft budget; for that reason, our group takes a critical view of it.
Just a small detail, the Council has not wanted to end the transport of live animals over excessive distances.
The ill-treatment of transported animals continues, and the Council of Agricultural Ministers is to blame.
Mr President, there is an old Dutch saying which reads: 'wie wat bewaart die heeft wat' [waste not, want not].
This has proved invaluable time and again for those who have lived by it.
When we adopt the budget, it is crucial to set aside adequate reserves for unforeseen expenses.
This was illustrated yet again this year.
In this respect, the recent crisis in agriculture springs to mind in the first instance.
Unfortunately, the Commission has abandoned its plans for a reserve in the sum of EUR 1 billion in the compulsory agriculture expenditure.
In our view, the Commission' s argument for this U-turn borders on naivety and bears witness to a short-term view.
Even if expenditure in terms of arable crops, dairy products, sugar, olive oil and mutton turns out higher than expected, expenses are far higher where vinicultural products and cotton are concerned.
Our greatest frustration is the fact that BSE and foot and mouth no longer seem to feature in the Commission' s dictionary.
Mr GÃ¶rlach from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is right to remark on the underlying uncertainty as to the final end of the foot and mouth crisis in the United Kingdom and other Member States, as well as animal transports and the inconsistent vaccination policy.
Additionally, I share his fear that the BSE crisis is likely to be around for the foreseeable future.
The recent confirmation of a case in Austria speaks for itself.
How does the Commission intend to pay for unforeseen expenditure?
Will we once again have to fiddle with the ceilings agreed in Berlin?
The second point concerns the flexibility instrument.
It is striking that these resources, an annual amount of no less than EUR 200 million, have been fully used up ever since this instrument was created three years ago.
I do not call into question the validity of the spending objectives to obtain funding.
What bothers me is the financing method.
Why do budget headings not receive a thorough overhaul for unspent amounts and unprofitable budget lines?
This Parliament wants to be close to the citizen.
It should therefore act as any sensible citizen - if it wants to pay for something new, there will have to be economies elsewhere.
Mr President, negotiations with the Council were, yet again, not straightforward, but it is important that we were able eventually to come to an agreement on the question of the modernisation of the fishing fleet and on additional funds for the Member States' frontier regions.
The roles played by the Commission, and indeed also by some Members, were in our view not always transparent.
The acceding countries must not have large amounts of promotional funds made available to them whilst the frontier regions of our Member States get no additional funds at all.
These regions' economic situation is often not much better than that in the acceding countries.
The poor economic situation in the frontier regions of the Member States may well get even worse after the new countries join the EU, because differing levels of funding - almost all get Objective 1 funding - will greatly favour the frontier regions of the acceding countries, some of which already possess better transport infrastructure than is to be found in the frontier regions of the Member States.
As an example of this, I would mention the airport at Laibach in Slovenia, which is more modern and much better developed than the airport at Klagenfurt in Southern Austria.
The accession of the new states will, for the reasons I have mentioned, make it difficult, or almost impossible, to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the frontier regions of the Member States.
We must, though, be clear in our own minds that the citizens in these regions can hardly be in favour of the accession of new countries under these circumstances.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my thanks to Carlos, Kathalijne, Francesco, Esko, Joane and Terry.
It is they, of course, who have provided us with these documents for today' s debate, and I believe they have done an outstanding job.
The result we shall obtain from all of this will be a very good one.
Allow me at this point, I spoke out of turn last time, to address Mr Vande Lanotte, the representative of the Council.
After Mrs Parly last year, you are the second President of the Council whom I shall remember with profound gratitude.
If this trend continues in the coming years, if this level is consistently maintained, we shall yet manage to establish really close cooperation and mutual trust one of these days between the Council and Parliament.
Keep an eye on us, Commissioner - you must treat us better, otherwise you will suddenly find that we are far more in tune with them than with you.
The point I wish to put to the President-in-Office, however, concerns Laeken.
As I have already remarked, one of the things you will be discussing in Laeken, naturally enough, is the future structure of the European Union, and this discussion will not be confined to the question of a constitution in the sense of defining the structure and purpose of each component of the Union.
No, we must also talk about the way in which we can achieve a budget that is transparent in every respect.
It is impossible to explain to any of our citizens the fact that, having underspent various allocations by 4.6 billion euros, as the Commissioner said, we should be fighting for weeks and months here to obtain an extra 200 million or, when acute emergencies occur, that we actually have to push the entire budget back and forth to deal with them at the expense of our long-term strategies and basic political aims.
We have had to make a large amount available for Afghanistan this year, and indeed it is very important that the people there do not merely see Europe as an authority that comes to punish but that they also experience Europe as a helper coming to assist them in their development.
We have allocated aid to the fishing regions and aid to the border regions.
This, too, was very important, because it signalled to the world that we are taking the current changes seriously and that we are restructuring in response to them.
Allow me a brief remark in parenthesis. Time and again, as we all know, the cry from Bavaria has been that we need money for the border regions.
These are the selfsame Bavarians who, on other occasions, denounce the system of revenue redistribution among the LÃ€nder and who, in CDU and CSU papers on structural issues, advocate the scrapping of all structural aid.
On such occasions they turn round and demand a great deal more money.
I have been a very fervent supporter of assistance for border regions and shall continue to support it, but those who beat the drum with high-powered press releases must ask themselves whether this is a consistent way to act.
We also have fundamental matters to deal with.
We must forge ahead with the reform of the Commission, because we want a modern administrative system.
We must forge ahead on e-learning, one of the areas with the highest growth potential in a developing economic area like the European Union, not only because we want to grasp our economic opportunities but also because we want to avoid a split within our populations between those who can afford to acquire computers at a very early stage and those who are excluded from the information society.
We must cooperate more effectively in Europol and Eurojust to combat terrorism.
We cannot have a situation in which the criminals are driving Ferraris and the police are trying to chase them in Fiat Unos!
I mention these two makes of car deliberately, because they come from a certain country, a country that would do well to consider what it is doing to Europe at the present time.
In the domain of foreign policy too, we must agree to tackle important issues.
The Balkans must continue to receive attention.
So must the Mediterranean region.
But we must also heed the silent agony of the voiceless in the world.
This is why we have been active this year in the struggle against AIDS.
Silent agony, however, is easily neglected. We must keep closer watch.
We must not wait to be rocked by violent explosions in the world.
On the contrary, the European Union must become more sensitive, in cooperation with the regions of the world where our help is needed, especially to the need for food aid to ward off starvation but also to the need to help the countries in those regions to improve their administrative systems and infrastructure, thereby guaranteeing that those countries can develop by their own efforts in a manner which reflects credit on the quality and diligence of European cooperation with the rest of the world.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I wish to concentrate on a single point, namely the issue of the Commission' s reforms, which are of course an important priority, in this year' s budget too.
There have been quite a few speakers here today who have stated that there are things in the budget process that could be done better and that the institutions should in future work better together, even though this budget has proceeded very peacefully under the expert direction of Parliament' s Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg.
However, I also think that, in certain areas, we should give some thought to how we act in Parliament.
In next year' s budget, money has thus been set aside for early retirement and new appointments in order to ensure that the Commission obtains the right manpower for carrying out its tasks.
In Parliament, we have demanded information as a condition of the appropriations, and the Commission has, on several occasions, reported in detail on the staffing situation.
There is a majority in the Committee on Budgets that has wanted to place a large amount of money in reserve until further information has been provided.
I think we must be careful, in making our demands, that we are not too pedantic and do not require too much detail. Otherwise, we shall end up obstructing the reforms rather than promoting them.
We must, of course, ensure that taxpayers' money is managed efficiently and transparently, but I believe it is important for us to concentrate our attention more on results than on detailed management of the Commission' s administration, for that would not promote responsibility.
I think that we in Parliament should honour the obligingness and openness shown by the Commission and either release those items that are in the reserve or at least be content to keep a smaller amount in the reserve so that the Commission obtains reasonable conditions.
Mr President, from Brussels' point of view, the budget for 2002 is coherent and comprehensive, despite the criticisms made by the European Court of Auditors, which I have been examining with great interest.
The Berlin decisions still offer some scope, particularly since there is apparently no need to maintain the levy on the Member States at its present level.
In the implementation of the budget for 2002, I expect the structural support funds for the development of rural areas to be spent in full and all surplus revenue to be reduced to zero before or during the year 2006 if possible, by ensuring that eligible projects are realised within the shortest possible time frame. In response to another complaint that I hear time and again, I also expect guarantees that enough flexibility will be shown for projects to be replaced if necessary.
At the same time, I expect the Commission to reconsider carefully whether the intended lowering of the support rates for major investments in the least affluent areas is necessary and warranted.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first let me pay tribute to the presidency of the Council and to its cooperative approach to this year' s budget.
Naturally I also pay tribute to our rapporteurs and to the Commission for a budget that, in my view, is going in the right direction.
Nonetheless, I have three comments to make.
The first concerns the reform.
In this context I must say that I am most disappointed, we as a Parliament are most disappointed with the various episodes of these past days.
As the President, Mrs Schreyer, will know, I am not addressing her at this moment but the Commission in general, including its Vice-President Mr Kinnock. I think the kind of communication and exchanges of view we have seen over the past few days between the Commission and Parliament is not likely to help us take the decision we need to take this evening to unfreeze the budget items on reform, which is a pity.
I want to draw the attention of Members and in particular of the rapporteur to two points.
It seems to me that yesterday the General Affairs Council buried the 'European political parties' heading.
That means EUR 7 million are likely to be unusable for lack of a legal basis.
I would ask the rapporteur whether we could vote differently on Thursday.
Furthermore, in regard to the budget heading for north-south cooperation in combating drugs, the Commission has not really followed up that question.
A report that should have been drawn up is not there.
Here again we have entered money under this heading, which has no raison d' Ãªtre.
So I would ask you whether we could change the vote on Thursday and delete this heading.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is right firstly to express my gratitude, as previous speakers have done, for the work of Mrs Buitenweg, of the chairman of our committee and, especially, Mr Costa Neves.
The Union is at a decisive stage of its history, which must be accompanied by budgets which are suited to the challenges we are facing.
We must begin by acknowledging the fact that, if we want to promote the work of the Union and make it truly efficient, we should enter soon into a debate on the Union' s resources and the Community' s budgetary weight.
First of all, I should point out that throughout the difficult negotiation, which has ended with a positive agreement, progress has been made in resolving problems which go beyond a particular budgetary year.
The commitments made in the statements during the conciliation process represent a code of conduct which works in favour of transparency and greater efficiency in spending.
It is therefore important during the next six-month period, under the Spanish Presidency, which has declared its intentions with regard to the financial Regulation, to reach a definitive agreement on this fundamental piece of legislation.
We have responded to the problem created by the lack of a fisheries agreement with Morocco by compensating the Community fleets in Spain and Portugal and guaranteeing the funding of the necessary conversion and modernisation programmes both in the 2002 budget and in the current period, as the Commissioner has pointed out, and I thank her warmly for her commitment.
But it is also necessary for this Parliament to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Commission on such important projects as the establishment of the European satellite navigation system, known as Galileo.
At a time when there are doubts on the part of some Member States, we must make it clear that the programme must not be called into question and that this phase needs to be basically sustained by means of public funding, as the Turchi report demonstrates.
It is true that, as we move towards the mid point of the period of the financial framework in force, the difficulties increase because the new demands, the new commitments, call on the budget without any financial coverage.
Despite the difficulties and contradictions, I sincerely believe that, with the signing of this budget, the way ahead has been partly cleared.
It is a political success because it is rigorous and is accompanied by guarantees of more efficient implementation, and these conditions are essential if we are to ensure healthy and sustainable economic growth.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at last at second reading and as far as the administrative reform is concerned I agree with Mrs Wynn and colleagues who raised the matter.
It is true that at first reading we were quite severe with the Commission about the reform.
However, as you know, after the Commission' s replies we are quite prepared to give up these reservations, although there are still some points, two in particular, that bother us.
Let me remind you of them.
First there is the question of early retirement; up to now, and for several months now, we have had no reaction and seen no document that meets our expectations.
The second point to which I would draw the attention of Parliament as a whole is the establishment of base management activity, with as its corollary the lack of any reliable response from the Commission on the application of coherent legislative and budgetary procedures with a view to drawing up our next budgets.
I must say that we would not be so concerned if the administrative reform had been accompanied by an even more revolutionary reform, that is, a much more satisfactory system of interinstitutional relations with a view to drawing up the budgets.
I must tell you that if the Council could reply in time, coherently and on a reasoned basis to the questions we or the Commission put to it, we could make progress on every front.
Above all, if the Commission implemented in a reliable manner the budgets we as the budgetary authority adopt, believe me, Parliament would not hesitate today and would find it easier to give a vote of confidence and to abandon many of its reservations, especially those relating to the reform.
You may be sure that Parliament continues to spearhead the reform with a view to modernising the administration; but then the Commission must also give us proof of its serious resolve to reform the working procedures between our two institutions.
Thank you, Mr President.
I, too, should like to congratulate all those involved in this budgetary procedure, which, as far as I can see, was an excellent procedure.
We greatly appreciate the fact that amendments tabled by Parliament to compulsory agricultural expenditure have been adopted under the Belgian Presidency for the first time.
It is somewhat regrettable that the Commission has failed to seize the opportunity to include Parliament' s proposal in the letter of amendment at this stage.
In the light of the foot and mouth crisis, it is crucial for the European Union to do something about the development of marker vaccines and of insurance systems against animal diseases.
I only hope now that the Commission will implement the amendments to this budget, for in the past I have had certain doubts in this respect.
Other amendments which have not been included unfortunately, but which are of major importance, in my view, are the amendments which relate to the quality policy for agricultural products.
This then refers to a quality heading other than the purely organic production.
I hope that the amendment will be adopted and that the Commission will implement it accordingly this time.
Of great concern is still the fact that a large number of amendments are left over, of which the Commission had said before that it was unable or not prepared to implement them.
There is every chance that these amendments will be adopted on Thursday nevertheless.
What will the Commission do in that case?
Will it persist in its attitude or will it bow to the wishes of the budgetary authority?
Mr President, I want to speak briefly about an amendment I have tabled to the Turchi report on trans-European networks.
I have no problem about telematics being included in such a programme and I generally support the Galileo project.
But the fact is that nearly EUR 1 billion is committed over the next five years, all from the public sector - from either the European Space Agency or from the Commission itself.
By contrast, only EUR 200 million is allocated to the project by the private sector.
My amendment therefore says that it is doubtful whether the private sector will come up with the goods early enough.
