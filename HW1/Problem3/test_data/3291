In concluding this first point, I should like to confirm that our assessment of the progress made in the field of road safety will continue on an annual basis.
MrÂ Gorbach also mentioned the idea of a European Road Safety Day, as well as the launch of awareness campaigns, events that will all need to be carried out at European level.
I can confirm to Parliament that we are working in conjunction with the Presidency on all of these matters.
If you will allow me, I am now going to address the issue of the security of modes of transport, including the difficult subject of how they are financed.
I know that this issue worries the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Following the events of 11Â September 2001, the Commission proposed a framework regulation designed to lay down common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
The support of Parliament, together with that of the Council, was crucial to the successful conclusion of that legislative process.
That regulation was accompanied by an interinstitutional declaration in which our three institutions reaffirmed their determination to enhance the quality of aviation security systems in the Community.
Furthermore, it seemed necessary to prevent any distortion of internal and external competition.
Finally, the three institutions noted the Commissionâs intention to commission a study concerning the way in which the financing of security is divided up between public authorities and operators.
The Commission committed itself to submitting to the European Parliament and the Council the results and the proposals that would emerge from this study.
A similar position was taken when the regulation on the improvement of ships and ports security was adopted in 2004.
The regulation recognised that the actual, uniform application of security measures raised important questions, which were always linked to financing.
In that respect, the Commission also had to embark upon a study with a view to sending information to the European Parliament and to examining any proposals that would be worth presenting.
The Commission put in place, from 2004, an inspection system that has helped significantly to enhance aviation security.
To date, the Commission has carried out 69 inspections in all of the Member States.
In the light of these inspections, the Commission proposed, at the end of 2005, the revision of Regulation 2320/2002, which is currently being looked into by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and for which you, MrÂ Costa, are the rapporteur.
Together with this proposal for a revision, the Commission presented the first annual report on the implementation of the regulation currently in force, as well as the main results of the inspections.
Furthermore, I would highlight the fact that the regulatory committee created by the framework regulation of 2002 has worked hard and has made it possible for eight implementing regulations to be adopted.
The Commission has also launched two crucial studies, which have confirmed the importance of the issue of financing.
As regards aviation, the study was brought to completion in 2004.
The results were published on the Commissionâs website.
The study on the financing of maritime security will shortly be completed, and the results will be submitted to you as soon as they become available.
As regards civil aviation security, the study carried out shows that the costs incurred within the Union, which consisted at that time of 15 Member States, fluctuated between EURÂ 2.5Â billion and EURÂ 3.6Â billion in 2002.
We can regard this amount as a large figure at the same time as emphasising the fact that, in the field of intra-Community transport, the combination of airport and security charges and taxes represented 1% to 2% of the average price of flight tickets.
This study also highlighted some differences in the methods of financing.
There are major differences as regards the role of the State.
The study also highlighted a certain lack of transparency as regards security taxes and charges.
In that respect, I must explain to Parliament that I have decided to organise a meeting between all of the air traffic operators, which will be held tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.
This meeting will mainly focus on airport taxes, but it will certainly reflect on these security problems and their associated cost.
On the subject of maritime security, the preliminary results from the study also confirm that the costs are substantial, even though expenditure in the maritime sector is rather limited in relation to the total costs.
The European Union has more than 1Â 200 seaports and around 3Â 700 port facilities, for which, according to this report, the average investment in security amounts to more than EURÂ 400Â 000, with running costs exceeding EURÂ 200Â 000 per year.
As regards the security of ships, the average investment stands at EURÂ 100Â 000, with running costs of around EURÂ 25Â 000 per year.
Those are the facts in relation to this complex problem. I recognise that it is a major problem, but I also have to admit that it is now difficult to say for certain that we can find a solution that can be imposed on everyone.
That is why we must reflect together on these security problems and on the way in which they will be financed, and I am delighted to hear your contributions on this subject.
This is a problem that will obviously have to be dealt with very rigorously in the future.
That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say, and I should like to thank you and to thank the Austrian Presidency for allowing us to hold this debate on the two issues of road safety and security problems.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with your question, and we ought to discuss in presidium how we can arrive at a sensible procedure while respecting all the constitutional rights of the institutions.
It cannot be right for the Council and Commission together to speak for 25 minutes in a debate for which half an hour is allocated.
When are they actually to debate with us?
If the two institutions want to debate among themselves, surely they can do that in the Council.
I want to come back to the heart of the matter, however.
Road safety is not the heart of the matter. Thank you for what you have said, Vice-Chancellor, I agree with you.
The heart of the matter is the simple question: how can we pay for security measures in aviation?
This problem was raised with the Costa report.
It is high time we discussed it.
May I remind you that we as the European Parliament agreed in 2002 that the aviation security measures occasioned by terrorism should be paid for by the Member States.
Counter-terrorism is a public function and paying for it is therefore also a public function.
Then, because we were unable to agree, in the legislative process for the basic regulation in 2002 we settled for at least an interinstitutional agreement that the Commission should present a proposal for the public financing of such aviation security measures.
Mr Vice-President, you know how much I respect you, but I do not expect you to submit studies, I expect you to present a clear report with clear legislative proposals.
After four years you ought to be in a position â you might at least perhaps be kind enough to deal with that â to say when you will be coming forward with a definite proposal.
There were rumours it would be in April.
Now they are saying the end of the year.
After four years that is no longer tolerable.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also want to have a clear statement from you: if we are agreed that the additional measures after 2001 were counter-terrorism measures, do you also believe that these measures should be financed by the State?
Yes or no?
We believe they should be.
Â Â  . Mr President, sharing, as I do, Mr Jarzembowskiâs view, I think that the topic of traffic safety deserves a debate of its own and that we are keen to enlarge on it on a different occasion.
I would like to confine myself to the issue of funding safety.
Since the attacks of 9/11, safety in the transport sector has become an important area of concern, for Europe as much as for anyone else, and with good reason.
The port sector has been looked at, European legislation has changed safety at airports beyond all recognition, and I am glad to see that other measures are under way.
If we want to adopt sound safety policy, though, we should not only draft common safety guidelines which, needless to say, should apply everywhere in the same way, we must also be clear about who will be footing the bill for all of this.
We need common European rules for this, along with a level playing field, therefore.
We cannot have a situation where in one Member State, all of the costs are passed on to the passengers, while in another Member State, most of the costs are borne by the state.
A regulation in this respect is all the more urgent, because the costs involved in new safety measures continue to spiral out of all proportion.
Accordingly, since 2001, Brussels airport has doubled its safety supplement which it charges each of its passengers.
We have now also started to draft fresh legislation.
As already stated, though, an interinstitutional declaration was drafted on this very topic as long ago as 2002.
This was accompanied by the pledge that a solution for the problem of funding would be tabled shortly.
The Commission promised to present a communication on a strategy to tackle this problem by the end of 2005.
We are still waiting for this communication.
A while ago, rumour had it that we could expect this by the end of April, which turned out incorrect.
I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect this communication.
Indeed, under these circumstances, it is difficult for us, as co-legislators, to do our jobs properly.
We may be discussing the change to Regulation 2320, but we have no idea where we are headed in respect of an important component in the dossier.
I accept that it is difficult, Commissioner, but you should present a number of ideas at the earliest opportunity, allowing us to hold a thorough debate.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my language, the word ââ covers the meaning of the two English words âsafetyâ and âsecurityâ.
It seems to me, however, that todayâs confusion cannot be ascribed purely to the linguistic factor.
These two subjects are too important to be tackled together.
I must admit, however, that when it comes to the âsafetyâ aspect of the word, it is thanks to the contribution of Parliament that fundamental progress has been made with regard to driving time and driving licences.
I would like to make just one point: the greatest contribution we could probably make to road safety would be to make less people use the roads.
If we worked harder and faster on the third railway package, therefore, we would perhaps succeed in making a more significant contribution to safety than any of the other proposals that have been illustrated today.
Coming, though, to the âsecurityâ sense of the word, and to its financing â which is a problem that concerns me directly, as rapporteur of this measure â I ask myself the following question: âCan we proceed with amending the regulation in accordance with the standards that define security without answering the question our citizens are asking, namely who will pay for it?â
This strikes me as the key point.
It is rather difficult to answer âyesâ, partly because we have also come to realise that security is a single issue, that there are not 25 types of security and that it is not possible for each Member State to establish its own security.
If, however, a single security exists for all countries, then we cannot do anything other than define standard, potentially uniform, measures, and establish in a clear, transparent way how to pay for it.
There could then also be additional measures, which are more stringent and apply only in particular countries.
Even in this case, though, how can we guarantee that these independent measures do not interfere negatively with, and have repercussions on, the security of the other countries?
While we wait, reality moves on.
What we have today is, in fact, a basic security financed through fares and extra ticket costs, and more or less cofinanced by the Member States according to the levels of security they wish to establish.
This system must be regulated differently.
I think that the Member States should at least pay for the surplus measures and that it is essential that there be clarity regarding the basic level of cofinance between operator or, better, user Member States.
We must follow these principles at least in order to continue our work.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, todayâs debate goes back to a very serious question from the Committee on Transport and Tourism about the financing of present and future measures in the matter of security.
That is what I want to comment about.
Transport security could also have been discussed with the Titley report.
So it is being discussed now, and we are talking primarily not only about the financing of additional measures in individual States, which are calling for more security at airports, but also â and this is serious â the overall system.
We were promised a communication here that ought to have provided us with the basis for this debate.
Now Parliament is being called upon to put forward proposals.
I am sure we all agree that we want a good foundation on which to do that.
We are not talking only about aviation.
The tragic events in Madrid have given us cause to reflect that other traffic routes and modes of transport are faced with the same challenge.
However, if we want fair competition between the different modes of transport, there must also be fair rules for the financing of security measures.
Hence my question: when can we expect the study?
Does it include this aspect, and can we count on being able to make good plans for further action on the basis of that study?
Â Â  â Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we can only put a positive image of Europe across to people if we have as many specific examples as possible to make clear that acting at European level brings people definite added value.
More safety in the transport sector, especially on the roads, will benefit hundreds of millions of European citizens: more safety, fewer accidents, less human suffering.
The mid-term review that has been mentioned several times shows that.
But it also shows that we still have a great deal of work to do.
If we look at it like that, it is important that renewed efforts are made.
But it will also be particularly important that all projects and all measures are well organised.
The proposed policy mix sounds sensible, but it will also cost money.
In this connection, we must try to ensure that European money is used sensibly, appropriately and economically.
It is of course also important that these scarce European resources ultimately end up with the people and do not drain away somewhere.
When I say that, I am not at all thinking of embezzlement, fraud and the like, but am thinking of the fact that, in aviation in particular, most European airports and airport operators make a great deal of money.
It is four years since we agreed on public cofinancing in the interinstitutional agreement, and if we now make money available â which will take some time â I am almost certain that people will not benefit from that money, but that we will get a new charge that will then probably be offset by refunding other charges.
So if we take this route and use public money, we should ensure that people and air passengers will actually gain something tangible from it.
Â Â  Madam President, Vice-Chancellor, Vice-President of the Commission, I am now rather confused.
Mrs Lichtenberger has already said that todayâs subject â as the Committee on Transport and Tourism also intended â should be transport security and everything related to it.
Now I listen to the Vice-Chancellor and there is not a word on transport security.
In my opinion, that is no way to deal with this House.
At least part of your speech should have dealt with this subject.
After all, that is what Parliament wanted.
I cannot understand why that did not happen, because I do not believe that 11 September passed you by unnoticed.
The only reason is perhaps that the Council is not interested in the subject. But that would be the wrong approach.
As regards the content, I of course agree with my fellow Members that counter-terrorism is clearly a state responsibility and clear lines must be drawn here.
It must be clarified that in some countries the taxpayer pays for it, in other countries the airlines, in others the airports and passengers.
That is why I want the Commission to take measures relatively quickly so that we can deal with this matter in practice and as legislators ensure that the situation is clear and there are no distortions of competition in this area.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will do my best to be brief.
The Austrian Presidency plans to deal with the question of the financing of security measures in the next Council working group, which takes place tomorrow, 6 April, and in particular to discuss the way forward with this dossier, especially as the Commission has now announced that it will not be presenting its study on the matter until the end of 2006.
In any case, close contact between Council Presidency, Commission and Parliament is essential in this matter, especially since we want to reach agreement with Parliament quickly.
I will gladly discuss in detail all questions of financing as the Council Presidency sees them, but there is no time for that today.
I have tried to report on road safety, on which the Council has focussed in the last few weeks and months, and to do so in close contact with the Commission, which has concentrated more on the financing of security in aviation, for example.
How difficult this question of financing is is shown by the fact that there are also different views in the European Parliament, as is evident from the Costa report and also from what you said, Mr Jarzembowski.
Of course I know as well as you do that we need clear rules, if only in order to have fair conditions of competition and for reasons of transparency.
I also believe that this really is about fighting terrorism, and that must be a national function, because if it is passed on to the airlines, the responsibility will again lie with the passenger, and I do not believe that is where it belongs.
The passenger has the right to adequate protection against threats, in one form or another.
That is why my clear position is that all this is a national function, and we have to face up to that.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr Gorbach, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to what one of you said, I am well aware of the importance of both road safety and security problems.
We are working on these issues, and I have listened very carefully to what has been said in this debate.
I should like to point out that, in its communication on the repercussions of the 11 September attacks on the air transport sector, the Commission has already stressed that the public authorities should take responsibility for strengthening certain security measures put in place by the public authorities in the wake of those attacks, which were attacks on the whole of society and not solely on those involved in the transport sector.
I believe I share MrÂ Costaâs view on this distinction, which will probably be one of the guiding principles of any future stance taken by the European institutions.
As I said, Madam President, air transport safety studies have been carried out, and the findings of maritime transport studies will soon be made known to Parliament.
What these studies reveal â and I quoted some figures earlier â is that the costs of security measures can be high even if they may seem insignificant in relation to the overall cost of transport.
In spite of everything, they are, in absolute terms, costs, and I said just before in this Chamber that we shall certainly be bringing up this issue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow in this meeting between European transport companies and the airports.
It is true that different Member States have different approaches to funding, that there is a certain lack of transparency and that we must try to assess and rectify any distortion of competition.
Mr Jarzembowski, MrÂ ElÂ Khadhraoui and MrsÂ Lichtenberger, I note your impatience.
I should like to point out that, while it awaits the findings of the maritime transport study, the Commission is drawing up a report, to be ready by the summer, which will respond to the interinstitutional statement on the regulation on implementing common rules in the field of civil aviation security, as well as to the regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security.
Let me assure you that we will have completed this report by the beginning of the summer.
I hope that I will be able to benefit from todayâs debate, even though it has been too short to cover every aspect of the issue.
I should like to thank Parliament for its commitment to this important matter and the Presidency for enabling us to raise this tricky but very important issue.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0017/2006).
We will take the following questions to the Council.
I must voice my deep concern at the persecution of Christians in China.
In spite of the fact that the Chinese Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and of religion, Chinese Christians are persecuted, imprisoned and tortured by the Communist authorities.
Studies and reports by numerous human rights organisations show that, since 2001, persecution of Christians has become commonplace and has been carried out on a large scale. It is particularly widespread in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Hebei.
The number of Christians in China is estimated to be as high as 70Â million, which demonstrates most clearly the weight and extent of the problem.
Tolerating such behaviour by the Chinese authorities or remaining indifferent towards human injustice and suffering because of religious beliefs is not acceptable in the 21st century.
What steps does the Council intend to take to defend the freedoms of conscience and religion in China?
Will the issue of persecution be raised at ministerial level among EU and Chinese representatives?
Â Â  . Madam President, in reply to Mr Sonikâs question, I would like to begin by saying that the Council very much shares the honourable Memberâs concern.
That is also the reason why, several years ago now, the Council outlined a number of key areas in which the European Union is seeking to make progress in the dialogue process.
These include in particular the unrestricted exercise â both in public and in private â of the freedom of religion and belief and respect for cultural rights and religious freedom in Tibet and Xinjiang.
Religious freedom has therefore been clearly highlighted on the agenda at meetings between the EU and China, not only at dialogue meetings but also at higher levels.
I can confirm from my own experience, both in my former work as a legal adviser who was also responsible for human rights and in my present position, that these subjects are in fact being raised at a great variety of levels.
In line with this conclusion of the Council, the European Union has regularly raised not only the persecution of Christians, the restrictions on house churches and the distribution of Bibles in prisons, but also the persecution of Buddhists, Muslims and members of the Falun Gong movement, a subject that the EU brings up on many occasions.
We have also made it clear that in our view these practices are in breach of Chinaâs international obligations.
Quite recently, freedom of religion was discussed in detail at the dialogues in September 2004 and October 2005, and the EU Troika has visited Tibet and Xinjang in connection with the dialogue.
The EU has regularly called on China to comply with the recommendations of the UN special rapporteur and the UN committees relating to freedom of religion and belief.
It has also continually raised specific cases and called on the Chinese authorities to investigate reports of torture and provide information on sentencing.
The outcome of these talks up until now has been that while the EU has welcomed the opportunity to hold detailed talks with relevant ministers, authorities, etc, it found many of its concerns about restrictions of religious freedom in China confirmed.
In 2005, China sent an official invitation to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the EU looks forward expectantly to the confirmation of a date for the visit.
It has to be said that this invitation itself is a major step forward.
The European Union will continue to press at all levels for genuine freedom of religion and belief in China, not least as part of the process of ratification and implementation of the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights.
Â Â  Thank you very much for a helpful reply.
MrÂ Sonik also wished to establish whether the Council was satisfied with the response by the Chinese side, however.
After all, this is not a new problem.
It is good that it is on the agenda at Troika and High Level meetings, but MrÂ Sonik was obviously hoping that stronger pressure could be exerted on the Chinese side to ensure implementation of these provisions.
Â Â  . I can tell the honourable Member quite plainly that we will never be satisfied until all international obligations are met.
That is why we must repeatedly make inquiries and refer to individual cases.
The situation is still not satisfactory.
That is also the reason why we will continue to raise this question at all levels.
If you are calling on us to apply more pressure, then I must ask you, honourable Member, what pressure the European Union is supposed to bring to bear on China.
Political pressure, that is bringing forward questions and repeatedly reminding them of them?
Yes!
Other opportunities, where the European Union does not confront China directly â and I believe they are important â are international bodies, the United Nations, hitherto the Human Rights Commission.
It will certainly continue to be a matter for the UN Human Rights Council.
I have already mentioned that the UN special rapporteur has a particular role to play here.
These are all levels and channels through which this question can be raised.
We will only ultimately be satisfied when complete freedom of belief and religion has been achieved.
Â Â  â I listened very carefully to Mr Winklerâs answer, but among the points he raised there is one I should like to focus on, namely the fact that this persecution is not only against Catholics but also against other religions.
I should like to ask whether the Council is aware of the Falun Gong report, according to which there is a death camp in the Sujiatun area of Liaoning province in which Falun Gong prisoners are massacred, and whether the Council intends to investigate this report of serious human rights violations in China.
Â Â  . I have never said â because it would be incorrect â that our efforts are concerned only with Catholics or only with Christians.
Freedom of religion is a human right that applies to all religions moving within the democratic framework.
Falun Gong is a special case, especially because we know, as you mentioned, that degradation and torture are used.
We are of course following this with great concern and are also raising it repeatedly.
You mentioned the re-education camps.
We have raised them as well, not only in connection with religious freedom but generally.
The Chinese side has known for many years that re-education camps have long been a thorn in the flesh of the European Union, because they certainly do not meet the normal international standards of human rights.
You can therefore be assured, honourable Member, that we are also seeking to end the suppression of the Falun Gong faith and its adherents.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office.
Apart from representations which seem constantly to fall on deaf ears, is there not something more resolute that the EU could do specifically in the area of trade?
In trade agreements with China and other countries we always have human rights clauses, but we are so timid about the implementation of them that they might as well not be there.
You ask what more we can do.
Has the time not come to be more robust and to consider sanctions in trade, if that is necessary and is the only thing that will deliver implementation of human rights?
What is the point in having the clause if we do not act on it?
Â Â  . I do not agree with the honourable Member that our pleas fall on deaf ears.
Progress has been made and continues to be made and we believe that the means we are using are improving the situation.
I am hesitant to talk about sanctions because we have to use the means that promise most success.
I believe that dialogue is the means of choice because I doubt very much whether we would achieve the desired result if we started speaking about trade sanctions.
I think we are on the right track.
We are making progress.
We should continue on this track and eventually we will make even more progress.
Believe me, we are bringing these questions up, not only through the Austrian Presidency, but through all Member States in their bilateral contacts, the European Union as a whole, the Council, and within the framework of the United Nations.
It is very clear that in the end this is the best way to proceed.
Â Â  . Madam President, in response to Mr Papadimoulisâ question I must first of all say that the Council has never discussed the incidents he mentions.
I must also point out that it is the Commissionâs task to ensure compliance with the Treaties and the provisions enacted by the organs of the Union on the basis of those Treaties.
If the Commission believes that a Member State has failed to comply with an obligation under Community law, it may of course refer the matter to the Court of Justice for a decision, and that is what it does.
Madam President, I could now say something about the legal position.
I assume the honourable Member is fully acquainted with the legal position and would therefore prefer not to list every single directive, but to mention just a few, such as the data protection directive, Directive 95/46, and a number of others, such as one which requires operators of publicly accessible electronic communications services to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to guarantee the security of their services.
There are also a host of other Community rules.
If those Community rules are not complied with, then the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to initiate appropriate measures, and it does so.
Â Â  â Madam President, the game of ping pong you played with the Commission and your hint that it should do more is interesting.
However, the telephone tapping scandal which has shaken my country is a scandal which concerns the tapping of the telephones of the prime minister, ministers and senior officers in the armed forces.
I am amazed that its obvious European dimension did not concern you in the Council.
How can you be so sure, Minister, that your telephone calls are not being tapped?
Â Â  Madam President, I believe in the rule of law.
The regulations are clear.
There are national and European authorities that monitor compliance with those regulations.
Of course, none of us is immune to breaking the law.
The important thing, however, is that the competent European authorities take appropriate action when Community law is broken.
The Council has no powers here.
If the Commission believes that the rules are not adequate, it and it alone has the right to propose that they be amended.
That is how the European Union works, and we would be well advised to stick to these procedures, which are laid down in the Treaties.
Â Â  I would like to pose a more philosophical question.
If the law were to be widened in such a way that it enabled the bugging of both Ministers and Presidents, as happened in Lithuania, and if this somehow ensured a greater war on corruption, crime and the abuse of power, would you still believe that such a path is risky and that we need to think more about citizens' rights?
Â Â  . I do not know whether that was a philosophical question.
I am not a philosopher, I am a lawyer.
I would answer your question like this.
Infringements of civil rights must always be a matter of concern to us, not only abstractly, but quite specifically, whether it is the illegal tapping of telephone conversations or anything else.
The rules that we have, both national and European rules, are there to prevent that.
If they are unable to prevent it, we must draw the appropriate conclusions.
That seems to me the logical answer to your question and to the question from the honourable Member from Greece.
So far as I am aware and according to the most recent Commission report from last year, Greece has incidentally not yet notified any measures to implement the directive in question and the Commission has therefore taken it to the European Court of Justice, which only goes to prove that the system is working.
Austria, too, is repeatedly accused of being in breach of the Treaties.
We are given the opportunity to comment on that.
That is how the system works and in my view that is how it ought to work.
Â Â  I share your belief in the rule of law, Mr Winkler.
But I am sure you can still remember the unpleasant bugging scandal in the Justus Lipsius Building, where the offices of several delegations were bugged, in particular some from the present Council Presidency.
When it was discovered where the bugging had originated, the whole matter fizzled out.
Was there a final report on the matter and what measures have been taken to prevent this building being bugged?
Â Â  To be honest, Mr Seeber, I do not know.
I have no answer to your specific question as to how that matter was concluded, but I nevertheless believe that wrong remains wrong.
The fact that something unlawful happened should not call the legal system itself into question.
I cannot give you a definite answer on the incident.
It also took place before the Austrian Presidency, and the Austrian Presidency did not therefore feel itself in any way called upon to take any particular steps in the matter.
Besides, I assume that appropriate measures were and are being taken to prevent such incidents recurring.
Â Â  . Madam President, in answer to Mr Beglitisâ question I can first of all say that the Council is of course very much aware of the questions he raises.
The ratification and subsequent application of the protocol adapting the Ankara Agreement to take account of the accession of the 10 new EU Member States is also a priority, and indeed a short-term priority for the revised Accession Partnership agreed in January 2006.
Moreover, the European Community and its Member States noted in their declaration of 21 September 2005 that the Union would be monitoring whether the additional protocol was being applied to all EU Member States without restriction and without discrimination and would make an assessment of the matter in 2006.
As you know, the application of the protocol is a precondition for opening negotiations on the relevant chapters.
If the protocol is not fully implemented, that will no doubt be detrimental to progress in the negotiations as a whole.
The Council will be reviewing the progress made on these questions in the course of the year.
Now so far as the unresolved border disputes are concerned, I should refer to the corresponding conclusions adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Helsinki in 1999 and at its meeting in Brussels in December 2004.
There can of course be no doubt that if Turkey is seeking accession it must share the European Unionâs values and objectives as enshrined in the Treaties.
It must show undoubted commitment to good neighbourly relations and settle unresolved border disputes in accordance with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
These questions form part of the scope of the negotiations, are short-term priorities of the Accession Partnership and are systematically raised in political dialogue meetings with Turkey.
So far as the reopening of the Theological School of Halki is concerned, this is a demand that the Union continues to raise forcefully with Turkey.
Freedom of religion generally, of which we have already spoken today, is one of the areas in which further progress must be made as a matter of urgency and where concrete measures must now be taken.
The enactment of a law that will deal with all the difficulties of non-Muslim religious minorities and religious communities in accordance with current European standards is one of the Accession Partnershipâs short-term priorities.
I met with the president of the Turkish constitutional court only two days ago and I also raised this question then.
She assured me that the constitutional court has taken measures concerning the legal personality of religious communities and their ability to acquire property and that those measures have actually obtained or will obtain legal force.
It is certainly a matter that we regularly raise.
In the light of this, the Council can assure the honourable Member that we are continuing to pursue these questions in the ongoing reform process in Turkey and in so doing will take full account of the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, the negotiating framework for Turkey and the revised Accession Partnership.
The extent to which progress is made in the reforms and Turkey complies with its Treaty obligations will naturally affect the negotiation process.
As things stand at present, however, I cannot of course anticipate the conclusions the Council will reach in its further deliberations on these questions.
Â Â  â Thank you, Minister, for your reply, but we must be honest here, because I fear that the European Union is still sending contradictory messages to Turkey.
On the one hand, we are saying that the application of the Protocol is a short-term obligation on the part of Turkey, over the next one or two years.
On the other hand, we are saying that the application of the Protocol is a condition for the commencement of negotiations on the relevant chapters on customs union.
I ask you, Minister: if Turkey is ready or willing to open the chapter of the negotiations on customs union in five years' time, what will the European Union do?
Will we give it an escape route?
Secondly, you did not reply to my question on the role of the army in political life in Turkey.
This is a political criterion and we can see today that the army continues to play a leading role in the Turkish political system.
Â Â  . I do not agree that we as the Council of the European Union are sending contradictory signals.
There is a clear procedure that is moving forward.
Everything will be examined in due course and the various points will have to be satisfied as stipulated.
Besides, the Council is constantly deliberating and will have to reach a conclusion.
There is not always unanimity there. But signals are only sent out when there is a consensus.
I do believe that the Council is proceeding consistently and logically over the progress of negotiations and seeking compliance with obligations and will continue to do so; as I have made very clear, these are obligations that must be met.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to ask you how the Presidency is dealing with the grievances being expressed by Turkey and efforts to negotiate the completion of customs union in relation to the Cyprus problem.
Have you replied clearly?
As far as the Chalki School is concerned, how long is it expected to wait and be patient?
Â Â  . It is not a question of whether we are satisfied with an answer or not.
It is a question of whether obligations are satisfied.
These obligations must be satisfied.
As I have already said in my answer to the original question, progress in the negotiations will very much depend on the extent to which these obligations are satisfied and not on the nature of the declarations.
Whether an obligation has been satisfied or not does not depend on the answer given.
So far as the Theological School of Halki is concerned, that is a demand we raise regularly.
This question, too, naturally affects the progress of negotiations on fundamental rights and liberties, which are dealt with in a chapter of their own.
Â Â  Madam President, in answer to this question I can say first of all that the Muhamad Mugrabyâs case was not raised during the meeting of the foreign ministers with Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora that took place as part of the Council session of 20 March; I was present at that meeting in person.
Mr Sinioraâs visit to Brussels, which was very brief, was an opportunity to stress the European Unionâs support for the independence, sovereignty and democracy of Lebanon at an important juncture in that countryâs history.
That meeting, with all the foreign ministers present, was not the right occasion to raise DrÂ Mugrabyâs case.
That does not mean, however, that the Council is not pursuing Dr Mugrabyâs case closely.
It has already raised it with the Lebanese government on several occasions; one such occasion was an approach to the Lebanese authorities on 22Â December expressing the European Unionâs concern about the charges brought against Mr Mugraby.
I also want to make it very clear here that the Council is convinced that it is unacceptable for a person to be prosecuted for peacefully exercising his right to freely express his opinion, especially before an institution of the European Union like the European Parliament.
We will therefore continue to pursue this case closely.
Â Â  . â I am genuinely dismayed that this was not addressed in the meeting with the Prime Minister, and should like to ask the Council if it deems this Beirut Military Tribunal an anti-Europe process?
The accusation levelled at Dr Mugraby is that he answered a question put to him by the European Parliament, something that undermines the functioning of the institutions and our ability to put questions to people who are ready to work with us.
I therefore wish to ask the Council if it does not view this as sufficiently serious to apply the human rights clauses that form part of the agreements with Lebanon.
Â Â  . I entirely agree that this is a very serious case.
If this case was raised at a relatively brief meeting like a lunch, that does not mean we do not take the case seriously.
As you know, the European Union is about to begin negotiations with the Lebanese government on an action plan as part of the European neighbourhood policy, in which we shall of course be raising human rights and democracy as main priorities, as is usual with such action plans.
This action plan will also mention the necessity of building an independent and impartial judiciary.
It will be a useful instrument for supporting the government in tackling important and necessary reforms in these areas.
You mentioned the association agreement that came into force on 1 April; that means we now have an additional new instrument available to develop and intensify the human rights dialogue with the Lebanese government.
Â Â  â I truly wish to congratulate my honourable friend, Mr Casaca, on his question, but I should like to add that, over the last year, numerous distinguished journalists and numerous distinguished intellectuals who were left-wing fighters in Lebanon have been murdered.
It is not merely a question of our starting now to cooperate with Lebanon as the European Union.
It is not merely a question of the application of UN Security Council resolutions to Syria.
I believe that the Council and the Presidency should exert pressure on Lebanon and the new government in Lebanon to respect human rights and I believe that the Presidency should take a stand on this.
Â Â  . I can answer this question very briefly.
I fully agree with the honourable Member.
It is not only â it is also â about the question of the fulfilment of obligations in connection with the initiatives and activities with regard to Syria, as we know them within the United Nations.
So far as the European Union is concerned, it is quite specifically about the fulfilment of human rights obligations.
It is being raised, we are taking it seriously.
We now have the necessary means to be able to raise these questions in all seriousness and with all urgency, and that we will do.
Â Â  . Madam President, may I perhaps begin by saying â because it is something in which I take a very personal interest â that the Council constantly argues for the unconditional preservation of all international standards of human rights and of humanitarian international law in the context â and particularly in the context â of the fight against terrorism.
The Council has also expressed this in legislative acts and programmes, as for example the framework decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism and the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy of 1 December 2005.
The foreign ministers discussed the question of the camp in GuantÃ¡namo during their dinner on the occasion of the 22/23Â March European Council in Brussels, noting among other things that GuantÃ¡namo remains a cause for serious concern.
They noted that the Heads of Government of some of the United Statesâ close allies have called for GuantÃ¡namo to be closed and that those calls were right and came at the right time.
Some EU ministers also pointed out that they had already voiced their concern at meetings with the US Secretary of State in Brussels.
I should also point out that the Council President, Foreign Minister Plassnik, stated publicly on 22 March that EU Member States and US allies had already called for GuantÃ¡namo to be closed on a number of occasions.
She went on to say: âThose calls were good and important, but they were not enough.â
On the principle that noÂ one can be above the law, the EU has for some time been conducting a purposeful legal dialogue with the United States with the aim of ensuring that humanitarian international law and human rights are applied in the fight against terrorism.
We assume â and I quote again â âthat GuantÃ¡namo will soon be a thing of the pastâ.
This was said in recognition of the fact that terrorism must be fought in a manner that is credible and consistent with human rights and that we have to insist on that, especially as the European Union, which is offering possible solutions.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, sometimes you speak plainly, such as this morning when, in the name â so you said â of the violation of human rights, you are taking measures against Belarus, and sometimes you speak in riddles.
We question directly and there are two questions:
First question: are the United States of America endeavouring to prevent the question of the closure of Guantanamo from being raised at the UN Human Rights Council?
Do you agree it should be raised or do you disagree?
Second question, to which I would like you to reply clearly, because you replied to me indirectly: do you now agree that the Guantanamo base should be closed and, if you do agree, what measures will you take, as the Council, against the United States of America in order to persuade it to close the Guantanamo base?
Â Â  . I would like to make it absolutely clear that we in the Council are certainly not applying double standards.
Human rights violations are raised whenever they occur.
The question of the compatibility of GuantÃ¡namo with the relevant provisions of international law and of humanitarian law in particular has been raised with the United States.
I have also quoted what the President of the Council said when she voiced the hope that GuantÃ¡namo will soon be a thing of the past.
We as the Council of the European Union have also supported the efforts of the UN special rapporteur on torture, MrÂ Novak, to prevent arbitrary arrest and inhuman treatment.
We certainly do bring this question up with US representatives, including and starting with the President, and with the Secretary of State.
It is certainly not true that we are trying to ignore the matter.
Â Â  Last week the US Supreme Court started a case against the military commissions, looking into the matter.
Of course, they violate international fair trial standards, are not independent of the executive and evidence is withheld from the defence.
They apparently admit to statements under torture, and there are no independent appeals.
Can the President-in-Office of the Council state categorically that it is opposed to these military tribunals?
Again, please answer very specifically whether you are going to put pressure on the United States Government to shut down GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
That is the answer we need.
Â Â  . Firstly, we cannot and should not comment on the national judiciary system if there are legal remedies available nationally that take care of this question.
You mentioned the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court and other courts in the United States have repeatedly dealt with the question of the legality of a number of things that have happened in connection with the camp.
I believe that the legal system of the United States is quite well equipped to deal with this question.
I say categorically that we hope that the camp in GuantÃ¡namo will soon be a matter of the past.
Â Â  Are there many, if any, Member States which would say in the Council that they oppose more stringent condemnation of the GuantÃ¡namo camp?
Which Member States oppose taking more concrete action on the issue?
Â Â  . In the discussions that took place at the Foreign Ministersâ dinner on the occasion of the European Council, nobody opposed anything.
It was quite clear that this was everybodyâs common position.
Therefore, there is no question of anybody opposing anything because what I have said is clearly the position of all Member States.
Â Â  As they are on the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Bearing in mind the European Court decision on compensation to airline passengers (10Â JanuaryÂ 2006), what action is the Council considering to ensure consumers actually get the protection and rights that this legislation intends?
Can the European Council state if it intends to bring forward any new measures to enhance the rights of passengers travelling on European airlines?
Â Â  . Madam President, with regard to these questions, but in particular to Mr Evansâ question, the Council can confirm that it has noted the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 10 January 2006 in the case of v .
The Council welcomes the fact that the Court of Justice found that examination of the questions referred by the national court for a preliminary ruling revealed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91.
May I also point out that Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council gives passengers certain rights if they are denied boarding or flights are cancelled or delayed.
Article 16 of the Regulation (âInfringementsâ) requires every Member State to designate a body to be responsible for the enforcement of the Regulation on its territory.
Where appropriate, that body takes the necessary measures to ensure that the rights of passengers are respected.
It also stipulates that passengers may complain to any such designated body about an alleged infringement of the Regulation and, finally, Article 16, paragraph 3, provides that the sanctions laid down by the Member States for infringements of the Regulation must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
It is therefore primarily up to the Member States and the national bodies responsible for implementation to ensure that passengers actually enjoy the rights granted them by the Regulation when they make a complaint.
Furthermore, under Article 211 of the EC Treaty it is the Commissionâs responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the Regulation are actually applied.
The Council is monitoring the application of the Regulation attentively. In particular, it will be carefully examining the report on the operation and results of the Regulation, which, under Article 17, the Commission is required to submit by 1 January 2007.
In connection with Mr Ryanâs question in particular, the Council would point out that, together with the European Parliament, it issued the above Regulation on assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding under the codecision procedure in 2004.
I would also like to mention that the Council, also under the codecision procedure with Parliament, will shortly be adopting a Regulation on the rights of passengers with disabilities and with restricted mobility.
It should finally be pointed out that the European Commission has the right of initiative to propose legislative acts to strengthen the rights of air passengers and that no new proposals have been presented.
The Council does not therefore intend to adopt further legislative acts in this field in the near future.
Â Â  . With enormous respect to the President-in-Office, I have to say that answer was very inadequate, because all he did was repeat the European Court of Justice ruling, of which I am fully aware.
We have had this, but still airlines are avoiding payment.
I have a file full of casework on airlines which are not paying compensation that people are clearly entitled to.
You said the Council is looking closely at this, but that does not help.
As I asked in the question, what is the Council doing or what action is it considering to ensure that the decision is enforced and that consumers are helped and receive the rights to which they are clearly entitled, as proven by the ECJ ruling?
Â Â  . â I should like to reiterate that that is a matter for the Member States.
The Council can only point out during Council meetings that these provisions, which are indeed unambiguous and clear, are to be properly monitored and that Member States are to insist that they are observed.
We cannot do more, and I am sorry, but we shall stick to this, as the legal situation is clear.
The simple fact is that the Member State concerned bears responsibility in each specific case and should indeed exercise this responsibility.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, being frequent flyers, we are all familiar with the situation at airports, with complaints sometimes only being channelled to the waste-paper basket, and consumers often facing the problem of how to assert themselves.
Would it be possible to establish an arbitration service or ombudsman to deal with such complaints properly?
Â Â  â If cases such as this start to occur more and more often, this would certainly be one possible way of solving this matter to the satisfaction of passengers, or consumers.
I would point out to the honourable Member, however, that this, too, is a matter for the Member State concerned.
I can only promise the honourable Member that I will have the Council discuss this and make it aware that this option exists for the eventuality that these complaints take on a dimension such as to necessitate action.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, like MrÂ RÃŒbig, I wish to draw attention to something that happens to each of us nearly every day.
A large European airport, in Frankfurt, hands out a leaflet on request that explains the Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament.
A careful reading of this text, which comprises roughly 10 to 15 A4 pages in total, each three-quarters full, reveals that the passenger has no rights.
Is the Council ready and willing to join with Parliament to approach the Commission and make it aware that it is actually responsible for ensuring compliance with this legislation?
Â Â  . â Compliance with passengersâ rights is very important to me, as is cooperation with Parliament, and so I shall answer the honourable Memberâs question with a clear âyesâ.
Â Â  I am pleased that the previous speaker had information given to him.
When my flight was cancelled by Air France on Sunday night at Gatwick airport, there were no instructions, no rights given to us at all.
I understand that it is a question for Member States, but can you please use your good offices to try and ask the Member States to make sure that legislation is complied with.
At the moment it is not.
If passengers are not even given any information about compensation, what can they do?
Â Â  . â I can only repeat to the honourable Member what I have already said in reply to the supplementary question, which is that it goes without saying that I am ready and willing to make my good offices â to use your words â available to make the Member States aware that these things are important and must be taken seriously.
I shall discuss this matter within the Council.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
The political agreement reached by the Council Summit in December 2005 concerning the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 reduced the Commission's original proposal for funding of the Trans-European Transport Networks from â¬ 20 billion to â¬ 7 billion.
Given the importance of the Trans-European Networks for the Lisbon strategy and the operation of the internal market, does the Council believe that it is possible, with the amount of â¬ 7 billion, to implement the thirty priority projects scheduled for the near future?
Does it share the view that this significant cut by two thirds of the original provision will hold back the transport sector more broadly defined, particularly since some of these projects are already encountering problems, and how does it intend to deal with this matter during the current six months?
Does it intend to seek a solution in the revision and/or suspension of some of the priority programmes?
What is the Presidency's view of the development prospects and construction schedule for the European Magistrale high-speed railway line from Paris to Budapest via Strasbourg, including its principal branch-line from Munich through the Brenner Base Tunnel to Rome and also, in particular, as regards the German and Austrian stretches of the two lines?
Attaining the goals of the Lisbon Strategy will not be possible without efficient European transport networks.
The 1994 Essen summit and subsequently Commission decisions 1692/96/EC(1) and 884/2004/EC(2) and the report of the high-level group chaired by Karel Van Miert laid down Community guidelines for the TEN-T and identified 30 priority projects.
It is a matter of great concern that the project Railway axis 23 Gdansk-Warsaw-Brno/Bratislava-Venice, which is of strategic importance for the social and economic development of central Europe, has been omitted from the Commission proposal appointing coordinators for 6 of the 30 trans-European network transport projects.
Will the Austrian Presidency give priority importance to this project linking countries on the Baltic with central Europe?
What progress has been made in implementing this project?
How will it be financed?
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, I should like to give the following reply to the questions regarding the TEN, the trans-European networks.
As regards the requested funding, the Commission has made a start, following the agreement reached at the December European Council, on assessing the prospects for Community financial aid within the new framework.
When this assessment has been completed, the Council will resume its discussions without delay, so that agreement can be reached as soon as possible on the definitive adoption of the proposal by the end of this year.
As regards the field of transport in general, it must be emphasised that Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks is intended for cofinancing projects that are often carried out within the framework of cooperation between national, public and also private authorities in the Member States.
The Community financial aid has the potential to, as it were, leverage funding from public and private authorities at national level and promote coordination between various national measures, particularly with regard to cross-border sections.
However, responsibility for implementing the projects remains with the Member States concerned â and also the participating actors, of course.
If the implementation of a project of common interest is considerably delayed, the Commission may, pursuant to Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, consult the Member States concerned and adopt suitable measures, with due regard to the division of competences.
As regards the re-examination of the list of priority projects set out in the Decision, the Commission may, by virtue of its right of initiative, present legislative proposals within the framework of the report on the implementation of the guidelines that it has to present every two years.
On the subject of the funding for the TEN budget heading in the Financial Perspective for 2007â2013, I should like to make the general point, as regards the funding of TEN projects from resources for the trans-European networks in this period, that I have already advocated â when I appeared on behalf of the Presidency in Parliamentâs Committee on Transport and Tourism on 25Â January â that the resources for the trans-European networks be increased still further in the Financial Perspective if possible.
Accordingly, I have also made the decision-makers and negotiators aware of the importance and urgency involved and pointed out that it is not possible to disregard mobility and sustainability â for which the extension of the trans-European networks is an essential precondition â when announcing growth strategies and job creation at European level.
I was pleased to note that a compromise was reached at yesterdayâs trialogue.
It is to be hoped that, by making use of all possible scope, we can now at least moderate the reduction of the TEN resources for the 2007â2013 period.
As President of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, I myself have constantly pointed out the importance of realising the TEN priority projects and, as I have already mentioned, have also made the responsible parties to the negotiations aware of this and applied pressure where this was possible and helpful.
I am pleased that agreement has been reached, at least for the time being, and hope, as I say, that we are now able to tackle at least the most important projects as a result.
Â Â  â Mr President, thank you very much for the information which you have given us, both today and in the Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament.
My question is clear: given the need for the development of the trans-European networks and for the completion of the single market for mobility and everything you spoke of, can these objectives be achieved with EURÂ 7Â billion?
If the targets are so necessary and there is such a shortfall, what does the Council intend to propose so that we can bridge the gap, over and beyond the general plea for cooperation between the public and private sectors?
Similarly, of the increased sum of around EURÂ 500Â million, what percentage corresponds to energy and what percentage corresponds to transport?
Â Â  . â A total of EURÂ 7.3Â billion has been allocated to transport.
The honourable Member very rightly mentions that, in order to realise the priority trans-European networks, we also have to implement, rather than just think about, innovative funding models.
I am thinking here of participation by private financiers and investors.
There is no other way.
In addition, there is no doubt that we shall have to establish priorities and, after a few years, shall be able to determine that the projects that are ready for construction the quickest are also likely to have the best chances of being realised.
For this reason, it will be the overriding task of those with relevant responsibility in the Councils to ensure that those priority trans-European networks that have been identified as important to employment and economic development have the necessary, relevant approval and are thus ready for construction.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, my question related specifically to the time frame for the European Magistrale from Paris to Vienna via Strasbourg and Munich and the branch line to Rome through the Brenner Base Tunnel.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office about the overall project, but in particular the connections from Munich to Vienna and Rome.
Â Â  . â In response to the question by MrÂ Posselt, I should like to say that the Council Presidency is of the opinion that the extension of the two railway axes â axis NoÂ 17: Paris â Strasbourg â Stuttgart â Vienna â Bratislava, and axis NoÂ 1: Berlin â Munich â Verona â Palermo â is vital to counteract congestion on the roads, particularly by heavy goods vehicles.
These are large-scale projects that aim to create a balance between the various modes of transport and to contribute towards a sustainable transport system in the EU.
In addition, these cross-border projects improve economic integration in the internal market.
Since the honourable Member has specifically enquired about the timescales, I can say that the construction of the two axes is expected to be completed in 2015.
However, the final decision on these large cross-border projects and their swift implementation naturally depends on the Financial Perspective for 2007â2013 and partly â as I have already mentioned â on the necessity of finding private funding.
Once there is agreement on the necessary budget, a long-term implementation plan is required for the completion of these ambitious projects.
By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is my firm personal conviction, particularly as regards the NorthâSouth transit route of axis NoÂ 1: Berlin â Munich â Verona â Palermo, that the first sod will have been turned by the end of this year and we shall be able to begin.
I myself turned the first sod for the heart of the project, the Brenner Base Tunnel, and, over the last three-and-a-half years, together with my fellow Minister MrÂ Lunardi, I have done my utmost to bring this project to where it is now.
I believe that a concerted effort is appropriate and necessary in respect of these two important axes.
Â Â  I did not receive a reply to my specific question concerning the GdaÅsk-Vienna axis.
This is a particularly important section, because in terms of links between the new Central European Member States and the old Member States of the Union, it is clearly a key part of the transport network.
Two other links are at the planning stage. I refer to the Paris-Vienna route and the priority line, which will run from Antwerp to Helsinki via Warsaw.
No provision has been made for the essential section I enquired about, however, hence my question to the Deputy Chancellor.
Â Â  . â I shall gladly discuss oral question H-0237/06 by MrÂ JaÅowiecki, too.
As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, Parliament and the Council have adopted the Decision on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network.
This assumes that the work on railway axis NoÂ 23 â the said Gdansk â Warsaw â Brno/Bratislava â Vienna axis â will be completed in the 2010â2015 period.
The Council Presidency is of the opinion that this railway axis is of paramount importance, as it contributes towards the establishment of commercial enterprises along the axis and promotes a shift to alternative modes of long-distance transport, but is also intended to take account of the mobility requirements of those making regional journeys.
In July of last year â 2005, that is â six European coordinators were appointed to advance the realisation of five priority transport axes and the introduction of the European Rail Traffic Management System.
Railway axis NoÂ 23 is not one of these initial priority projects, but at this stage the Presidency cannot anticipate a decision on which transport axes will be classified as priority projects in future and whether a second group of European coordinators will be used â my apologies for this.
The transport projects of railway axis NoÂ 23 form part of the National Reform Programmes (NRP) of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia; preliminary economic studies have already been conducted, and the design studies and environmental impact assessments have begun.
I should like to add that large-scale investment in the ViennaâVenice section, which was also mentioned in this question, is planned in Austria.
I would also reiterate that, as has been mentioned a number of times already today, a final decision on railway axis NoÂ 23 also depends on agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007â2013, and on the mobilisation of private capital.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, the European Magistrale affects us all greatly, as it runs right through Strasbourg, the capital of Europe.
Does the President-in-Office believe that the coordinator appointed will have the opportunity of reporting to the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council at regular intervals on the progress made with coordination?
Â Â  . â MrÂ RÃŒbig, I think that it is a good idea for the coordinator responsible, who must of course be well informed, to justify himself and be accountable to this House, too, to the responsible, interested MEPs.
I shall be glad to take up and pass on this suggestion.
Â Â  The Commission has proposed the nomination of six coordinators for six out of the thirty projects.
In seems that in an Orwellian way, these are the more equal animals among the TEN-T projects.
When is the Commission going to put forward the second phase for the next most privileged priority projects?
When are you going to do it in the Council?
Â Â  . â It is like I have already said. There is a total of thirty priority TEN projects, and these are ranked, with coordinators appointed for the most important six.
Experience will show delays here and there, however, and then the ranking will have to be reviewed.
That is why I have emphasised that the ranking system is good and important.
The High-Level Group under MrÂ vanÂ Miert has done excellent work on this.
We shall have to show flexibility, however, as the routes are important not only for economic growth and employment, but also for the implementation of the principle stated in various white and green papers, namely that of shifting freight transport from the roads to the railways.
We need to provide intact projects for this, too.
I am convinced that we cannot fight too hard, together, to secure the relevant resources for this, including beyond the coming period.
I have great confidence here in the innovative potential and approaches, mentioned earlier, of making use of private funds, too, so that projects can be implemented more quickly than would otherwise have been possible, not only in the interests of the economy and of job creation, but also, in particular, of the environment and the people living along many transit routes.
Â Â  I am very much obliged to the Vice Chancellor for first raising the subject of the Financial Perspective.
Indeed, we have tonight agreed to provide EURÂ 500Â million more direct funding for the TEN projects and an additional EURÂ 500Â million to obtain EIB loans.
He has therefore ended up with EURÂ 7.3Â billion.
My question to the Vice Chancellor relates to one of the projects vital to Europe and to Austria, the Brenner Base Tunnel.
Can he tell us how he sees the progress that has been made on this TEN project, since this project is so vital to the EU?
Â Â  . â MrÂ Karas, I shall be very happy to do so.
The situation with the Brenner Base Tunnel, the heart of the BerlinâPalermo transit route, is as follows.
The Commission has promised to cofinance the pilot tunnel to the tune of 50% â a large sum.
The investment volume for this pilot tunnel amounts to approximately EURÂ 450Â million.
We are currently in phaseÂ 2, the preparatory stage, and, in the summer of this year, we shall start boring this pilot tunnel and do our utmost to implement phaseÂ 3 â the phase of constructing the Brenner Base Tunnel itself â in no more than two-and-a-half to three years, so as to guarantee its completion by 2015 at the latest, as envisaged by the international treaty between Italy and Austria.
As I have always said, if we are ambitious in our pursuit of these objectives, it is quite possible to save a couple of years, so that, in the best-case scenario, the heart of this transit route â the Brenner Base Tunnel â could be completed in 2013.
I should also like to emphasise here, however, that, if the countries concerned are in agreement and the Commission gives them maximum support â as Vice-PresidentÂ Barrot, who has also been enquiring about the situation on site, has just done â there will be progress to match.
I am also relying heavily on the Commission and the EU for the remaining cofinancing.
Â Â  â Madam President, there was a question by me to which I was expecting an answer and I thought there would be enough time for us to reach it but, unfortunately, numerous honourable Members intervened on one specific question and mine could not be examined.
As you see, I have been waiting here for one and a half hours but, unfortunately, we are going for a written answer.
Â Â  Mrs President, on a point of order, every single month I find myself left out of Question Time, even though I am in the first 12 or 13 questions.
To take three questions together and only get through ten questions is really a reflection on this House.
Something has to be done about this.
I am sent here by people to ask questions.
There are 700 of us.
To get through that few questions is really quite an appalling reflection on the House and the system.
I would ask that this be communicated to the Bureau because something needs to be done about it.
Â Â  I am really sorry.
I have noted what you have said, but the mere fact that other debates overrun means that we frequently have the problem of a reduction in the time for Question Time.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  â The next item is the statement by the Commission on World Health Day.
Â Â  . Mr President, the global shortage of doctors, nurses and other health professionals has reached a crisis point in many parts of the world.
Ageing populations in Europe, the United States and most wealthy countries, combined with increasingly sophisticated medical treatments that require specialised staff, mean that demand for health workers in the developed world is outstripping supply.
Indeed, the demand for health workers is not only outstripping our internal capacity to produce doctors and nurses: it is placing a huge strain on the international market for health workers.
However, the shortage of health workers in rich nations does not even begin to approach the severe shortages being experienced in many parts of Africa, where the lack of health workers can often mean the difference between life and death.
With less than one health worker per 1000 people in Africa, compared to over 10 health workers per 1000 people in Europe, it is hardly surprising that the shocking and unacceptable death toll of children and their mothers continues.
More than one in five children die before their fifth birthday and more than one in a hundred mothers die as a result of complications of pregnancy in many African countries.
Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in Africa is unacceptably slow, with progress reversal in some countries as a consequence of HIV/Aids.
The burden of caring for the sick falls on families and communities who have few resources to cope with this significant burden.
The World Health Report for 2006 focuses international attention on the health worker shortage, and is very much welcomed. It puts a spotlight on a crisis that has been evolving over many years, but that now represents probably the most significant barrier to progressing towards the health-related Millennium Development Goals â reducing maternal and child mortality and controlling communicable diseases such as HIV/Aids, TB and malaria.
Without doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health workers, it will be impossible to improve healthcare, or to meet our commitments to increase access to essential services.
The causes of this crisis are complex.
There has been chronic under-investment in health services in developing countries for many years, including under-investment in training of health workers.
Many countries in Africa are still trying to run their health services on a budget of less than EURÂ 10 per capita â that is much less than the minimum of EURÂ 30 recognised as necessary for providing essential services.
But the problem is not just lack of investment in Africa.
Many countries in Europe and elsewhere have underinvested and inadequately planned for health worker training to meet the needs of ageing populations.
The rich world can attract health workers from other countries; the consequences for poor countries is that they train health workers who leave the country, effectively providing a perverse subsidy to health services in developed countries, by shouldering the burden of training costs.
Training more health workers worldwide is only part of the solution.
Many health workers who are trained do not want to work in the poorest and most remote areas where needs are greatest.
There is a pattern of internal migration from rural to urban areas, and from the public to the private sector, and from poor countries to richer neighbouring countries and then to the richer, developed world.
However, it is difficult to blame the individual, once you have seen the conditions under which they have to work.
We need to better understand the motivations of health workers, and to create incentive systems that encourage them to work where there is the greatest need.
The âpushâ factors of poor working conditions, low salaries â which are paid irregularly, lack of drugs and equipment and lack of career prospects all contribute to the migration of health workers.
Indeed, it is surprising that, given these poor conditions, you still get a hard core of dedicated health workers in many African countries who continue to do a remarkable job in very difficult circumstances.
It is important not to lose sight of the achievement and the increasable contribution of many health workers who continue to serve their people, despite the challenges of their jobs and working environment.
The âpullâ factors for migration â better salaries in rich countries, better working conditions and greater security, which are sometimes coupled with aggressive recruitment practices by private recruitment agencies â also play a significant role in increasing health worker mobility.
These issues have all been described in the communication from the Commission to Parliament on the EU strategy of action to address the crisis in human resources for health in developing countries.
If we are to overcome the crisis, developing solutions must begin in the countries most affected and must support strengthening of their planning and financing of health worker training, support and finance, and improved terms of conditions of services.
It is essential that country action be supported by regional and global action, sharing knowledge and best practice, sharing training resources and changing international recruitment policies to make them more ethical.
It is important that we look closely at our own health worker training programmes and increase our own production capacity, to make us more self-sufficient.
The Commission has been leading and coordinating the development of a coherent European response.
The communication on human resources for health has been debated and strong conclusions are due to be adopted by the Council.
EU Member States have agreed a Statement of Commitment, which is being announced for World Health Day.
That should demonstrate to the rest of the world that Europe takes this issue seriously and will support a significant response to the crisis.
Â Â  . Mr President, I endorse every word that the Commissioner has said tonight as we commemorate this yearâs World Health Day with the WHOâs chosen theme of the appalling shortage of health workers.
In Europe we have three doctors per 1000 people and, as she has said, we are still short of health professionals.
In Africa they have under five doctors per 100Â 000 people.
In Europe it is our fault and in Africa it is also too often our fault.
And why is it our fault?
Because the developed countries take 63Â 000 doctors and nurses a year from developing countries and return just 1300 to those countries.
That is an unethical, immoral imbalance.
In Europe we must do much more to recruit and retain health professionals through training, through pay, through working conditions, through research facilities and so on, but with developing countries we must do so much more and above all we must stop this recruitment rape of their skills.
Sub-Saharan Africa has some 750Â 000 health workers for 682Â million people.
Europe has 15 times higher a ratio.
Sub-Saharan Africa is short of one million health workers.
Ghana has only 1500 doctors for its population of 20Â million.
Two-thirds of the young doctors in that country leave the country within three years of graduation, and yet Africa bears 25% of the worldâs health and disease burden, and has only 0.6% of the worldâs health professionals.
In the United Kingdom, my country, two thirds of new doctors and 40% of new nurses come from abroad.
That is something of which we must be ashamed and we must pledge ourselves to show our guilt by stopping the recruitment rape and by ensuring that we can sustain, with the people of Africa, the health services and the health professionals they so desperately need.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, on this World Health Day, I am happy to contemplate the European contribution towards the achievement of the Millennium Objectives.
No fewer than three out of these eight objectives are about health care, about the fight against diseases such as AIDS and malaria, about reducing child mortality and the mortality of mothers during pregnancy or childbirth.
The world, particularly Africa, is still lagging behind in a spectacular fashion.
Every year, worldwide, more than one million children die of malaria, six million children under the age of five die of a lack of food or qualitatively imbalanced nutrition, and two to three million children die of diseases which could have been prevented by vaccination.
In 2005, one woman died every minute of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
Time after time, the Commission and the Member Sates promise to grant high priority to health care in the developing countries.
Despite all these fine promises, they fail to deliver and to incorporate them in the annual spending plan.
Not even 5% of the EUâs budget for development cooperation is spent annually on basic health care, which is completely at odds with the promise and wish of this House to spend 20% of the EUâs aid budget on basic education and basic health care.
Put your money where your mouth is.
Moreover, when we grant budgetary support, we must be much tougher with regard to the spending criteria.
There should be no budgetary support for those countries that do not qualify on account of bad governance.
Where budgetary support is given, it has to target specific sectors, in other words, explicitly home in on health care or education.
It must also be clear beyond any doubt that the money is actually spent on health care, which causes it was spent on, and what the results are, whereby a specific percentage accounts for monitoring expenses by a civic watchdog group.
We owe this to the European taxpayer and the people and parliaments of the receiving countries.
Spending, should, in fact, not only be done via European programmes, but can often be done more effectively by joining forces with organisations such as the World Health Organisation, UNAIDS, UNFPA and via global initiatives such as Global Fund.
Europe should guarantee the funding of projects for sexual and reproductive health care which, on account of policy by the US President to block resources for these projects, are short of funds.
This is in stark contrast to the 12 billion which the US is investing in an absurd campaign which promotes no sex before marriage and fidelity to the partner.
The US Congress concluded today that this campaign causes confusion and hampers existing campaigns.
Many women and girls have died as a result of this outrageous policy.
We in Europe cannot, and indeed should not, put up with this.
I hope that my fellow Members of the other parties in this House will not side with Bush, but rather with the millions of women and girls.
In addition to spending that should be increased, we should also approach health care in developing countries in a structural and integral manner.
Access to a basic service such as health care is of the essence for the poorest of the poor, but this access is often inadequate due to a lack of expertise and infrastructure at source.
That is why we should invest in logistics and social infrastructure, in the transfer of knowledge and training local staff, and also in basic education, with a view to imparting basic knowledge in the areas of hygiene, healthy drinking water and healthy food.
Not until such time as a basic structure is in place can poverty-related illnesses and other unnecessary causes of mortality be eliminated in a truly structural manner.
In our resolution, we are right to focus on the shortage of health workers, often caused by brain drain, a phenomenon whereby highly trained doctors and nurses decide to work elsewhere in the world.
We must prevent this brain drain by actively concluding agreements between sectors and countries, by promoting circular migration, whereby people return to their home countries following a short spell abroad, by training and transferring knowledge and by creating better working conditions.
Finally, in many countries, corruption and bad governance prevent a large share of the money that is spent on health care from ending up with the poorest of the poor.
Studies have shown that in a country such as Chad, only 1% of government funds that are spent on health care actually arrive at their destination.
This brings me to my own report on corruption and development cooperation which will be discussed during tomorrowâs plenary.
Good governance and the fight against corruption are of the essence if we want to achieve the Millennium Objectives.
Both donor and receiving countries should make an all-out effort to bring this about in the next few years.
In this plenum, I cannot emphasise enough the importance of the Millennium Objectives, particularly in respect of health care and education.
It is now really vital to double the budget that is spent on these.
By doing this, you are doubling the chance of developing the poorest of the poor of this world, helping them escape poverty and become healthy.
Make poverty history!
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the Commissionerâs summary of the complex aspects of this problem.
World Health Day is a good moment for taking stock.
We have the Millennium Development Goals and many statements of good intent by governments and parliaments around the world, but unfortunately there is still a huge gap between the rhetoric and the reality on the ground.
In too many places people are still dying simply because of the absence of basic medical facilities that could have saved their lives at very little cost.
I will mention just one place: the equatorial region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the population is suffering a catastrophic death rate, not because of famine or even because of ongoing violence and insecurity, as is the case in the east of Congo, but simply because medical facilities are non-existent in that beautiful but inaccessible forest area.
We need to take a hard look at Commission spending on health and ask why such a low percentage of the EDF budget is earmarked for the health sector, as Mr van den Berg has just pointed out.
That is despite the fact that Parliament has asked for one fifth of overall development funds to go to basic healthcare and basic education.
I want to turn to the issue of health workers.
It is not just a question of inadequate funding: it is an area where European Member States are actively undermining the health services of developing countries by poaching their trained medical staff.
Member States may have signed up to commitments not to actively recruit health workers from the poorest nations, but in practice they are finding ways round those promises.
For example, the UK has the National Health Service code on recruitment of health workers, but it only applies to workers recruited by the NHS directly.
The Code does not apply to nurses recruited by private agencies.
Often the agency jobs are lower-skilled jobs, so those nurses do not even have the advantage of gaining specialist skills while they are in Europe.
The result is devastating.
In Swaziland there are about 3000 nurses and Swaziland is training about 100 per year.
However, up to 80 nurses per year are leaving for the UK alone. That is on top of the huge number of Swazi nurses who are dying of Aids: 300 died of Aids in 2003-2004.
Member States must close the loopholes in their codes on health worker recruitment and put in place effective health workforce planning so that they are no longer tempted to poach trained personnel from the very countries where better healthcare is so desperately needed.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if one has the opportunity to analyse the often transitory nature or the effectiveness of these world days devoted to some great cause or other, the conclusion is that it is an opportunity for us, on the one hand, to shed some light on a dramatic situation and on the shortage of healthcare personnel in the South, an issue to which we normally pay scant attention, and on the other hand table some proposals to implement in the short, medium or long term.
Hence the need to incorporate these health objectives into the framework of the multiannual financial programming, which would make it possible to increase the predictability of EU funds, which is so lacking at present, and to give more practical support to national strategies for increasing the number of healthcare personnel.
One must not forget, however, that this problem that we are discussing today is not just another stroke of bad luck due to pure chance.
This shortage of healthcare personnel is in fact the result of so-called âstructural adjustment' programmes which have been brutally pursued by the international financial institutions and which have led to the collapse of public healthcare and education services in a good many countries.
There is therefore âa fair bitâ of hypocrisy in stating in 2006 a determination to increase healthcare personnel over the next few years, while macroeconomic financial policies pursued elsewhere have had a detrimental effect on those same human resources for over ten years.
Nevertheless we welcome this awareness, however late it was in arriving, of the pressing need to invest in human resources, without which no development policy, however virtuous, can be implemented.
This is why, as far as we are concerned, the EUâs action in this area should be focused on three areas.
Firstly, as has already been mentioned, the amount earmarked for health issues within the framework of official development aid, which currently stands at around 5%.
This is woefully inadequate, and the prospects are not all that encouraging; at least 20% is needed, not least to cover salary costs for training and for all manner of issues already mentioned.
Secondly, putting an end to the budgetary restriction measures imposed by the international financial institutions.
In cases such as these, the EU needs to bring its influence to bear, especially as regards the salary ceiling and civil service recruitment.
Lastly, a code of ethics which would help to remedy the scandal of the two-tier recruitment, in the North, in terms of status and salary.
Such recruitment, which happens in a fair number of our countries, must be combated, and the country of origin principle must be scrapped.
To conclude, we trust that these generous statements of intent will actually be followed up, thanks to the very firm commitment of the EU institutions and of Parliament in particular, and thanks to the campaign started by the NGOs and European civil society.
Â Â  . â Access to healthcare is recognised as a fundamental human right.
Yet large sections of the population are still not guaranteed this access.
The UNâs Millennium Development Goals include reducing by two thirds the mortality rate among children under five, reducing by three quarters the maternal mortality rate, halting and beginning to reverse the spread of AIDS and halting and beginning to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases.
The time has come to prevent the deaths of many millions of children and women due to a lack of primary healthcare, mother and child health, sexual and reproductive health, water and sanitation infrastructure, and education, including education in the field of health.
For this to happen, there needs to be greater solidarity between the most developed countries.
We therefore feel it is vitally important to provide active support for training doctors in developing countries and access to medical training for students from rural and remote regions.
In this regard, I wish to highlight the remarkable example of Cuba in training, free of charge, thousands of doctors and other healthcare personnel to work in Africa and Latin America.
It is similarly crucial to deliver access to high-quality, free, public healthcare services for all throughout the EU, which is not the case as things stand, due to the macroeconomic approach of the Stability and Growth Pact.
In some countries there have been serious backward steps, as is the case in Portugal at the moment, and this is exacerbating poverty and social exclusion.
We have therefore tabled a number of amendments to the joint resolution, which will hopefully be adopted.
On this World Health Day, what is needed, Commissioner, is for this debate to be followed up by action.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the EU we have an expanding need for well-trained committed doctors, nurses, therapists and technicians.
Population-ageing, increases in the incidence of disease and increases in the treatments for them mean a greater demand for workers in the health sector.
But we should not just consider our need for healthcare, but the needs of those who deliver it.
Their first need is to be safe.
We must do everything to protect them from diseases and accidents, especially needle-stick and exposure injuries.
It is almost a tradition to overwork doctors and nurses, but tired, stressed staff are far more prone to dangers.
Vaccines have a part to play in protecting healthcare workers, but we must, in mandating immunisations for our healthcare workers, acknowledge and compensate those who have suffered debilitating adverse reactions.
In Ireland we have seriously restricted, and still restrict, the number of young Irish people who train for medicine, nursing, pharmacology and the therapies.
When we â as we inevitably do â experience shortfalls in services, we solve the problem by hiring people from other countries.
We can now afford to do this and these excellent professionals are a boost to our health service.
Our hospitals and our health services are staffed by health workers from India, the Philippines, South Africa and many other countries.
I have been told by some of them that they see working in an EU country as a great opportunity, but I wonder if we ever give a thought to those left behind, especially to the sick.
Healthcare migration is certainly to our benefit, but as lives are saved in developed countries, they are lost in less developed countries.
A Zambian Government official described to me the difficulty Zambia has in retaining doctors.
Its government sends promising students to the EU to train, but once the training is complete they either do not return or when they do they find that their highly technical training relates very poorly to work in settings with little equipment and few drugs.
They leave in frustration.
We must address this problem urgently.
This brings me to my last point.
I would like to ask what competence Members think we have to condemn another sovereign nation because its country refuses to fund projects it disagrees with.
I am referring to the US-Mexico City policy of requiring that NGOs agree, as a condition of receiving US funds, that they should neither perform nor promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.
In condemning the way the US is spending its foreign aid, Amendment 5 presumes a mandate that this House and this Union simply do not have.
Â Â  Every year on 7 April, we commemorate World Health Day.
This year, it will be devoted to health workers, who will form the focus of the commemorations for the next decade.
Even though the worldâs problems include a shortage of medical staff in developing countries, as well as malaria and HIV, we in the EU are also facing major problems in the healthcare sector, particularly in the new part of the European Union.
Following accession to the EU, the ten new Member States have been experiencing a âbrain drainâ in the form of a massive migration of doctors and nurses to Western Europe.
As a result, there is a shortage of doctors in the new Member States.
We have chiefly lost young multilingual people, who have decided to work in the western part of the European Union, attracted there by better conditions.
The chances of them coming back are extremely slim.
Sadly, as we observe World Health Day, a major strike was announced in one of the largest hospitals in Slovakia, and more hospitals are joining in one by one.
The motivation for this strike arises from the intolerable working conditions which our doctors and nurses have to endure.
A doctor in Slovakia is paid anywhere between EUR 350 to EUR 500 a month, while a nurse brings home EUR 250 to 300 EUR.
Under these circumstances, it comes as something of a surprise that our highly qualified personnel are willing to remain in their home country at all.
They receive EUR 2 per hour for night shift work, which is truly shameful.
We must therefore see to it that these people get adequate pay.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to welcome those who have taken this initiative, and there are many involved in the decision-making chain, and it therefore seems to me to be exceptional.

I would like to talk about two issues in particular; firstly, the problem of training in the place of origin.
I believe that one of Europeâs problems is that we have not drawn up any strategy on the policy of aid relating to health, and in particular training.
On the one hand, I believe that we in Europe have been implementing a very self-centred policy of in the majority of universities and nursing schools, in order to guarantee employment for our students, without taking account of the fact that the prospects and needs of Europe were going to exceed our capacity to provide care; that is why doctors and nurses from other countries are needed.
This is clearly leading to the drain that is being talked about so often today.
At the same time, however, I believe that, in the development aid strategy, universities should be created alongside hospitals.
The investment policy must not be restricted to roads, but must also consider hospitals and human resources training.
Furthermore, there must be a specific programme which offers results.
Furthermore, there is one issue that is of great concern to me, because I have seen it first-hand: the difficulties in the distribution of medicines and the corruption that exists in their distribution.
We are aware of the difficulties faced by hospitals on the ground, in Cameroon and in other countries, in carrying their work and accessing medicines, and that frequently the people distributing medicines for combating AIDS, which are being sent free of charge, are adding additional costs to them.
Within this context, I believe that, in its programmes, Europe must allocate more money to training, but at the same time control the distribution of aid much more effectively and prevent that corruption, which is a permanent obstacle, thereby putting to an end to the frustration of the people treating the sick.
Â Â  Mr President, it is an interesting statistic that there are more nurses from Malawi living in Manchester, in the United Kingdom, than there are living in Malawi; and there are more doctors from Ethiopia living in Chicago than there are in Ethiopia.
There is an estimated global shortage of 820Â 000 doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Obviously human resources are a central part of all human healthcare systems, but the reality is that the recruitment of health professionals and the scourge of HIV/Aids are continuing to prolong the crisis already afflicting very fragile healthcare systems in developing countries.
Many leave developing countries â as you said, Commissioner â because in developing countries they earn low wages, have poor working conditions, little prospect of advancement and a lack of training.
In addition they have the pressure of dealing with high numbers of patients with HIV/Aids and other very difficult diseases.
This brain drain is the major obstacle to providing quality care in Africa.
Countries are losing the most qualified and experienced nurses.
Last year Kenya lost 3000 graduate nurses to other countries, mostly to the United States and the United Kingdom.
There is a net flow of skills away from Africa, where individuals make decisions to go where they can earn and where they can take their careers forward.
Many women that I have met across the United Kingdom working in elderly care centres, etc., are doing so because they want to earn money in order to send money back to care for their children in the countries where they come from.
A consequence is that that the losing nations do not have that skill space that they need to educate their young people and develop their own economies.
We in the European Union have to look at ways to compensate those countries that are being so drained of the skills that they need.
I welcome the Commissionâs urgent attention to the crisis.
We hope that we will see strategies â and that is the next step â that can deal with the root causes of the problem we are talking about this evening.
That problem is that in spite of the terrible burden of disease there, Africa only has 0.6% of the worldâs registered healthcare workers.
How can that be acceptable when the healthcare and disease pressures are so enormous there?
I am concerned by Commissioner Frattiniâs recent proposal to promote the recruitment of highly educated immigrants, including the creation of a âgreen cardâ for researchers, engineers and doctors.
Parliament must call for an active end to the recruitment of health workers.
It rightly calls for the European Union to press for a global code of conduct on ethical recruitment.
Commissioner, would you subscribe to the view that this is something that the Commission should do in order to try to deal with this crisis, which is what this eveningâs debate is all about?
The other side of the coin is that in Europe we have an ageing population and we have declining birth rates.
We are therefore trying to suck in the health workers from other countries in order to deal with our own problems.
Raising wages to levels comparable with the industrialised world is very difficult for developing countries, but funding must be targeted at the health system and efforts must be made to decentralise healthcare and to support regional development.
I also believe â and no-one else has mentioned this, but it is in the resolution â that tele-medicine is a very important way of dealing with this issue.
I was recently in Mauritania and saw how, in a very small hospital in a desert area of that country, health workers were making contact with French doctors in order to have some consultation on diagnoses for patients.
That is something we could also look at investing in, in a more serious way than we do currently.
With regard to nurse practitioners, nurses should be given more status in developing countries than they now have.
That is very important, as it is to look at what countries such as Uganda are doing, which is to decentralise the health service and take it out of the main cities, into the rural areas.
If we are actually going to deliver on the Millennium Development Goals we have a huge task.
In relation to health, it is a major task and we need to make a contribution.
In relation to the financial perspectives we are now discussing, we really do not have the options to deliver on the debates and on the commitments that you have discussed this evening.
Â Â  Mr President, good health is invaluable and it is thus not surprising that in the developed world we invest so much in healthcare and we expect to receive the best treatment whenever the need arises.
But to have an effective healthcare system in operation, we need healthcare workers, people who are well trained, committed, and who are devoted to the care of their fellow human beings.
The healthcare workers are the backbone of our health systems and to them we owe more than words can express.
However, the case with the developing world regarding health is, unfortunately, completely and shamefully different.
There, good health is mostly the exception rather than the rule.
Allow me to give you some figures in order to illustrate the point.
One index figure that can be used to assess health provision in a country is, as has already been mentioned, the infant mortality rate.
That is a measure of how many infants die per 1000 live births.
The infant mortality rate in a country like Sweden, Germany or France â in fact most EU States â is around five deaths per 1000 live births.
The corresponding figure in countries like Mozambique, Sierra Leone and Liberia is about 140 deaths per 1000 live births, and in Angola it is about 200 deaths per 1000 live births.
In other words, the chance of an infant dying in Angola is about 4000% more than it is in an EU country.
A premature or ill baby in Angola has a next to nil chance of surviving.
In many Third World countries basic healthcare is almost totally lacking and the few brave health workers who find themselves in those countries have to battle against all the odds to save life and limb.
They have to cope with lack of infrastructure, lack of equipment, lack of medicines and a lack of understanding of hygiene by the population.
Very often they are persecuted, arrested, tortured or murdered when caught up in local wars or social uprisings.
In these areas, to be a health worker should be regarded as being a hero.
These people deserve not just our admiration and respect but our active support, and we must do our utmost to provide them with all the help they need.
We owe it to them and we owe it to our conscience.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motto of World Health Day is âWorking together for healthâ; yet, unfortunately, not much of this cooperation remains.
Cooperation primarily means âbrain drainâ.
We have heard dramatic, affecting figures today; figures that should make us feel ashamed, as they make it clear that Europe is faced with a crisis in the health sector that it is not tackling at the roots â here in Europe â but is trying to solve by means of the brain drain from these countries.
The main health issue in Europe is the fight against lifestyle-related diseases, which are attributable to nutritional and environmental factors; whereas the situation in developing countries is that people are dying of diseases that are actually curable, for example in childbirth â women are developing fistulas as a result of giving birth â or that, as has just been reiterated, there is quite simply a lack of paediatric vaccines and the most essential measures are not being taken.
At the same time, we know that demographic developments will only intensify the problem.
As a result of our ageing society, there is a lack of people going into the caring professions.
That is why I also believe that the EU needs to show foresight in taking action at long last to counter this dramatic development.
The financial resources have already been mentioned.
We have spoken a good deal about African countries today, but I have the impression that, particularly in development policy, resources are being poured into other countries.
We have heard today that the Commission does not have a strategy â the example of the green card has just been given again.
The Commissioner has presented us with fine words today, but her colleagues in other fields of competence often do the opposite or pursue policies that support this very development instead of tackling it and contributing towards a solution.
The Commission has also been silent on the subject of the disputes over patents for AIDS drugs in Africa.
The EU should have been vocal in condemning pharmaceutical giants who look on as people die an agonising death as a result of patents.
I hope that the Commissionerâs words are followed by action.
What we need is not fine words because World Health Day is approaching, but a strategy, a real solution to the problem.
I hope that we have made a start here this evening and that this has been a new departure.
After all, we were all in agreement on the objective: that what we need is real action to tackle the problem.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, âWorking together for healthâ is a lovely motto for World Health Day, as long as it is also taken seriously by all those making speeches, producing press releases or conveying messages on the occasion of 7Â April.
In this respect, I should like to endorse the previous speakerâs words.
This is all the more applicable when it comes to health workers, to whom World Health Day 2007 is devoted.
In my view, therefore, Parliament also needs to address the problem that âWorking together for healthâ and the improvement of working conditions for health workers in the EU are not really being taken seriously.
The reverse is true.
I should like to make just four remarks, therefore.
The first is that the debate on the Working Time Directive and on health-care reforms has worsened, and is continuing to worsen, the working conditions for health workers.
I should like to remind the House of the dispute on the recognition of on-call duty as working time that is still ongoing, and of the strike by German hospital staff that has been going on for weeks and is paralysing many hospitals in Germany and thus also seriously impairing care for the people.
The access of millions of people to health services is being restricted or complicated, and is by no means being improved or safeguarded.
My second remark is that, despite the enlargement of the EU and the growing health problems, the health and consumer protection appropriations in the budget adopted by the European Council in DecemberÂ 2005 have been cut in comparison with the present period.
My third remark is that, even though the Spring Summit of the Heads of State or Government on the Lisbon Strategy is being held just a few days before the annual World Health Day, health issues play only a secondary role there.
What is at issue is greater competitiveness, greater strain and stress for the individual; which, of course, are known to be detrimental to the health of the majority of the population.
I should like to take the liberty of making a fourth remark at this juncture.
The day before yesterday, the Commission opened the public consultation on the creation of a European defence equipment market.
This makes clear the real political importance of todayâs debate on World Health Day.
Arms are a direct route to the destruction of health.
In this context, however, I should also like to draw attention to the growing importance of military aspects in development policy, whose principal purpose is actually supposed to be the improvement of public health in poor countries.
From my point of view, there is enough cause â and also material â here for a discussion aiming at improving the health of people living in the EU and boosting the EUâs contribution to improving global health.
In this connection, I should also like to make an explicit plea for a study of the alternative world health report, which pleads, in particular, for the extension, qualitative improvement and democratisation of the public-health field.
It describes health workers as the lifeblood of health care.
The matter of primary importance is not cost, capital or dubious productivity, therefore, but the qualified, responsible commitment of health workers, because their personalities, their professional and social competence, and also their opinions and suggestions should count.
For this reason, I propose a public consultation of health workers, asking them the following questions.
In your opinion, what is the most common cause of illness, or particularly detrimental to public health?
What is the thing that most hinders you from making maximum use of your know-how for the benefit of public health?
In your opinion, what needs to be changed about the political framework to enable you to work better and improve public health?
From your perspective, what should the EU do to boost its contribution to global health, to overcoming HIV/AIDS and epidemics, and to combating the effects on health of hunger, shortages of drinking water and environmental degradation?
Â Â  MrÂ President, the slogan for this yearâs World Health Day is âWorking Together for Healthâ.
As we are all aware, health is a multifaceted issue.
I could refer to the medical and social dimensions involved, but its political dimension is particularly significant.
Health is therefore not simply an issue for individual human beings.
The health of each and every one of its citizens should be a top priority for every state.
It is unacceptable to reduce financial resources, thus depriving millions of people of essential medical care and worsening the situation of the poorest and most vulnerable social groups.
In particular, it is also unacceptable to deprive those who cannot stand up for themselves of the care they need, or to drastically cut such care.
I have in mind unborn children, the elderly and the seriously ill.
Simply launching one appeal after another and celebrating World Health Days is not enough.
Health workers need to be properly trained.
For these individuals, devotion to the health sector is both a service and a calling.
Without them, it is impossible to guarantee effective health care, and now I am not referring exclusively to the poorer countries.
Against the background of contemporary globalisation and rampant liberalism, it is especially important to bring ethical and moral principles to bear on medicine and heath care, thus enabling each individual to be treated with dignity and respect, and his or her health to be promoted.
Essentially, the underlying problem afflicting contemporary health care is a world vision governed by a materialistic approach to life.
This means that financial, business and economic interests have free rein, to the detriment of the life and health of human beings.
The huge economic divide between the new Member States and the older ones, where salaries are exponentially higher and working conditions are outstanding, has resulted in the emigration of well-qualified medical workers.
In Poland at least the conditions for professional training and development are quite favourable, but likely remuneration is unattractive, hence the brain drain.
I am concerned about the nature of a potential proposal on the introduction of an ethical recruitment code.
I wonder what kind of criteria would be laid down in such a code so as to make it easier or harder for workers to emigrate.
I very much hope any such criteria would not be content-related, so that poor countries do not lose even more outstanding specialists.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as has been brought to our attention today, European health services are in a most unsatisfactory state, but things are far worse in Africa.
One of the key issues to be dealt with concerning Africa is ensuring that AIDS victims benefit from generic medicines.
The latter are certainly much cheaper, but they are still too expensive for Africans.
MrÂ Bowis raised another important issue relating to Africa, namely encouraging individuals trained in Europe to return to their home countries where they are sorely needed.
What needs to be done in Europe is to increase the mobility of both patients and medical services.
In Poland, for example, it is hard for nurses to find a job paying more than EURÂ 250 a month, whilst in Belgium hospital wards are being closed due to a shortage of nurses.
In addition to mobility, it is important to harmonise recognition of medical and paramedical qualifications.
In general, Europe lacks a common health strategy and policy.
Finally, I would like to mention the issue of additional investment in research programmes, for instance those working on cancer.
It is shameful that such programmes have to be funded by events on television.
The money ought to be coming instead from national budgets or perhaps European programmes.
We proved capable of mobilising ourselves to respond to the sudden threat of avian influenza, but we do not seem able to overcome deadly diseases that have been with us for a very long time.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the right to health is a universal value.
Extraordinary progress has been made over the past 50 years.
At the same time, however, costs have not stopped rising, yet we have a great deal of trouble admitting that prevention costs much less than cure.
We are experiencing an actual health crisis due to a lack of foresight and in particular due to a purely accounts-based approach to health policy.
The right to health is a universal value, as I said.
It is not only Europe that is affected; the entire world is, too, with developing countries the hardest hit.
The consequence of the well-documented shortage in the training of medical staff â doctors, nurses, and so forth â in the EU is that Member States turn to doctors from developing countries, thereby exacerbating the shortage in those countries.
I should like to make three main points.
Firstly, it is necessary to train health workers in developing countries and to channel every effort into ensuring that they stay. For this to happen, there needs to be better planning of medical systems in Europe and the United States.
Secondly, over several decades there have been some terrible pandemics in the world.
Developing countries are the most vulnerable because they have neither the resources for information and awareness raising, nor sufficient medicines to stem diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This is purely down to a lack of personnel.
Thirdly, I would have liked our resolution to be more precise on certain key points, for example the availability of medicines.
Here too, in my view, the lack of personnel is crucial in that no one is there to act as a focal point.
I therefore welcome the measures taken by some European businesses, which, in a show of solidarity with the people of these countries, distribute essential medicines or vaccines.
Given that we are aware of the difficulty of carrying out such distribution in countries where there is a shortage of infrastructure and qualified personnel and where there is sometimes a complete lack of political will, the inescapable conclusion is that the EU must do all it can to support these measures and in fact must go further.
Sadly, the Commissionâs proposals are woefully inadequate, and things are not about to improve on the back of the famous agreement on the financial perspective.
Who is bearing the brunt of this?
The most serious aspect of this is that the main victims of our shortcomings are vulnerable people, including women and children.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the day after tomorrow, 7Â April, is World Health Day, which this year is devoted to health workers.
This is a good opportunity to call for fair, good working conditions for these workers and draw attention to the existing shortage of such workers.
When we talk of fair, good working conditions, we are not just talking about developing countries, of course, although we focus special attention on these, but also about Europe, and the forthcoming discussion on the Working Time Directive, in particular â which has already been mentioned today â will reveal how seriously Europe and this Parliament take fair working conditions for people in this field and the importance accorded to high-quality public and health services.
The shortage of health workers is a global phenomenon, and has numerous causes: the Commission points this out and so does the resolution that we shall be adopting tomorrow.
It has also been discussed in great detail how developing countries, in particular â African countries being the worst example â suffer as a result of the brain drain: of rich countriesâ recruitment measures.
In my opinion, an important point as regards the shortage of health workers is being obscured.
Many countries are saving on public spending, and consequently important posts are lacking in the health and social services sector, too â either lying vacant or not being created in the first place.
Many preach the virtues of the slimline, almost anorexic state, but they do not mention its impact on the functioning of the health system.
I hope that AmendmentÂ 6 will be adopted by a majority tomorrow, so that we have a comprehensive analysis of the shortage of health workers in the various countries of this earth.
Health services in developing countries have also suffered as a result of the drastic budget cuts in the social sector arising from macroeconomic reforms such as structural adjustment programmes.
The international financial institutions need to reconsider policies such as continuously putting emphasis on the privatisation of public-sector activities in developing countries.
AmendmentÂ 7 reveals another key reason for the shortage of health workers and for inadequate health spending by developing countries, African countries in particular.
I certainly do not wish to play down the reasons such as corruption or the lack of political will that have been given, but it is also true that these countriesâ external debts significantly reduce their scope for adequate spending in the social sector and on health.
Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals relate to health: reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and tackling HIV/AIDS.
The international community, including the EU, must ensure that sufficient financial resources are available for tackling HIV/AIDS.
We know that only some of the financial commitments entered into at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development have in fact been honoured.
We also know that the proportions of the HIV/AIDS pandemic are far greater than was assumed at that time.
It is important to provide sufficient resources for promoting reproductive health, which is also the reason for my appeal for majority support from the House for AmendmentÂ 5.
In addition, MrsÂ Hall has already pointed out how this HIV/AIDS pandemic is neutralising the investments of many African countries.
Â Â  Mr President, World Health Day reminds us that access to health is the single most desirable goal that all humans wish to reach.
Yet the range of challenges to global health today is wide and the prospects of achieving the international goals are daunting.
Annually four million children die before they are one month old.
Another four million children die from diarrhoea or pneumonia.
Malaria is responsible for at least another million child deaths, and in total more than ten million children die every year as a result of conditions for which we have effective interventions.
These problems are outrageous in the context of global wealth in the 21st century.
Yet there are new challenges to health associated with the accelerated globalisation of the markets, such as SARS and avian flu.
In many countries HIV/Aids has already begun to destroy the modest progress made since the 1980s and is today threatening the survival of entire societies.
The worldâs response, while impressive relative to other areas, is far from that which is required.
But not all is bleak.
The world has also witnessed unprecedented progress in science and knowledge and today we know how to address the great majority of the worldâs disease burden.
Many of the solutions are cheap and low-tech.
Even greater, therefore, is the responsibility upon us, the imperative to focus on how these interventions can be delivered to those who need them.
Health is at the very heart of the Millennium Development Goals and it must be recognised by all that health is central to development and to the fight to reduce poverty, as well as an important measure of human wellbeing.
The clear message coming out of 2005 and the Millennium Development Goals is that of health systems.
We will only start to make real progress when we finally get serious about health systems.
Without the basic systemic capacities in place in all countries, it will not be possible to do what politically has already been agreed upon: to scale up disease prevention and controlled programmes for reducing child and maternal mortality and roll back HIV/Aids, TB and malaria.
Central to each and every health system are the people working in it and for it; having the right workers with the right skills in the right place doing the right things is fundamental to being able to address the full range of health challenges in a country.
However, these elements also include health stewardship â the range of functions carried out by governments as they seek to achieve health objectives, sustainable health financing, efficient and effective health service delivery and the application of health knowledge, technology and infrastructure.
While the lack of health workers is of particular urgency, the overall task is to improve all these aspects simultaneously.
Â Â  According to a saying â also used in my country â âmoney can buy everything except good health'.
At the same time, we know fully well that, unfortunately, health is often a matter of money.
This is certainly true of public health.
This is the problem we are facing, when the World Health Day this year draws our attention to the shortage of health workers throughout the world.
According to WHO, the shortage is caused by the fact that the training, remuneration, working conditions and management systems of health workers have been underfinanced for several decades.
Moreover, due to demographic changes, there will probably be an increasing demand for doctors in Europe.
The absolute lack of money is only one part of the problem faced by public health.
The other is the lack of appreciation for health workers in society and the lack of prestige of the profession.
The number of those training to be doctors and nurses is constantly decreasing, because their average remuneration and social perception are not proportional with the difficulties and importance of their vocation.
Therefore, appreciation for public health must be restored as soon as possible.
The migration of health workers is already a considerable problem.
A part of the shortage of doctors in England is supplemented with doctors from Hungary, where the shortage is supplemented by doctors and nurses arriving from Romania; Romania is trying to replace them with doctors and nurses from the Republic of Moldova.
And the long list could be continued.
It is obvious that the concerns are more serious in developing countries, but there is much to be done in Europe, too.
Another aspect of the concerns experienced in the area of remuneration is the widespread gratuity system in certain Member States.
This is both legally and morally unacceptable, it is humiliating both for patients and doctors, and it also creates further inequalities in the public healthcare system.
Therefore this should be eliminated as soon as possible.
Overall, we must provide more money and create more appreciation and clearer conditions to ensure that our public health standards throughout Europe do not deteriorate in the coming years, but on the contrary, they improve.
I hope that the World Health Day will draw our attention even more to this important area, and will bring the solution closer.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall focus on three points, because a great deal has been said with which I agree.
The first point is that we need to concentrate our attention today, as we debate World Health Day, on prevention.
Prevention and investing large amounts in prevention is very important, because it allows the incidence of disease to be limited and, by extension, the cost of treatment and hospital care to be reduced, with obvious beneficial results both for citizens and for the public purse.
Improving the health of the population without doubt boosts progress, fortifies citizens by safeguarding a longer, better and more productive life and is the precondition to economic prosperity.
Second point: I should like us to focus our attention on those who have given us innovative treatments, innovative medication, inoculations and, in general, the knowledge to combat diseases and those who work with the sick â doctors, nurses and all health workers â and we must apply ourselves in this sector, to see where the gaps are, so that we can have adequacy in this sector.
Of course, we will also need to use new knowledge and technologies, such as telemedicine, which is important if we are to offer a modern service.
Finally, the third point is the inequalities which exist today in the sector of the supply of health services.
Even within the European Union there are inequalities and, of course, there are inequalities on the planet at the moment; we have deaths, we have a high incidence of disease and I think that the European Union should apply itself to this issue and invest money in this sector, because noÂ one can be happy in the middle of unhappiness.
With these three points, and agreeing with everything said by my honourable friends, I too should like to pay homage to the people who work with the sick and offer these excellent services.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this year, World Health Day is devoted to health workers.
There are 35Â million health workers worldwide, approximately 4Â million of whom are in Germany, and well in excess of 12Â million in the EU.
These figures alone show that the South of our planet has far from satisfactory provision.
There is a clear divide between the developed and the developing world as regards peopleâs chances of receiving health-care services.
In the short term, it would be entirely appropriate to provide twice or several times as many resources as emergency assistance.
What is indispensable, however, is an increase in human resources â in both Europe and the developing world.
Given the short time available, I should like to discuss just the conditions in Europe.
The previous speakers have already commented on the developing world, and they have my full support.
I should like to select four European issues.
Firstly, the ageing of our society brings with it new challenges, new illnesses, new treatment procedures and a growing need for nursing and care that we are already losing the ability to fully cover.
Secondly, an improvement in the skills and quality of the health professions in Europe is needed if we are to meet the excellence criteria we set ourselves.
A dramatic increase in the training figures in all fields of the health service is needed if we are to meet these demands.
Thirdly, we need to enhance our cooperation within the Union.
Although health policy plays a subordinate role, positive intervention is called for on our part.
Health policy must not be reduced to monetary aspects â even if these words are sure to make the ears of my colleagues in Berlin burn.
Fourthly, we need to preserve the health of health workers by means of reasonable working hours and workloads and reduce cases of exhaustion.
In this connection, I would appeal to the Commission to adopt Parliamentâs position on the Working Time Directive.
Â Â  Mr President, the theme of World Health Day, which takes place the day after tomorrow, is employees in the healthcare sector.
This yearâs subject is very pertinent, since we are facing the threat of a worldwide pandemic.
The problems associated with availability of healthcare staff and working conditions affect both the developing and the industrialised countries.
Focusing attention on the status of healthcare staff is the right way to get to grips with the causes of health problems and to try and prevent them.
Investing in preventive work is always the best option as far as both people and the economy are concerned.
It makes sense to invest resources in everyday structures that support peopleâs health, and not just in corrective work.
We need the political will to recognise the needs of healthcare staff and address them.
Educated doctors and nurses save human lives.
Unless their professional skills are appreciated and given support, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, for example, will not be achieved.
That appreciation must also be reflected in pay and working conditions.
The skills of healthcare personnel staff are being especially put to the test with new threats to health such as bird flu.
Healthcare professionals must in all circumstances be sure that their working conditions are not needlessly exposed to infection.
A possible global pandemic would also mean that staff would be confronted with difficult ethical questions.
Even though it may be a basic premise that everyone is vaccinated and receives the drugs they need, there may come a situation where, for example, part of a vaccination batch is missing.
Questions of healthcare prioritisation call for fundamental ethical debate as a basis on which to work.
With the threat of pandemics, the developing countries are in a particularly difficult situation, as malaria and HIV are already causing untold havoc.
I strongly agree with the calls in the resolution to improve the focus for development cooperation so that it is used for human and social development.
Â Â  On the occasion of the World Health Day, please allow me to call your attention to another significant day, the International Roma Day, celebrated on 8 April.
I would like to talk about the Roma.
The Roma population is young: they have a high birth rate and a high mortality rate.
The life expectancy of the European Roma is ten years shorter than that of the majority populations.
The number of Roma patients is several times higher than the average number of majority population patients: the number of TB patients is ten times higher, the number of patients with tumorous diseases is four times higher, iron deficiency and blood system disorders are ten times higher, the number of cerebrovascular disorders is six times higher, the number of patients suffering from essential hypertension is four times higher, and the number of patients with heart disease is fifteen times higher today in Europe.
Unfortunately, although these data have been taken from a Hungarian report, they reflect the general picture across Europe.
One of the many reasons for the life expectancy of Roma being ten years shorter than that of the non-Roma is the discrimination experienced in the public health system.
And this is where I need to mention the issue that many of you have already brought up today: the training provided for health workers.
Are they sufficiently trained to treat their patients without any discrimination?
(Unfortunately, we cannot talk much today about Roma patients and doctors.
I would have gladly joined in this topic, too, but unfortunately I cannot do it.)
We celebrate the International Roma Day on 8 April all over the world, and in connection with this we accepted a resolution in the European Parliament last year, in which we called attention to the worrying health situation of the Roma.
In the year that has passed, neither the European Commission nor the Member State governments have taken any corrective measures in the public health sector, or in order to eliminate the unemployment affecting the Roma or their exclusion from the economic, housing and education sector.
We are asking the European Commission to release a Green Paper as soon as possible on the intolerable situation of the Roma, in order to eliminate their exclusion from public health, and to ensure that the extremely poor quality healthcare services provided to them are brought up to European standards.
Â Â  Mr President, this is perhaps one of the most important debates we have had in this House.
I am sorry that because of the late hour there are not more people here to listen to the appalling statistics of deaths of young children, of mothers â needless deaths from illnesses that we could cure so easily.
I want to thank the Commission and my colleagues for highlighting the terrible ills that face us in the world and for trying to raise awareness of the appalling vista that lies ahead.
I come from Ireland, a country from which not so long ago we were exporting nurses because there were no jobs for them.
Today, sadly, we are now importing people into the health-care sector in large numbers because we have such a shortage of skills.
We are not thinking about the countries we are robbing of their people, because our motives are selfish: we need to look after our own.
Yet, even when we take in people from outside, we see in our accident and emergency departments, on a daily basis, people who in many respects are in Third World conditions, lying on trolleys in unacceptable conditions.
So the problems are first-hand and they are all-pervasive.
I was in Malawi last year.
I witnessed what one of my colleagues has already spoken about: the lack of nurses â who are now in Manchester â and the appalling effects this is having in that country.
It is hard to know what the answers are, but perhaps we should look at the job of the health-care workers and value what they do more than we do at the moment â in terms also of respecting and rewarding them.
It was asked how we can compensate the developing world for having taken their best.
There is a huge moral question about how we reject the rest, but take the best.
We must not do nothing.
We are moving on to a debate on avian influenza and market support measures.
Heaven help us if we have a human pandemic and see how stretched our health-care services will be worldwide.
I should like to read out what the World Health Organization wants us to do on Friday, the day we are talking about: âraise awareness of this chronic problemâ â the crisis concerning health-care workers â âand to build support to ensure that health workers will be working where they are needed, when they are needed, with the right skills to provide the highest attainable level of health for people everywhereâ.
I hope we achieve this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very impressed by the passionate contributions on this very important issue.
The process that the Commission is leading to develop an EU response to the human resources crisis demonstrates the strength of greater European coordination.
The collective commitment of Member States and of the Commission is likely to have a much greater impact than the Commission or Member States working alone.
The response to the human resources crisis reflects the principle set out in .
It is the Member Statesâ commitment to increase the overall levels of development assistance, moving towards the target of 0.7% of GNI as ODA, that will provide the increasing budget for accelerated progress.
But it is the coordinated efforts of the European Community that will ensure that the increased resources are more efficiently spent, providing coordinated, coherent backing for country-led and developed plans.
We believe that better coordinated and more coherent implementation of our common European policy, reflecting the commitments made in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, provides the best means for a drastic increase in human and social development spending.
That needs to be prioritised by the Member States and reflected in our common policy.
That is why the Commission has proposed a package of concrete measures on aid effectiveness.
The package will allow the European Union to deliver more, faster and better aid.
At the Paris aid effectiveness meeting, the European Union made a commitment to increase the proportion of aid it provides as budget support.
That commitment includes the potential to increase funding for both general and sector budget support, complemented, if necessary, by project-type funding.
Delegations making programming decisions for the 10th EDF therefore have a choice of aid instruments with which to respond to nationally defined priorities.
There is considerable scope for the national decision-making and country programming processes to focus increased effort on the health or social sectors through sector budget support, if that is prioritised at country level.
I should just like to answer some of the more specific questions that have been raised.
On the question of a code of conduct, I can confirm that the Commission is willing to consider how to develop and implement a European code of conduct for the ethical recruitment of health workers.
On the question of tailored medicine, which was raised by two Members, we are currently supporting a study on the potential of trying to make better use of the available efforts as part of our partnership with the African Union.
Corruption is indeed a problem for development and particularly damaging for the delivery of key social services, such as health.
As you know, we agreed on the need to address that problem through a whole range of measures.
Tomorrow we will have plenty of time to have a more in-depth discussion, when we discuss MrÂ van den Bergâs excellent report on the issue.
Several Members have mentioned the question of the proportion of development funds that is allocated to human and social development.
Most Commission financing is allocated through country programming.
Currently, over 20% of the Commissionâs development budget is allocated to social infrastructure.
In addition, general budget support financing includes linkage to progress measured against health indicators and is therefore a mechanism for supporting and reinforcing country-level prioritisation of the Millennium Development Goals.
The Commission will be increasing the proportion of development assistance given as budget support and will seek to increase the link between budget support and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.
The decision on the proportion of financing allocated by countries to human and social development is ultimately a question for national governments.
The Commission will continue in its policy dialogue with governments to emphasise the importance of human and social development for economic growth and for poverty reduction.
Â Â  â To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2)(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the proposal for a Council regulation amending regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 and (EEC) No 2777/75, as regards the application of exceptional market support measures (avian sector) (COM(2006)0153 â C6-0111/2006 â 2006/0055(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, in recent weeks and months we have been accustomed to frequent press coverage of new outbreaks of avian influenza.
The latest outbreak was confirmed today in a turkey farm in Saxony.
We have been able to follow the diseaseâs development on maps as we have seen it spreading from one country to another.
We are all affected either directly or indirectly.
We â and in particular the poultry sector â are faced with a real crisis situation, which requires a swift response.
That is why we are here tonight.
I would therefore, first of all, like to thank the European Parliament for having accepted the Commissionâs request for urgent procedure.
I am especially grateful to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Joseph Daul, as well as to the rest of the committee for their rapid contribution and opinion on the Commission proposal.
That is a clear testimony that when there is a need for us to act fast, we can do so.
The many cases of avian influenza in the European Union have not left us unaffected.
Even though mainly wild birds have been the victims of avian flu, it has already had a strong negative impact on European consumption of poultry in many Member States.
The impact on prices has varied from country to country, but in general prices have been under pressure and have in some cases fallen significantly.
