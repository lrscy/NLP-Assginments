Why should we, every five years, have a half-year period where the EU's work comes almost to a halt, while we first have the European elections and then an outgoing Commission that needs to be replaced by a new one that can only start work the following year in January?
It would be good to introduce this on a permanent basis and not just on this one-off occasion.
Secondly, the issue of the signing of the new Treaty that emerges from the Convention, containing a constitution.
It is fair enough that this has been set for May, when the new Member States will legally be members and can sign that new Treaty.
However, I would not like to see the new date being used as an excuse for having a long, drawn-out IGC from autumn 2003 to May 2004.
We must keep to the idea of having a short, sharp IGC in autumn 2003, with the participation of the new Member States, to approve the results of the Convention, which we hope will not need to be changed.
My third and final point is the question of the number of seats in this Parliament for Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Under the Nice plans they are allocated two seats fewer than Belgium, Portugal and Greece - although those countries have a comparable population with Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic and Hungary are right to ask for equality.
Whether that is achieved by cutting the number of seats for the three current states - which may be difficult - or by raising the number for Hungary and the Czech Republic, the issue must be addressed in the Accession Treaty.
It would be arrogance to attempt to sum up the Copenhagen Summit in two minutes.
I will therefore limit myself to a few points.
First and foremost, I would like congratulate the Danish Presidency - and these congratulations are not just formal, they come from the heart - on the skill with which it has brought lengthy negotiations to a successful close.
Secondly, we are witnessing an historic period of history, the full meaning of which we may not yet have grasped: for the first time in the history of mankind, a union of States is being built on the basis of a project of civilisation and shared values without recourse to military force.
This means that we, the European Parliament, and the Council and the Commission, must evaluate very carefully something which President Prodi mentioned, namely the fact that, at this juncture, now Europe has been built, we need to make the rules.
The rules of our founding fathers, the rules which were the basis for the development of the European Economic Community, now need very careful revision, revision which I am sure will be achieved by the Convention but which needs a further contribution.
I would like to quote a statesman who lived two centuries ago in Italy - Count Camillo Benso di Cavour - who said.
'We have made Italy, now we must make Italians!'
We have certainly made Europe at Copenhagen - now we have to make Europeans.
And to make Europeans we need this large-scale information campaign promoting Europe - which our President mentioned this morning - which has been announced many times but will have to be implemented practically in the coming months, for what is happening here must be by common agreement between all our fellow European citizens.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it has been said, and rightly so, that the Copenhagen Council put an end to the post-war division of Europe.
We also need to put an end to a much older division, by which I mean the difficulties preventing eastern Europe from moving from the Middle Ages to the present day, difficulties which condemned it to a period of endless stagnation and cost it dearly in terms of both money and blood.
It is time we paid our respects to the people of eastern Europe for their persistence and for their faith in the concept of progress, which I hope will be vindicated today.
There has been a parallel achievement in southern Europe.
It does not have the same material dimensions as eastern Europe, but it does have similar moral dimensions.
Look at Cyprus, an ancient European people, a Hellenic people, which found itself in the grip of a nineteenth century colonial regime and finally - and rightly - rebelled against it in the middle of the twentieth century.
As in numerous other instances, the consequences of that rebellion were - in English for the benefit of my British colleagues - an 'independence of sorts', but an independence accompanied by the partition of two nations, with the colonial power playing one off against the other on the basis of the classic principle of divide and rule.
Today's Europe, with the admission of Cyprus and the call for the island's two nations to be reunited, will remedy the tragic consequences of the colonial adventure in - or rather the retrogressive order which governed - this European country.
This is what is important, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, not the fact that no agreement was reached.
Of course, the Greek side responds fully to your call for an agreement to be reached by 27 February and, if there is a similar response on the Turkish side, an agreement will be reached.
But what you should really be looking at is the response in the hearts of the Turkish-Cypriots, whose demonstrations show exactly what they think of their reactionary leaders.
This is the real response and the real brilliance of Europe in the hearts of its people, when Europe sticks to its principles, and we must rely on this brilliance to move forward and build the future.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in closing the Copenhagen European Council which brought together the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen Member States, the President-in-Office, Mr Rasmussen, stressed the truly historic nature of this event which puts an end to the period of separation.
The subject of our work over recent days was a common vision for the future of our continent.
A stroke of good luck but also intense and extremely commendable work by the Union, and especially by the candidate countries, has meant that the enlargement process, launched in 1992 in the Danish capital and forming the basis of the famous political criteria, named after Copenhagen, on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, has been completed in the same place.
Look at how much progress has been made over the last 50 years! Look at how many barriers have been torn down, how many misunderstandings have been overcome!
Twenty-five - soon to be twenty-seven - States are finally working together to achieve the objectives of freedom, democracy and responsibility. Such cooperation honours the fight that millions of our predecessors waged at the price of intense suffering and sacrifice.
We still have a great deal of difficult ground to cover, no one has any illusions about this.
The European Union must, in particular, respond to the need to make fundamental changes to the way it works and to its institutions.
This is the work that the European Convention must bring to a successful conclusion under Mr ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing.
We hope that the European Convention will lead to a draft for a single constitutional treaty that is legible and which responds to the need for a Europe that is more efficient, more democratic and perceived to be more legitimate by all European citizens.
Unless we fundamentally reform the way in which the European Union currently works, Europe's reunification will lead to weaker political will within Europe and this is something that we certainly do not want.
Mr President, although the Copenhagen decision is indeed of historical significance, this is only one stage in the development of the European Union.
It has been said quite rightly today that enlargement of this Union must go ahead.
On the one hand, a number of countries - I am thinking here of the Balkan countries - await membership at a later date, and on the other, there are other countries with a well-founded claim to close partnership and equal status, by which I mean Russia and also the states bordering the Mediterranean.
An enlarged EU must, though, strike a new balance between flexible and efficient decision-making and the aspects of the decision-making structures that have to do with democratic policy-making.
Together with the representatives of the Council Presidency - I see that Mr Haarder is present - Parliament, the Council and the Commission are engaged in the search for a common basis for dialogue on better forms of governance.
Mr Haarder has gone to a great deal of trouble to provide a number of contributions. Even though he is now the representative of a government and no longer a member of this House, a certain awareness may be at work here.
The main thing, though, is that there are a number of governments that are far more restrictive than he wishes to be.
I see that as highly problematic, as not enough governments have made public commitments to transparency and public access, especially as regards their decision-making structures.
I would particularly like to thank President Prodi for the way in which the Commission has again presented a range of proposals that point a way forward to possibly better and, at the same time, more democratic ways of governing, principally indicating how the Council and Parliament can participate in lawmaking with equal rights.
Not all of the Commissioners have realised, however, that when this House delegates and cedes the power to make laws, we can, of course, do so only on certain conditions and in conjunction with a right of recall.
I hope, though, that the next conversations, which we will be having at the beginning of the Greek Presidency, will bring us a result.
I appreciate it when the Commission and the Council keep on reiterating their obligation to insist on adherence to the Treaties, but I ask them to acknowledge that we in this House have to insist on the principles of democracy being guaranteed by the legislators' participation in the process of drafting laws.

We will be having elections in 2004, which we will not win against each other; we can win them only with each other and only when we make it our real concern that there should be greater flexibility, greater efficiency, and also more democracy in the European Union.
Mr President, the historic decision taken by the Copenhagen Council will doubtless help to restore the unity of Europe lost after the war.
The accession of central and eastern European countries, together with Cyprus and Malta, is another step in the evolutionary process of the unique phenomenon we refer to as European integration and I should like to congratulate both the Danish presidency and the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen on their successful handling of the entire process.
I do not have much time so I will make just two comments.
First of all, because of the economic and financial repercussions of enlargement as the result of the accession of new Member States, the Union will have to be bold in adjusting its financial perspectives if they are to meet the demands both of enlargement and of its citizens and make an effective contribution to the stability and cohesion of the societies of the Member States, especially the new Member States.
Secondly, I should like to comment on the accession of Cyprus and, more particularly, the atmosphere surrounding the Copenhagen Council.
It seems to me that the Council satisfied all of us because it showed that Europe can manage its affairs both wisely and decisively, taking as its criterion the construction of a healthy, democratic structure in which human rights and the proper values of human society are respected.
We must not, however, forget that a solution to the problem still needs to be found and that Copenhagen was unable to find one because the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders refused to focus on a solution.
We must now make every effort and do all we can to bring about the integration of the whole island within the next two months.
However, I would point out that the solution to the Cyprus problem, however badly needed, must keep the fundamental principles of the Treaties of the European Union intact.
Any derogations from the acquis communautaire, any transitional arrangements included in the solution to the Cyprus problem must not leave factors which violate basic principles of the European Union behind once they expire.
I call on the European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, to keep a close watch to ensure that the solution does in fact abide by the Treaties of the European Union.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as rapporteur for the accession of Cyprus, I fully welcome the decision of the Copenhagen European Council to admit Cyprus to the European Union as a new Member State.
I would also like to congratulate the Commission and Council teams that negotiated the accession of Cyprus.
The European Council has therefore honoured the promise made at Helsinki to carry out accession, even in the absence of a political solution.
Our hope of seeing a reunited island joining the Union has not materialised.
We now know that neither lack of time nor external pressure can be cited as reasons why it is impossible to accept the UN Secretary-General's proposals as a basis for a global settlement.
The agreement was sabotaged by those who continue, even today, to advocate the existence of two separate States instead of one federal State, and who wish to see Cyprus join at the same time as Turkey, rather than in May 2004, as an independent and indivisible country.
Mr Denktash and his entourage are largely responsible for this failure, and I understand the frustration and anger of a large part of the Turkish Cypriot civil society as well as the opposition parties.
It is true that the two sides have committed to continue negotiations with a view to reaching a global settlement before the end of February; it is true that there is still the opportunity to bring down the last wall in Europe.
However, the mental barriers that the privileged few of Mr Denktash's regime still cling to will not disappear as if by magic because, for them, no solution is the solution.
Mr Denktash's stalling policy could very soon turn out to be a threat to Turkey's ambitions in Europe.
At present, there is still a last glimmer of hope that the European Union should bank on: the new Turkish Government could lay a major deal on the table and thus demonstrate that its declared intention to persevere along the path indicated by Europe is, in fact, genuine.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I count myself among those who wish to extend the warmest of congratulations to the Council Presidency on its success.
Whilst I think that what was achieved in Copenhagen will still be sending out signals long after the end of the summit and will be of great significance for European integration in the twenty-first century, I of course want to pour a certain amount of cold water on this achievement in order to enlarge on a few points.
The first topic that I wish to address is as follows. We are of course already expecting the Czech Republic to take the initiative in making an unambiguous statement, even before we are called upon to vote on its accession treaty in this Parliament.
In November, with reference to the Brok Report, Parliament expressed its position with perfect clarity.
Secondly, President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen, I would like to ask the Commission to give some thought to how we can work together to develop a sort of third way as regards Turkey.
How do we bridge the gap in time between monitoring the compliance with the criteria and the day when we actually discuss negotiations?
What types of cooperation can we offer that are in both Turkey's interests and our own?
I think these considerations make 2003 a very important year.
We should all - Council, Commission and Parliament - be working together on how a large number of individual projects, ranging from customs union to the common foreign and security policy, can enable us to achieve a new kind of co-existence with an important strategic neighbour.
My last topic, one that I want to address briefly, is the need for us to resist all the attempts at blackmail that are being made even from within the European Union.
I do not want to go into the details right now, but various Council working parties are meeting right now to resolve a problem for a Member State that joined in 1995.
I think there should be no support here for attempts at extortion on the part of Member States, and I am very grateful to the Council and to you, Mr President-in-Office, for not yielding to them.
Last Friday, 13 December, I went to the cinema to see Roman Polanski's film, 'The Pianist', the story of a Jewish musician from Warsaw who survived the Second World War in a miraculous way.
At the beginning of the film we see how his family reacts with relief to the news that the British and the French have announced that they will be coming to help the Poles following the invasion of Poland by the Germans.
We all know that nothing came of that help until last Friday, the thirteenth.
On that day the outcome at Copenhagen paid off an old debt. The success of Copenhagen is success for everyone - including for this Parliament, which has been so intensively involved in this process.
We can be proud of this result.
To paraphrase the words of the great social democrat Willy Brandt, something that belongs together is now really being given the opportunity to grow more closely together.
What started with Brandt's historic genuflection in that self-same Warsaw has now been completed in Copenhagen.
The credit for this new historic moment goes mainly to those who brought about the momentous changes in 1989 and 1990 and who were astute enough to make the most of the opportunity to turn the new democracies into fully-fledged EU candidate countries.
Many of those who were leaders at the time have now disappeared from the political stage, but the outcome of Copenhagen is also a tribute to them.
Of course, our own European Union also deserves to be congratulated, as it may well have taken a long time to formulate the starting points and preconditions for accession, but it has subsequently maintained the agreed scenario and adhered to the agreed timetable consistently and efficiently.
In this context I would like to pay particular tribute to Mr Verheugen's efforts.
The candidate countries are also deserving of praise.
Their staying power has really been put to the test.
As rapporteur for this Parliament for Slovakia, I myself have experienced the efforts made by the Slovaks to meet the EU's conditions at close hand.
They were far-reaching, and there was very little time.
The emphasis in the reports from the end of last week about the results of the Copenhagen Summit was on the financial arrangements for the negotiations and the Turkey question.
Both aspects are important, but they are not the only weighty matters.
Other problems also play a role in the European Parliament's final assessment that we have to issue for each candidate country.
It is enough in this case to remember our earlier concerns on matters like the battle against corruption, the lack of administrative capacity in the accession countries and the discrimination against the Roma.
Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Rasmussen, Mr Haarder, Mr Prodi and Mr Verheugen on this excellent outcome.
I would also like to join our group chairman, Mr Poettering, in emphasising that this small country has produced a great achievement.
This really means that we will not have to change this rotation system in the future.
Experience teaches us that big countries sometimes do not do things very well, and that small countries sometimes do things very well indeed.
I say to Denmark that you can be proud of the outcome.
Secondly I would like to make some comments on enlargement.
I am delighted that Poland has made it to the first group of accession countries.
This was of course not without problems.
It would also probably be a good idea - and I am addressing this to Mr Verheugen - to give the Member States an even better explanation of what enlargement is really going to cost us.
If we are aware that there is still a leeway of some EUR 25 billion before we reach the EU expenditure ceiling, and if we know that we will only be incurring costs of EUR 12 billion in the first year of enlargement, EUR 12.6 billion in the second year and EUR 14.9 billion in the third year, we will know that despite enlargement we will still have money left over in 2006.
We must therefore make it clearer that this enlargement is not expensive; in fact it is cheaper than all the enlargements that have gone before.
Thirdly , I would like to mention Cyprus and Turkey.
It is a pity that Cyprus has not been included in its entirety, but it is a good thing that we have made sensible arrangements with regard to Turkey, which does not yet have a date for accession, but will have to adhere explicitly to the arrangements agreed at Copenhagen and will be tested against them.
I think that this is very important.
Actually I wonder whether Turkey ever ought to accede, as we will then have to tackle the debate about Europe's borders at some stage.
My last comment is this: you had a visit from Mr Giscard d'Estaing, and I have the honour of being a member of the Convention.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing once again spoke about the president of the European Union and the congress that would have to be set up.
Those are his ideas.
I can tell you that there is really very little support for this in the Convention.
If we ever need a president of the European Union, it should be the president of the European Commission, and we do not need a European congress at all.
It is this European Parliament that needs more powers.
That is also what it says in the Benelux statement.
If all small countries endorse this, we will fortunately be able to consign this nonsense of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's to the scrap heap.
I hope, therefore, that Denmark will back this.
Mr President, the Danish presidency set itself an extremely ambitious agenda for the Copenhagen Summit.
As a result, two fraught days were spent in Copenhagen negotiating a financial package, with divisions at one stage threatening to stall proceedings.
However, once this had been resolved, the EU formally invited eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe, plus Cyprus and Malta, to join in 2004.
This was a momentous occasion in European history, finally bringing to an end the divisions created by the Cold War.
However, it must be said that enlargement is not yet complete.
Negotiations have still to be concluded with Bulgaria and Romania and have yet to begin with Turkey.
I endorse the commitment given at the Copenhagen Summit to start the negotiations with Turkey in 2004, subject, of course, to a review on progress on human rights and rule of law issues.
I have consistently argued that the accession of Turkey could form an important bridgehead between East and West and help consolidate Turkey as a secular democracy and a calming force in an otherwise unstable region.
As a result of these momentous decisions, our new neighbours will be Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
Now is the time to consider what sort of relationship we want to develop with these countries and how far we want it to go.
In conclusion, I am pleased that the recent uncertainty regarding the timetable for enlargement, which was partly due to our rejection of the Treaty of Nice in the first Irish referendum, has been removed.
It will now proceed in May 2004, ironically under the Irish presidency and indeed, Mr President, during your final six months as President of this Parliament.
I look forward to welcoming the new accession countries into the EU family on that historic occasion.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the year that is coming to its end has been a remarkable one for Europe.
The introduction of euro notes and coins has made the internal market a domestic one.
The Copenhagen resolutions have set in motion the process of ratification for enlargement as a precondition for the reunification of Europe, and have enabled the legacy of Yalta and of the post-war era to be overcome.
This move also has knock-on effects on all the Member States and candidate countries, including my own country, which possessed the longest external - and dead - border.
From Europe's margin, we have moved back, to be - as the Austrian national anthem puts it - like a heart at its centre.
Our task is to draw closer together, to build up Europe's stability and its capacity to act, to listen, to be desirous of mutual understanding, to tear down walls and cut through barbed-wire fences - wherever they were or will be set up.
Neither Copenhagen nor participation in the 2004 elections to Parliament bring the accession process to a conclusion.
Information, communication and reform continue to be needed.
The European projects call for the public to be more deeply involved, and not only prior to the ratification of treaties.
Far from being already at an end, the process of enlargement is moving forward, and I am thinking not only of Bulgaria and Romania, but also of Croatia and the countries of the former Yugoslavia, of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
As my final point, let me say that transit policy is evidence of the fact that the Danish Presidency, to which I am very grateful, is at work right through to its last day.
Let me tell you, as an Austrian, that we give the utmost support to the proposal to be found in COREPER, because it is right and good.
It is my expectation that a resolution will be passed at 3 p.m. this afternoon, or, failing that, at the extraordinary council of Transport Ministers on 31 December.
Let us put an end to transitional arrangements; let us establish European rules and introduce the infrastructure costs directive in 2003 at the latest!
- (DA) Mr President, first and foremost, I should like to express my thanks for a constructive and positive debate and for the many positive comments on the Danish Presidency in general and the course of the Copenhagen Summit in particular.
The Presidency views the cooperation it has enjoyed with Parliament as constructive and positive, and we are delighted to see that Parliament shares this view.
A number of questions have been posed, and so many subjects have been raised that it is impossible for me to comment on everything that has been said in the limited time available; but I should like to highlight a few subjects that many people have mentioned.
Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Verheugen to clarify something important.
Commissioner, let us assume that both sides in Cyprus agree to a solution based on the Annan plan by 28 February.
Provision has been made for a referendum to ask the people if they accept the plan and if they accept integration.
If one side, let us say the Greek-Cypriot side, rejects the referendum, what then?
Do we revert to the Copenhagen arrangements, which only make provision for the integration of the Republic of Cyprus?
Mr Alavanos, the United Nations peace plan includes a road map, which concludes with the proposal that the process should end with a referendum to be held in Cyprus' Greek and Turkish communities on the same day, and which would combine both questions, that is to say, approval of the resolution of the conflict and approval of membership of the European Union.
Consequently, the situation cannot arise in which membership of the European Union is approved, but not the political solution to the conflict in Cyprus, and so your question is hypothetical.
On the contrary, it is a fact that if, by a democratic process, the people reject accession to the European Union, we regret that very deeply, but, being a democratic institution, we have to respect it.
The debate is closed.
I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule (42)5
We voted against this report, which repeats the affirmation of the European Commission - even if the rapporteur distances himself from it - according to which 'labour costs are generally considered as the main potential source of inflation' in the eurozone.
The report states that establishing a European labour cost index would resolve a 'major weakness' of the economic and monetary Union.
Who are they trying to fool?
If there is a major weakness then it has to be the salaries of the overwhelming majority of European workers.
In the European Union, which is one of the richest regions on earth, the real standard of living of the working class has been declining for many years, beginning with that of tens of millions of workers that employers condemn to insecure employment, not to mention those who have been made unemployed!
For decades, all the policies of left- or right-wing governments and those of the European authorities have moved in this direction in order to increase the wealth of the ruling classes.
Do you want statistics?
In that case, publish the index of profits made by the European ruling classes thanks to the exploitation of their workers!
For the workers of Europe, it would be the exorbitant cost index of maintaining a capitalist system that is socially unjust, harmful to individuals and economically devastating!
The EC Treaty specifies that the European System of Central Banks shall have price stability as its principal objective.
So far, however, there has been no single instrument to record, transmit and evaluate labour costs, which constitute the most significant factor in price stability.
The Common Position that is before us will close this gap.
It is with satisfaction that I note that the rapporteur has given his approval to the Council draft, without tabling any new amendments.
Also to be welcomed is the idea, put forward in the Critical Appraisal, of developing a productivity index enabling increases in labour costs to be measured in relation to growth in productivity.
Our esteemed colleague could not, however, restrain himself from pointing out in his Critical Appraisal that he does not share the Commission's, and the Council's, viewpoint that labour costs are one of the largest sources of inflation.
I regret that I am unable to share the rapporteur's viewpoint.
If you want to understand the potential influence of total salary on changing prices, it is enough to consider the proportion of salary costs to the overall costs of any business, be it large or small.
The argument adduced by the rapporteur to the effect that salary increases are only the result of increases in the cost of living, is like the question of whether it was the chicken or the egg that came first.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
When prices increase, the value of wages decreases.
To protect themselves against this, the trade unions in many European countries have battled for years for indexing.
This means that it is not necessary to negotiate on compensation for the reduction in purchasing power every year but only on the extent to which workers should participate in productivity increases and on the making up of arrears suffered by some occupational groups who have been underpaid for years.
Pressure from employers' organisations and the support afforded by neo-liberal governments have in very many cases reversed this indexing.
This can result in increasing intransigence in wage disputes.
Attempts are repeatedly being made to place the blame for inflation or the lack of money for useful government expenditure on the shoulders of the workers.
This means that in the eyes of the Right and the employers, the economy will flourish only if a majority of the people accepts a creeping drop in purchasing power.
They do not consider the loss of domestic purchasing power that this can cause, or the excessive profits and too low taxes.
Official statistics on wage costs and the development of prices become an important item of information in labour disputes and in the way in which governments and employers attempt to manipulate these disputes.
The regulation on labour cost index will not eliminate this conflict of interests.
.
(PT) The Commission considers a labour cost index to be of utmost importance for the European Central Bank, to monitor inflation in the EMU, and for social partners to use in negotiating wage agreements.
The current proposal seeks to remedy that by establishing a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour cost indices.
In short, it is being proposed that, in order to calculate labour costs, the total quarterly costs incurred by the employer in the employment of labour must be taken into account.
In implementing the regulation, the Commission shall be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee.
The Commission will submit a report to Parliament and the Council every two years on the regulation's implementation, including an assessment of the quality of the data supplied.
In its Common Position, the Council has made a number of adjustments to the original Commission proposal.
The rapporteur considers that these changes are in line with the spirit of the original proposal and I therefore wish to use this explanation of vote to express my favourable position.
.
(PT) Having seen that the lack, to date, of a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour cost indices has been a major weakness in the action plan for EMU statistics - a fact that will also have a detrimental effect on inflation in the Eurozone - I have supported this report, which rightly seeks to guarantee the existence of this common framework.
In fact, as the rapporteur points out, this common framework will enable the ECB to monitor changes in inflation within the EMU and will be of enormous benefit to the social partners in negotiating wage agreements.
As in countless other cases, transparent and reliable information and the existence of clear and understood criteria these days constitute a crucial tool.
This will contribute both to the upstream adoption of fair, proportionate and appropriate measures by national and Community authorities and to serving as a downstream tool for clarifying the role and interests of economic actors and ensuring that the composition of these is balanced.
Whilst welcoming the establishment of this common framework, I still look forward to the results of this new regulation's implementation, in which the quality of data in particular will be assessed, because the Commission will have to present a report on the new regulation's implementation to the European Parliament and to the Council every two years.
.
(PT) I congratulate Mr Pohjamo on the excellent report he has drafted on the Parliament and Council proposal for a regulation on the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air, which I support, especially with regard to the need to adopt regulations that will enable mechanisms to be set up to provide European carriers with up-to-date and comparable statistics for this sector. These will help to guarantee the safety of passengers and the efficient management of these companies.
In this context, I should also like to emphasise the importance that this set of regulations will have in helping to resolve the issue of air space saturation.
As a former rapporteur for Customs 2000, I have an active interest in EU cooperation on customs in the EU and have voted for the Mollar report, which improves the exchange of information.
In all matters relating to the area of freedom, security and justice, a balance must be struck between the freedom of the individual and the urgent need to tackle the rise in organised crime.
It is hoped that the customs file identification database (FIDE) will make a positive contribution to the fight against organised crime in the EU.
As regards Mr NisticÃ²'s report on the regulation of the distribution of human blood, it can truly be said, Mr President, that this conciliation process was a fight to the last drop of blood.
However, blood also indicates nobility, when it is blue, and we have to admit that the rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ², is not lacking in nobility.
It also indicates a sanguine nature, which Mr NisticÃ², like all the people of Calabria, certainly has, so much so that he has achieved great success in this conciliation.
It also means solidarity, for to give blood is to show solidarity.
Therefore, with the greatest of pleasure, I voted for the report.
Mr President, I would also like to welcome this report and the new directive.
The passing on of contaminated blood can and does have fatal consequences and I welcome strongly the proposals to regulate the transportation of blood and to ensure supervision by qualified staff, which represent an important step forward in this directive.
I would like to thank medical staff at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge and at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, both of which are in my constituency, who have given me help and advice so that I could contribute to this directive.
They want to convey the importance not only of qualified staff to supervise the process but also of training for all those who handle blood, because human error is the biggest source of accident in this respect.
Finally, the voluntary donation of blood - which is an important principle for us in Britain in particular - has the added benefit of ensuring the highest possible voluntary screening-out of the health risk associated with blood transfusion.
We should be thanking and congratulating all those millions of people in Britain and throughout Europe who give blood.
We should also appeal to the 94% of people who do not give blood to do so in future.
.
(PT) This report has sought to ensure that more rigorous standards are adopted for the eligibility of blood and plasma donors and that blood donations are screened, to establish a Community-level quality-control system for blood transfusion centres, complemented by an equivalent system of control and approval in the Member States and to set common standards for staff training and the traceability of blood from donor to patient.
On 12 June 2002, Parliament adopted eight amendments at second reading.
Under the written procedure, a compromise solution was reached and accepted by the Council, in conciliation, for donors to be examined by qualified health professionals.
For all these reasons, this report has won my vote.
We voted in favour of this text due to the number of positive points that it contains, particularly those seeking to limit the levels of certain dangerous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and those compelling manufacturers to finance waste disposal.
We condemn the over-scrupulous nature of the text, however, and particularly the lengthy timeframe given to manufacturers to apply this directive.
Given that dangerous substances are involved, this lengthy timeframe, which only comes to an end on 1 July 2006, is a licence to poison for manufacturers.

(PT) Many of the complaints made by Europe's citizens about the Member States' environment policies are based on the one hand on the lack of transparency by the institutions in terms of informing the public and, on the other, on the lack of consideration of the citizens' opinions about projects that will have an impact on the environment.
The fact that, in the wake of the Aarhus Convention, the Commission has legislated on public access to information in certain plans and programmes and on public access to justice is, therefore, extremely important.
Greater public information and participation will not only add legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions but will also enhance the quality of these decisions.
The directive that has been adopted today represents a significant step in this direction - the public dissemination of information will become the rule and the protection of information by the authorities will become a clearly defined exception.
The aim of this report is to facilitate public access to environmental information, so we cannot be anything but in favour.
However, whilst explaining the need to 'ensure that environmental information is disseminated to the public as widely as possible', the report half-closes the door that it has just half-opened by assuring that 'the Member States may refuse a request for environmental information on specific grounds', in other words whenever they see fit.
Furthermore - and this is well beyond the limits of the report itself - of what use is the affirmation of transparency in this area, when major companies which pose the main threat to the environment can always hide behind commercial or business secrecy?
Transparency requires the veil of industrial and commercial secrecy to be lifted.
. (PT) Sustainable development depends on our ability to make the 'greening' of the economy a reality - to ensure that buying green becomes a right and not a luxury and that selling green becomes a competitive advantage.
This will only happen if, by analysing the life cycle of products, we quantify their environmental features, from project stage to disposal, and thus include these environmental costs in the product's final price.
The directives on electrical and electronic equipment that have been adopted today represent an extremely significant step in this direction because on the one hand they will force producers to reduce their use of certain dangerous substances, such as lead, mercury and cadmium, in electrical and electronic equipment and on the other, they will promote the collection, reuse, recycling and recovery of electrical and electronic waste, making the producer responsible for funding these systems.
.
(PT) This new directive makes it binding on Member States to provide the public with access to environmental information held by the authorities, in terms arising from a compromise reached between the Council and Parliament, which I think is acceptable.
In short, the joint text lays down:
the obligation for public authorities to actively assist citizens in their search for information, encouraging them to use the new technologies to answer their requests;
quality standards designed to ensure that the information supplied is up-to-date, accurate and reliable;
the principle that information should be provided to the public free of charge, although it has been accepted that a charge can be made, restricted to 'a reasonable amount'.
Because this compromise strengthens the citizens' right to obtain information from national, regional or local authorities, specifically in the event of river contamination, the construction of new projects or the destruction of natural habitats of protected species of flora or fauna, thereby increasing transparency in areas of common interest, I could only vote in favour of this report.
.
(PT) I have, of course, voted in favour of this important report, which seeks to establish common criteria for access to information, to ensure public participation in the decision-making process and access to justice in environmental matters, because I believe that this access to information - and I am talking about high-quality information - on environmental matters must today be considered to be a standard prerogative of citizenship.
In fact, establishing rules for such access will effectively contribute to control by the citizens in an area that concerns everyone - a genuine Citizens' Control to protect our environmental heritage.
I therefore feel it is quite appropriate to strengthen the mechanisms for access to information and to information technologies.
The trend of authorities providing environmental information without charge, in conjunction with promoting the use of information technologies - especially the Internet - will lead to this information being widely and freely accessible, subject, of course, to the necessary restrictions when national security, court cases or industrial rights or those concerning intellectual property are concerned.
Lastly, I welcomed the idea of establishing practical arrangements to ensure that information about the environment is used effectively, and of granting of more rigorous powers to the Member States in this context, which will result in greater responsibility for these, but also in the subsidiarity principle being implemented.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The minutes from yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, one very quick question: I have just read in a Spanish newspaper that NestlÃ©, a large multinational, is demanding USD 6 million from Ethiopia in the middle of a famine.
I really do not know what kind of world we are living in, and I cannot get over my amazement, regardless of the economic and legal reasons this multinational may have.
Whatever the case, the situation is none the less cruel.
I share your concern, Mr Bautista. The problem is that I asked about the Minutes and, although your contribution was not entirely irrelevant, it is the Minutes that plenary was supposed to be discussing.
(The Minutes were adopted)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on safety at sea and measures to alleviate the effects of the Prestige oil tanker disaster.
- (DA) Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Council, my deepest sympathy with those affected by the devastating and scandalous pollution that followed the accident involving the oil tanker Prestige off the Galician coast.
I believe that we all hoped that, following the Erika accident in 1999 - I myself was present at discussions on this here in Parliament - we had put an end to this kind of disaster in the heart of Europe.
Unfortunately it has happened again, however, and thus maritime safety and the prevention of oil slick disasters is back on the agenda.
Following the Erika accident, the Council and Parliament adopted a number of measures to improve safety and reduce oil pollution at sea.
We still do not know what went wrong to cause the wreck off the Galician coast, but the fact that it could happen is, in itself, proof enough that further action is required.
There is now a need for us to make whatever efforts are necessary to prevent this kind of accident in the future - and for us to send a strong political signal to the population, shipowners, captains, and everyone involved in transporting oil, in particular.
On 21 November, Parliament made a strong statement on the Prestige accident.
I should like to say to Mrs de Palacio that the Commission, in my opinion, has shown great energy in acting on this difficult matter.
Both institutions deserve praise for the Community's swift action in initiating decisions promoting maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment.
We now have a starting point from which to proceed with the matter.
It has been the Presidency's intention to treat the Prestige accident extremely seriously.
The matter was placed on the agenda of the Council of Transport Ministers on 6 December and at the Council meeting of Environment Ministers on 9 December, and I was present when it was also discussed in detail at the European Council meeting in Copenhagen last week.
This was one of the reasons why there was a delay, meaning that the ministers did not end up dining with the Queen of Denmark.
It was important to the Presidency that the meeting produce tangible results, and we can now say that it did indeed produce results.
The Council has declared that all the relevant measures will be taken to prevent this kind of accident: at international, EU and national level.
I am happy that the Council Conclusions are fully in line with the views of the European Parliament.
Both the Council and the Presidency hold the view that we have achieved a good result, one which sends out the strong political signal we need: a firm line against single-hull tankers in the EU and the political will to find solutions.
It is my hope that Parliament will make an active contribution - and I am quite sure that it will - to the rapid achievement of the goals set.
In particular, I am thinking of the measures that Parliament and the Council will be adopting together under the codecision procedure.
These include accelerating the phasing-out of single-hull tankers.
I have no doubt that we can agree on this, given the will and resolve that Parliament has shown in this matter.
The Council is also looking forward to constructive cooperation with Parliament, so that there is no unnecessary delay in putting in place the tightening of regulations and the rules on liability that are needed for the purposes of prevention and in order to ensure that, if accidents should happen, it is the right people who are made to pay: that is, those responsible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only a few weeks ago, when the Prestige had just sunk, I made clear to Parliament my fury and disappointment that we had been unable to prevent this tragedy from occurring.
Unable to prevent a tragedy that was foreseen, that we knew could happen at any time and that we could not prevent because we lacked the political impetus, the will, the decisiveness required to move more swiftly and decisively in applying the measures proposed by the Commission at the time.
Today I must reiterate this.
I would like to do so because we cannot allow a third disaster to take place. We cannot, following the Erika and the Prestige, allow another Erika or Prestige to sully our coasts.
The result of this debate and your vote tomorrow, here in Parliament, must therefore be the same result as that of 6 December in the Council of Ministers, in other words, a clear, determined will to implement radical changes, to take decisions immediately, in all the Member States of the Union and to go further, at international level, because, I repeat, we need to protect European coastlines first of all, but Europe also has international leadership responsibilities, which mean that we need to respect and maintain clean seas throughout the world, not just along our own coastlines.
In this regard, I would first like to thank the Danish Presidency for the decisive support given by the Council of Ministers the other day to these measures, which specifically led to Council conclusions that are, if they are really put into practice - and that is the key - a genuine, decisive step forward for European maritime security.
I would therefore like to thank the Danish Presidency for its work, but I would then like to say that the statements made the other day must be put into practice, in each and every country in the European Union.
Putting them into practice means that when decisions are taken to prohibit the entry into and exit from European ports of single-hulled vessels carrying oil, tar, bituminous products or heavy fuel oil, these decisions must be upheld.
It means asking the Commission to present a proposal to bring forward the deadline for banning single-hulled vessels, single-hulled oil tankers, for oil transportation, from our waters and then supporting this proposal when it is on the table at the Council of Ministers.
It means that when we say we are going to increase controls in ports in the various States of the Union, we actually employ the necessary staff, provide them with the necessary means and carry out these controls.
It means that when we say we are going to promote progress in international maritime legislation at international level, adapting international maritime legislation to new challenges, new risks and new social demands, we really do promote this from now on, all together, all Fifteen of us, and, I hope, the ten new States and the other candidate countries.
(Applause)
It means that when we say we are going to allow the Agency, which we are currently setting up and which will begin work, I hope, in January, to begin to monitor and indicate, where necessary, any deficiencies or shortcomings, we pay attention to the Agency when it does point any out and that we take the necessary steps to correct them.
These are the factors we need to promote.
We have already seen the results of prolonged delays, paying more attention to certain problems. I do not deny that these problems existed but they prevented us from taking swift enough action.
We cannot allow the tragic results of this to happen again along European coastlines.
I must stipulate that, following the Erika disaster, it has been extremely frustrating for me to see that we in Europe have been unable to do what the United States did after the Exxon Valdez incident.
I refuse to believe that we in the European Union should be content with fewer laws and fewer powers than the citizens of the United States, for example.
I repeat, therefore, that the European Union is not enough.
We must also make progress at international level.
Mr President, the Commission, and I shall end here, understands that there are various levels and timetables. We are now experiencing the impact of these coastlines destroyed by an oil slick, and having to deal with these people whose lives, homes and opportunities are affected.
That is the issue we must address first of all.
We must solve existing problems, and European solidarity has been demonstrated clearly here, in the Transport Council and the Environment Council, and, I would imagine, is currently being demonstrated in the Fisheries Council, in any case, in the Copenhagen European Council.
This solidarity has also been demonstrated with regard to funds; reprogramming funds; direct access to disaster funds; economic contributions, but also providing resources, people and efforts by the various countries of the Union which, in different ways, have helped to mitigate the disaster we are currently facing.
Although this must be our immediate concern, however, we also need to act immediately, urgently, to prevent any more disasters of this kind.
We must act, as I have said, to implement bans within the Member States to ensure that the most contaminating products are transported in more secure vessels, to guarantee that these are monitored to the highest possible degree; but we also need to act immediately, while knowing that this will only bear fruit in the medium term, at international level, to promote change in international maritime law.
Lastly, I would like to say that the Commission, as well as setting up the Agency, as well as authorising and mobilising various funds, as well as making changes with regard to the use and allocation of certain existing funds, will now table a regulation with a European standard to speed up the timetable for banning single-hulled vessels in the field of oil transportation in European waters and ports.
Immediately banning the use of all vessels but the most secure means banning single-hulled vessels in the transportation of the most contaminating products and therefore requiring the use of double-hulled vessels.
In order to make progress in clarifying responsibilities, we need to create a penal classification at European level, in all the countries of the Union, to cover serious negligence, when this type of situation occurs.
I would like, by means of this and other measures, to further increase the security of our ports and our waters, internally and at international level.
Mr President, I would like to end by saying that the Commission, just as it did in the case of the Erika, is responding promptly, swiftly and decisively.
We hope that the Council and Parliament will respond similarly and with the same political and practical commitment, so that we might avoid having to hold another debate such as this in years to come.
(Applause)
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European institutions for the solidarity they have shown towards the people and regions affected and I would also like to thank the parliamentary groups that supported us in holding a debate, as Mr Haarder pointed out, on 21 November, and in repeating it today.
It is essential for Galicia in particular, but also Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the French and Portuguese regions affected, to see very clearly that we shall continue to support them, and that by no means should they feel alone.
I would now like to put forward a proposal that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is to table, for the Conference of Presidents to request a report from the European Commission and make the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism responsible for holding a public hearing on maritime transport safety in Europe and the consequences of this kind of accident.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is by far the worst ecological disaster that my country has suffered and it is a disaster of European proportions that no country has the means to tackle alone.
It is true that the sinking of the Erika was a nasty but salutary shock which, as we have seen, was insufficient, and the Vice-President of the Commission is right to express her indignation.
I therefore believe that today we in Parliament should remember the measures she proposed at the time with the support of the European Parliament, which the Council did not support.
That must be the basis for our work, in order to achieve a reasonable level of safety so that this kind of event does not occur again on our seas and along our coastlines.
Mr President, this is not a natural disaster. There are guilty parties: not the wind or the sea, but people with names.
This ecological, social and human disaster, however, requires us to mobilise all the financial means available to the European Union and also the recently created Solidarity Fund.
It is true that we in Parliament are subject to the Rules of Procedure that all the groups approved, but the situation requires that we act generously and flexibly.
Although this Fund did not exist when the Erika sank, I would also like to ask the European Commission, what means were authorised for recovery operations along the French coast?
I shall now turn to the Council to ask it to commit to the proposals to increase maritime safety, which have the backing of both the Commission and Parliament, and to fulfil the commitment given in Copenhagen to create a compensation fund for the damages caused by oil spills.
I shall end, Mr President, by calling upon the Socialist Group in general, but more particularly my fellow Spanish Members.
Two motions of censure have already been discussed against the government of the Partido Popular in Galicia, and the Galician Parliament has set up a committee of inquiry.
Here we formally propose that we all work side by side to help those affected and increase maritime transport safety, but if you do not want to, if you do not have the heart, at least let us work towards this.
Mr President, yet again this Parliament finds itself debating another maritime disaster.
We are now faced with a disaster of such magnitude that it is no longer just a transport issue, it is also an environmental, social and fishing issue, which is why my group believes a committee of inquiry is needed to ascertain what went wrong with the Prestige.
On behalf of my group, I express to the people of Galicia our sadness at their tragedy and our solidarity and support in their battle against this modern-day black death that is threatening their livelihoods and damaging their shores.
This Parliament would be fully justified in saying to our own Council of Ministers and to the IMO: 'We told you so!'
The parliamentary records are full of calls from this body for action on maritime safety.
From the Estonia to the Braer, from the Sea Empress to the Erika. We have highlighted flags of convenience, inadequate port state control, single-hull tankers and deficient crews and yet, despite our best efforts and the support of the Commission, our own Council of Ministers has failed to heed the warnings and take decisive action and has been instrumental in ensuring that the IMO is one of the most ineffective bodies ever.
I say to the people of Galicia that it should be our own Council of Ministers and the IMO, not them, with oil on their hands at this moment.
They have let the people of Galicia and all of us down on this issue of maritime safety.
The Council of Ministers does not want a committee of inquiry, as there are probably too many skeletons in its cupboard for that.
However, it is shocking that the PPE-DE Group opposes such a move.
It is a clear snub to the people of Galicia.
They seem to be more concerned about protecting political friends than protecting the people of Europe.
This is the worst ecological disaster for years and the PPE-DE Group calls for a hearing - pathetic!
The time for talking is over.
What we need is action - to ban the flags of convenience in our waters; to improve our port state control; to ensure that the ships of shame are detained; to ban all single-hull tankers; to ensure that those responsible for these disasters pay the full cost of the damage that they caused; and last, but not least, to ensure that the Prestige is the last tanker to spread its black death over our coastline.
Mr Haarder, take the message back to the Council: no more blocking, delay, subsidiarity or hiding behind the IMO - action is what we demand!
Commissioner, you are not the only one who is angry.
When I see how this event is destroying the livelihoods of so many people and of a whole region, we are all angry.
On behalf of my group I can tell you that our hearts are with them all, and I believe that we must offer them help through all the channels we have.
Here in Parliament we must do what a parliament must do, however, which is to make rules and reinforce existing rules.
The first thing I would like to ask - and I am also addressing this request to my good friend Mr Bertel Haarder - is that we apply the existing rules and that we take Erika I and II in hand.
There is still a document being debated in the Council, Mr Haarder, and I hope that you will do something about this.
We must also tighten up a number of things that are contained in Erika I and II; I am thinking in particular of ports of refuge and safe anchorages.
In order to prevent major catastrophes, we must make this system compulsory, so that ships that get into difficulties can get help there and are not turned away.
We must draw up a rule for this.
The Commission is supposed to be carrying out a study.
We must have this. We must also have a compensation rule for ports or places of refuge that take in ships.
We now have a ship lying at a depth of 3 500 metres with 50 000 tonnes of oil still on board, and this ship will be causing problems for years.
We must avoid this kind of thing in future.
Secondly, I would like to comment on port state control, as mentioned by Mr Simpson.
Let us tighten this up for hazardous ships.
It is absolutely no use checking 25% of ships in good condition; you must focus the controls on hazardous ships and old ships.
We must make sure that ships passing through sensitive shipping zones are better controlled.
We ask that you enter into negotiations with third countries, including with Russia, with a view to possibly signing bilateral agreements in this regard.
It is time to put an end to the quarrels between the Council, the IMO and the Commission.
The Commission must negotiate and must be given the opportunity to talk about this; then we will have much stricter rules.
International legislation - and this is clearly stated in the resolution we all agree on - cannot be a reason to destroy the environment and people's lives.
The one must not take priority over the other.
Finally, with regard to the debate on procedures; together with the Commission and the Council, we must act fast and get rules down on paper.
We are therefore not in favour of a committee of enquiry, as this would take too long.
Mr President, the speed at which the European Union has taken certain decisions is a perfect illustration of what up till now has been Community inaction in the field of maritime safety.
Clearly if these decisions had been taken earlier, if the Prestige had had an accident, it would not have occurred in Community waters.
Two points should be made in this regard: firstly, to determine the reason for this inaction and the delays in taking decisions, and secondly, to determine whether the measures adopted are sufficient.
In this respect, my political group considers the decisions adopted in Copenhagen to be insufficient, even though they are a step forward, and by way of example, the matter of flags of convenience has not even been addressed.
The Council, and I am now going to refer to its previous management, who could have prevented the current situation from arising, considerably shortened the Commission's proposal, thus allowing floating timebombs to continue sailing until 2005, instead of having taken them out of use in September 2002, which is what would have happened if attention had been paid to the Commission.
The delays in transposing the legislation, or in applying the Erika I and Erika II packages, speak volumes, as do the failures to comply with this legislation, concerning inspections and controls of vessels, for example.
The permissive attitude that allows flags of convenience to be entered in registers by the Member States is no more constructive, and there are other causes for concern.
I think that the issues I have raised constitute grounds for investigating levels of infringement of Community law and poor administration and, consequently, for establishing a committee of inquiry.
Mr Galeote, although you chose to address the Socialist Group, which is very large, and my group is tiny, I am going to speak sincerely, on behalf of a very small group, but one that on vital issues has been involved, modestly, side by side with all our Spanish colleagues.
From this modest experience I am going to say, first of all, that you have forgotten that you prevented a committee of inquiry from being set up in the Spanish national Parliament.
Secondly, it is one thing to take decisions that could be questionable and that, at best, have proved to be wrong, and it is another, more serious, matter to adopt a communication policy to deny the problem, failing to take preventative and corrective action.
The most serious aspect of your government's management in Galicia is that the State had no plans or instruments to address the crisis immediately.
This comes as no surprise, Mr Galeote, when Mr Aznar supports the idea that we need to reduce State public services to a minimum.
The issue we must now address - as elected Members of Parliament - is the people's feeling that they have to tackle a disaster with small-scale means and great sacrifice, while the State, to which they pay their taxes, remains either impotent or implacable, I am not sure which.
What is done is done.
There is nothing more to do except think about compensating those affected until economic activity can be rebuilt.
In order to do this, the Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds need to be mobilised rapidly.
In conclusion, allow me to make one point: at a time of enlargement, we need a large Europe, but not a Europe that is an empty shell, and what cannot go on is the current failure to implement serious processes to prevent those operating on the edge of the law, in search of speculative profits, reducing safety conditions and social protection, from continuing as if nothing had happened.
Mr President, Mr Haarder has described the tragedy of the Prestige as scandalous. The Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, has said it was an unnecessary incident which could have been avoided.
This means that both the Presidency of the Council and the Commission and even Mr Galeote feel that there is blame to be apportioned.
This is why we are calling for Parliament to set up a committee of inquiry with the task of identifying where the different responsibilities for the incident and for the subsequent salvage and emergency operations lie, particularly where the Spanish Government is concerned, which, I would remind you, was amongst those who firmly supported the rejection and weakening of the 'Erika package' and which is now calling in major building and construction firms to clean up the beaches.
We condemn the fact that the Council has only adopted part of the Commission's proposals.
Here, we would like to pay tribute to the Belgian Minister - who, moreover, is one of the few remaining Greens - who was one of the very few people to support the package proposed by the Commission and to fight for it to be adopted in its entirety.
The European Union needs its own legislative framework because we are absolutely sure that the international community will not be able to produce adequate legislation.
We feel that there are two supplementary measures which need to be taken in addition to those already adopted.
Firstly, the port state control bodies must carry out inspections on at least 25% of the ships entering each of the ports of the individual Member States rather than an average calculation being carried out at national level.
Secondly, there must be new standards ensuring that dangerous substances are transported in smaller container ships than at present with a maximum capacity of 10 000 tonnes.
Moreover, we feel that the Commission proposal for a directive on environmental liability must also include marine pollution and that, in the event of oil spillage, the European Union must adopt the same financial responsibility system as that already applied in the United States, where ship owners have unlimited financial responsibility if blame for the incident can be attributed to them.
Lastly, Mr President, the European Union must provide sufficient financial support through the Structural Funds and through the Solidarity Fund to meet the needs of Galicia and northern Spain and help them to recover from this disaster.
Moreover, we must on no account disregard the fact that many Nature 2000 areas are affected by this disaster.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is too late to change the past, but we must ensure, once again, that it is not too late where the future is concerned.
I would like us to be able in future to discuss this matter once again, but in another context, completely different to that of 21 December and to that of today, to say in future, that this has never happened again or that, if a new unfortunate situation involving risks and threats should arise, this time, thanks to the measures that have been adopted and to the technical and political awareness that we have all gained, the management of the crisis has run smoothly.
At the moment, we are still in shock and this shock is at once good and bad for us.
It is good in the sense that we will adopt firmer, more rigorous and tougher measures for the future; it is bad, however, if we undertake, or plan to undertake an investigation of crisis management in a highly emotional state or in one of biased shock.
It is, furthermore, extremely important, in this regard too, that a technically rigorous and politically dispassionate investigation should be undertaken into how the crisis was managed, not primarily in order to judge anyone, but to prevent any mistakes being repeated in future.
Our group also wishes to draw attention to a new raft of preventive measures.
We have heard about preventive measures concerning the technical risks facing vessels or the way in which voyages are undertaken.
This is true, but it is not enough: we must also identify conditions of legal risk, if I may use that expression, in other words, issues of flags of convenience and seaworthiness certificates that are not worth the paper they are printed on. We must also define mechanisms that can be made requirements at international level and which disqualify these operations, these so-called off-shore maritime navigation operations.
A doctrine has developed with regard to the misdeeds of off-shore operations in money laundering and we also need to develop a doctrine of combating off-shore operations for laundering responsibilities for the sailing conditions of ships.
Mr President, all policy-makers must realise that our dependence on imported oil inevitably brings with it transportation risks.
If we are to reduce this dependence, we will need to invest more in investigating the use of renewable energy sources.
We should also be looking at the possibility of bringing in more oil in through pipelines.
This does not, however, detract from the need to improve the general conditions for transporting oil by sea.
Firstly, this means tightening up the present system of port state control.
More stringent and more frequent inspections should result in unseaworthy ships or ships that are not in good enough condition to carry certain goods being placed under arrest at an earlier stage.
Secondly, the Council deserves support for its plans to speed up the phasing-out of single-hull tankers.
It is, however, in everyone's interest that we establish double-hull transportation capacity so as to avoid a shortage of supply.
Thirdly, Member States must offer tangible help to ships and areas that are in distress.
By no means all Member States appreciate the need to designate ports of refuge and create rescue, assistance and cleaning facilities in them.
Furthermore, we must also press ahead with the setting up of the COPE fund, which will reimburse affected areas for the damage they have suffered.
Incidentally, our attention should not be directed solely at the cargo but also at the bunker oil used as fuel for the ships themselves.
This can also cause significant damage to the environment and has thus far not formed part of the remit of the IMO.
Sadly, we have already experienced several major oil disasters.
It is time we took a fundamental look at our position and our approach to these.
I hope that everyone concerned realises this.
Mr President, the European Union Member States agreed last summer that ships in distress should immediately be accommodated in a place of refuge.
The Spanish Government, on the contrary, decided to tow the Prestige into open sea, regardless of the consequences.
This week in the Spanish Parliament we witnessed the Spanish Government's arrogance.
For more than a month it has produced a day-to-day falsification of facts, failing to adjust itself to circumstances.
Mr Aznar, as the main political authority responsible, has been totally unable to achieve a sense of reality.
On the other hand, even if the Galicians have made little progress in their cruel work, they do not lose heart.
Galicians are admirable.
The disaster of the Prestige has become the disaster of JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar and the 'prestige' of the Galician people.
Mr President, surely the first thing we have to bear in mind when discussing safety at sea and the introduction of any new legislation is the application of existing legislation.
The problem - and it is a huge problem - is that this legislation is not being applied, especially when it comes to port controls.
Secondly, we must not forget that shipping goes beyond national and European borders.
So action is needed at international level.
And that means giving the European Commission the necessary credentials, so that it can reach agreements right from the start with candidate countries and with our neighbours so that we can coordinate our action.
And of course it needs proper credentials from the Council so that it has the necessary authority to negotiate correctly with the International Maritime Organisation, which really does drags its heels.
Thirdly, we must not forget that there are numerous sides to this problem.
There is a lot of talk, and rightly so, about old, single-hull tankers.
But may I remind you that a fairly new double-hulled ship, the Ievoli Sun, which was about 10 years old, sank off the coast of France recently, about two years ago in fact, which just goes to show that double hulls are not necessarily the only answer.
However, nor is focusing on flags of convenience the only answer, because problems are frequently caused by ships not sailing under flags of convenience.
So what exactly am I getting at?
Obviously we need to address the question of single hulls, obviously we need to examine the question of flags of convenience, no doubt about it; but we must not overlook all the other questions which we often underestimate.
Port controls are vitally important.
The question of ports of refuge, maintenance of ships, all these questions need to be examined overall, globally, if we want results.
So we need a package of measures to deal with the problem.
As for the committee of inquiry, may I call on my honourable friends not to turn Parliament into a referee in order to resolve internal Spanish differences.
Mr President, I said a month ago that this was a European disaster and requested a European response.
The Galician citizens - my fellow citizens - who are caught up in a titanic fight against the oil that has arrived on their doorsteps, have been the casual victims and have paid the price for all European citizens.
Since day one, therefore I have insisted both here and there on the need to provide a clear and simple European response, as we did for the floods in Germany, which takes account of two aspects: prevention and mitigation.
Should we toughen and change transport legislation?
Yes.
Should we reprimand ministers?
Yes.
But we need to do more.
We need to explain to the people who are currently collecting oil by hand why there are no resources and assure them that, if this were to happen again, these resources would be available.
We need to tell them, at the very least, that we are sorry for the lack of resources and coordination that there have been in addressing this disaster from the very beginning.
They are the ones who are enduring this, and their cries for help have reached this Parliament, and we cannot deny this fact.
The Galician, and therefore, European citizens need to feel supported in the long and difficult journey into which the negligence of their own ministers has thrown them.
We therefore cannot understand why anyone in this Parliament would be opposed to knowing what has happened, where mistakes have been made and what we must do to ensure that this never happens again.
This is not a disaster of European dimensions: it is a European disaster and we do not want it to be repeated anywhere.
If it does happen again, however, we clearly cannot act as we have done here.
The pathetic images that have been shown around the world - which have shown what I saw - make it unnecessary, Mr Galeote, for me to give any further explanation.
We Galicians are strong.
We always have been, we have always been able to fight against adversity and we shall not let ourselves be beaten by this disaster.
What my people in Galicia cannot understand is why, if all of Europe recognises the lesson that we as a people are giving, the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament continues to deny us the opportunity to clarify what has happened, assess the damage and propose emergency and crisis management programmes at European level that could serve all Europeans.
We are not the ones who can answer this question, we compatriots, as Mr Galeote says.
Compatriots are not the same thing as accomplices, and we do not want to be accomplices.
Do not insult us by asking us for complicity in the decisions of a government that for a whole month tried to minimise this disaster and has been incapable of mobilising the Community institutions.
On the other hand, Mrs de Palacio, you should ask the Spanish Government a question.
Nobody has been able to use and set in motion the abundant means available to Europe.
Why not?
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, like many of my fellow Members and like many European citizens, I welcome the proposals - which I support - made by the Commission in the wake of the Prestige disaster and presented again here vigorously by Mrs de Palacio.
As we all know, however, they may not be enough.
If we want to avoid finding ourselves discussing the effects of another disaster in the near future, certain measures need to be taken without delay, with less lukewarm cooperation from the Council: port controls must be stepped up, crews must be given training, assistance must be provided to vessels in difficulty, and, above all, 'old tubs' must be banned and single-hulled vessels rapidly replaced.
I stress the need to speed up as fast as technologically possible the introduction of the obligation for oil tankers and other vessels with dangerous cargoes to be double-hulled.
If we are actually to make a difference in this area, we need practical measures.
I therefore propose that access to certain ports located in sensitive areas should be restricted without delay to double-hulled vessels. These areas should be progressively defined and delimited at European level, with the introduction of similar measures to those currently in force, for instance, in Venice harbour.
Moreover, the capacity for demolition of old vessels, which is currently inadequate in northern Europe, in particular, must be enhanced with the provision of incentives.
The problems ensuing from this drastic measure will only be temporary and will, in any case, be incomparably less than those which would arise should similar disasters take place in sensitive areas, and I am thinking with horror of certain parts of the Mediterranean.
Are the Commission and the Council prepared to subordinate the economic considerations which thus far have been given priority to the demands of environmental protection?
The Commission's response would appear to bode well.
I call upon the Council to be equally courageous.
Mr President, the disaster caused by the Prestige oil tanker took place more than a month ago and we still do not know how long we will continue to see waves of oil slicks, which alone is an indictment of the leaders of Spain and the EU for having adopted such belated and ineffectual measures in an attempt to play down the effects of the real tragedy that has befallen the communities and the sea of Galicia, but which has also spread to the maritime territories to the North and to the South, affecting Portugal and France.
Although the tragedy has shown that underlying the ecological disaster are the profits that some shipowners and oil companies seek to make by any means possible, even at the cost of maritime safety and working conditions, specifically by flying flags of convenience, the fact is that governments have allowed them to undertake these activities through increasingly neoliberal practices, including the delay in applying the directives decided on following the Erika disaster.
We must therefore determine the reasons for the current crisis, such as the persistence of the causes, the indecision we have seen and the delay in transposing laws.
We must also go further, however, as my group has proposed in the proposal to which I have added my name: banning flags of convenience and the transport of oil products and other dangerous materials in single-hull tankers, establishing shipping lanes that are further from the coast and stepping up inspections are crucial measures for preventing further tragedies.
Mr President, the pictures of the fishermen and the volunteers fighting the oil slick from the Prestige with their small boats and their bare hands demonstrate the enormous strength of an entire people - the Galicians - and prove the culpability of the European Council and the Spanish State.
It is now clear that Galicia's citizens are suffering the consequences of the serious political conflict which opposes the positive proposals put forward by the Commission and which has led to the selfishness and irresponsibility demonstrated by the Member States of the Council.
The Copenhagen decisions have not answered the anguished questions of the citizens but instead the interests of the predatory capitalism of the oil companies which, taking advantage of the murky and primitive international situation, reject all and any attempt to establish European legislation to protect our seas.
The Council, as well as Mr Aznar, has shown contempt for the people of Galicia by having taken no rapid decision to help that region.
It has shown contempt for the fact that Galicia suffers more disasters than any other part of the world.
The Council has granted Galicia and the neighbouring territories a miserable EUR five million more, whereas the United States, which has strict and specific legislation, clearly lacking in Europe, is claiming USD four billion for the Exxon Valdez accident.
Ladies and gentlemen, our citizens are demanding that we put an end to this situation, starting with setting up a committee of inquiry.
This must never happen again.
Never again!
Mr President, the Commission recognised the need to take further initiatives, and in doing so, implicitly acknowledged the inadequacy of the directives that it had itself proposed in 2000, particularly concerning the transport of heavy fuel, which was already in question as a result of the sinking of the Erika and the timetable for scrapping single-hull tankers.
The Commission also quite rightly acknowledges that two elements, which are essential for guaranteeing safety at sea, do not fall within the competence of the Union.
The first element is the protection of coastal waters against ships in transit which present a threat to the marine environment, as was the case of the Prestige; in this regard, Article 220 of Part 12 of the Montego Bay Convention clearly enables coastal States to exert strict controls.
This is what France and Spain, which share borders with Portugal and Italy, decided to do.
The success encountered in this area is a result of the lasting political will of the States concerned.
There is also the question of liability.
The Prestige affair is as complex and unclear as that involving the Erika and until the liability of the charterer has been clearly established, these areas will not be able to be clarified.
As a result, either the IMO demonstrates that it is capable of dealing with this issue, or the European Member States must consider taking back their freedom and putting in place their own system, which is what the Americans have done with considerable success.
Mr President, Commissioner, I was particularly disappointed by the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit on the issues of safety at sea.
What do the conclusions say?
The European Council merely expresses regret and its grave concern at the consequences of the sinking of the Prestige and assures Galicia of its support.
These statements are very revealing.
Where are the concrete measures?
Why do we still feel that the ministers are stalling?
I would like to express my anger, as you did, Commissioner, as well as my extreme concern regarding the fact that no genuinely practical decisions have been taken.
The Council reiterated its conclusions of December 2000 regarding the measures to take with regard to the Erika.
How much progress has been made in implementing these measures?
What is happening with port controls?
What is being done to ensure the integrity of those who enforce these controls?
How far have we come in banning flags of convenience?
What is the status of the European list of ports that are likely to receive doomed ships?
The Council must deliver an opinion on this as soon as possible.
Lastly, what is being done to establish the responsibilities of owners and charterers?
What we are waiting for is the Council to give us appropriate answers to these specific questions.
How much longer are we going to wait?
How many more disasters must happen?
On the other hand, I congratulate the Commission on its determination and I pledge the European Parliament's support.
A committee of enquiry, however, will not help, as we already have a legislative package and a committee would be a waste of our time.
The political will of the Fifteen Member States is essential.
We must work quickly instead of spending more time talking.
If the directives adopted by this House had been supported, if the Commission had been supported, we would not be in this situation.
Europe could have and should have prevented the Prestige disaster.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do need to pass more legislation; what we must do, at long last, is to apply existing legislation.
We do not need to have one debate after another.
We must take action.
Subsidies will not help to repair the environmental damage.
The environment must be preserved.
What use are our directives on protection?
I would also point out that it is more profitable from an economic point of view to anticipate than to repair.
Then the disastrous social consequences are so difficult to quantify.
Whichever country is affected, how does one assess the distress of fishermen, of those working in the tourism industry and of those citizens who see the oil slick spread further every day?
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika is still lying at the bottom of the sea, off the coast of my home town.
On behalf of the people of Brittany in France, I would therefore like to pay tribute to the people of Galicia in Spain, whose lives have also been affected by an oil slick.
Europe's work is dictated by one crisis after another.
The attacks of 11 September produced a European arrest warrant; from the Sangatte centre emerged the right to asylum and substantial measures were drawn up as a result of the Erika disaster.
The Commission has worked well, but what are we going to do now?
We have the whole shebang: oil in the Atlantic and old bangers in the Pas-de-Calais.
The only thing left to do is fill them up with petrol.
Things just never change.
We need to learn a lesson, so we will learn it.
I am sure we will make the provisions on single-hull vessels more stringent, I am sure we will step up the measures on battered old boats, I am sure we will step up this, that and the other.
I am going to make a suggestion, Commissioner: you should start to explore the idea of a European coastal guard, which does not work in the same way as in the United States but uses our method.
You will see - because this is not necessarily our last disaster - this request will become increasingly popular in coastal communities.
The people will demand it and they will not understand why the seas remain in this state.
I am not telling you to do this in two minutes flat, but to start thinking about it, because, as usual, it will come to pass, as the result of the next disaster or the next crisis, in the same way that the European arrest warrant and many other measures have been introduced.
This is the way Europe works.
Since necessity is ultimately the mother of legislation, let us begin by adopting legislation where it is needed.
Mr President, my heart goes out to the Galicians, and to the people who are clearing up the oil, which is now more than a metre thick.
Unfortunately, however, we do not have an emergency response team, and we do not have a professional approach.
I find this particularly regrettable.
We must, however, stop simply passing the buck.
Naturally it is important to have this discussion, but not now, and not here.
It is much more important to pay attention to making sure that Europe's coastline is protected.
My colleague Mr Dirk Sterckx's specific suggestions about ports of refuge are particularly appropriate.
I would like to call upon the Commission and Council to avoid hot-air politics when it comes to the safety of shipping.
I support the Commission in respect of the agency and the exercising of controls, as Mrs de Palacio has just mentioned.
A ban on single-hull tankers carrying crude oil is soap-box politics and avoids the actual structural problems of international shipping.
A well-maintained single-hull tanker is safer than a badly maintained double-hull tanker.
I am not a fan of the IMO, but it is absolutely necessary for coming to agreements and for honouring and implementing agreements that are already in place.
It looks as if we are creating a more realistic policy than the one you are proposing.
In my opinion it is important to negotiate with Russia on the control of ships that are loaded there and travel along the European coast to Africa.
I think that it is very important to check classification agencies so that we know the responsibilities of the skippers, captains and shipowners and in particular in order to plan clear shipping routes.
I hope that this will result in a better policy.
Mr President, the Prestige has sunk and, once again, half-baked measures designed to prevent further oil slicks are urgently adopted.
They will not be enough for the traumatised and angry communities who must deal with several hundred kilometres of polluted beaches, with the destruction of ecosystems, job losses and the threats looming over the entire local economy.
The main cause of these repeated disasters is the drastic reduction in sea transport costs, which have dropped by 30% in 10 years.
This results in crew members being exploited outrageously, suffering conditions verging on slavery, fleets that are badly maintained and often obsolete still sailing our waters, and all this goes on whilst those responsible are being protected by a web of impenetrable procedures.
In short, bold political decisions are needed.
The IMO, which authorised the creation and the development of flags of convenience, must now place a ban on them, which will clarify the chain of responsibilities between boat owners, charterers and States, and will make it possible to hold polluters both financially and criminally responsible.
Next, a plan must be drawn up to scrap 4 000 boats that you yourself deem to be at risk, Commissioner, which means ship yards must now focus on constructing and developing modern and safe ships.
Lastly, under the responsibility of the ILO, binding legislation must be drawn up that is applicable to all crews the world over.
A genuine European maritime safety agency, in which the trade unions would be represented, could and should use an adequate number of inspectors in order to monitor ships and crew working conditions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we must indeed do something, and we can go even further than what has already been agreed.
I am therefore pleased that the two biggest groups here in Parliament support our proposals for a European coastguard and a European civil 'rapid reaction force'.
Firstly for prevention.
We need a European coastguard to watch over European interests and to prevent ships in distress from being passed from pillar to post by Member States who put their own interests first and in doing so make the wrong decisions.
The coastguard must be the strong arm of the agency for maritime safety.
Secondly, the European civil protection intervention corps must be able to turn out immediately in an emergency and arrive with its own equipment.
These 'Green Helmets' will then be able to step in anywhere in the European Union, as not all Member States have the equipment and expertise needed to tackle disasters.
I witnessed what was happening in Galicia a week after the disaster, and I saw what a difficult job our Belgian civil protection intervention corps had to do and how long an action of this kind takes to get under way.
I have been told that big construction companies are now having to be called in.
This is of course unacceptable.
Finally I would like to ask the Council to urgently direct its attention to the liability directive, as this lies at the heart of the problem of maritime transport, both in Europe and worldwide.
Commissioner, perhaps you could pass this message on to the next presidency: 'Nunca mais' [never again].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the vast ecological, economic and social disaster that Galicia is currently suffering, which has become a genuine European problem, I believe we must be clear in this debate we are holding.
Prevention first, cure second, it was said here.
The former, prevention, means we must not be distracted from the real culprits in this tragedy.
We are dealing with a floating dump, with dangerous goods, with an opaque network of the interests of soulless businessmen that we should untangle and condemn.
Must we investigate all these aspects?
Yes.
Should we prevent them?
Again yes.
I hope and believe that this time the European Union has learnt its lesson.
The European Commission has learnt its lesson.
The European Commission is clear about the matter, and I believe that now the European Parliament and the Council must be intransigent in the face of the laxness and casual attitude of this maritime traffic.
Secondly, cure.
We must focus on repairing the damage that has been caused.
Galicia cannot pay the physical price, in addition to the damage it is suffering.
The real victim is the entire people of Galicia.
Our responsibility now is to work together to achieve the maximum structural funds and the application of the Solidarity Fund; we are going to achieve it.
An inquiry?
Of course.
I would like to say here - it has already been said, but I would like to repeat it - that the Galician Parliament has set up, today and with the agreement of all the political parties, a committee of inquiry.
It is applying the principle of subsidiarity so that the closest politicians investigate the matter and therefore we, together with the Liberal Group and the UEN Group, have tabled an amendment for a comprehensive technical inquiry to be undertaken into this complex aspect.
We are going to ask for more European means to achieve better coordination and civil protection; however, Mr President, seeking to use the tragedy for electoral gain, as some politicians are doing, is simply repulsive.
I believe this division is damaging to the politicians themselves as well to the victims, who are confused and stunned both from the effects of the disaster and from seeing politicians attacking each other with their partisan egotism.
I shall end, Mr President, by thanking, as a Galician European, all of Parliament and the institutions present here today, for the solidarity they are showing us and which I know they will continue to show us over the coming days.
Mr President, anyone who does as I and a number of my colleagues in this group have done, and spends time with the fishermen on the Galician coast, will discover how urgently European aid is needed there.
I think this House would do well to agree to that today and tomorrow.
Arriving in Santiago de Compostela, one is aware that it marks the end of the Way of St James, with which the Commissioner will be familiar.
The Way of St James is the route taken by pilgrims and sinners in order to do penance for their sins.
We know that this path ought to be trudged by a whole host of Heads of State and Government, along with their Transport Ministers, in order to do penance for their sins of omission.
The sin recorded against their names is that of inadequate port State control.
If you sign up to 25%, but only manage to come up with 9%, as one Member State has done, then that amounts to a great sin.
The charge sheet reads: lack of a decent system of European ports of refuge.
Mr Haarder, that was decided on a considerable time ago, but the Council has not yet set it up.
The charge sheet reads: absolute failure when it comes to a compensation fund for oil disasters.
Parliament decided on this one and a half years ago, but until today the Council has had nothing to say on the subject.
Mr Haarder, the Prestige sailed past Copenhagen.
Let us remind ourselves of the route it took. Coming from Latvia, it passed through the Baltic, the Skaggerak, the Channel, the Bay of Biscay and past Galicia - it could have happened anywhere.
In the Baltic, though, there are four candidate countries, which keep themselves well covered when it comes to safety at sea.
Malta and Cyprus were always among the flags of convenience under critical discussion.
Commissioner, what we need from the Commission by April 2003 is a report deciding whether and, if so, how all these candidate countries should play their part in Europe's policy on safety at sea.
The Prestige - as Mr Haarder will be aware - could also have broken up in the 'Kadettrinne', one of the most dangerous places in the Baltic Sea, the scene of innumerable accidents, near-accidents and ships being driven the wrong way.
This is where we need to make pilots mandatory.
The Council and the Commission must bring pressure to bear on Russia in order to get a general requirement for pilots introduced via the IMO.
This is one of the most dangerous places in Europe for traffic at sea.
If it is our intention to withdraw single-hulled tankers from circulation, then we need more double-hulled tankers.
Perhaps you could have a word with your fellow-Commissioner Mr Monti about what we should do about future aid for Europe's shipyards.
Mr President, I would also like to express my support for all those who have been affected by this terrible disaster.
I think that we should praise the incredible efforts of the people of Galicia and Spain, as well as the voluntary workers who travelled from many different parts of Europe.
Although we are able to welcome the proposals made by the Commission, the same does not apply to the decisions reached by the Council. I also regret, like other fellow Members, the fact that they are lacking in ambition.
After the Erika disaster, and given the extent of the damage caused by the Prestige, it is now urgent, Commissioner, to bring forward the date for applying the measures adopted.
I am, however, also of the opinion that they are still inadequate.
Prevention also means demonstrating to charterers, ship-owners, cargo owners, even classification societies, that their criminal and financial responsibility will be fully engaged if legislation is not observed and if a disaster occurs.
Prevention also means taking the swift and courageous decision to ban flags of convenience in the territorial waters of the Union.
This disaster once again highlights the harmful consequences of liberalisation of the maritime industry, which has led to rules on safety and social welfare being compromised.
Europe should send a clear message to the maritime industry by proposing significant improvements to the social situation of sea-workers and by involving their organisations, as well as citizens' associations, in drawing up and implementing specific and essential new measures to enhance safety at sea.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, I am glad that you are here and that we are engaged in discussion, but I must go straight to the heart of all these debates.
I was delighted to read the resolutions from the Transport Ministers' Council of 5 and 6 December on increased safety at sea, but - alas - I have no faith in them.
Let me give you two examples. Up until now, the Council has always done its utmost to defend the use of single-hulled tankers up to 2015, and suddenly the Transport Ministers in Council announce an immediate end to the use of single-hulled tankers for the transport of heavy oil.
In addition, there is this wonderful question, Mr President-in-Office: by virtue of which law is this to come about?
We cannot make it Community law within the next couple of weeks.
Can you quote me any national regulations that will put the Member States in any sort of position to implement the ban on single-hulled tankers?
My second point, Mr President-in-Office, is that Mr Piecyk and others have already referred to the fact that a number of Member States are failing to meet the obligation imposed on them by the port state directive of controlling 25% of the vessels calling at EU ports.
Now, acting through the Council of Transport Ministers, the Council has decided to increase its efforts to step up monitoring of controls, if at all possible by 1 January.
Can you, in your capacity as President-in-Office, confirm how many posts have been newly created for inspectors, and in which countries, in the course of the last week or the last ten days, and how many qualified applicants there are for these positions as inspectors?
You see, Mr President-in-Office, passing fine resolutions is no use at all.
What we want you to tell us is how they are to be implemented.
I would like to refer back to Mr Sterckx, who wrote the report on ports of refuge.
He is perfectly right, and here too, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same questions arise.
You have now said that the Member States should set up ports of refuge and register them more quickly, but I would like you to tell us how you propose to ensure that, once the individual states have designated the ports of refuge, they are actually set up.
Let us remember that the Erika wanted to call at a port and was not allowed to, and the question is similar when it comes to the Prestige: if she had called at a port, might she not have avoided breaking up, might it not have been possible to pump out the crude oil more easily and to avoid a disaster of such a magnitude?
Mr President-in-Office, how do you intend to make sure that the Member States do actually set up these ports of refuge so as to avoid greater calamities?
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the shipwreck of the Prestige has demonstrated the powerlessness of the European authorities and the various Member States when faced with a disastrous situation like this one which, although the coasts it has ravaged belong to Galicia, is nevertheless a European disaster and is felt to be so by all European citizens.
It is precisely the European public, shocked at this appalling event, and the upset and fury of all those affected - particularly the wonderful Galician coastline and its communities - that are demanding that such a situation must not be allowed to happen again on our common coastline.
It is the citizens that are hoping that Galicia will be given appropriate assistance by the EU. A committee of inquiry is required, in order to shed light on all the circumstances of the disaster and to determine responsibility so that we can learn lessons for the future.
Europe's citizens are demanding that legislation be made tougher, and that it enter into force and be implemented earlier than planned, without further ado.
Protecting Europe's maritime industry must increasingly be a common concern and therefore a common policy.
Protecting the marine environment and the European coast are now major challenges for us all.
If the tragedy of the Prestige serves to raise political consciousness and to stimulate action, the despair and the fury of the Galician people - and ours too - will not have been in vain.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to begin by reiterating my solidarity with the Galician people and with all the communities who might be affected by this tragedy, in Spain, in France and, of course, in my own country.
As time passes, the true scale of this disaster is becoming ever clearer.
I hope that the investigation requested by Parliament will be undertaken in a thorough and timely manner.
And, as I have already said in this Chamber, we must also clear up the mysterious change of direction taken by the ship which, after moving westwards, turned suddenly towards the South, until it sank, thirty miles outside Portuguese waters.
What we need to do now, however, is to talk more about the future and this is why I would like to address four issues.
Firstly, the European Union must provide funds to compensate, as much as possible, for the damage caused by the oil slick.
In this context, I believe we would be justified in mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund, which has not yet been done.
The second aspect is that since this has clearly had a terrible effect on fishing and shellfish farming, we must consider a more integrated and far-reaching package of measures that will provide practical responses for the communities that have been affected.
The third aspect is that a technically and scientifically justified decision must be taken on what to do with the ship, which is now lying on the ocean floor with its 60 000 tonnes of oil.
Unless this is resolved, we will be condemned not only to an oil slick but to a succession of oil slicks for months and years to come.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise that it is now time to properly establish the European Maritime Safety Agency, which means that the Council must agree on where it should be based.
To conclude, I wish to say that we want there to be a rigorous inquiry, as Parliament has already called for.
What we do not want is for Parliament to be used to debate a country's domestic problems.
Mr President, we could classify the speeches made in the course of this debate into two categories: firstly, those which view the problem from a European perspective and which propose actions to be implemented through European and Community policy and, secondly, those which, at this time of human tragedy, tragedy for a country, which is five months from an election, believe that this is an opportunity to gain electoral advantage without considering what the real consequences for these people are.
There has been talk of a temporary committee of inquiry, in accordance with Rule 150 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure, which must be justified on the grounds of non-compliance with European legislation.
What grounds have we heard here?
To know what has happened; clearly we all want to know what has happened, but we are not going to achieve this through a parliamentary committee.
We will be told this in the reports of the experts and that is why the PPE-DE Group's proposal is that it should be the Commission that informs the Council and Parliament by means of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Assessing the damage; criticisms are being made, although the time limit for assessing damage ends on 23 January, but today, at the beginning of December, the Spanish State is being criticised for not having assessed the damage.
Measures to be adopted; Spain has adopted measures.
Coordinating 10 000 volunteers, coordinating the work of the institutions, coordinating international aid; what is coordinating all of this are the measures that have been adopted.
Mobilise the European institutions; yesterday we had a meeting with Commissioner Barnier, during which he acknowledged the talks and contacts he had had with the Spanish Government.
The fishermen are being paid, aid is arriving.
Therefore, what are the justified grounds?
They do not exist.
Simply a will to criticise for political reasons in view of the elections, and this is neither the forum nor the place, and you will not find us participating.
You will find us helping the Galicians, you will find us helping the Spanish and saving these coasts. That is what we are working on.
. (DA) Mr President, may I on behalf of the Council state that I agree with most of what has been said, and with the anger, vexation and deep concern that has been expressed, and the demands for action that have been heard in this House.
It is not fair to say that the Council has done nothing, and therefore I would like to start by quoting from the Copenhagen conclusions, which state that 'the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of 6 December 2002 and of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of 9 December 2002 should be implemented straight away in every respect'.
It then continues by expressing satisfaction with the Commission's work in respect of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the loss of the Prestige.
It also expresses satisfaction with the Commission's intention to investigate the need for further specific measures, including in respect of liability and associated sanctions.
There was thus complete support in Copenhagen for Mrs de Palacio and for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
What, then, was decided in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 5-6 December?
It was a series of paragraphs which approximately correspond to Parliament's viewpoints, which are indeed vigorous on a great many points and which already meet nearly all the requirements put forward here in this House.
Naturally, there is a certain justification in saying that if steps had been taken a long time ago the catastrophe might possibly have been avoided - yes, we must acknowledge that fact.
But now something is being done, and what is being done is exactly what the honourable speakers have asked for, and the rapid action taken by the Commissioner has been applauded.
I would like to say to Mr Simpson that one of the issues is, of course, that of the parties responsible having to pay. There are two types of liability.
The first is to be met by the funds for covering expenditure on cleaning up beaches and providing compensation for fishermen - and there is nothing to suggest that these funds are insufficient to cover the expenses concerned.
There is also, however, the liability for environmental damage, of course.
The possibility of requiring greater liability to be accepted is open to discussion; and it is agreed that, if at all possible, there must be a requirement to accept such liability.
Mr Sterckx and others are right in saying that it is not the number of inspections which is crucial, but that inspection is carried out at the right points.
It is a requirement that 25% are to be inspected; it is also correct that some countries are not meeting this requirement - and naturally that is wrong.
The crucial thing, however, is that the right places be inspected and that they be inspected in the right way.
Mrs Ramos was concerned by certain attacks on the Spanish Government.
Having been present at the debate in Copenhagen, I would like to bear witness to the fact that the Spanish Government put these problems right at the top of the agenda.
With regard to the issue of coastguards and agencies, I would refer to sections 7 and 9 of the Transport Ministers' resolution of 5-6 December.
With regard to the imposition of liability, I would refer to section 18.
It must be conceded, however, that section 18 of the resolution is not particularly strong, and I believe there is a common hope that the Commission can come up with a stronger solution than that which is being prepared, and I believe that such a solution will have the Council's blessing.
With regard to ports of refuge, which I did not manage to mention, I refer to section 8 - where the issue of ports of refuge is expressly mentioned, and that is my reply to Mr Jarzembowski.
My final advice to Parliament is as follows: hold the Council to the right declarations that have been made.
That applies to the European Council, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Hold the Council to the right things that have been decided.
After all, Parliament and the Council are in agreement concerning what is to be done; the task now is to put it into practice, as many speakers have also said.
I wish Parliament luck with this and with providing inspiration to forthcoming presidencies in the years ahead.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would begin by saying to Mr Piecyk that on this issue the Commission can hold its head high, because if what we proposed had been done we would not have had the Prestige, because it would have been out of use for several months before it sunk.
Having said this, however, I would also like to say to the honourable Members and to everybody, let there be no mistake, that out there in waters off our coasts and other coasts of the world, there are currently more than 400 Erikas or Prestiges.
There are such vessels with more than 20 000 tonnes of oil or more than 30 000 tonnes of oil-based products.
There are 258 of a lesser tonnage, with 10 000, 20 000 and 30 000 tonnes approximately, which are also quantities which can cause enormous pollution.
And what we have to do is respond so that, as soon as possible, these vessels are no longer off our coasts or, if possible, anywhere in the world.
This is what we have to do and we must do it now. That is what we are talking about.
And this is the first issue we have to confront here.
Secondly, the Erika I and Erika II packages must be implemented straight away.
And what does this mean?
Implementing them in terms of the controls of the port authorities, and several Members have mentioned this, and it is true that there are two countries which do not even comply with the current legislation which is much more lax and less complicated to implement.
It is urgent that they do so and they have committed themselves politically to it.
The Agency, which will soon be operational - its board of management has already met, because we have brought forward its implementation and although it does not yet have its final headquarters it is beginning to function already - will have to ensure that in all ports of the Union - and it must be in all of them, since there cannot be ports of convenience in the European Union - appropriate controls are carried out in the appropriate way.
In the meantime, however, the Council must approve, by March, the regulations that the Commission will present by the end of the year on the accelerated withdrawal of single-hull vessels from European ports and the European prohibition of the use of single-hull vessels for the transport of heavy oil and bituminous products, tar and more polluting products.
We must make progress in the field of responsibilities and I hope that, in agreement with Commissioner Vitorino, we can quickly present this Parliament and the Council with a proposal for a criminal definition of serious negligence.
And we must continue to make progress because, let us not beat about the bush, who is responsible here, who is responsible for the Erika?
Firstly, we know very well, the shipowners, who have ships in bad condition. And those who charter ships at a low cost because it is cheaper and optimises certain profits and who do not care that there are risks, which are then suffered by coastal populations and society as a whole.
This is what we have to prevent once and for all.
And this means making progress in the field of responsibility and preventing this whole chain of companies involved from evading responsibility.
But this means action on an international level as well as on a European Union level.
(Applause)
And this means, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission must be a full member of the International Maritime Organisation in order to be able to promote its work.
The fifteen States are already members and have acted in a coordinated fashion, but more is needed, the Commission must also be able to participate in this forum, in which it will be able to promote issues such as the responsibility of States with flags of convenience, that is, the system of obligatory audits which is being proposed within the context of the International Maritime Organisation.
And we must make progress on the issue of flags of convenience.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must distinguish between two types of flag of convenience: fiscal and financial convenience and the convenience of those States which give their flags to wrecks, to ecological time-bombs, to ships which under no circumstances deserve to sail the seas.
We must combat both types and I am also prepared to combat those which simply become tax havens.
Also within the context of the IMO, the FIFG Funds, achieving the EUR 1 000 million we have proposed and if not, to promote the complementary European fund which is on the table in the Council of Ministers and which, of course, if in May there is no resolution within the IMO, will have to be approved quickly so that we may at least have that complementary fund.
Ladies and gentlemen, somebody spoke of the human factor: crews.
Before the summer you will have proposals under the Greek Presidency which place great emphasis on promoting training and which furthermore - let us make this clear since there are many different opinions on this - clearly opts for a quality maritime sector.
I would also like to say that we must continue to make progress on international maritime law.
We all know that it takes years, but we must do what is necessary so that it takes as little time as possible, and meanwhile we must talk to our neighbours.
We must talk to Russia, we have the Baltic, which is an enclosed sea, where any accident, just as with the Mediterranean, would be much more tragic and would have much more dramatic consequences from an environmental point of view than in an open sea such as the Atlantic Ocean, which has greater capacity for regeneration.
Therefore we have to speak not only to Russia, but to all the countries of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, that is, the Mediterranean in the broadest sense.
Because we must manage to strengthen, guarantee and safeguard all our coasts and those of our neighbours and make progress in the international field.
The honourable Members say that there has been no progress at the Copenhagen European Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that I have the conclusions of the Council of Nice and, in fact, they ask for the Erika I and Erika II packages to be implemented as soon as possible, even before the dates for their entry into force, and this has not been done.
Copenhagen has said the same thing, and I hope that this time it will be done.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is too horrendous that after the Erika we are now talking about the Prestige.
I am sure that this time the States of the Union will really honour what they have said.
And if not, we will say it and remind them of it here; and if not, I hope that all the honourable Members with connections and with national parties will raise the issue by means of your colleagues in national Parliaments as well.
Of course, the Commission, by means of the Agency and the reports we will present here, will specifically monitor true compliance by the Member States with the issues agreed. Amongst other things, the entry into force of the Erika I and Erika II packages, without waiting for 30 June 2003 or February 2004.
I would like to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that this includes, for example, ports of refuge, which have until February 2004.
I do not believe we can wait until February 2004. We have to get to work now and in January we are going to begin talking to the Member States in order to confront this.
Let us make it very clear that a port of refuge is not just any port.
A port of refuge must be a port with special facilities, easily accessible, so that a vessel with manoeuvring difficulties can access it during difficult storms.
Because that is when accidents take place.
They take place when the sea is rough, with winds of more than 100 kilometres per hour, in situations where ships have problems with manoeuvrability, with waves of 8 or 10 metres as in the case of the Prestige or the Erika.
This means equipping these ports in a special way, providing them with access which is particularly easy and suitable.
Providing them with material and human resources and action plans which allow them to deal with emergency situations.
And that is what we have to deal with.
Ladies and gentlemen, do not confuse a port of refuge with just any port, they are different things and this is a very complex issue.
I would like to continue with the issue of funds, which the honourable Members have mentioned.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the case of the Prestige I believe that European solidarity is clear.
In the case of the Erika, do you know how much support and contribution to funds Europe has provided?
Well I will tell you: a reprogramming of EUR 10 million, of the Objective 2 funds, which Brittany benefited from.
In the case of the Prestige, it is true that the disaster is even greater.
But we are talking about a reprogramming of fisheries funds - FIFG Funds - of a supplement of other funds relating to fisheries which would be added to those FIFG Funds, we are talking about access to the Solidarity Fund to combat disasters which, it is true, is 2.5% of the amount for disasters, no more, but it is a European solidarity effort in any case.
We are also talking about reprogramming the Cohesion Funds or Structural Funds allocated to Spain or to Galicia.
European solidarity is shown through funds and the Commission has been able to use them, as have the authorities, for example, of the Council, which has said yes clearly, and which has raised the possibility of adopting additional specific measures because, ladies and gentlemen, there are unfortunately still 50 000 tonnes of fuel oil on the sea bed.
50 000 tonnes of fuel oil in two wrecks which, unfortunately, are still leaking oil.
The Commission is also participating in the Scientific Committee organised by the Spanish Government, which also includes French representatives and, if I am not mistaken, Portuguese representatives, and I hope that that scientific committee will tell us soon exactly how that fuel oil on the sea bed is developing.
Because naturally what we cannot tolerate is that these two submerged sections of hull should continue giving out and expanding the oil slick.
We must provide a solution.
We will have to see what solutions are possible and we will also have to see how Europe can show solidarity, and I sure there will be no lack of it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, coastguards have been mentioned.
I believe we must make progress on this, but I would also like to say that while we are able to create coastguards and other European bodies, which I am sure we will create in the future, what we need, at least, is to improve the coordination of all the maritime services in the States of the Union.
I hope that, following this tragedy, all of this will be strengthened and that we will be able to make further progress and prevent any more tragedies such as the Erika or the Prestige.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
To conclude these Council and Commission statements, I have received 7 motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, I feel that Mr Galeote has made personal comments about me, in my capacity as President of the Spanish Socialists in this House.
I would ask him to withdraw his falsities and slurs.
I really do not understand Mr Galeote.
I do not understand why Mr Galeote is determined to turn a European debate into a Spanish debate.
I do not understand why he provokes us, I do not understand this narrow nationalist attitude, trying to bring about a debate amongst Spaniards, when what we should do is resolve - as the Commissioner has said - a problem which is European and which should be resolved from a European perspective.
However, Mr Galeote, from one Spaniard to another, I will define what I think of your attitude by means of two traditional sayings.
The first is that 'offence is not caused by those who want to but by those who can', and the second, which is also very traditional and descriptive, because we all have memories and we all have history, Mr Galeote, is that 'the thief believes that everybody is like him'.
History has recorded what your attitudes have been and what our attitudes have been and still are, the attitudes of the Spanish Socialists here in this Parliament and those of the Spanish Socialists down there, in the Spanish Parliament.
Mrs DÃ­ez, you felt that personal comments were made about you and the Presidency has given you the floor.
Perhaps the second of your sayings, although the Presidency understands what you mean by it, contains a word which perhaps, for the sake of parliamentary courtesy, you should also withdraw, Mrs DÃ­ez.
Mr President, a saying is a saying.
In no way have I tried to call Mr Galeote a thief.
It is a saying which means: everybody believes that others are like them.
He has accused us of dishonest conduct, which has never been the case, and he knows that there has been dishonest conduct in his ranks.
The Presidency is grateful for this clarification, Mrs DÃ­ez, which restores our sense of parliamentary courtesy.
Mr President, Mrs DÃ­ez, of course I would withdraw any type of insult or slur in my speech, if I could, and I would challenge you to read the verbatim report for this sitting and tell me whether it contains any insult or slur, because I will withdraw them without question.
What I want to say, Mr President and Mrs DÃ­ez, is that committees of inquiry are laid down in Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure - I would ask you to read them, please.
And this request to create a committee of this type is justified by non-compliance with Community law, and it has been said here, explicitly and literally, by some of your colleagues and compatriots, that the intention through this committee is to establish the responsibilities of the Spanish Government in relation to the Prestige disaster.
This has been said here, literally.
What I am saying is that you cannot say in Spain that we are going together to ask for more funds and then say here that the funds should not be given because the Spanish Government is at fault.
That is what I meant.
Mrs DÃ­ez, you have taken the floor for your personal statement and so has Mr Galeote.
What we cannot do is allow an interminable chain of personal statements. Let us consider this issue closed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on
the statements by the Council and the Commission on immigration and asylum policy,
the report by Mr Watson (A5-0381/2002) on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council resolution [SEK(2002) 412 - C5-0263/2002 - 2002/0092(CNS)] on the signing of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on the readmission of unauthorised residents, and
Mr Watson's oral question (B5-0505/02) to the Commission on the European Union's principles and criteria with regard to readmission agreements with non-member states.
. (DA) Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to give an account of this very important area of work in which my dear colleague Commissioner Vitorino has been extremely active ever since he started, and in which I believe we are starting to reap rewards of which I am pleased to give an account.
With the Treaty of Amsterdam, it was decided that various measures on asylum and immigration should be taken within five years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is, 1 May 2004.
As we know, the European Council repeated and reinforced its desire for action in these areas in Tampere in October 1999, in Laeken in December 2001 and in Seville in June of this year.
In Seville, specific priorities were devised along with deadlines for adoption of the individual legal acts.
We have not simply met these deadlines; we have gone even further.
As was stated in the Seville conclusions, the Council must find the right balance between, on the one hand, an integration policy for immigrants who have settled lawfully in the Member States of the Union and an asylum policy that complies with the international conventions - first and foremost the Geneva Convention of 1951 - and with the efforts required, in particular the efforts to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking.
The implementation of the Seville conclusions has been a task of the Danish Presidency.
This applies also to the issue of combating illegal immigration and administering the external borders.
Seventeen different projects and initiatives have been implemented with a view to strengthening border controls at both sea and land borders and at airports.
In addition, a general dispatch programme and a specific plan for the return to Afghanistan have been adopted. These two were approved a couple of weeks ago.
With regard to asylum policy, substantial progress has been made in respect of implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam objectives and the priorities set in Seville.
The European Fund for Refugees was established back in September 2000, and in July 2001 a directive was adopted on minimum standards of temporary protection in cases of mass influx of displaced persons.
Further progress has been made on the area of asylum under the Danish Presidency.
There is now agreement in the Council on the Dublin II regulation, which is expected finally to be adopted.
This was the particular task to be achieved under the Danish Presidency.
This task has been achieved; there is political unanimity.
There is possibly one more parliamentary reservation, but I am sure that we will be able to adopt the Dublin II regulation - possibly as soon as tomorrow, when there is a Council meeting in Brussels.
The Commission's proposal for minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers is similarly expected to be adopted at the Council meeting tomorrow.
Over the past six months intensive negotiations have taken place concerning the Commission's proposal to set minimum standards for the recognition of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or persons in need of subsidiary protection.
Substantial progress has been made, and there is now political unanimity on the definition of a refugee and political unanimity on the definition of subsidiary protection.
This unanimity is based on the Geneva Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.
We have achieved political unanimity on virtually all of Articles 1-19 concerning the basic terms used in refugee law.
All that remains is the issue of the rights of refugees and of persons with subsidiary protection, which is why we can expect the proposal to be adopted by the summer at the latest, as was decided in Seville.
The things on which agreement has been reached are some of the difficult things.
Some might say: that is all very well, but where is the skill in adopting something based on conventions that have already been in force for a long time?
The answer is: it is skilful because it means that from now on these conventions must be observed in every country, and that includes the new Member States that we decided just last Friday to bring into the Union.
Moreover, there is a big difference between having conventions and having directives.
The difference is that the Commission has much greater authority when it comes to considering whether the directives are being complied with, and finally there is also the possibility of going to Court if countries breach the conventions.
The answer to the question that I myself asked is therefore: it makes an incredible difference that the standards of these conventions are now being introduced in the form of directives.
At the Council meeting in October we had an open debate on the Commission's revised proposal on minimum standards for asylum procedures at which the ministers of the Member States contributed various comments on the proposal.
This proposal, too, will be adopted by the end of 2003.
As far as immigration policy is concerned, the Seville conclusions state that the Council must approve the Commission's proposal for provisions on family reunification and long-term residence status by June 2003.
Substantial progress has been made in the negotiations on the revised proposal for a directive on family reunification - the proposal that was submitted by the Commission in May this year - and it is expected that it will also be possible to adopt this by the deadline set in Seville, that is, by June 2003.
As regards the proposal on long-term residence status, on 15 October 2002 the Council discussed a number of outstanding political issues.
A certain amount of progress has been made in this area under the Danish Presidency, but a number of crucial issues remain - including the right to a certain form of free movement.
The Council will work towards meeting the deadline laid down in Seville for adoption of the proposal.
At the same time, an open debate was held in the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs on 15 October 2002 on the Commission's proposal for a directive on the conditions for entry and residence by third-country nationals for study purposes.
Parliament has been consulted in all these cases, and Parliament's statements have been incorporated, or will be incorporated, into the basis for the Council's decision.
The Council considers it very important that Parliament be involved in this area, to which the codecision procedure does not yet apply.
The Council looks forward to even closer cooperation with Parliament in the area of asylum following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice.
I hope that I have, in this way, given you a comprehensive status report as regards the results achieved within the area of asylum and immigration policy.
I believe that, overall, it conveys a positive picture.
I agree that matters have proceeded too slowly.
I know that the Commissioner felt this too, as indeed I myself did, when I sat on the relevant committee here in Parliament.
Though I say so myself, I think that the Council has picked up speed, that we have eventually started to see quite a number of results and that we have started to live up to our own aims.
It is important that the deadlines are met.
Asylum and immigration policy is of great significance for the people concerned, and it is important that we achieve results and find the balance that I spoke about in the introduction to my speech.
Mr President, I could have spoken for much longer, since in reality there are a great many initiatives - for example, in the area of border controls, in which a full 17 initiatives have been implemented - which I could have talked about for a long time, but everything must come to an end, so I will stop here and let the Members' contributions decide what we will discuss in more detail in the hour ahead.
Mr President, although the Commission has presented all the proposals required by the Treaty 18 months ahead of the deadline set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, it is true that only a few of the objectives defined for the establishment of a common asylum and migration policy have effectively been met.
I hope that the Council will continue to press ahead quickly with the examination and adoption of the several measures under discussion, as the European Council requested at both Laeken and Seville.
I recognise that under the Danish presidency significant progress was made, not only as far as the Seville conclusions are concerned, but in particular on the development of the common asylum policy.
This progress was due to the personal engagement and knowledge of Mr Haarder, whom I praise for that.
In fact, the Dublin II regulation is expected to be formally adopted in the Justice and Home Affairs Council tomorrow.
Together with the start of operation of the Eurodac system, which is scheduled for 15 January 2003, this will constitute a positive step forward.
I am fairly optimistic about the discussions in the Council on the directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in Member States.
I share the President-in-Office's view that it is possible for the Council to have this directive adopted tomorrow.
Thanks to the adoption of this legislation, the first phase of the common European asylum system is progressively taking shape.
Two main elements of the system are still to be adopted.
However, as the President-in-Office said, good progress was made, thanks to an energetic Danish presidency, on a common definition of 'refugee' and a common approach to subsidiary protection.
Little remains to be done on this key proposal which could be adopted by the Council at its first meeting in 2003.
I also expect the Council to speed up the examination of our amended proposal on asylum procedures, which we presented six months ago.
It is of the utmost importance for the credibility of the Union in these areas, which are at the heart of public opinion's expectations about Europe, that substantive progress is really achieved.
In such sensitive policy areas, the strategy of small steps will prove to be efficient and win the confidence of our citizens.
Moreover, the time has come to consider seriously the forward-looking ideas that were recently presented by the High Commissioner, Ruud Lubbers, and which have been blessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Executive Committee.
In early 2003 the Commission intends to put forward a communication where we will express our own views on the main elements of this new agenda for protection presented by Mr Lubbers.
As you know - and as already mentioned by the President-in-Office - the directives on family reunification and long-term residence status are still under examination.
I encourage the incoming Greek presidency to finalise these negotiations as soon as possible.
It is possible to have them adopted during the first half of next year.
The rules on admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment, presented by the Commission in July 2001, have now been complemented by a new proposal, presented in October, on the conditions for entry and residence for study purposes.
Urgent progress is needed on these two texts, which are key elements for an active EU immigration policy.
Moreover, with regard to international relations, the Commission has recently put forward, on a joint proposal by myself and my colleagues, Mr Patten and Mr Nielson, a communication presenting our views on the nexus between migration and development.
In this document we also elaborate on the possibilities, but also the limitations, of the Community budget in this area.
I would like to take this occasion to confirm that the Commission will put forward a proposal in 2003 with the aim of establishing a multiannual programme of cooperation with third countries in the field of migration, working on the experience that we have gained on the basis of the use of budget line B7-667.
Our intention is to respond in a specific and complementary way to the needs of third countries in their efforts to ensure better management of all aspects of migratory flows and to stimulate them in their preparation for implementation of the readmission agreements or to assist them in the implementation itself.
This programme complements other Community cooperation and development instruments.
The degree of harmonisation attained or currently being negotiated has often failed to meet the Commission's expectations.
Certainly more could have been done.
However, the harmonisation being attained is worth our effort.
Those of us involved in the formulation of this policy should not forget that we have been pioneers in laying the first building blocks of European legislation and policy on such a difficult subject as migration and asylum, and Parliament most of all.
Nevertheless, this first attempt at building a policy has also taught us a few lessons.
This policy is still encumbered by too many institutional and legal constraints, as the President-in-Office was commenting in his remarks on conventions.
Codecision should become the norm and general provisions should allow the Commission to formulate a fully harmonised policy.
The objective should not be simply the achievement of minimum standards but a fully common asylum system.
Unanimity in the Council - especially in view of an enlarged Union - appears more and more to be an invitation to stalemate.
Therefore, I am very pleased with the constructive conclusions reached by the Bruton report within the framework of the Convention.
They point in the right direction as to the future of European policy on asylum and migration.
I am sure that those conclusions will receive the full endorsement of the European Parliament.
Mr President, we have spoken much in recent weeks about the enlargement of the European Union.
That enlargement extends our borders to Russia, to Ukraine and Belarus - it is hardly surprising if issues of border control and immigration policy are centre stage.
But when it comes to immigration, no country is an island.
A real debate is needed at European level, and not the kind of distasteful sloganeering that we suffered at the Seville European Council.
As a policy issue, immigration is simple.
Unless we open our markets to goods from poorer countries, thus helping their people to prosper, we will take their people.
And unless we set our own immigration policy, either anarchy will reign or - more worryingly - criminal gangs of human traffickers will set that policy for us.
What a pity that our governments did not listen a little more carefully to the advice of the Canadian Government about how, if we wished to get on top of the trafficking in people, we should open our front door a little to legal migration, in order to close our back door more effectively against illegal migration.
I congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the proposals that he brought forward a couple of years ago at the beginning of this whole debate.
I deeply regret that Member States did not adopt them as proposed.
The debate has been dominated by the repressive aspects of migration policy and has shown scant regard for its humanitarian aspects.
The strategy has hardly been one of small steps as the Commissioners suggested - one of 'faltering feet' is perhaps a better description.
I had the honour of chairing the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in this House for the first two years of that discussion.
I regret not only the EU's failure to establish effective and complete policies on immigration and asylum, but also its failure to ensure responsible stewardship of our economy which is intimately linked with immigration.
The Commission's review of the European economy in 2002 shows the devastating economic consequences of stagnating population growth, which could lead to the rate of potential economic growth falling by 1% of GDP per annum for the next 50 years.
What should we do?
Well, exhortations to procreation have never been known to work.
The evidence suggests that the higher our living standards become, the less people will want to have children.
So for economic reasons too, we need a mature debate about a policy of managed migration.
I hope that this afternoon's debate will contribute to achieving some joined-up thinking on immigration policy.
I have been asked to report on the readmission agreement with Hong Kong.
I regret that Parliament has been neither consulted nor kept informed during the negotiations on this readmission agreement, that we find ourselves in the position of having to deliver our opinion after the agreement has been initialled - and, moreover, after the Agriculture Council on 23 December adopted the decision authorising its signing.
According to Rule 97 of our Rules of Procedure, throughout the negotiations - and here I quote: 'The Commission and the Council shall inform the committee responsible regularly and thoroughly of the progress of the negotiations'.
I deplore the fact that did not happen, all the more so because this is the first readmission agreement negotiated by the Community.
In the case of future agreements, I ask that Parliament be kept informed about the state of negotiations by the Commission and the Council.
Readmission is about the return of persons found irregularly on our territory.
Few in this House would deny the need for a policy of return.
It is an integral part of any credible immigration policy.
Effective return safeguards the integrity of asylum policies and of regular immigration programmes and it acts as a deterrent to irregular migration.
Return has risen to prominence essentially because of the way in which our over-stretched asylum systems are being used as alternatives to a closed-door immigration policy.
When the Council adopted its return action programme at the end of last month, I am sure it took into account the many advantages of assisted voluntary return, as well as the possibility of forced return.
The advantage of assisted voluntary return is that it permits return in a non-punitive and a cost-effective way.
It has been shown to work in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in the Netherlands and in Belgium.
It is more convenient and it is less costly, both financially and politically, than deportation.
It has been almost exclusively a European phenomenon and we need more research on the sustainability of return under AVR programmes.
But our policy needs to be rational, driven not by prejudice, but by a sober assessment of our needs.
It must be carried out by governments who ought to resist the temptation sometimes to deport in order to seek approval from the mob.
That policy must also address gender and health issues which are vital in this debate.
The readmission agreement on which I have been asked to report is the first readmission agreement that the Community is entering into.
I share the Commissioner's appreciation of the willingness of the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate this with us.
There is a danger that today's debate will be confused with a debate on Hong Kong tomorrow which reflects concern about the implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law.
Some may argue that Hong Kong is not a safe country.
I accept the assurance given on 10 December by Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's Chief Secretary, when he gave his personal guarantee about the free flow of information and the freedom of speech remaining essential characteristics of Hong Kong society.
Nor have I any doubt that the Hong Kong administration is competent to administer a readmission agreement.
Moreover the agreement itself refers to international commitments to the protection of vulnerable persons.
However, what concerns me about this agreement is that it is the first in what will be a series of such agreements.
Authorisation has already been given for the negotiation of such agreements with many countries - some of them have even been initialled.
The fact is that some of those agreements will be far harder than this one.
Therefore, I would ask the Commission this afternoon to clarify a number of issues.
The first concerns the scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by the Member States, the categories of people involved and their countries of origin.
Are the measures that Member States have adopted adequate and effective?
Since this House is also very concerned to ensure that the policies of return and the readmission agreements we negotiate respect fundamental rights, I would also ask how the Commission proposes to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected in the event of repatriation, especially if this occurs on a large scale.
Is the Commission sure that the readmission agreements it is proposing are compatible with our obligations under international refugee law?
Will the Commission commit itself to establishing joint monitoring mechanisms with the countries with which we make readmission agreements?
The House would like answers to all these questions.
I would also like to know why the European Parliament is never mentioned in the Commission's communication on a Community return policy.
I would like clarification as to which coherent and transparent financial instrument will be used for the return policy in question and readmission agreements in particular.
The role of the European Parliament as one arm of the budgetary authority is clearly important in this, and I would be interested to know whether we will, from a financial point of view, need a new legal base for this policy.
The human rights clause in the readmission agreement used for Hong Kong is not strong enough to protect us against all eventualities in such agreements with other countries.
We should recognise that, while concluding the agreement with Hong Kong was a relatively easy matter, as we were able to offer them visa-free access to the EU in return, cutting a deal with countries such as Russia and Morocco will be not a whit as easy.
We will need to provide incentives for many third countries to cooperate with us, rather than threatening them with economic sanctions, as Mr Blair and Mr Aznar proposed in Seville.
That is why I welcome the Commission's recent communication on integrating migration issues into the Union's external relations policy.
If we join up the dots between this paper, our development policy, the negotiations on readmission and our economic need for immigration, we will be demonstrating the joined-up thinking we so urgently require in immigration and asylum policy.
Mr President, it is a pleasure to be here and address these issues again with Mr Watson who has made a major contribution to this debate in the House as Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
I am happy to see that has carried on and followed the evolution of these issues.
Commencing with Hong Kong, we welcome this first ever European Community readmission agreement with a third country or territory.
It proves not only the willingness of Hong Kong to commit to cooperation in the management of migratory fluxes with the European Union, but it also reinforces the credibility of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle.
As far as this concrete agreement is concerned, we have adopted a balanced approach.
As you may recall, the European Union decided to grant visa-free access to Hong Kong citizens in March 2001 and, at the same time, we proposed the negotiation of a readmission agreement.
I recognise that we should have kept Parliament better informed regarding these negotiations.
In my defence, the only thing I can say is that there was only one round of negotiations.
It would have been difficult to inform Parliament in the middle of the talks.
Nevertheless, we take seriously the fact that we will now negotiate several readmission agreements.
We need to introduce practical ways of consulting Parliament and keeping Parliament informed.
