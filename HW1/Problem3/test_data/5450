I can tell you that there is an important initiative on violent radicalisation.
In a little over a month, on 16 and 17 October, a European conference will be held for the first time on the role of education and schools in eradicating violent radicalisation among the youngest members of society.
We have called upon the world of education in Europe and, obviously, I invite observers from the European Parliament who would like to participate.
This will be an opportunity to say clearly that we want to replace the culture of evil and violence with a culture of tolerance and cooperation.
We are mapping all the initiatives launched in the Member States to combat radicalisation and prevent the recruitment of terrorists.
The results and the good practices revealed by this mapping will naturally be made available to Parliament.
We have talked a lot about dissemination and exchange of data and information.
Often, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of data, in fact an overdose of data, but no adequate analysis of the data.
This is why we need to give Europol a stronger role.
I thank all those who supported the strengthening of Europol, including Mr Pirker.
Last December I put a proposal before Council on this subject and I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will support the adoption, before the end of this year, of an increased analytical role for Europol.
In July an initiative on bioterrorism was presented.
We indicated very clearly what the vulnerable sectors are and where greater European cooperation is required - I am addressing Mr Borghezio who raised the issue.
Some have spoken of failures by the Member States to act.
I am in favour of 'naming and shaming exercises'.
Last June I published a document highlighting very clearly which Member States are in default even in implementing the legislation in force against terrorism.
This shows, and here I am addressing Mr Guardans CambÃ³ in particular, that I am ready to point out responsibilities, but these exercises will only be useful if all the Member States and the Council regard a statement of failure to act as a suggestion and encouragement to move forward.
Many have spoken about transatlantic relations.
I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that greater collaboration with the United States is required, and, at the same time that we need more involvement by Europe.
Among others, I would like to thank Mr Cashman for having expressed this principle.
It does not make sense for us to be slow in preparing and developing a European model and at the same time to reproach the United States because they, in fact, do have a model.
I think that more European input is needed, and more collaboration with the United States, but there is no need to say that Europe's problem is the United States.
The problem is the terrorists and their activities in the heart of Europe.
This is the point to bear in mind.
(Applause)
One last thought: I am certain that the new European Treaty will give us better instruments, that it will give us an instrument with which to work together with Parliament in order finally to create co-responsibility between the three institutions.
This will also give us in the Commission and the Council more strength.
I think that at that moment all citizens will be able to understand and see, transparently, who has made a mistake, who has acted correctly and who has not acted when they should have done.
Thus, the hope is that this treaty will become a reality, that it will be agreed, finally, and that this Parliament will become, with us, a fully-fledged institutional actor in the fight against terrorism.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Frattini.
I apologise for the noise, but it was not a lack of courtesy towards you.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 11 October.
Written statements (Rule 142)
As in previous debates, the majority of the EP, the Commission and the Council have avoided going into detail or even making a serious analysis either of terrorism - in all its forms, including State terrorism - or of the 'fight against terrorism'; it is clear that they are constantly trying to take the analysis of terrorism out of context in order to draw a veil over the deep causes of terrorism and the policies that engender terrorism.
Such conduct is all the more serious and politically significant when it is increasingly evident in the 'fight against terrorism' - in which the USA and the EU play leading roles - that the peoples of the world are facing an instrument for failing to respect international law, overturning the sovereignty of peoples and placing at risk the independence of States by promoting intervention, aggression and war, whether in Afghanistan, Iraq or Palestine, with their hundreds of thousands of victims.
Even though some speakers have repeated to exhaustion the safeguarding of human rights in this 'fight against terrorism' and in the offensive of security measures backing up that fight, a growing number of situations and facts point to a failure to respect citizens' fundamental freedoms, rights and guarantees.
in writing. - The EU is all about free movement of people, goods, services and capital.
Obstacles for these are to be taken seriously.
The fight against terrorism as part of international crime must not be neglected.
Terrorism is, however, a delicate topic.
We must not ever forget that all policies on counter-terrorism have to be based on respect for fundamental rights and human dignity.
Measures also need to be effective and proportionate to the gain of security.
I doubt, for example, that the new restrictions on liquids on aeroplanes meet these criteria.
All in all, every effort towards better coordination between Member States, and between them and the EU institutions, should be welcomed.
After Mr de Vries stepped down, a new EU anti-terrorism coordinator should be appointed as soon as possible.
(NL) Mr President, I would only note that, during the debate, the President-in-Office of the Council - who has already left - and the Commission were asked some very precise questions to which we have not received replies.
I should like a written reply from the Council and the Commission to my questions regarding the High-Level Contact Group on Data Protection and the US Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act.
We will proceed in line with the Rules of Procedure and also on the basis of the request made.

Mr President, on a point of order, can I ask for an urgent action by the President of Parliament to call for the protection of a delegation from Colombia which visited our Parliament on 27 and 28 June, and whose members this week received a public death threat because they had spoken out here in favour of the proposal for a humanitarian exchange of prisoners in the Colombian conflict?
The accusation that the delegation's members, including Yolanda Pulecio de Betancourt, mother of the French former Colombian presidential candidate, Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro, the head of the Catholic Church in Colombia, and Dr Jose Noe Rios, the general secretary of the Colombian Liberal Party, are all supporters of the country's guerrilla movement, is both preposterous and puts the group in grave danger.
On humanitarian grounds alone, I ask the President to do everything possible to make representations for their safety.

(Before the vote)
Mr President, concerning declarations of interest, could you explain to me whether, in the vote on the next three reports on milk, the dairy farmers among us should declare an interest and refrain from voting?
(Applause)
Obviously, Mr Titley, we proceed on the basis of declarations signed by individual MEPs with reference to conflicts of interest at the time of taking on the mandate and with reference to individual parliamentary procedures.
Explanations of vote
in writing. - (PT) We regard the sustainability of fishery resources as essential for the continuation of fishing activity and the viability of the fisheries sector, but we do not accept a fleet management policy - as adopted in the EU - or a reduction in the fleet, the main consequences of which will be a significant reduction in the means of production and a drastic loss of jobs.
To achieve the objective of a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, account must be taken of the social and economic situation in the fisheries sector by applying mechanisms for subsidising or compensating fishermen affected by the economic consequences of an environmentally friendly fishing activity and by measures to reduce fishing, especially in less-favoured regions that are dependent upon the fisheries sector.
Similarly, the fishing effort should be matched to existing resources and to the protection of the marine environment - which would at one and the same time promote small-scale coastal fishing and non-industrial fishing and safeguard fishing communities; it would be particularly helpful in that context to increase Member States' exclusive fishing zones from the current 12 nautical miles to 24 nautical miles and for outermost regions from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles.
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague Mr Casaca because it clearly underlines the perverse effects of the current system, which sometimes causes decisions to be taken that are disconnected from local realities.
Take, for example, the case of thonaille fishing in the Mediterranean.
Those who do it have made efforts to develop their fishing methods, but legislation adopted recently is putting disproportionate restrictions on them that are in danger of causing their disappearance.
They are in fact facing unfair competition from their colleagues in the Eastern Atlantic, both Spanish and French.
In accordance with the report's proposals, an approach using geographical fishing areas and taking account of the specific features of the techniques employed would have made it possible to ensure a fairer distribution of fishing effort capable of guaranteeing a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities.
in writing. - I support the Elles report on the draft amending budget No 5/2007.
In doing so, I would like to point out a particular problem for my own country that might mitigate against support for additional spending.
The problem Britain has is that Margaret Thatcher with the 1984 Fontainebleau Agreement left future British Governments with a poison pill.
Fontainebleau gives Britain back a rebate of two-thirds the difference between our annual contributions and annual receipts from the EU.
Thus any new expenditure programmes cost Britain twice; first we pay our 50% and then lose two thirds of the EU contribution, diminishing uniquely in our case the EU contribution from 50% to less than 17%.
Allowing for the fact Britain's contributions are just below 15% of the total budget, any new project for which Britain receives less than a third of the benefits leaves Britain out of pocket.
in writing. - (PT) The report states that approximately 110 billion tonnes/km of dangerous goods - dangerous for the population and the environment - are transported annually within the EU, accounting for almost 8% of total transportation of goods.
Of those, 58% are transported by rail, 25% by air and 17% by inland waterways.
The international transportation of dangerous goods is regulated by international agreements.
In that context, we believe that the useful and necessary cooperation at EU level must safeguard the full sovereignty of the Member States as regards the transportation of (dangerous) goods within their territory, for example by means of the right to regulate, to issue individual authorisations and forbid the transportation of dangerous goods, notably for reasons of national security or environmental protection.
This is a matter of principle that is all the more important in the context of the unbridled liberalisation of transportation promoted by the EU.
The Commission proposal on the simplification and unification of European legislation on the transport of dangerous goods should be endorsed in its entirety, including in the interests of better regulation.
As recently as 31 August 2007 I visited the traffic management headquarters for seven road tunnels, among them the longest tunnel in Germany, and became aware of the need for harmonisation, particularly of the provisions on the transport of dangerous goods in tunnels.
The transport not only of goods per se, but also of dangerous goods, is growing rapidly - and this is happening worldwide so that even the increase can no longer be absorbed by a single mode of transport.
It makes sense, therefore, to adopt the relevant rules for transport not only by road and rail, but also by inland waterway.
This improves the chances of applying the co-modal approach to the problem of our transport needs.
It is particularly worthy of mention in terms of the understanding of our fellow citizens that the present legal act takes account not only of the specific recommendations of the United Nations but also of Member States' subsidiarity requirements.
The fact that the directive summarises four 'old' directives and saves 2 000 pages of legislative text makes it an example of bureaucracy reduction in action.
Member States will retain the right to regulate or even prohibit the transport of certain dangerous goods within their territory, for example, for reasons of national security or of environmental protection.
In the final analysis, the public can expect this directive to make a contribution to improving both transport safety and environmental safety.
For once the Commission proposal aimed at harmonising the rules for the transport of dangerous goods is a step in the right direction.
Indeed the proposed text aims to simplify and unify existing Community legislation.
Currently no less than four directives and many Commission decisions govern the transport of dangerous goods by land (rail, road) and inland waterways.
This disparate collection means that the rules are too complex, difficult to transpose into national legislation and often obsolete.
This is a particularly important subject because the volume of inland transport in the EU is constantly increasing, as is the volume of dangerous goods.
Nearly 110 billion tonnes/km/year of these goods are transported annually in the EU, amounting to 8% of all goods transported.
Because of its strategic position as the crossroads of Europe, France's road, rail and waterway networks are often congested and therefore particularly subject to transport accidents.
It is high time all the peripheral, excessive EU legislation on this matter was eliminated to enable the various operators, but also the national authorities, to guarantee and fully strengthen the safety of this type of transport.
Given the continuous rise in freight transport, the catastrophic lorry fire in the Gotthard Tunnel and similar occurrences will certainly not be the last horror stories about lorry accidents.
This is particularly the case since lorries play a disproportionately frequent role in accidents on motorways, and since rest periods are often not observed owing to ever decreasing margins and ever increasing competitive pressure.
Poorly upgraded roads and the formation of tailbacks also increase the potential danger.
If a vehicle transporting dangerous goods is involved in such an accident, the consequences are, of course, all the more serious.
In addition, time and again, radioactive, corrosive or explosive freight is transported illegally, putting the emergency services in mortal danger when accidents occur.
It is only right and proper that the safety requirements be updated, which is why I, too, voted in favour of the report, although checks should also be reinforced accordingly.
in writing. - (PT) One of the EU's basic obligations and responsibilities is to create safe living conditions for European citizens.
The volume of inland goods transport within the EU is constantly expanding and, in line with that increase, the volume of dangerous goods transported has also been rising.
We therefore need to ensure that the legislation applicable to the transportation of dangerous goods is simplified and clarified.
The intention to include under a single directive the transportation of dangerous goods by rail, road and inland waterways might encourage co-modality and, by the application of established rules, improve safety and speed based on the adoption of new criteria on fast delivery of goods and provision of the relevant services.
A prerequisite for that is, therefore, ever greater safety in transportation throughout the territory of the EU, including the transportation of dangerous goods; I believe that will be possible with the implementation of the measures contained in this directive.
I am voting in favour of BogusÅaw Liberadzki's report on the inland transport of dangerous goods.
Professor Liberadzki is a leading specialist in the field of transport.
The report he presents is professionally written and gives an in-depth analysis of the problem raised.
One of the European Union's priorities is undoubtedly to ensure that Europeans enjoy safe living conditions.
This also includes the safety of transport throughout the Union, and particularly the transport of dangerous goods.
The increased circulation of goods and services has brought about an increase in road, rail and river transport.
That is why I am supporting the initiative to bring these forms of transport together under a single directive.
I feel that at European level we should strive to establish legislation with the greatest added value for EU citizens.
Encapsulating the regulations in a single EU document will enhance their transparency and accessibility and also the efficacy of their application.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Jeggle reports, because I hope they will facilitate the survival of our farmers.
After all, there was a time when farmers could make a very good living from their produce.
Nowadays, food prices are rising continuously but, whilst large enterprises benefit from this and harvest handsome profit margins, simple farmers are pushed increasingly into the role of supplicants.
Often, smallholders need a supplementary source of income to survive, and the love of nature is the overriding and only reason many take on this dual burden.
Increasing numbers are throwing in the towel, however, which has already led to a dependence on imports in the field of fruit, vegetables and feeding-stuff production.
Since EU accession, over 50% of Austrian farmers have given up their businesses; that is, ceased milk production.
Thus we are rapidly approaching the point at which our self-sufficiency in fresh milk and fresh-milk products is under threat.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during today's vote on the three milk reports I expressed my support for the Commission proposals, as I believe they represent steps in the right direction.
The over-regulation of the market in milk and milk products for drinking milk in the EU is both unnecessary and senseless and both consumers and producers suffer as a result.
It is therefore only right that the existing rules be liberalised.
It is commendable that besides the three existing categories of drinking milk, additional categories of drinking milk with other fat content be allowed.
As a result, both consumers and producers will be able to exercise a greater choice.
Such a development can only be welcomed.
In fact, the Commission should vigorously pursue the liberalisation of the drinking milk market, because the existing system of milk quotas is both antiquated and functionless.
There is no reason to continue imposing fines on producers for producing large quantities of milk.
Now, at a time when the demand for milk and drinking milk products is increasing throughout the world, milk quotas are clearly proving to be an obstacle to the development of the milk industry throughout the EU.
in writing. - The current strength in the milk sector is creating great optimism amongst dairy farmers in Europe.
Growing appetites for dairy in Asia, shrinking European production and increased use of land production in the US for biofuels is driving the price of dairy to a record high.
As an MEP representing rural Ireland, I am happy that dairy farmers are getting a deserved break, although production costs continue to rise making it harder for smaller dairy farmers in particular to survive.
A change in market management mechanisms brings instability.
With the milk quotas scheduled for removal by 2015, provisions need to be made to absorb volatility in the market.
The reaction of the producers is unknown.
An increase in output of milk will lead to a drop in prices.
Safeguard mechanisms allowable under the WTO will be crucial for stability.
At present, export refunds are zero rated due to the strength in global dairy markets.
We should ensure that they are retained as mechanisms that could potentially be introduced at a later date.
Change is inevitable in the dairy sector, but there needs to be a well managed transition to provide the farmers of Europe with a stable and bright future.
in writing. - (PT) We agree with the line taken in the report that it is important to give an essentially qualitative boost to the school milk programme.
We regret, however, that in its present form with the management philosophy adopted and with the resources currently allocated, this programme has in many cases become an encouragement to stop drinking milk in view of the poor quality and unsatisfactory nature of the products offered in relation to the tastes of pupils in lower secondary school.
We therefore agree that the range of products for inclusion in this programme should be expanded both as regards diversity and in terms of nutritional considerations and dietary rationalisation.
However, we must remember that we need to solve, as a matter of urgency, simple issues such as the lack of refrigeration networks, because that prevents schools and many Portuguese students from having access to anything other than UHT milk.
The nutritional value of milk is well known, and we know that we need to encourage people to drink it.
However, in order to make that possible, aid is required to help to produce quality milk and it is the innumerable small herds that hold the key; it is in the main family farms which, by means of non-intensive dairy farming, keep the rural communities alive and the countryside populated.
in writing. - (SV) The reports on milk products from the Agriculture Committee are a mixed bag.
The June List supports the Commission on the point that it must be permitted to produce and sell drinking milk that is not classified in any of the three categories that apply at present.
Such liberalisation is good and makes things easier for Sweden, which since 1995 has had problems adapting Swedish traditions to the EU's rigid rules on milk products.
The other two milk reports build on the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and are rejected by the June List.
Milk production should be a matter for the free market, subject to normal food controls on public health grounds.
The Agriculture Committee's amendments in the report on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products are simply absurd.
They propose that budgetary savings that are made are redistributed in the milk sector and that a milk fund restructuring programme is set up, that support is given to those within the milk sector who are affected by increasing market liberalisation, that marketing support measures and milk promotional activities are stepped up, that support is given for milk production in mountain regions and that the scheme to distribute milk to schools is reinforced.
We are strongly opposed to these proposals.
The June List would observe that it is just as well that the European Parliament does not have codecision powers in the EU's agricultural policy, because the Union would then fall into a trap of protectionism and heavy subsidies for all the different groups in the agriculture sector.
The Danish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Schaldemose, Mr JÃžrgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against not only the Commission's proposals but also the amendments proposed by Parliament.
In the delegation's opinion, reform of the scheme to distribute milk to schools is necessary, but the proposal does not go far enough.
The delegation believes that support for high-fat milk should be abolished completely, whilst healthy milk should receive the greatest support.
However, the delegation wishes to emphasise its support for reform of the EU's agricultural support in the direction of greater market orientation, and EU agricultural policy should be linked to environmental policy and public health initiatives, among other things.
in writing. - In order to ensure the integrity of this Parliament, all Members who have a financial interest in the dairy sector should declare an interest in these votes.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution, as I believe there comes a time when we need to review this measure and assess whether it is really appropriate and effective.
If it is not effective, we will abolish it; if it is only partially effective and appropriate, it will have to be modified accordingly.
At all events, however, we should be working towards standardising implementation - that is, ensuring uniformity of checks - so as to put an end once and for all the vexation we are currently experiencing at airports.
(MT) I would like to explain that there should not be any compromises as far as security is concerned.
We have to appreciate that when it comes to the restrictions on taking liquids on an aeroplane, it is true that it is an inconvenience, it is true that it is annoying to have to throw away what you are carrying, but on the other hand, security is paramount; security is the best way.
If the British secret services are telling us that there is still a threat, then there is still a threat.
We cannot make any compromises, and that is why we have to be very careful when adopting resolutions and approving motions relating to this matter so that we do not appear in any way weak or feeble in our attitude.
(SK) During my regular business trips I witness annoying problems faced by passengers carrying liquids in their hand luggage at European airports.
Passengers must part with their cosmetics.
Fortunately they can manage to drink a half-litre bottle of mineral water but aftershave or shampoo exceeding the permitted limit will meet its end in a ready container.
Passengers see these strict airport controls as a violation of their rights.
They do not know why they have to do this and are angry with the Union, with its bureaucratic rules.
The purpose of their flight is different and therefore they do not understand why they have to part with basic hygiene products.
Nor do the employees have the time or the inclination needed to justify the strict controls in place as an anti-terrorist mechanism.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, which proposes ending the controversial measures affecting air passengers and emphasises the need for research studies to find efficient tools for the detection of explosives in liquids.
I believe that the European Commission will thoroughly review the ban on taking liquids on board aircraft and - if no further facts are uncovered - it will abolish this controversial measure.
in writing. - Although UKIP makes the point on principle to support any repeal of EU Legislation, this is a national security issue and as such the party could not support a measure that could place air passengers and crew at risk.
As HMG has stated, terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat.
in writing. - Although UKIP makes the point on principle to support any repeal of EU legislation, this is a national security issue and as such the party could not support a measure that could place air passengers and crew at risk.
As HMG has expressed, terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat.
HMG's view:
HMG welcomes the TRAN Committee resolution's acknowledgement that Europe needs a high level of security in aviation.
Terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat.
It is currently impractical to test more than a small proportion of the liquids that passengers wish to carry.
So the interim controls, pending work on a more convenient technology-based solution, represent the only present way of properly ensuring passenger safety.
in writing. - I voted for this resolution particularly because of the demand contained within it for a review of the effectiveness and fairness of Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 (introduction of liquids onto aircraft).
What I find most absurd is that I can fly into Europe with duty-free liquids - alcohol, perfume or food bought outside of the EU - but should I transit to another plane within the EU, it will be confiscated by the authorities.
Does it not occur to the Commission that terrorists probably are more aware of the Regulation than your average passenger and will therefore act accordingly?
It equally implies that security at all extra-EU airports are inferior to the worst EU airport.
As a regular air traveller, I find that difficult, if not impossible, to believe.
in writing. - (PT) As regards the Regulation on restrictions on the introduction of liquids onto aircraft, I believe that the adoption of the amendment - that was also tabled by our Parliamentary group - that 'invites' the European Commission to repeal that Regulation, is a positive step, since there has never been any evidence that it is effective in terms of security, nor have any conclusive facts been produced, as had been promised, by means of an exhaustive public report.
Moreover, it was emphasised that if the Commission intends to present a regulation of this kind in the future, it must first produce a report proving that such a measure will be effective.
I would point out that, although the current regulation is being applied, the Commission has not even published or made available to the public a specific statement of the prohibitions and restrictions to which they might be subjected, a list of exceptions to those rules or the reasons for the measure.
Nor did the Commission ensure that air passengers were fully and correctly informed of their rights, especially as regards cases of abuse of power in the application of the security rules.
in writing. - I support moves to review the current restrictions on the quantity of liquids passengers are allowed to carry on board aircraft in the EU.
I voted in favour of the resolution which asks the European Commission to review the restrictions and ensure they are proportionate to any risk.
We need restrictions that are realistic and in proportion to any potential threat.
We all take the need to guard against terrorist threats very seriously, but our response has to be proportionate and justified.
There is cross-party concern that the current restrictions imposed by the European Commission are disproportionately costly and disruptive.
I would like to see the situation reviewed, and if these restrictions are to continue, then the Commission needs to clearly justify precisely why they are needed.
in writing. - British Conservatives fully support a review of the Regulation governing what liquids passengers can and cannot take on board aeroplanes.
The way in which this Regulation has been applied across the EU has varied, giving rise to inconsistencies and manifest unfairness, and any review must address this aspect as a matter of urgency.
However, we do not consider it would be right to call for a repeal of the regulations at this stage, since as a matter of principle the outcome of an expert review should not be pre-judged and protection of the public is paramount.
in writing. - UKIP supports the repeal of all EU legislation.
However, this is a particular measure which would put passengers and crew at risk and which we cannot therefore support.
in writing. - I voted against this Resolution which seeks to repeal the existing regulation, introduced last year, that restricts liquids on board aircraft.
I am worried that British Liberal and Green members of the European Parliament have now opened up the possibility of repealing this law, even though the strong advice from both the Security Services and the Department of Transport is to keep this legislation in place.
While I agree with reviewing the legislation on an ongoing basis, it is both premature and dangerous to repeal the legislation at present.
in writing. - (PT) I think that the threat to the security of air transport is a real one and that the risks involved are enormous.
I therefore believe that the inconvenience to passengers is proportional to what we are protecting and that the issue here is in no way a violation of rights, freedoms or guarantees, but simply a technical measure that has proved effective.
I therefore consider that the European Parliament is being too hasty and over-stepping its brief in asking that the Regulation on the introduction of liquids onto aircraft should not be implemented unless new proof is produced in support of such implementation.
The precautionary principle would dictate that it is better to suffer some slight inconvenience than a disaster.
The security principle dictates that we should not make things easier unless we are sure of the risks involved.
I therefore voted against the motion for a resolution laying down measures for the implementation of common basic standards on aviation security (introduction of liquids onto aircraft).
At a time when a large number of holidaymakers are heading back to work, it is worth thinking about some of the safety rules on board aircraft and at airports.
As a reminder, more than 16 million passengers transit through Brussels National airport each year, and since last November they have been subject to a ban on carrying liquids in their hand luggage.
There is no question as far as I am concerned of compromising security.
However, a large number of passengers have complained about the way this ban is enforced at different European airports: at some, they can carry products purchased at the airport in their hand luggage, and at others they cannot.
What is more, it is difficult to impose this kind of measure on passengers if its added value in terms of security has not been proven beyond doubt, and this does not seem to be the case.
So it seems reasonable to me to ask the Commission to demonstrate the validity of this measure, and if it is proven, to provide for uniform application, in total transparency.
That way, passengers will finally know which way to turn.
in writing. - I voted against this report because, whilst it makes real sense to review the impact of this measure, it is important not to repeal it.
The passengers that travel through European airports like Gatwick in my region are often confused and upset with the application of this rule.
In particular the way in which passengers are expected to turn over their 'duty-free' liquids purchased at an airport to the authorities checking hand luggage.
The problem seems to be with passengers in transit who buy in the 'transit' airport and then attempt to check through security for their further flight.
I opposed a full repeal because there are still legitimate security concerns which must be our first priority.
There are also alternatives to a simple repeal which might produce better convenience for passengers and maintain security.
in writing. - The current, mindless airport and aviation security measures are an unfortunate and constant reminder of terrorism.
They do not instil public confidence.
There have to be security checks - both on the public side and airside.
But these should make sense and be flexible.
Above all, they should be targeted more effectively.
This means 'profiling', a key measure that is avoided for fear of a 'discrimination' accusation.
It is curious that the European Commission thinks it has to give the green light to new security measures for Europe's airports.
Governments of EU countries should co-ordinate their response - but this must not be an excuse to extend the competence of the Commission into new areas.
Certainly the British Government must resist any further attempt to remove our national veto on justice and policing matters.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation, with its global reach, is the appropriate body to ensure that airports around the world meet security needs.
We abstained on the resolution.
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague Mrs Ayala Sender in response to the Commission communication on freight transport logistics in Europe and sustainable mobility.
We are going to be looking forward to the Commission's report on an Action Plan for freight transport logistics in Autumn 2007.
However, on the subject of logistics, it is becoming a matter of urgency to launch the debate on the ambitious European territorial development policy, based particularly on financing infrastructure (motorways, railways, airports, ports, new technologies, satellites, etc.) using the leverage of debt with, for example, greater use of the European Investment Bank (EIB), which could release nearly EUR 1 000 billion of investment potential over 10 years, public/private partnerships (PPPs), etc. An ambitious European territorial development policy based on massive investment will be one of the conditions to enable logistics operators to do their job properly at the best cost while respecting the environment.
in writing.
(SV) - There is good reason to work together to create a smoothly functioning transport system between Member States with a view to promoting the internal market.
We do, however, question many individual points in this report.
We do not share the view that the common transport policy is under-financed and that the EU should invest further resources in this area.
We question the need for common training standards for the personnel involved in transport and logistics as we have every confidence in each Member State's ability to manage this area satisfactorily.
Lastly, we believe that the Member States must decide independently whether or not 60 t goods vehicles may be permitted.
On account of these criticisms we have chosen to vote against the report.
in writing. - (PT) Although many other considerations deserve a mention with regard to this report, we should like to point out, in this explanation of vote, that we cannot understand why our proposed amendment, aimed at including a mention of the outermost regions - such as the Azores and Madeira - within the definition of the priorities for transport logistics in the various EU countries, was rejected.
Our amendments, which were rejected, placed the accent on:
the strategic importance of public services and their contribution to the public sector in promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion, and criticism of the policies that challenge the role of the State as a provider of public services;
the incentive effect of public investments co-financed by the Structural Funds under the cohesion policy, which attract private investment and the possibility of using Community funding to finance private investment where there is no public investment strategy.
The rejection is all the more significant since the report notes that logistics is primarily a business activity, considering, however, that public authorities can play a role and act as facilitators and asking for the dissemination of best practice in financing logistics, for example, various initiatives using private-public co- financing.
A word to the wise...
I voted in favour of this directive because it raises public awareness of the transport sector, in particular.
After all, transport logistics is a crucial factor in the development of European economic growth, competitiveness and quality of life, and also reduces environmental impact.
However, in my opinion, the statements on the authorisation of megaliners are out of place in this directive, as they are short-sighted and do not go far enough.
I voted in favour of the directive only in the hope that the Commission will take up this matter in the immediate future and regulate the area separately, at which point safety, environmental, transport and logistic aspects alike will have to be taken into account.
State-of-the-art knowledge will have to be utilised, as will politicians' scope for laying down a strict framework for the use of such vehicles.
This could include rules on the use of Driver Assistance Systems such as brake assistants, lane departure warning systems, adaptive cruise control systems and camera monitors, or rules on steered axles and the distribution of driving power over several wheels.
Finally, we must not automatically associate the term 'megaliner' with a maximum authorised mass of 60 tonnes.
It should be taken into account that megaliners with a maximum authorised mass of 44 tonnes actually reduce road congestion and bring enormous benefits to the economy, transport and the environment without harming the railways, which cannot even absorb the growth in demand for transport services.
While I am delighted about the adoption of the own-initiative report by Mrs Ayala Sender on logistics, which underlines the importance of intermodality for cleaner and more sustainable transport, I can only lament the adoption of paragraph 21, against which I had already voted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
I voted against this paragraph because 60 t goods vehicles, to which this paragraph has just opened the door, are dangerous for the environment and for the users of our roads, which were not designed to carry these loads.
The road lobby's arguments are fallacious: as the load capacities of current HGVs are already underused, the reduction in pollutant gas emissions that people are trying to lure us with on the basis of 'fewer vehicles for more transported goods' is a trick.
As for the impact of these juggernauts on our infrastructure, it will eventually land on the shoulders of taxpayers by causing an explosion in road resurfacing budgets.
Finally, regarding road safety, apart from the risks posed by damage to infrastructure, the very size of these road-using monsters represents a danger for all other users.
in writing. - Although I will be supporting the Ayala Sender report because it contains a number of good and constructive suggestions as regards the technical subject of freight logistics, I do have some concerns.
One thing that concerns me is that the possibility of introducing 60-tonne mega lorries throughout Europe is a concept that I believe to be misguided and inappropriate when rail freight is at a low ebb, and when national infrastructures cannot sustain 60-tonne lorries it seems crazy to move away from present weight limits.
I appreciate that some countries already have 60-tonne lorries, which is why it is right to allow Member States to decide for themselves what their national weight limit should be.
However this should not be taken as giving a green light to 60-tonne lorries per se, nor should it be seen as a kind of 'thin end of the wedge' scenario.
Sadly, Mrs Ayala Sender's excellent report has been given an unjust hearing because members and the media have highlighted just one section of it - namely 60-tonne mega lorries.
It is right therefore to reiterate yet again that there will be no compulsion on Member States to introduce them on their national networks.
I am voting in favour of the report by InÃ©s Ayala Sender on freight transport logistics in Europe - the key to sustainable mobility.
Mrs Ayala Sender has presented a very good report that provides a thorough analysis of this important issue.
Without an effective logistics sector, aims concerning growth, employment and increasing the attractiveness of the European Union for investors and employees - in other words, the main pillars of the Lisbon Strategy - cannot be achieved.
Logistics are an important element in the development of Europe and its competitiveness in the international arena.
Logistical activities taken as a whole constitute 13% of GDP in the EU.
We should also bear in mind the enormous impact of the right logistical solutions in restricting environmental pollution, and how they help to limit energy consumption.
My view is that we should support a report that is aimed at helping to shape a plan of action in the area of logistics at European level.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in which it says that the European Employment Services (EURES) network should become an important European labour market communication platform and a one-stop shop for workers' geographical and occupational mobility.
This one-stop shop should aim to remove obstacles, especially arising from work-related social security questions, and to extend the knowledge of workers about their individual rights.
Geographical and occupational mobility is a crucial instrument for the success of the Revised Lisbon Strategy and more generally for the proper operation of the internal market on the basis of the social market economy.
It is an important challenge for the introduction of 'flexicurity' approaches to employment, that is, approaches allowing greater flexibility in the management of human resources while providing the job security expected by our fellow citizens.
I voted in favour of the resolution on the EURES Activity Report 2004-2005 on the contribution of EURES to a single European labour market.
I believe that geographical and occupational mobility is a crucial instrument for the success of the Revised Lisbon Strategy.
In this regard, I consider that the European Commission should promote further the geographical and occupational mobility of workers through the increased budget line for 2007 in order to support projects in the area of transnational recruitment and cross-border partnerships.
The EURES network is presented as a possible European labour market communication platform, that is, as a factor which could help to encourage workers' geographical and occupational mobility.
It should also help to address the present shortcomings in terms of information provided in order to avoid the horrific situations facing workers in various countries where they have to go in order to work, generally because of unemployment in their own country, as is the case with Portuguese workers.
We must improve information on social security and on workers' rights with regard to holidays, pay, sickness benefit, housing benefit and benefits for education and training.
We need to ensure that the rights of workers going to work in a country other than their country of origin are duly recognised and upheld.
One serious issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of controls.
It is well known that workers are often required to work long hours, without proper housing, even with no contract of employment, and are paid much less than initially agreed.
These issues must be addressed if we are to achieve trouble-free worker mobility.
(CS) I supported the report aimed at contributing to a reduction in alcohol consumption where it is excessive and hazardous.
I also support the 0.00% limit but for professional drivers only.
I am against warning labels applied indiscriminately, as I consider it non-committal, as well as falling outside the EU's competence.
I believe that it is the responsibility of the national parliaments to adopt such measures, not to be applied indiscriminately, not to be populist or non-committal, but rather aimed at educating targeted risk groups, threatened by excessive alcohol consumption.
(FR) Mr President, the presentation of Mr Foglietta's own-initiative report has provoked comments that could suggest that all members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats underrate the serious problem of alcoholism.
I cannot approve of the casualness with which the problems of alcohol dependence are concealed out of reverence for the producers of alcoholic beverages and their lobbies.
The protection of young people deserves better, as does the treatment of alcoholism as a serious illness affecting everyone close to the person concerned.
In the end, this own-initiative report will do nothing to change the real situation.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to support the report in the final vote.
Nevertheless, we would have preferred to see stronger provisions on warnings on spirit bottles and on the risks of alcohol use by women during pregnancy.
It is regrettable that Parliament was not able to support the amendments and the parts of the existing text along those lines in the plenary.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Mr Foglietta on a European Union strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm.
The Commission was right to issue a communication on the hazardous and harmful consumption of alcohol and its harmful health consequences.
I support the recommendations, while not undermining the principle of subsidiarity, in favour of ambitious general objectives for the Member States with a view to curbing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, particularly in vulnerable social groups, such as children, young people and pregnant women.
I am pleased that MEPs, in their wisdom, acknowledge that the consumption of alcoholic products can be considered as a part of the European cultural heritage and life style, and that low consumption of alcohol (10 g/day) may, under certain conditions, help prevent some diseases.
in writing. - After tobacco and high blood pressure, alcohol abuse is the third most important cause of ill-health and early death in the EU, costing millions to our heath service.
Related road accidents continue to claim lives while related public order offences and underage drinking are on the rise across all of Europe.
The greatest tool of efficiency in decreasing alcohol-related harm is real awareness combined with enforcement.
Effective education in the home and in school from primary school up is paramount.
Women and men should be better informed about the risks of alcohol during pregnancy and about FASD in particular and I support the original language of the report emphasising the appropriate warning on the package of alcoholic beverages which may prevent women from drinking alcohol before and during pregnancy.
I call on the Irish government to examine mandatory labelling on alcoholic beverages targeting this syndrome.
I am very much in favour of asking the Commission to take steps to facilitate an independent study of the performance of innovative communication means, including labelling, as a way of reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption.
The June Movement supports warning labels on alcoholic beverages.
When these proposals return to Parliament, we shall work towards minimum labelling rules, so that Member States can legislate in line with the precautionary principle.
In my opinion, the problems associated with alcohol abuse are taking on worrying proportions in all EU Member States.
Beyond the traditional convivial consumption of alcohol, which varies from region to region and Member State to Member State, it is necessary to remember that regular, excessive consumption of alcohol has a harmful impact on health and serious, direct consequences: road accidents and antisocial behaviour.
Consequently, as a matter of urgency we need to remind alcohol producers and distributors of their responsibilities, to ask operators in the sector to provide the necessary support, to involve schools and families, to send out a message providing young people with positive examples and to increase awareness of risks among the more vulnerable sections of society.
in writing. - (PT) The report merely broaches, without going into detail, the central issue of the underlying reasons for alcohol abuse and therefore has the drawback of taking what we might call a cognitive/repressive approach based on the process of assessing the risk/threat/punishment balance.
It should be borne in mind that any addictive drug and any addictive behaviour have their own characteristics.
The report mentions the need for effective conclusions to be drawn based on collected data, but it seems to embark upon a road leading towards a foregone conclusion.
Before tackling the grand question of 'alcohol and the workplace' we ought to be stressing the capital importance of role models in the formation of young people's values and attitudes.
Even occupational health, which ought to play a central role here in prevention and therapeutic guidance, is seen as an extension of the repressive/exploiting arm of the employer rather than an independent mechanism for preventing health problems and promoting health.
A budgetary item should be created to fund programmes supporting workers who are suffering from workplace stress, excessive workloads, unemployment and job insecurity, directed at identifying and treating alcohol dependence, improving working conditions, preventing sickness and promoting health.
in writing. - (SV) The June List has chosen to vote against the report and several of the amendments.
Alcohol policy must be a national matter and cannot therefore be shaped at EU level.
Each Member State has its own drinking culture which must form the basis for its citizens' work to reduce alcohol-related harm.
International advances are being made in this area, as in nearly all others, as countries find their way along different paths.
By learning lessons from the experiences of other countries, each country can then develop its own alcohol strategy in the best possible way.
Such institutional competition among countries is the reason for the European countries' historical successes in nearly every area.
Parliament must not hamper that competition by pushing forward homogenisation at EU level.
I voted in favour of this report, which makes a number of concrete proposals to prevent alcohol abuse among vulnerable groups such as young people and pregnant women.
The report does not demonise moderate consumption of wine (except in the specific case of pregnant women), which is part of our culture and traditions, but addresses alcohol abuse.
I am also delighted with the proposed measures to provide more information to pregnant women on the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
Alcohol consumption, even in small quantities, is harmful to the foetus.
Facial abnormalities, microcephaly, neurological problems with agitation, behavioural problems, cognitive problems or even mental retardation: these are some of the risks for the child.
Lastly, I am satisfied with the proposal to introduce appropriate communication directed at pregnant women through healthcare services.
We would all like to combat hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, particularly by young people, whose latest fashionable excess is what the Germans call Koma-Saufen, a term well understood in my own country.
I recognise the European Union's competence in dealing with public health problems and the role it has to play to encourage the exchange of information and best practices among Member States.
Unfortunately, the resolution only highlights the harmful consequences of alcohol and not the benefits of moderate consumption.
Indeed, it is scientifically proven that wine consumed in moderation has a preventive effect against cardiovascular diseases, cancer and dementia.
But this valuable information is prohibited on labels by European regulations.
Why warn women before and during pregnancy and ignore the effect of alcoholism on the men procreating?
Why recommend higher taxes on alcoholic beverages when it is clear that alcoholism is worst in countries with very high taxes?
I would like to underline the fact that there can be no question of setting EU level blood alcohol content limits for all drivers.
Zero tolerance of drivers who commit offences, whether or not drink-drivers, would be more effective in fighting the increase in the number of road accident victims.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the above-mentioned report and welcome the inclusion of an amendment to paragraph 16, which I voted in favour of, highlighting the harmful effects of consuming alcohol during pregnancy.
Currently, Member States may use labelling to inform consumers about the potential negative effects of consuming alcohol, and this is something that the Irish government should certainly consider.
However, meaningful progress in terms of labelling can only be achieved through a degree of EU harmonisation in this area.
I look forward to the publication of the Commission's study on the performance of innovative means of communication to reduce hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption before 1 January 2010, as called for in the above-mentioned report.
in writing. - I supported this report and am pleased that there will now be a real effort to tackle under-age and binge drinking.
I support the recommendation also that the blood alcohol limit be as close to 0.00% as possible especially for new drivers although I realise that a 0.00% limit is impractical.
I believe that alcopops must be separated from soft drinks in supermarkets and I am pleased that the report highlights this.
It is all very well to legislate on milk, on its distribution in schools or the army, or on the creation of a new category, but the dairy sector is something else.
In the 1980s, the Commission in Brussels told us that there were milk lakes and butter mountains.
As with cereals, then, a policy of 'Malthusian bureaucracy' was introduced.
Under the impetus of the French Agriculture Minister, Michel Rocard, milk quotas were invented.
That is, rationing, the deliberate fabrication of scarcity.
For the first time in the history of humanity, people were preventing themselves from producing, and were rejecting the riches offered naturally by nature.
Worse still, to be certain of achieving scarcity, we went as far as the daft premium for the slaughter of cattle.
What was bound to happen has happened.
The barriers to production have limited production.
From milk lakes to the Aral Sea of milk.
There is a shortage of butter.
Prices are rising.
This shortage was organised, in the same way as for wheat.
in writing. - Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) need to be seriously considered as a matter of urgency.
FAS warnings on alcohol products, similar to those in the USA, combined with a public health education campaign are an effective way of warning of the impact of drinking while pregnant.
There is no safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and women deserve to know the facts.
The alcohol industry must act as a matter of urgency.
Also, all Members who have a financial interest in the alcohol industry should declare an interest.

Financial instability and the impact on the real economy (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on financial instability and the impact on the real economy.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as you would imagine, it is still too soon to evaluate the recent turbulence in the financial markets.
We must await more specific economic data and, as you know, the Council has not met since late July, but I agree with Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the Eurogroup, when he said that for the moment there is no perceptible impact on the growth forecasts in the euro area as a whole.
The European economy has continued to show strong growth based on solid foundations.
In fact this year has shown very positive results in terms of reducing budget deficits, stability of the euro, economic growth and employment.
It is against that background that we must view the recent financial turbulence that I mentioned earlier.
That is all I have to say on the matter for now.
I am sure that the informal meeting of the Ecofin Ministers, to be held on 14 and 15 September, in the Portuguese city of Porto, will, as is customary at those Council meetings, analyse the economic and financial situation of the European Union in greater detail on the basis of much more complete and up-to-date data.
I should also like to assure you that the Portuguese Presidency will continue the work of consolidating a single market for financial services.
Also the continuing high investment in convergence of supervisory practices and constant improvement of the prudential framework clearly shows that we have not underestimated the importance of a framework which promotes financial stability.
Finally, in general terms, the Presidency is committed to continuing implementation of the Lisbon Agenda.
Implementation of that agenda is the best contribution we can make to strengthening the potential for growth in the European economy and maintaining solid foundations and the Portuguese Presidency remains strongly committed in that field.
Commission. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks there has been serious turbulence in the financial markets, initially caused by the deterioration in the US sub-prime mortgage market.
This deterioration extended to all the financial markets via securities and financial products supported by those mortgages, which, in recent years, have been acquired in large quantities by financial institutions almost throughout the world.
If we look at corrections to stock markets over recent weeks, they have not been greater than previous market corrections over the last two years; however, what happened recently is unusual in that it gave rise to a liquidity crisis in the interbank markets, which obliged the central banks to inject large amounts of money.
The liquidity problems are clearly linked to a decline of confidence owing to a lack of information on the global exposure of market operators to the products linked to North American high-risk mortgages.
The impact of this turbulence could go beyond what we have seen so far and it therefore demands our full attention and fully justifies today's debate.
It is still too early to quantify the consequences of this crisis on the real economy.
The final impact will depend principally on three factors.
Firstly, we will have to see what direct impact the deterioration in the North American housing market has on the overall US economy, although there is no doubt that it will be negative, and US growth will be lower than predicted up till now.
Given the influence of the US economy on the wider global economy, a slowdown in growth in the United States will have some impact on the rest of the world, in particular, on European economies.
This impact should, in principle, be limited, in our case, as EU countries mainly trade within the EU.
Moreover, the global economy continues to enjoy a high rate of growth, thanks to the dynamism of the emerging countries, among others.
Emerging countries have certainly not been greatly affected by this crisis.
The second relevant factor when evaluating the possible impact of the financial turbulence is the changes in financing conditions for businesses and households.
We are already seeing a re-evaluation of risk premiums to bring them more into line with the real assessment of that risk.
This is correcting a situation in which the abundance of liquidity had led to a degree of relaxation of risk assessment.
This has positive aspects, but if financing conditions were to be tightened beyond certain limits, economic activity would undoubtedly be affected by the reduced availability of capital.
The third factor, which is probably the most important and most difficult to predict, will be the impact on confidence.
Confidence is a key driver of investment and purchase decisions, but unlike the previous factors, it is a subjective value that is based on the overall messages, perceptions and information received by economic operators.
Among others, these include messages from the public authorities, whether national governments, parliamentary representatives or international organisations.
I therefore think that this debate is a good opportunity, not only to assess the direct consequences of what has happened on the markets in recent weeks, but also to recall and emphasise the fact that the European economy continues, as the representative of the Council has just said, to have solid foundations, which should not be significantly affected by the recent turbulence and that therefore our economy is in a good position to overcome the uncertainties that have arisen.
As I said before, the global economy is still extremely dynamic, and thanks to this there is still a trade surplus in the external sector of our economy, as demonstrated by the latest statistics published by Eurostat.
Investment, in particular in capital goods, remains at high levels, supporting current economic activity and anticipating future improvements in productivity.
Private consumption is benefiting from sustained job creation, so that our latest statistics show an unemployment rate in the euro area and in the EU that is almost comparable to historical lows: in the case of the euro area, unemployment is below 7%.
Inflation remains stable.
Thanks to all this, companies are enjoying positive results, which should enable them to cope with any tightening of credit without having to significantly review their investment and growth plans.
In short, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that, given that one of the risks of decline which we had been warning about for some time when we published our economic forecasts - risks of a decline in the US mortgage market and its impact on the US economy - has materialised, growth this year and next year in the European Union and in the euro area is not going to exceed our forecasts given in May this year.
Nevertheless we have good reason to remain confident about the foundations of the European economy and its capacity to overcome the current turbulence.
Next Tuesday, 11 September, on behalf of the Commission, I will publish the interim growth forecasts for 2007 both for the euro area and the EU, which will give us an initial indication of the possible impact of the crisis.
On the same day I will have the opportunity to present these forecasts to you when I appear before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The forecasts for 2008 and beyond, as you know, will have to wait until we publish our economic forecasts in November, as usual.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the United States sub-prime mortgage crisis and its potential impact in Europe have been occupying our attention in recent weeks.
The European mortgage market has different characteristics than that of the United States, so problems on anything like a similar scale are less likely to arise in Europe in the near future.
Sub-prime lending in the European Union is very limited compared to the United States and we have safeguards in place, such as lending rules and limits on loan to value.
The recent turmoil has, however, clearly demonstrated the interconnectivity and globalisation of financial markets.
Risks have been spread wisely.
This is positive.
Contagion, however, is an issue.
Some European banks and asset funds are exposed to sub-prime related securities.
There have been some real problems, notably via the liquidity squeeze of the asset-backed and commercial paper markets.
What can Europe learn from this crisis?
It is too early to draw firm conclusions, as there is too much uncertainty in the market.
It is also important to react sensibly, taking the necessary time to assess the situation.
Fast policy reaction is likely to be a bad reaction.
The following issues emerge from our preliminary thinking:
Firstly, the interconnectivity of markets shows how important it is to have a globally converged approach to regulation, with sound prudential rules and proper investor protection standards.
It makes the Commission's regulatory dialogues with the United States and other jurisdictions even more critical.
High standards of regulation are necessary throughout global financial markets, given the spill-over effects.
Secondly, questions about mortgage lending in the United States inevitably arise.
While I support the notion of facilitating access to the housing market for people who would not normally be able to buy a home, with hindsight the adequacy of regulation and consumer protection will inevitably be debated.
Repair is under way, but the problem will take some time to resolve.
One of the lessons from the crisis is the importance of lifetime financial education for citizens, whilst ensuring that responsible lending is enforced.
In the European Union we are already looking at these issues within our ongoing work on consumer and mortgage credit and consumer education.
Thirdly, the transfer of mortgage loans, and their risks, to other parties has been at the centre of this crisis.
Sometimes these risks have returned to the originating bank when their financial vehicles could not sell off or finance the bank-originated securities.
We certainly need to look closely at the mechanisms at play - that is the role of conduits and special-purpose vehicles, and their relevance for European banks.
The problems of valuation of complex securitised products and market-clearing mechanisms in stressful market situations also need further analysis.
The recent market crisis has also highlighted the importance of reputational - as well as liquidity - risks as important drivers to properly assess banks' risk exposure to complex transactions.
Fourthly, what about Basel II, the new capital requirements directive for banks?
Basel II provides improved opportunities to banks and investment firms to properly assess risks and to correctly calibrate their regulatory capital.
So will Solvency II, which is Basel's broad equivalent for the insurance sector.
However, this does not mean we should be complacent.
There will be implications that will require careful examination by regulators.
For example, more work will be needed on the capital calibration of complex products and of banks' ability to identify potential problems in crisis situations, including potential concentration of risks in certain areas.
Fifthly, many hedge funds have been particularly active in the structured credit markets.
Many of those hedge funds and their wealthy private or institutional investors may have incurred losses - some heavy - in recent months.
That is the way markets go.
Sophisticated players in hedge funds know this.
Financial markets function on risk.
I do not criticise those who make fortunes when times are good; I am not going to shed any tears now if there are losses.
However, the crucial thing is that hedge fund failures do not appear to have spilled over to the wider financial system.
Investment fund rules, USITs, have held up.
Our prudential framework and bank risk controls have, as we expected, prevented hedge fund failures from triggering wider systemic disruption.
As much as some people want to demonise hedge funds, they are not the cause of the difficulties in the market.
Let us not forget where the present crisis has its roots: poor-quality lending, compounded by securitisation of these loans in off-balance sheet vehicles, the risks associated with which few understood.
These are issues that prudential authorities and supervisors will need to focus on in the time ahead.
Sixthly, what was the role of credit-rating agencies in this crisis?
I have already expressed criticism about how slow they were in downgrading their credit ratings for structural finance backed up by sub-prime lending.
How robust was their methodology?
How well were the limitations in the ratings of structural products, vis-Ã -vis standard corporate ratings, explained and understood?
Potential conflicts of interests of credit-rating agencies is another concern: on the one hand because they act as advisers to banks on how to structure their offerings to get the best mix of ratings; on the other, credit-rating agencies provide ratings that are widely relied upon by investors.
They also concern regulators, given their importance for the calculation of banks' capital requirements.
It has been alleged that there was unwarranted rating inflation for structural products.
The role of credit-rating agencies needs to be clearer: what they do and what they do not do, the extent to which they can be relied up and the extent to which they cannot.
I am following up these issues with Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and I intend raising them also with our international partners.
What we need are clear, robust, methodological rules and principles that are rigorously applied, and a much deeper understanding by investors of the uses and limitations of ratings and their reliability or otherwise.
The scope for conflicts of interest to influence ratings must be firmly addressed.
Of course, adequate due diligence by other market players is also essential.
Where was it?
Were firms and the professionals they employ constantly and objectively assessing the quality of the instruments they were buying and selling and the risk implications of the structures of those instruments, or were they just assuming?
Did they stop and consider the viability of the underlying assets, the fraud risks, the track records of the originators and the trends in the markets?
Did they question the ratings themselves and did they have access to the necessary data, both qualitative and quantitative, to do so?
I hope that the boards of all financial firms will examine their actions and draw appropriate conclusions.
We believe that light-touch, principled-based regulation is the best approach for the financial sector - it has proven its value.
But we need to remain vigilant and draw lessons.
All parties need to take their responsibility and to take it seriously.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, while the Council was not meeting, at least the European Central Bank, was at work and I think can be given some credit for having stemmed the possible further infection in Europe.
Let us hope it will continue to play that sensible, reasonable and sensitive role.
But every so often it seems that it is the inevitable fact of financial life that the chase after competitive advantage will lead to excesses, which in turn lead to the predictable bust.
These pressures are largely responsible also for the urge to develop these innovative financial instruments which Mr McCreevy described, and which lurk behind the development of this crisis in the American sub-prime mortgage market and its resulting transmission to Europe.
I do not see this situation as a justification for a witch-hunt on hedge funds.
To some extent they have been perhaps sophisticated, or naive, victims of these new-fangled alchemies.
In the same way, normally conservative but naive banks have been tempted by the enhanced interest rates paid by these supposedly high-rated instruments to go for what has obviously turned out to be too good to be true.
It seems that few operators in the financial markets, including, probably, few regulators, sufficiently understand these instruments, these credit derivatives, these collateralised debt obligations.
Even less do they fully understand the potential risks and implications.
So it is incumbent on the authorities both in the US and Europe - and I am glad to see that Mr McCreevy is going to take this particular aspect so seriously - that they all become more conversant with these mechanisms with their structuring and their slicing, how these slices are rated, valued, accounted, with their marketing, with their liquidity and tradability.
Innovation is as desirable in financial mechanisms as anywhere else.
This must not be inhibited but, when problems of this seriousness are likely to emerge, it is essential that managers and regulators shoulder their responsibilities to understand them fully and, if and where necessary, introduce the requisite restraints.
Mr President, the cost of August's turbulence on the financial markets has not yet emerged.
The Commission - we have just heard - is expecting a negative impact on growth.
The real losses suffered by the banks and other financial players will become apparent when their annual accounts are drawn up.
According to Commissioner Almunia, we still lack information about the actual, overall exposure of all the players.
The fact that those who took risks that were too great are footing the bill is a salutary principle, but behind the speculative activism of the financial world, there are victims: the families caught in the trap of mortgage lending based on the promise of unlimited growth in the property market and small investors directed to risks that were undervalued by all those living off fat commissions, including the credit rating agencies.
The Socialist group has been asking for years for increased supervision of hedge funds and all the special instruments being endlessly multiplied by the markets.
As Carlo Ciampi maintains, the tumultuous development of derivative products is free from any kind of control.
Even the directors of major banks no longer understand these opaque instruments.
The real risks, for example the property loans, are sliced up ad infinitum, and repeatedly included in investment fund products and stock exchange instruments, with the result that nobody can locate the original risk any more.
The market expects the central banks to come to the rescue of the speculators.
The ECB did in fact, in its role as lender of last resort.
One might therefore ask why the ECB has had to inject more capital than the Federal Reserve into the market when it suddenly became illiquid, even though the sub-prime crisis came from the United States.
Were the European banks more gullible?
Did the supervisory authorities fail to do their job properly?
The Socialist group demands that the Commission should learn lessons from the financial market, which has become too opaque and therefore extremely dangerous for the real economy.
(Applause)
Firstly, I would like to answer Mr Goebbels's question about why the European Central Bank allocated more money than the US Central Bank.
It is because the EU economy is now the largest in the world.
This is a great challenge for us all.
The fact that the OECD and the European Commission assessed the potential outcomes of the financial problems in the market differently on the same day surprised and saddened me.
This means that the European Commission should probably adjust its economic assessment models, especially since they are likely to be based on mathematical methods.
It is worrying, as forecasting economic policy is a complicated matter and the instruments used must be flexible.
What should we do now when we meet new challenges?
I would not like to comment here on the problems that arise; my fellow members have done this so well.
I would just like to emphasise one point.
Firstly, the crisis occurred because of the aggressive monetary policy within the EU's boundaries when it was attempted to solve the problems of the Internet bubble.
Thus we cannot influence various decisions of third countries.
We can strengthen the dialogue and cooperation with supervisory bodies, but the European Union faces a dilemma: a global merger of financial institutions is currently taking place and it is possible that we will no longer have a single market.
We will have a transatlantic market in the area of securities; perhaps we will have some other market in the area of insurance.
This means that we need to decide whether we consider Europe to be a single market and require all agreements to be made at European level.
Can we accept pilot projects when one of our markets enters the world stage independently?
We need agreement on this, otherwise it will be very difficult to manage this crisis.
I would like to emphasise one more thing.
Financial markets are under reconstruction.
We ourselves acknowledged the role of non-banking institutions in the SEPA Directive.
We need to admit that various Islamic banks and foundations are appearing and finally that trading networks are entering the financial market.
Thus the regulation of non-banking institutions is also necessary - common regulation, which would make the rules of the game the same for both banking and non-banking institutions.
This is today's reality.
The third issue that I would like to emphasise is that I am worried that we use only risky models as a basis.
This principle of risk assessment has proved to be very subjective, and I therefore have doubts about the Solvency II and Basel II directives.
We cannot trust rating agencies; we can criticise them, but the problem will remain.
We should trust market instruments - that is, liquidity.
If we cannot sell particular securities on the market or if they are rarely traded, no rating agency can evaluate them.
This should be properly understood and we need to reduce the dependence of our legislation on the opinions of rating agencies.
To conclude, I would certainly like to say that there is no need to rescue financial institutions.
I can say from my own experience after the financial crisis in Lithuania that when bankers spend a couple of weeks in prison they very quickly understand how to manage banks.
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioners for their response.
The events that took place in August in the sub-prime market highlighted a number of issues for all of us.
First of all, the globalised nature of the financial markets which we are now dealing with, and the issue of how quickly regulation or supervision can keep pace with the way new products are being developed and new ideas are being developed.
But it also brings to mind something an old farmer in West Cork in the south-west of Ireland once said to me: there is no such thing as an oil that can make your hair grow - apologies to those folically challenged within the Chamber; there is no such thing as a pair of glasses that can let you see through clothes and, also, there is a fool born every day.
The reality is that the products made available were high risk, and no matter what anybody says, the idea of caveat emptor is one that should have been at the very core of any decisions with regard to banks or other funds that we were going to invest in these high-risk products.
It brings starkly into contrast the role of the credit-ratings agencies and their responsibility, not only with regard to the advice they give, but, in particular, regarding their informing us in a transparent manner as to whether they are representing these funds themselves or whether they are actually giving clear, independent advice.
Colleagues will remember that, a number of years ago, we discussed a directive on consumer credit, and the whole area of transparency and of having independent advice available to the consumers was one key element.
Now, it is laughable that some of the biggest financial institutions in the world - and some in Europe - who are the people who spend so much money on buying-in expertise and telling us in Europe how we should run our economies, can be the ones who are now caught because of their bad investment policy.
I congratulate Commissioner McCreevy on his willingness to take on this issue and to tackle some of these areas.
I also think it is essential now, not only in looking at credit-rating agencies, but also with regard to the risk that European banks are being exposed to because of the policies of some of those investments, and next week ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis demands that I highlight three points.
First, it comes from a hardship crisis among North American national officials.
It should be understood that all US officials have very serious deficits, described by what we call the US twin deficits.
We have had this crisis, we will have others, either from large US companies, US states or even perhaps from the Federal Government.
We should expect some more very serious crises to come from the United States over the coming years.
Second, this crisis happened in the United States in March.
It spread throughout the world through hedge funds, the first two of which failed in June.
It only affected European banks in late July, early August.
We did have time to realise that the flames were spreading.
Mrs Merkel, our President-in-Office at the time of the G8, told us to take measures concerning hedge funds, and nobody listened to her.
Worse still, the Netherlands are in the process of developing a policy to deregulate the establishment of hedge funds within the country.
At the same time as it is speaking against hedge funds, the European Union is encouraging their development in its own territory.
This shows a genuine failure of attempts by the European Union to impose supervisory measures and prudential rules upon itself.
As a former rapporteur in favour of prudential rules and supervision of financial conglomerates, I experience this as a personal failure.
I recall that we needed more than one parliamentary term to write the simplified prospectus on issuing securities in Europe.
Today, one bank is not capable of reading the complex prospectus that another bank publishes on the content of the funds it is selling.
That is what it has come to.
The third problem, as I told the Central Bank years ago, is that you cannot regulate the monetary system solely with measures aimed at the lending rate.
I think the crisis in Europe was precipitated by the increase in the European Central Bank's interest rate at the end of the last quarter.
I do not think it is enough to say you should reduce the rate by 0.5% or keep the same rate or increase it by 0.5%.
We have a genuine problem to sort out, which is the reintroduction of a selective policy for lending, so that the interest rate can be set at 0% for necessary investments such as fighting climate change and can be much more expensive for lending directed at speculation.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I would like to address my remarks to the gallery, which is a lot more filled than this Hemicycle is with Members.
I hope you have got your headphones on because decisions are being made here today by people with absolutely no knowledge of international finance at all.
I have been 40 years in financial services; I am a professional economist - we are talking about hedge funds, we are talking about international currency.
If you want to look up the books and see what expertise the Members of the European Parliament have, I think you will be bitterly disappointed.
But here we are, making decisions for global finance.
Forty percent of British GDP is the City of London.
We have people from Poland, the Czech Republic and Latvia who have absolutely no knowledge of these sorts of things whatsoever, deciding where we are going to go for the future in international finance.
(Uproar)
They do not understand about these things.
They do not know anything about these things, any more than they do about agricultural policy, fisheries policy - the lot - but here it is.
Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, if you want to see international finance, go to Dubai, to New York, to Los Angeles, to Bermuda.
You are looking at the people down there - look at them.
None of them have ever done a real job in their lives.
This is a Mickey Mouse assembly, and we are going to lose the lot.
May I draw your attention to the fact that when you are speaking in the Hemicycle, you address the President and the Members, while those who are taking part in the session are the audience.
Please have respect for those who are showing you the respect of listening to you.
(applause)
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the collapse of the US market in high-risk loans has caused a splash that is still being felt on the stock markets today and which has thrown speculators and savers into serious crisis.
What the US real estate operators did is common knowledge: they offered loans, which were then defaulted on, to high-risk individuals, thus placing not only the financial products but also many banks in crisis.
This year a very high percentage of borrowers has stopped paying the instalments owed, placing the entire system in crisis.
In Italy, apart from the stock-market movements, it appears that the crisis has only had a slight effect on the national banking system because Italian banks, apparently, are not directly exposed to sub-prime loans.
This was not the case for many German, British and French banks and that is why we are having this debate today.
Therefore the least we can hope for is the opening of an enquiry into the largest international credit rating agencies on their role in these events and thus action on financial instability and on the impact on the real economy.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to tell you what happens in Italy - because loans and home purchases in my country are significant - and let me recount to you what an important Italian weekly publication, L'Espresso, said about the ethics of some Italian politicians (who, by the way, have also been our colleagues) in the face of the sufferings of so many savers and those who clamber to pay loans, when in fact a simple institution such as the social loan could make owning a house a reality.
In the face of all this, listen to what L'Espresso reveals about some Italian left-wing politicians - a fact that is worth emphasising - as well as some centrist figures, but above all left-wing ones.
These gentlemen, whose first and last names and addresses are listed, benefited from exceptionally favourable terms for purchasing property in Rome.
Recommendations, you may say, are a practice, perhaps an accepted practice, and perhaps an ancient practice, in my country - and not just in Italy, but perhaps worldwide.
However, when a recommendation is requested and the favour is obtained from a bank or insurance company, I ask myself, what is given in exchange by those in power?
According to the weekly publication, Mr Veltroni, Mr Prodi's successor, Ms Cossutta, daughter of one of the most radical and committed communists, Mr Violante, former Prime Minister and among the most well-known arbiters of other people's ethics, as well as Mr Marino, Mr Mancino, Mr Mastella, Mr Casini, Mr Proietti and Mr Baccini purchased houses in Rome with at times as many as 25-30 rooms at a quarter, if not less, of the market price, given these special terms by owners who, strangely enough, are banks and insurance companies.
Democracy has its costs, you may say, and as the proletariat had its costs so today does progressive socialism, which has inherited from its predecessors the ability to be specific in the pursuit of its own interests.
If you are strangled by your mortgage month after month and, like me, you have the good fortune to suffer from it a little less thanks to this seat in Parliament and the activity of your spouse who now contributes, you should blame the communists, old and new, who have decided to liberalise taxi licences and the opening hours of barbers and to sell medicine in supermarkets, but have left the banks free to decide what sacrifices to impose on your families, to mortgage your futures and your lives.
You have only yourselves to blame, Italian and European citizens, if you have decided to do something other than pursue a career in one of the Italian parties that govern or have governed cities, regions and nations, and which in governing are governed by the banks.
(ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I would first of all like to express my thanks for the words of our authority figures regarding maintaining an optimistic stance in the face of the crisis that we are experiencing.
At the same time, however, I would also like to bring as much realism as possible to this debate, as concealing the seriousness of the facts will only lead to confusion when it comes to seeking solutions.
Firstly, we are facing a crisis that was predicted.
We are not facing a surprise crisis.
It was known that this would happen at least one year before, and there has been a lack of care, a lack of capacity to react.
Secondly, we are facing a serious crisis.
The President of the Bundesbank said so himself just over three days ago.
We may be on the verge of a classic banking crisis of withdrawal of confidence.
Thirdly, Europe has been infected by financial institutions in countries that have been unable to make profits because their economies were relatively stagnant, and have therefore sought profit at a greater risk.
It could therefore be said that the supervisory authorities, the European prudential authorities, have failed to prevent this from happening.
The European Central Bank is therefore the first to intervene in the crisis, the one that is injecting the most money, precisely because it is in Europe, in the heart of Europe, which is now recovering economically, where this crisis could become most serious.
We therefore need more clarity as to what the actual repercussions are and how major this crisis really is.
Undoubtedly the fourth characteristic of what we are experiencing, the circumstances that we are in, is, in short, the reaction of our monetary authorities, the reaction of the European Central Bank.
In my opinion, it acted correctly when it made these injections of liquidity, because what we are seeing is a withdrawal of liquidity. However, it is also true that it is paradoxical that this should happen precisely when Europe is raising interest rates in order to restrict the liquidity of the system, to restrict credit.
This is a major paradox that needs to be explained properly, without the confusion that arose from the explanations given throughout August.
Clarification is essential, because we are talking about millions of families and millions of small and medium-sized enterprises, which depend on variable interest rates in Europe, getting into debt.
Therefore, it is essential that we clarify the interest rate scenario and ask for caution in interest rate rises in Europe, in order to strengthen the economic growth and job creation that we need so much at this stage of EU integration.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we must be realistic: despite being the powerful European legislator that we are, we will not be able to do anything about the origin of this crisis.
We are powerless against US legislation that fails to understand consumer protection in mortgage lending, whether by banks or by other institutions.
Let us be realistic: we are facing a crisis of which we urgently need to correct the effects, but also learn the long-term lessons.
Let us be clear: our European citizens are, quite rightly, worried about the consequences of this crisis for the financing of the real economy.
Let us be clear: our fellow citizens do not understand that, to cope with the risk-taking of a few, whose method of remuneration does not follow any economic logic, public institutions like the European Central Bank are at the end of the day forced to intervene to guarantee the liquidity of the market.
Let us cope with the situation.
Let us stand where Europeans should stand, grounded in realism and proposals.
In the end the Central Bank did its job as lender of last resort.
However, as a supervisory body, it is powerless to find out the reality of the risks taken by the market players.
We must improve the supervisory powers of the European authorities, and it is your job, Commissioner, to play an active part in this too.
Let us cope with the situation: we have been talking for many years about fair value, and this same fair value has today worsened the conditions for valuing sub-primes.
Let us cope with the situation: as regards the credit rating agencies, the IOSCO code of conduct, Commissioner, does not meet the demands of the current situation.
We need a truly competitive market, in which there are no conflicts of interest and which is characterised by greater transparency.
Finally, let us be utopian and hope that the use of the financial bubble created in this way will finally start to release finance for the long-term investment Europe needs to cope with the climate and energy challenge.
Sometimes utopia can be the best form of realism.
- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves in this Parliament facing once again a problem we faced back in July.
At that time, some uncertainties were expressed concerning the crisis which was then about to strike the euro area.
This was a crisis foretold, as indicated by the news coming from the USA.
It had already been clear for some time that property prices in the USA were excessively inflated and that the US system allowed loans to be granted too easily to insolvent persons, or to be granted at very high interest rates, and the resulting turbulence in the global market was inevitable.
Who has played a part in this game?
Investors, citizens, mainly from the US but also Europeans, are suffering its negative impact; citizens and investors, savers.
Thus the question is whether this Chamber, and the institutions in general, have the protection of savers at heart.
Protecting savers means understanding the role played by the other operators within this framework or in this scenario, the role of the credit rating companies, which often display a great inconsistency and have conflicts which at times go unchallenged.
I believe that rules and standards ought to apply to all of this.
The crisis has also highlighted a marked contradiction at a time in which the ECB has been forced to make financial movements in the market and at the same time to raise interest rates to tackle the risk of inflation.
Let us hope that this situation will not persist.
The fact that this is happening, however, means that we must ask ourselves how the standards governing persons on the world stage - since this is a crisis which has once more highlighted the aspect of globalisation - ought to define the conduct of every person.
(LV) Mr President, the current financial instability should not have come as a surprise, but when it materialised, everyone was shocked.
Insecure consumer and property loans gave rise to a growing demand for liquidity.
Market corrections are occurring because for a long time money has been too cheap, and this has eroded standards for evaluating investments.
A lack of confidence in the market has damaged even attractive assets, which ought not to have been subject to the downward price correction.
We can now be sure that easily accessible, cheap money does not create stable growth.
The foundation for stable growth is the proactive reform of systems, effective investments and markets that function more freely and more transparently.
At the moment the main fears revolve around the liquidity crisis turning into an insolvency crisis.
Instability that starts off in the form of a liquidity crisis can degenerate into an insolvency crisis, since market participants, convinced that their level of knowledge is inadequate, will be unwilling to lend to each other.
The property crisis may create serious complications in several EU Member States, not just in the United States.
Investors and depositors will not recover confidence in the financial market until they are convinced that evaluations are correct.
This means that risk premiums may increase, and as a result company and household consumption will decrease.
This could reduce investment movements or, in some cases, even bring them to a halt.
Europe's fiscal and monetary policy makers must be ready for this.
The main responsibility for stabilising the situation will fall to fiscal policy makers.
In the monetary policy sphere we can expect lower interest rates, which many European politicians have been longing to see.
At the same time the market should not harbour the misleading belief that risky investments will remain.
Both loan rates and demands for collateral should reduce the moral damage that such a belief could create.
In the long term, the central banks need to improve regulatory mechanisms for the financial markets in order to establish greater clarity and certainty within them.
Thank you.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the full extent of the instability sensed on the global financial markets is not yet clear.
The weak points of global finance are the poor creditworthiness of borrowers on the US mortgage market and the errors made in assessing credit risks of assets and/or in auditing these.
We could ask what happened to Basel II in this phase in the United States; I realise that it has not been brought in yet, but it would have been helpful.
In the United States, a mortgage volume of USD 120 billion has been adjusted up to now. This fact alone has triggered rate-adjustment shock of the proportions known.
Approximately 700 billion more mortgages are to be adjusted in the next two years.
Heightened investor sensitivity has exacerbated the dilemma, with confidence and the appetite for high-risk investments down.
Even boards of directors of banks are now admitting that they did not know what they were doing.
Lack of investor confidence and realistic assessments are currently preventing a return to normal levels - a process that will undoubtedly take some time and will not even spare the professionals of banking supervisory bodies.
Confidence cannot be expressed statistically by mathematical formulae.
However, transparency builds and maintains confidence and facilitates risk control.
Commissioner, you mentioned Solvency II.
The risks from hedge funds and sub-prime mortgages have tended to be low thus far in the insurance sector; and that is the way it should stay.
That is why Solvency II is intended to provide the right starting points and incentives.
Under the present proposals, alternative investments such as hedge funds and asset-backed securities, which are often also exposed to sub-prime risk, will be subject to own-capital backing of 45% as a standard consequence of Solvency II.
This may seem high at first glance, but it provides a clear incentive for enterprises to push an envisaged hedge fund to disclose its investment to the investor.
In my opinion, one principle applies here, and that is that only those who have the necessary know-how themselves should be making higher-risk capital investments.
The European Parliament has long been calling for transparency in specific financial products and mechanisms.
A response by the Commission to the creation of further transparency rules for the 9 000 and more existing hedge funds is overdue.
Transparency rules for credit rating agencies are also needed.
A more realistic assessment of global credit risk would benefit both.
Over the past few years, European budgets and the economy have been incurring multiple debts.
The sin of taking out loans at enticingly low rates of interest automatically produces imbalances between monetary and real-economy performance.
Mr President, there is a lot to say about this financial crisis, but I will use my two short minutes to focus on three areas where I think we need to take action.
The first is the lack of regulation.
Several members have said this already.
Complex new products, and particularly the diversification and securitisation of risks, is something which is a key element in this crisis.
It was sold to us as a perfect method to get rid of risks, but it is now clear that diversification has also meant a proliferation of risks and of the insecurity that is now everywhere.
The second element concerning regulation is that these operations largely take place outside the regulated market: over-the-counter activities and hedge funds, as has been mentioned already.
I really think that we have to investigate where these blind spots are leading.
I know Mr McCreevy does not agree, but I think it is really high time now to look into possibilities of regulation - not to over-regulate, not to panic, but really to conduct a serious study.
That is what the Commission should do.
Another element is the lack of information and transparency.
This has also been mentioned by several people.
I want to mention the ratings agencies as well, and the accounting rules which Mrs BerÃšs also mentioned - the fair value issue.
This is linked to my third point, which is the lack of coordination and cooperation.
That is an element which we have seen now in the actions that have been undertaken by the ECB, which correctly provided liquidity but did not have the information and does not have the tools to punish those who caused the crisis.
There should be a much closer link between the ECB and its knowledge and the supervisors.
A very important element is cooperation and the strengthening and reinforcing of European-level supervision, which really has a grip on these phenomena at the top of the market and these new phenomena.
I have mentioned several times that we need such European-level supervision.
People then tell me, even if they agree, that you have to wait for a crisis to appear because the sense of urgency is not there.
I think now it is high time, and the crisis is there, so now we should act.
(SV) Mr President, this summer's financial unrest has clearly shown how closely integrated the markets are.
The global financial market literally runs around the clock, with millions of transactions that affect us all.
New technologies create entirely different conditions.
The possibility of creating better prospects for development in investment has increased dramatically.
Access to venture capital is vital here.
Many new financial instruments, which some have called into question today, have been largely good and increased liquidity and investment opportunities.
During the turbulent past few weeks on the financial markets it has been shown that it is good that Europe has a strong central bank.
The ECB was able to act more quickly than its counterpart in Washington and could take rapid action to calm the markets.
For that the ECB deserves praise.
We still do not know how far the US mortgage crisis will continue to spread.
The autumn will be crucial as new statistics emerge.
Hopefully there will be a normal market adjustment without any great convulsions that might affect the regional economy, which is essentially healthy within the European Union.
I hope - unlike some of my fellow Members here, obviously - that in Europe we do not overreact and think that the solution always demands more regulation and decisions taken in too great haste, as Mr McCreevy said.
Despite the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, with extensive regulation, the risky mortgages were not discovered in time.
A smoothly functioning financial market requires a balanced approach, and space for new methods combined with legislation that strengthens the interests of consumers.
I think that MiFID is a good example here.
For me as a liberal, openness and transparency are key in the financial markets.
I would also like to see more cooperation between the EU's financial authorities to combat crisis situations and to provide a rapid response.
Mr President, Commissioners, I must make one comment: when things are blowing up around the world, it is clear that a small currency and a small market like Sweden's are hit lightning-fast.
The events of the summer have given me further reason for Swedish entry to the euro.
- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the grave spectre of the debacle resulting from the sub-prime loans also hangs over European banks.
Many of their management funds irresponsibly stuffed themselves with derivative products.
There is a serious risk of contagion via private equity.
The banks have irresponsibly palmed mortgage bonds off on institutional investors and thus also on savers, presenting them as having a triple A rating - theoretically risk-free like national securities - instead of at a very high risk of default, like negative equity loans.
Speculation, set free to lord it over the globalised financial market, has led small savers to believe that derivatives are the philosopher's stone of the third millennium.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
This chain of events is definitely not over and those who are really responsible remain unpunished - the hidden schemers of high finance.
Here speakers have been restricting themselves to pointing the finger of blame at the credit rating companies, but why have we permitted the assessment and control of the riskiness of financial products to be entrusted to companies closely involved with and with an interest in the growth of a market that is under the intoxicating influence of speculation?
Please, have the courage to face it clearly: not only is the improper use of derivatives harmful, but the derivatives are harmful in themselves.
Derivatives are to the real economy as usury is to savings and the productive economy, as a great American poet, Ezra Pound, taught us in his canto: 'With usura hath no man a house of good stone each block cut smooth and well fitting that design might cover their face, with usura seeth no man Gonzaga, no picture is made to endure nor to live with but it is made to sell and sell quickly, sin against nature.
Pietro Lombardo came not by usura, Duccio came not by usura, nor Pier della Francesca, Zuan Bellin' not by usura, nor was 'La Calunnia' painted.
Came not by usura Angelico.
Usura rusteth the chisel, it rusteth the craft and the craftsman.
Usura slayeth the child in the womb, it stayeth the young man's courting, it hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth between the young bride and her bridegroom.'
Usury is not the way to govern the world, to protect the widespread interests of honest people who work, produce and save.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, this financial crisis is a wake-up call for all of us and also for Commissioner McCreevy.
Only a few months ago Mr McCreevy assured us that the talk about financial risks and crises was theoretical and we would never run into new bubbles.
Now we have just been confronted with one, which has serious consequences, according to today's Financial Times, the OECD and other qualified institutions.
I have four questions for Mr McCreevy.
Firstly, if we look at the derivatives - credit derivatives, credit market - you blame the agencies and say that they are not good enough; I say that we do not know anything about what is going on.
Are you ready now to propose a public classification of the complex derivatives in such a way that the public and private agencies can give us guidance on the risk connected to them?
Because that is impossible today.
My second question is about the conflict of interest.
If we take the prime brokers, the hedge funds and private equity funds, we see that they are mixed up in a complex set of interests: they earn income from each other, they trade with each other and we do not know what is going on.
Are you ready now to introduce rules of transparency, disclosure and accountability which give us a real chance of regulating the market?
My third question concerns pension funds.
We know that wage-earners and workers are having losses connected to putting money into hedge-fund speculating in this derivative market.
Are you ready to introduce rules which can protect the pension funds and insurance companies trying to administer wage-earners' money in the future so that they have an interest in saving and knowing that the losses are limited?
My final question is: how can you defend the fact that the hedge funds, private equity and investment banks are the last resort on the international and financial markets without any regulations?
We have the usage to regulate the banks and the mutual funds, why should they - hedge funds, private equity, investment banks - be the last resort?
I cannot explain it, you cannot explain it.
It is time to put the common interests at the front, and that is why we need regulation.
(Applause)
(ES) Mr President, following the storm, the skies have not yet cleared, and in the midst of the uncertainty there is a demand for economic stability, financial security, growth and job creation.
This crisis is a great opportunity to take action in four major areas.
Firstly, we need to act to limit its impact on the economy as a whole.
The market has reacted with turbulence in share prices and a tightening of financial conditions.
The European Central Bank's response of providing liquidity was a positive one.
Financial institutions have already increased their interest rates to their clients, in anticipation of the predicted rises within a few months, taking into account the growth of the economy and the announcements made by the European Central Bank.
I hope that the European Central Bank will act in a balanced, prudent manner for our economy.
Secondly, we need to act to improve risk management and economic governance.
There is symmetry between a global financial services market and a national regulation and supervision system.
If within the European Union we do not promote these objectives in an integrated way, we will not be able to put them forward at global level, and we will not be protecting our citizens or defending their interests.
Thirdly, we need to act to make the market more transparent.
The diversification and dispersal of risk can be positive if it does not prevent risks from being controlled in the market.
We need to adopt measures in order to map out financial risks.
Finally, we need to act to make the operators more responsible.
Trapping people with limited resources into debt with very expensive mortgages that could even be described as predatory during a period of interest rate rises and the end of the growth trend in the property market is bound to generate problems.
The banks that relaxed mortgage conditions because of the possibility of transferring those mortgages, the rating agencies that did not warn about the quality of the securities, the investors that purchased securities imprudently and the institutions that financed them without additional guarantees all have a responsibility, and we need to make sure that this does not happen again.
Mr President, the process of sub-prime lending has definitely been a huge problem causing the financial turbulence which we have witnessed this summer.
That was clear, but what is less clear is the identification of investors and counterparties which may be, and continue to be, under stress, and that identity is absolutely vital for us to clear up.
This is due by and large, as we have heard today, to the sophistication of financial instruments which are viewed by some as akin to alchemy.
However, we need to take a careful and cautious look at what to do about these and the effects that have been caused by that turbulence.
Over-reaction may be equally as damaging as what has already occurred, as we find the price of credit rising as a result.
This is not good for the Lisbon Process, we should be reminded.
So what has actually happened in the USA to close the door on some of these issues?
It might be said that the barn door has just been closed when the horse is in the field, and that would be true to say.
However, largely speaking, the sub-prime mortgage lending area was unregulated.
That is a fact now which has been addressed very directly as industrial regulatory and legislative initiatives, I am told, are under way.
At the same time, a high level working group has been set up under the auspices of the White House to look at credit rating agencies and sophisticated financial vehicles.
What we can draw from that is that it is vital to work closely with the United States and other global markets as we share the same conclusions about the transparency in these markets.
If we do not, because the global markets are intertwined so closely, we will stand to lose so much of the benefit that could be added by the conclusions which we would have to share.
What has happened within the EU and what has happened within the US?
I share some confidence now in the Commission, and of course with the ECB as well as with the Federal Reserve in the United States, in what they have done.
They have helped to settle down the markets, which was exactly what we needed to do.
I can agree, however, with some of the speakers here today on calling for proportionate responses and I can maintain that in the sense of the confidence that I have.
I believe that the securitisation and special purpose vehicles, which will be under scrutiny along with the credit rating agencies, do need to be opened up to greater scrutiny and transparency, that is clear, as Ms BerÃšs has already said.
But let us be clear that the sophistication of financial instruments is difficult for many of us to understand, and the role of credit rating agencies is open.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, that was a clear enough message to the Commission.
We can already foresee that the US mortgage crisis will have noticeable adverse effects here, too.
The volume of outstanding mortgage loans already exceeds US public debt.
Even speculation based on future property appreciation and low interest rates on mortgage loans has clearly proved to be a bubble.
Now, fears of recession are being voiced ever louder in the United States.
After all, eight out of ten recessions start with a property crisis. We now know that the crisis was foreseeable but that credit rating agencies did not carry out their role of watchdog.
High-risk forms of capital are capable of doing all of us and the economy very great harm and thus must not be left to their own devices or to speculators.
The principles of transparency and duty of disclosure, and also controls, must be guaranteed.
The Commission is now required to present proposals on this.
(FR) Mr President, this crisis is the third major crisis in 10 years.
Could it have been avoided?
Mr McCreevy tells us it could.
To do this, we would need to teach the poor not to borrow money when they have none.
What is the reality?
US sub-prime mortgage lenders are the main culprits and players in this crisis.
To increase their profits, they have turned to households in great financial difficulty.
In 2006, half of the loans granted were made without a check on income.
These lenders have earned money with loans that should never have been made.
They have been supported by their banks; however, these are controlled by their board of directors, auditors and regulatory authorities.
That has not prevented the banks from lending money to credit agencies, or from selling their customers lucrative though risky financial products on the back of this mortgage lending.
These securities, backed by the sub-prime market, were bought on a massive scale by hedge funds mostly domiciled in tax havens, which are exempt from any regulation.
So it is the whole control and supervision chain that failed.
My question is simple.
What serious initiatives is the Commission now going to take to prevent the rush of the financial markets to the American property market from happening with new assets tomorrow, ending up with the same results: a stock market crisis then loss of growth?
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, financial crises are never confined to the financial sphere.
The current crisis will have the effect of further restricting credit and it has already started to push prices up in anticipation, irrespective of the decision the Central Bank takes tomorrow.
The confidence of economic operators has also fallen substantially and, despite the optimism of Commissioner Almunia, economic growth is neither generalised nor guaranteed.
There are even many regions with serious economic difficulties.
Today it is difficult, but I should like to know how to explain to citizens that the alarming increase in household indebtedness, the disincentive for public investment, the over-estimation of exports of goods produced in Europe due to interest rate management, among other factors, are inevitable sacrifices. That was the traditional remedy for controlling non-existent inflation.
Nowadays the options are more limited for dealing with the perfectly predictable results of excessive risk taking by financial operators, and which we could not or would not regulate in time.
I think there are two conclusions to be drawn.
Firstly, there is a need for improved regulation, transparency and cooperation in the financial markets, as has already been mentioned.
Secondly, there is an urgent need to review the relationship between monetary policy and its impact on the real economy, families, investment and employment.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief, particularly since I already stated the Council's basic position on this matter in my first speech.
I should like now to thank everyone here for all the speeches and suggestions you have made and to say that I have taken note of them and of your concerns, particularly those of what I would call a more social nature, that is, the possible consequences that the recent financial turbulence might have for citizens.
We shall keep that point in mind as a concern voiced by several Members.
I should like to reaffirm that we, as the Presidency and as the Council, shall continue to work on the convergence of supervisory practices and also on the schemes and mechanisms that will make it possible to constantly improve the prudential framework.
Both the Council and the Commission mentioned here that all the data available at the moment indicate that we have achieved our economic and financial objectives: deficits, economic growth and employment too are on the increase.
We are remaining totally realistic about this, however and - since realism has been mentioned here - I should like to say that the Presidency and the Council will be realistic.
We shall pay attention to all these matters, to the developments which the future might bring, and the Presidency and the Council, as it behoves them and where justified, will not fail to take the appropriate action and initiatives to provide a response to any misgivings and problems which might arise.
Commission. - (ES) Mr President, with regard to the impact on the real economy of the turbulence, or the crisis, if that is what you wish to call it, in the financial markets in recent weeks, I repeat that according to our initial estimates - we will be publishing forecasts on Tuesday - but also according to opinions that are being made public by other bodies and public and private institutions, the impact of this turbulence on economic activity, economic growth and employment in European economies in 2007 will be felt, but it will be very slight.
A large proportion of the results for 2007 are already guaranteed by the results produced in the first two quarters, by the information available on what is happening in our economies in this third quarter and by the positive inertia of economic recovery based on the good, solid foundations that we inherited from 2006.
The risks will be more evident looking towards 2008.
In our forecasts in May the growth rates for 2008 were already affected by a maturing of the economic cycle and by the impact of the decisions adopted on monetary policy by the central banks.
In Europe and beyond, this financial crisis, this financial turbulence and the subsequent tightening of credit conditions are going to increase or are increasing the risks of a decline in results for 2008, but I still think that it is too early to make a definitive analysis from which to draw some final conclusions on the subject.
We need to hope that, insofar as many of the factors that have been encouraging the turbulence of recent weeks are related to confidence, if we recover confidence and if we all contribute to a rigorous vision and diagnosis of the situation in order to improve confidence, or to consolidate confidence, the 2008 results will be better or less concerning than some imagine they will be.
I think that most of those who have spoken broadly agree on what led to this increase in volatility and to the turbulence in the financial markets, and I also think that there is agreement that solutions need to be found.
However, the solutions are not simple, and we should not overact.
Just like good actors in the theatre, good politicians should not overact at times of turbulence.
We need to do more detailed analysis and understand the facts more fully, and we need to try to seek effective solutions to challenges that exist, those that are evident, and those that we have not yet discovered.
If we look back over the debates in Parliament or the reports on financial stability by the Monetary Fund or the Central Bank, the analyses by the European Commission and our own speeches in the recent past, we did not know where or when, but we did know that turbulence of this kind could occur, given the evolution of the financial markets, and the sophistication of the instruments and techniques used by financial institutions.
I repeat what I said at the start: the European economy is still on solid foundations.
The euro is protecting us.
Once again it has proven its ability to protect and to absorb shocks that under other circumstances, before the launch of the euro, would have created much greater difficulties for us, both from a monetary and financial point of view and in our real economy, and, to finish, I think that the European Central Bank, in exercising its responsibility, acted sensibly and correctly in August.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I shall be brief.
I fully agree that we cannot be complacent about the supervisory challenges that are presented by increasingly complex financial products and off-balance sheet vehicles.
Neither can we be naive and believe that Basel I, Basel II and Solvency II will solve the problems that have occurred.
There are important lessons to be drawn, which I will be taking up with all concerned in the time ahead.
As I said in my opening remarks, I believe a light-touch, principles-based regulation is the best approach.
I am certain that more regulation now would be the worst thing we could do for financial markets.
In any event, I do not believe that there is a need for more regulation.
It might surprise Mr Rasmussen to know that I agree with something he has advocated, i.e. more transparency.
However, there are other ways of achieving this than through regulation.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PT) This debate was intended to clarify the essential issue of the moment, that is the reason for this situation of financial instability.
It is not enough to identify the problem after it has already become apparent.
It is even less helpful to propound remedies, which in practice serve only to alleviate certain consequences for the moment but which, in the short and medium term, will not change anything.
We all know that the real economy is based on production, distribution and the consumption of goods in accordance with people's needs, whether those needs be real, imagined or created by advertising.
That means that the money in circulation ought to match that real economy; and yet the greed of those who want ever higher earnings has led to the creation of stock exchanges and speculative profits in a type of casino economy, putting the production sector in second place and encouraging financialisation of the system.
That is the root of the current problem which the central banks are trying to alleviate by placing even more money in circulation or putting up interest rates.
These processes have their limitations and run the risk of creating new speculation bubbles or of further damaging the real economy, thus increasing costs for families.
Convention to Combat Desertification (debate)
The next item is the debate on
the oral question to the Council on the Objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification to be held in Madrid, from 3 to 14 September 2007, by Miroslav OuzkÃœ, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0140/2007), and
the oral question to the Commission on the Objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification to be held in Madrid, from 3 to 14 September 2007, by Miroslav OuzkÃœ, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0312/2007).
author. - (CS) Mr President, first of all I would like to apologise to the interpreters, as I have not prepared anything in writing and I therefore was not able to provide them with a written text of my contribution in advance.
I will, however, do my best to speak slowly and concisely, as the issue I am about to address is, in itself, clear.
As the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to commend the Portuguese Presidency for having set as one of the main goals of its programme the issue of desertification and water shortage.
That is also why I particularly welcome the upcoming conference, mentioned earlier.
You are well aware of the fact that this Parliament and the EU as a whole has adopted climate change as one of the principal challenges for the period ahead and it is well known that water shortage and advancing desertification are incontrovertible consequences of climate change.
I am amongst those who are convinced that we should be preparing for the impact of climate change, rather than desperately attempting to arrest it, because our efforts in that direction are likely to fail.
Today we know as a matter of certainty that Europe, particularly its southern regions, will have to cope with water shortages and soil degradation.
Climatological debates teach us that atmospheric water loss causes further desertification, which in turn is responsible for further climate warming.
Breaking out of this vicious circle will prove to be very difficult.
My question to the Commission and the Council on behalf of my committee is as follows: what are the practical steps that the Commission and the Council aim to take?
Is it clear today what can be done at Member State level and what can be done at European level?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr OuzkÃœ, first I should like to thank you for referring to the Portuguese Presidency's programme on the environment, specifically on issues relating to drought and desertification.
That is actually one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency and I should now like to point out the results obtained in that area at the informal Council of Environment Ministers held recently in Portugal.
I shall not read all of the points in the Presidency's conclusions on the matter.
I do however regard them as very interesting and important and would therefore call your attention to those conclusions, in particular as regards combating drought and the relationship between drought and the environment, and the measures which we could and should take in order to tackle this growing problem.
I should like also to mention in greater detail the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which is also an important feature of this session; that Conference, as you know, is being held now, from 3 to 14 September in Madrid.
On 23 July the Council approved the conclusions setting out the European Union's priorities - those that the EU must uphold at that Conference of the Parties, which is the eighth conference since the Convention was approved.
You will know that the Council supports the adoption, by this eighth Conference of the Parties, of the Ten-Year Strategic Plan and Framework to Enhance the Implementation of the United Nations Convention drawn up by the Intersessional Intergovernmental Working Group, and we are eager to see it implemented.
We are aware that civil society has an important role to play in this context, especially at local level, and we are in favour of that; we must therefore encourage greater participation by all civil society actors in the implementation or in the process of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.
You will also know that the Conference of the Parties is to place the emphasis on the relationship between poverty and desertification to pinpoint how the Convention might contribute to combating poverty in close cooperation with other relevant world and regional actors.
The Council considers that it is important to reach a consensus on an improved system for monitoring the Convention based on standards for the conservation, management and sustainable use of dry areas.
Such a system will make it possible to measure past and present progress.
The Committee on Science and Technology has an essential role to play in improving the Convention's knowledge base and making it possible to adopt measures and decisions on a more sound foundation.
The Council of the European Union considers that the challenges of desertification, climate change and biodiversity are complementary to one another and must be approached in a coordinated manner, with appropriate policies in order to develop synergies and make them more effective.
The Council also thinks that other vitally important factors are the availability of adequate financial resources, efficient management and the financing of initiatives to combat desertification, as well as an active and efficient Convention Secretariat.
Drought, like desertification, is also a serious cause for concern.
The Council is firmly convinced that these threats - drought and desertification - can be tackled effectively only through close international cooperation.
The European Union is therefore pursuing its objectives in this field in collaboration with third countries.
I would remind you in this context that, at its annual meeting held on 25 May this year, the ACP-EC Council of Ministers adopted a joint statement on combating drought and desertification.
That joint statement by the ACP countries and the European Union acknowledges the importance of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification for reducing poverty and for pursuing the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations.
The statement also supports adoption by the Conference of the Parties of the Ten-Year Strategic Plan and urges all the parties to work together to make the United Nations Convention more effective.
We therefore think it is very important to set a limited number of priorities as regards implementation selected on the basis of scientific data and to use indicators in order to measure the progress made.
Greater participation by civil society, on the other hand, and improved communication and broader dialogue between all actors will, in our view, also contribute - and significantly so - to the effectiveness of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.
Commission. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Community has attached great importance to the role of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in alleviating poverty ever since it was signed in 1994.
The Convention was developed as a principle tool to help achieve the objective of sustainable use of soil, in order to combat hunger and poverty.
The Commission still considers this Convention to be a key part of the fight against poverty and desertification; the Convention is still a unique forum, with the necessary competence and experience to learn lessons and design new approaches to tackling soil deterioration, and has achieved a great deal but, as we are all aware, there is still much to be done.
The current work of the Convention is focused on key issues in the implementation of actions, such as integration and coherence, within strategic frameworks for cooperation.
The countries affected, as well as the donor countries, need to ensure that the development of the Convention is closely linked to other key development initiatives and, in particular, they need to ensure that the country concerned owns the process and runs it itself.
With regard to the European Union objectives for the conference to be held in Madrid, firstly, the Commission is particularly pleased that four members of the European Parliament are part of the Community delegation to the conference.
The Convention is entering its second decade and needs to adapt itself in order to respond to new challenges and take advantage of new opportunities.
This means reviewing measures that are taken through the Convention, in order to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of our work in combating soil degradation and poverty.
With this in mind, the main EU objective for the Madrid conference is the adoption of the ten-year strategic plan to improve the application of the Convention, which was drawn up by a working group in accordance with the conclusions of the last conference of the parties, which was held in 2005.
This plan, which is strongly supported by the European Union, represents the parties' joint, renewed vision of the strategic direction to take over the next ten years.
If, as we hope, this joint vision is adopted, we will need to create an effective framework for applying it in order to maximise the effectiveness of the work of the Secretariat of the Convention and its other institutions.
Finally, this package of reforms will be accompanied by a realistic budget that is acceptable to all parties, establishing provision for expenditure that is in line with the planned activities, fulfilling very strict standards of transparency and clarity.
In July, as the President-in-Office of the Council said, the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted the overall approach that I have been talking about.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I am proud that in Parliament we have been able to draw up a resolution to be submitted to the next convention, which is already being held in Madrid, organised by the UN.
I am proud, too, that - as I have just been informed - the Spanish Parliament has given us its permission, which is absolutely exceptional, and I thank Mr MarÃ­n, President of the Spanish Congress for this; we have a voice and we are also going to present it to the plenary sitting of the Spanish Parliament.
I am, however, quite sceptical about the subject of desertification.
The European Commission's own documents show that the aid that has been given in recent years and the policy that has been undertaken has not produced the required results.
Why?
Because the desertification policy would require integrated systems and for all the points of view to be brought together and, unfortunately, the authorities operate separately: agriculture does not operate with the environment, water policy operates separately and, in actual fact, the desertification problems, for example the large area of land that is being abandoned, with no activity, in the case of the Mediterranean, are extraordinary.
The same European agricultural policy is causing land to be abandoned in the south, and across Europe, and the CAP is going to have a significant impact on desertification.
Not to mention climate change, an area, for example, in which nothing is being done about the problem of water shortage and the melting of the glaciers, which is already occurring and is going to have an absolute effect on the situation of the soil.
I would therefore like to bring to the attention of the countries that rather than making observations, they should make specific policies and implement programmes, because it really is a question of integrated projects in which states have to tackle integrated policies and active policies.
I think that everything is known about desertification, but very little action is being taken.
This is the message that we are going to take, Europe helping with this common policy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, desertification threatens a quarter of the earth's land surface, as well as 250 million people and the livelihoods of more than a billion inhabitants in 100 countries because of decreased agricultural and livestock productivity.
Poverty, political instability, deforestation, excessive grazing and bad practices are factors that reduce the productivity of land.
I therefore hope that in Madrid, after more than 13 years since the UN Convention to Combat Desertification came into being, the international community will debate a reform of the Convention itself, in order to include measures that make the fight against this phenomenon more effective, especially the draft ten-year strategic plan that is being debated.
Soil erosion, uncontrolled urban development, loss of fertile land, fires, deforestation and the over-exploitation of water resources are some of the causes that explain the impoverishment of a great deal of arid, semi-arid or dry soil, and these causes are carrying us inexorably towards growing desertification of the planet, which we need to try to stop by every possible means.
We also need to remember, as the Members who have already spoken have said, that desertification contributes to climate change, as it causes the degradation of the soil and the loss of vegetation, which is associated with an increase in emissions, therefore it would be very helpful to support reforestation policies in order to re-establish and change conditions in arid areas.

With regard to the European Union itself, I think that it is essential that a European drought observatory be established urgently, something that we have considered several times in this House, as a centre for knowledge, mitigation and monitoring of its terrible effects, especially in southern Europe.
Unfortunately, in south-east Spain we are well aware of this problem, therefore I propose that the observatory should be located at the European Environment Agency's Topic Centre for Land Use in Barcelona, as proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Cristina Narbona, or at the Mediterranean Centre for Environmental Studies or the Centre for Desertification Research, both in Valencia, which have focused their multidisciplinary work on areas associated with desertification, and which have broad international experience.

I think that there is an urgent need for greater involvement from the Community institutions on the subject of desertification, so that the European Union can lead the way in this area in the same way as it is doing in the fight against climate change.
I would like to close by saying that combating this problem is a major challenge, not only from the environmental viewpoint but also from the viewpoint of people and human rights: many people are fleeing their lands because of hunger and poverty, largely caused by desertification.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to Mr OuzkÃœ and the others for an excellent motion for a resolution.
According to the United Nations, desertification now affects 100 to 200 million people directly.
It is a potential threat for more than a billion, and possibly even as many as two billion, people.
It is not just a matter of the Sahara spreading and such similar phenomena.
Desertification, the disappearance of fertile layers of soil and vegetation, is taking place all around the world, from the coasts of Spain to the plains of China.
Almost a third of the land area of the globe is at risk of desertification.
As much as 40% of arable land is now in very poor condition.
The situation is worst in Central Asia, where three-quarters of the soil is infertile.
