However, we ultimately succeeded in making it clear that men can still not become pregnant and accordingly cannot give birth!
At the last moment, the rapporteur - who tabled an amendment contrary to the agreement we had reached - wanted to reinsert a provision to the effect that discrimination against men and women in the context of reconciling family and career duties counts as discrimination for the purposes of the directive.
This would have no benefit at all, apart from encouraging litigation, and especially litigation advocated by people who exploit woolly provisions of this kind.
Many of us still have problems with legal actions taken by associations and the requirement for employers to produce complicated annual reports and statistics.
Then I would like to mention equal pay.
There is a directive dating from 1975 on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value.
That directive is certainly in need of improvement, but in its own context and not this one.
We are calling on the Member States to take measures to ensure that employers promote equal pay for equal work in a planned and systematic way.
That is mistaken for a number of reasons.
First of all, there is the autonomy of the two sides of industry - the employers and the unions.
In this context, any demand that employers should promote equal pay for equal work would fall short of the provisions of the 1975 equal pay directive.
There is a French proverb that says 'Superflue, chose trÃšs nÃ©cessaire' .
However, that does not apply to legislative texts.
I hope that in the interests of equal treatment of men and women we will concentrate on the essentials and eliminate anything superfluous when we vote tomorrow.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for her willingness to take into account the considerations and the work of all the political groups.
The report she is tabling today and upon which we are to vote tomorrow shows that Parliament has focused on the most important points, which will improve the common position, in order to achieve the adoption of the amendments to the directive with all speed.
Although the common position recognised Parliament' s position at first reading on a precise definition of direct and indirect discrimination - which we welcome - we feel that it is necessary - and this is an important amendment - to provide precise definitions of harassment, sexual harassment and the procedures for combating it, including preventive measures.
We also feel that it is important to keep our amendment reducing the derogations provided for by the Commission and the Council in respect of the implementation of the directive, and that it is necessary to reinforce protection of maternity and paternity rights, including in cases of adoption, providing effective safeguards against discrimination against parents using the rights they are entitled to.
There is one point which I am sure will be discussed in conciliation, for the Commission too expressed reservations regarding this point in its amended position, and it is the provision for positive measures laying down specific advantages.
We felt that it was important to include them because that consolidates the provisions of the Treaty.
Another important point which we feel should still be included is the laying down of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, leaving it to the Member States to identify procedures, an issue which we have also addressed in other debates in this very Chamber and which we endorsed with the vote on the report on information and consultation.
Moreover, it is necessary to make clear, as we have done, the concept of protection for victims, the extension of this protection to trade union representatives and the need for the bodies created to apply the principle of equality to be provided with adequate resources so that they can lend appropriate legal and other assistance to the victims of gender discrimination.
We must also clarify the provision made for collective action to be brought in the event of breaches of the directive and the requirement for employees to draw up equal opportunities plans.
The Socialist Group will vote for all the amendments adopted in committee.
Regrettably, however, I have to tell the rapporteur that we do not support the two amendments she tabled together with the Liberals and the GUE, not so much as regards the content as because we feel they do not achieve anything substantial in legislative terms and, on the contrary, inappropriately go against the compromise reached, which I hope will be confirmed tomorrow with a very wide majority in this House to give us more power in conciliation.
Mr President, the rapporteur has made every effort to reach consensus.
She therefore deserves all credit for the emphatic result that is now before us.
Many necessary improvements have been made to the measures against sexual intimidation and in connection with adoption leave and a woman' s right to return to her old job after maternity leave.
If the Commission and the Council are serious about the equal treatment of men and women, they would do well to adopt all these amendments.
I was astonished to find out from my Christian-Democratic counterparts that pregnancy is a purely female issue.
On the contrary: it is of the utmost importance for men to be given the opportunity to be more involved in the new life that they have helped create.
The joint amendment that is before us does not create new rights.
We simply do not want men who wish to make use of their existing national rights, for example, to three -days' leave, to be prevented from doing so.
In the view of the liberal group, unlike that of the two major groups, it consequently seems hardly too much to ask for men and women to be able to make use of existing rights to combine work and care tasks without experiencing discrimination.
We do live, after all, in the twenty-first century.
Needless to say, the green-liberal-GUE amendment on mainstreaming is also an important addition.
I therefore hope that the others will also support us in this and that we indeed face a more equal future backed by a broad majority.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the original Commission proposal, with the exception of a few positive measures, has to be described as extremely weak, to put it mildly.
It contains a number of major failings.
There were hardly any innovative ideas in it, except for how to tackle sexual violence, something which, for a directive which is already 25 years old, is telling.
However, it is, of course, positive that sexual intimidation is recognised as a form of discrimination, particularly against women, but recognition is as far as it goes.
There is no regulation providing for a possible preventative policy, and the protection of witnesses is not regulated properly either.
In addition, there is no coherent regulation of sanctions in the event of this form of discrimination taking place.
It can be likened to driving through a set of red traffic lights.
You are allowed to drive, no one is stopping you from doing so, and no measures are taken.
Moreover, the penalty is extremely lenient.
In order to protect women better after pregnancy, in those countries where this is regulated, fathers should be given the same protection as mothers, so that work and family life can be combined.
Hence, also the green amendment to establish one regulation for both mothers and fathers so that fathers can look after their children more but are also protected in the same way.
There is a clear majority in this House in favour of regulating a number of more specific matters.
Most of these matters, however, belong in other and separate directives, such as the pregnancy directive and equal pay for equal work.
In recent years, the Commission has proved unable to draft a number of amendments to directives which are more tailored to the current needs of women.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance therefore urges the Commission once again to table amendments of this kind to existing directives, possibly in the form of a codification of the male and female equality acquis.
We are meanwhile awaiting the Commission proposal on male and female equality outside the employment process with bated breath.
Finally, I should like to express the hope that the Belgian Presidency, given its own progressive legislation in this respect, succeeds in convincing the Member States of the importance of approving the directive by 2 January and that it can approve this directive under the Presidency of Mrs Onkelinkx.
Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Hautala for her unstinting effort, prior to the summer and also today, in wanting to give the Commission' s proposal some structure, whilst reiterating the need for specific directives, such as equal pay, protection during pregnancy and motherhood, and now the recognition of types of harassment, and that of the reconciliation of family and working life.
Thank you, Mrs Hautala, for having done so much work, which was not easy.
I would now like to explain why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and I support the amendment by Mrs Hautala.
The Commission is certainly willing to recognise the right of fathers to look after their children.
We have the recommendation on the protection of workers who look after their children.
Why stop, though, when things are going so well?
We now need, and this is the purpose of our amendment, to acknowledge that inequality, or discrimination in other words, can exist, with regard to fathers, when they want to look after their children.
Why did the Committee on Women' s Rights not go this far?
Personally, I do not understand this and I would hope that we are a little more reasonable in the future.
What will happen if we are?
Not only more quibbling, as Mrs Lulling believes, but, quite simply, better recognition of what is needed - not only by women, but by men as well - in order to be able to have both a family and a career.
If we do not do both, we are not living in the twenty-first century, as Mrs van der Laan said.
That is why I believe that this amendment simply provides the possibility of extending the right of fathers, something that we also hope for and want to acknowledge.
That is why I think it is important to support this amendment.
In addition, I would now like to highlight several points that are new in these proposals for amendments.
On the one hand, the introduction of adoption is very important, this is something new, which we must weigh up.
Next, I must say that my group supports the need to set out some positive measures.
We must not be satisfied with dealing with this at arm's length, we must clearly define these measures and this is what has been done, as a solid legal instrument will be the result.
I feel that we must also support the possibility of associations and organisations commencing proceedings.
In doing this, we recognise that there will not just be individuals faced with a law or faced with proceedings, but also bodies which can support these individuals.
This may be the reason that, whilst it is worthwhile, and whilst we can welcome the protection of workers' representatives who support complainants against discrimination, on the other hand, we have done away with the protection of possible witnesses, or of individuals who witness the harassment or discrimination that some individuals experience, and I think this is a real pity.
I personally deplore this, even though we did not table an amendment on this for tomorrow.
Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, these are the points that I wanted to make, on behalf of my group.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her work.
Parliament has stressed on many occasions that equal opportunities for men and women must be more than just a principle.
Equal opportunities is a concept, a definition which must be translated into a genuine effort by the institutions to ensure, first and foremost, genuine equal treatment of men and women as regards access to work and professional training.
What is more, working women must also be able to choose whether to take the opportunity to have a family and bring up children without this jeopardising their professional careers through no fault of their own.
Indeed, society must be re-educated to see motherhood not just as a woman' s right but also as an opportunity for society as a whole, considering, not least, that one of the causes of the falling birth rate is precisely the fact that many women are discouraged from having children by the rigid mechanisms of the employment world.
For precisely this reason, we need not just to ensure that a woman has the right to resume her job when maternity leave comes to an end but, in order to genuinely protect working mothers, we need to be able to provide them with more flexible legislation on parental leave, allowing fathers to benefit from paternity leave too so that they can attend to the child during its first few months of life.
In conclusion, Mr President, the European Union should increasingly promote all such instruments - social, legal and economic - which can provide strong, practical - as opposed to theoretical - support for women, especially working women, and thus provide strong support for families.
Mrs Lulling, I would like to thank you for livening up this evening' s sitting. These sittings can sometimes be rather monotonous, but I would like to remind you of our Rules of Procedure.
You must, in principle, wait until the end of the debates if you wish to make a personal statement, and you have limited speaking time.
You spoke for more than two minutes.
I think, however, that your fellow Members now have a much clearer understanding of your position.
We shall now take the speakers who wish to make a personal statement, beginning with Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with the second reading of a directive which is important for the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women, in terms of access to employment, training, professional promotion and working conditions.
This directive has led to many hours of work, meetings and agreements between the different groups in order to achieve a text that is acceptable to the majority of the House, as well as the Council and the Commission.
It has not been easy, but foremost has been the desire for a legal text which is a good instrument for providing women with equal access to the labour market under equal conditions and for allowing them to reconcile family and professional lives, which still causes women enormous problems, especially young women.
Article 1(2), which guarantees that women retain their job after maternity leave, is of the greatest importance. Not because it is an innovation, since it is included in most national legislations, but because, despite this, retaining jobs and continuing professional promotion after maternity are still creating enormous problems for women.
These problems principally affect women, but the directive lays down that, when a father has paternity leave, he can have the same guarantees as women, although this leave is after the specific leave for childbirth, which is exclusive to women.
Also included are positive measures which promote the presence of the least-represented sex in a specific working sector, in order to allow greater equality between men and women.
It is also important to stress that the directive deals with a work problem which unfortunately affects women more than men: sexual harassment, which will not only be prosecuted and punished, but prevention measures will also be adopted in companies.
Although we are aware that small companies may have problems complying with this directive, we believe that it is an important achievement for equality between men and women.
I hope that in the end it will help women and not create additional problems for them.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Hautala very sincerely for the enormous amount of work that we have achieved together here.
This proposal became necessary because appeals had been made to the European Court of Justice in over 40 cases.
The most prominent cases, which we in the European Parliament have also been very much involved in, a point I would like to reiterate, were the Kalanke and Marshall cases.
These cases have important ramifications not only in Germany, but have also led to a degree of legal uncertainty throughout the Union.
The anti-discrimination provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and Articles 141 and 3 give us a clear legal basis for amending this directive now so as to improve the position of women.
Many of the extensive amendments at first reading are reflected in the common position.
That is our first achievement.
Direct and indirect discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, positive action - these are now all covered by the common position.
Nevertheless, we are now going a step further.
We want to protect not only mothers but also fathers, something that, as is reflected here, originally met with some resistance in this House.
But that is what we expect.
I think that we now need to find some clearer wording.
In the course of various extended working sessions, we have managed to achieve a broad consensus in this Parliament on 15 compromise proposals.
I accordingly wish to recommend that my group should stick to this compromise.
Our objective remains that of rapidly improving the position of both men and women who are committed to their family, and working towards reconciling professional and family commitments.
We want to create a clear legal framework.
That is why if it proves necessary we want to initiate the conciliation procedure as quickly as possible.
We hope that the compromise before us here will hold up and that the Commission and the Council will accordingly also display a willingness to agree, for the benefit of women.
The report by Mrs Hautala tackles the subject of equality between men and women as regards access to employment.
As far as access to the floor is concerned, this equality has not been respected this evening.
Rest assured, this is something that I regret, as we had 16 female speakers to just one male speaker.
We shall therefore listen even more closely to what he says over the next two minutes.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Hautala for a good piece of work.
If it had only depended upon herself, the result could certainly have been still better, but we have to be able to live with compromises, and these are important steps that are now being taken to move closer to equality in Europe.
The right to equal conditions at the workplace is a fundamental right and should go without saying.
That is unfortunately not the case.
The issue is one of human dignity and of avoiding harassment, something with which everyone ought to agree.
In spite of this, we know that many women in Europe are at present exposed to sexual harassment on a daily basis.
A genuine change in attitude is needed, but also clear and vigorous legislation if we are to create equal opportunities in working life.
The present values also lead to large discrepancies in salaries between men and women.
I nonetheless think it is important to say that equal opportunities for men and women are not in actual fact only a women' s issue.
It is an issue that affects us all, irrespective of our gender.
Rights are needed which make it possible for both mothers and fathers to combine professional and family life.
Maternity and paternity leave must obviously be brought into line with each other.
My own experience teaches that equality must begin in the home. I sometimes think that the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities does not do enough to include us men in its view of equality.
I think that that is a pity and is in danger of delaying more resolute work for equality within the European Union.
I should like to conclude by saying that I feel dissatisfied with Amendment 7.
I do not think that the wording goes far enough.
Every mother and father must be entitled to return to her or his own work after parental leave.
I emphasise his or her own work.
The wording, work of equal value is not enough, for there is then a risk of employers less conscious of their responsibilities exploiting this opportunity to create worse conditions for parental leave.
Unfortunately, there are many such examples in my own country, too.
I should therefore have liked to have seen clearer wording.
Allow me an additional ten seconds - given that Mrs Lulling was given an extra two minutes - and allow me to say to the latter that my marriage would never have survived if my wife and I had not shared the parental leave equally.
In view of the fact that Mrs Lulling spoke so clearly, all of us in this House understand that Amendment 17 will of course be supported by Mrs Lulling, and for that I am very grateful.
Thank you.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Hautala but say at the same time that the best is often the enemy of the good.
The two amendments that were tabled subsequently by Mrs Hautala have caused a great deal of difficulty, for a large majority of people who are already unhappy about this directive have found in these amendments a reason to vote against a whole host of things.
And in the knowledge that 314 votes must be attained, you should have acted more wisely.
Approval of the present compromise is far more important than submission of your two additional amendments.
I should like to make this clear to you: it was a poor strategy.
For my second point, I should like to address the Commission.
Back in 1993, I drafted a Royal Decree in which I made it compulsory for businesses to draw up an annual report about equal opportunities for men and women in their businesses.
That Royal Decree goes beyond what is stated in the present text, since the latter merely encourages them, whereas my piece of legislation was binding.
Commissioner, I have to say, if you want this to yield results, there will need to be consultation with the social partners - much more so than is now the case - and there will need to be agreement with them to apply the provisions of the laws and the directives.
For our big problem is not the legislator.
He will faithfully transpose what is in the European directives, sometimes too late, but it is done, anyway.
Our big problem is the application in the field, and that is in the hands of the social partners.
Equal pay and the equal treatment, and whatever else, of women is never a priority for trade unions and employers.
In my opinion, the Commission and the Member States would do well to emphasise this.
Mr President, imagine if men in Europe earned 25 per cent less than women.
Imagine if one in two men were subject to sexual harassment.
Imagine if European men were over-represented in precarious, low-skilled part-time jobs and were given their notice when they told their employers that they intended to have children.
Imagine if the proportion of men in Europe' s national parliaments were only 20 per cent.
The mind boggles.
However, it is women, and not men, who are discriminated against in this way.
'A new way of thinking is required in order to solve the problems created by the old way of thinking,' as Albert Einstein once said.
I want to congratulate Mrs Hautala who has worked to find a new way of solving the problems entailed in the EU' s out-of-date Directive on Equal Treatment.
The proposal on which we are to vote tomorrow lays the foundation for clear and effective legislation in the Member States to protect women and men from gender discrimination at work.
Countries must take active measures to promote equality in practice.
What is perhaps most important is Mrs Hautala' s demand that public and private employers in Europe must, in a planned and systematic way, prevent gender discrimination, harassment and unequal treatment.
It is no longer enough to react after the employee has complained.
Employers are encouraged to draw up annual equality plans with statistics concerning differences in salaries and the proportion of women and men at different levels and with proposed measures to combat this state of affairs.
Employers should be responsible for ensuring that their employees are not harassed and that they have equal wages for equal work and the opportunity to pursue careers and, especially, to combine work and family life.
I assume that the Council is prepared to approve our proposals.
Only then shall we have an instrument for removing the extensive discrimination against women in working life.
Mr President, the amendment to the 1976 directive is a very important move and illustrates the Commission's sensitivity on the question of equal treatment for men and women.
For its part, the Committee on Women's Rights, thanks to the sterling efforts of our rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and other honourable Members, has helped to produce an improved text today which attracts a broader consensus.
That is why we expect it to be warmly supported by both the Commission and the Council.
The new directive certainly responds to the change in the situation which has taken place over the last twenty-five years as regards women's employment and vocational training and replaces an outdated legislative framework which has done what it can to combat discrimination against women, serious infringements of the principle of equality, higher unemployment rates, the exclusion of women from numerous professions and the general division of the job market along gender lines.
I should like to inform the House that the Greek Parliament recently voted almost unanimously to replace a similar article in the Constitution allowing derogations from the principle of sexual equality on the labour market.
The Hautala report suggests a new, better, framework and introduces new types of measures, such as measures to prevent and combat sexual harassment in the workplace, efficient protection for workers from unequal treatment related to pregnancy and maternity, judicial protection, positive measures to apply equality in practice, as other Members have pointed out, and sanctions to punish infringements of the directive.
However, I feel that the directive could be clearer in defining purely objective selection criteria for all jobs and should not leave loopholes for gender-based exceptions and exclusions.
Mr President, this directive is tremendously important to the future of Europe because it regulates matters which concern the whole of society - men and women alike - and is a way of achieving fundamental strategic objectives of the European Union, as laid down in the EC Treaty, Articles 2 and 3, and the European Social Agenda.
It absolutely must update this directive if it is to be an efficient means of achieving these objectives.
The reform of the directive has been a dogged and, at times, difficult procedure, as happens when we try to adopt a correct, binding and efficient text.
Both the rapporteur and all the political groups showed willing, although it was difficult to strike a balance between the ambitious objectives set by the European Union for women's employment and the quality of jobs, the already high acquis communautaire on equal treatment for men and women and the exceptional, high-level performance by certain Member States which have gone beyond the proposals for the directive (Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Smet referred to experiences in Greece and Belgium) and the real need to maintain flexibility and the status of female employment during a downswing in the economy and on the labour market, help speed up cooperation with the Council and the European Commission and avoid overburdening the text with important women's issues such as equal pay, which are dealt with elsewhere, and achieve the consensus and majority needed.
In my personal experience, this procedure has given all of us, European institutions, national governments, social partners and social agencies, a more responsible attitude to women's problems and to the importance of female employment to our development objectives.
I think that this mature attitude will also find expression in tomorrow's vote.
The views of my political group have been stated and I share them.
Personally, I support Amendment No 17 on the recognition of paternity as a factor in the strategy to promote new working conditions, as a factor in the balanced participation of men and women in family and professional life and as acknowledgement of the social values of family life and support for women in their multiple and simultaneous roles.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion is a stated objective that we all share.
The only disagreement is about how we should achieve this, and there is ultimately the question of how effective individual measures are, or whether such measures just mean more rules and regulations, and extra expenditure and bureaucracy, which we certainly do not need.
The Council has not taken all Parliament's demands on board in its common position.
Nevertheless, it is true to say that the text of the original proposal has been considerably improved upon.
This means that we have taken an important step on the road to updating the Community legislative framework.
However, a number of issues and problem areas remain to be resolved.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has closely examined all these unresolved questions, and a decision has been reached between the groups not to re-examine all the outstanding demands, but rather the most important.
The rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has made enormous efforts in order to work out viable compromises.
We have the result before us.
It emerged from the first reading debate that paternity rights cannot be the same as maternity rights.
The compromise accordingly does not affect Member States' freedom to recognise the right to paternity leave within their borders.
Both mothers and fathers should have the option of devoting themselves to family duties.
This - in contrast to the opinion that we have heard expressed here - is undeniably the stated objective of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.
Furthermore, the formula whereby a woman on maternity leave should be entitled, after the end of her period of maternity leave, to return to her job or to an equivalent post must be taken on board.
However, we have problems with the definition of sexual harassment.
We seem to have ended up with a rather woolly form of words here that is not helpful for any judge or other person that has to make a decision on this.
Lastly, I would like to make one further brief comment opposing the annual reporting arrangements for employers on progress with equal treatment.
Bureaucracy alone will not promote equal treatment.
We also need to think about small and medium-sized enterprises so that they too accept women looking for jobs.
Mr President, Commissioner, this evening, we are discussing the equal treatment of men and women with regard to access to employment, occupational training and chances of promotion, and with regard to working conditions.
In actual fact, it is astonishing that we should still be discussing this topic, because we have been discussing it for so long, and virtually everyone is convinced, both men and women, that such equal treatment is fair and does not and should not have to be justified.
However, we are not yet that far advanced, unfortunately.
To this day, women are being treated as inferior and discriminated against, also in working situations.
The combination of work and care still poses problems in many cases.
That is why I am pleased with this report.
I am also pleased that we were able to find a compromise text concerning a number of important points.
I therefore hope that the voting tomorrow will be positive so that it can truly represent a step forward in the process of equal treatment.
The report encourages States and organisations involved to take measures in favour of equal treatment and to combat sexual intimidation.
Better legal protection is given and, for example, opportunities are given to return to work following pregnancy or in connection with adoption.
In addition, we will gain a better insight into the actual situation concerning participation of men and women and we shall have access to better, updated statistics.
That is why I should like to extend warm thanks to the Commission for the initiative.
I should also like to thank the rapporteur warmly for all her efforts to persuade us to sing from the same song sheet, but a special thanks goes to all those who have worked hard on this broadly-based text.
I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and I would like to thank all the Members of the committee for their efforts and excellent contributions in this difficult and complex area.
I am aware of your concerns to improve the text of the common position on which there was unanimous agreement in the Council on 11 June 2001.
As you know from the first reading, the Commission accepted in spirit the majority of your amendments - 49 amendments of a total of 70 - and consequently drew up an amended proposal which reflected this position.
In general it should be stressed that the common position considerably enhances the text of the initial proposal and responds to the desire to update the text of Directive 76/207.
We must now focus on the most essential issues of the directive and make a concerted effort to find possible solutions to improve even further the common position.
As you know, the Council only reached an agreement after long discussions on issues such as the precise wording of the definitions and the article on maternity and paternity leave, on which it was very difficult to reach agreement in the Council.
The compromise therefore is extremely delicate.
On the other hand I feel that the Council could make further compromises in areas such as equality plans, the role of bodies for the promotion of equality and the introduction of preventive measures to combat sexual harassment.
In this context the Commission can accept the following amendments.
On Amendments Nos 1 and 5, on preventive measures against sexual harassment the Commission can accept in part the idea of introducing measures for preventing sexual harassment by reformulating the text.
Instead of obliging employers to introduce preventive measures, it would be preferable to encourage employers to do so.
On Amendment No 8, on positive measures, the Commission can accept this amendment in part if a definition is contained in the recitals instead of the article of the directive.
On Amendment No 9, on provisions in contracts and agreements, the Commission accepts that annulment should be obligatory but rejects the removal of the possibility for amendment of the contract.
Here there is the need for flexibility.
On Amendment No 13, on the role of the independent budgets, the Commission can accept this amendment in part by reformulating the proposed text.
The text of the common position could be improved by strengthening the role of bodies for the promotion of equal treatment and by adding to their tasks the monitoring and follow-up of Community legislation in the field of equal treatment.
The Commission can also accept a reformulation of Article 6(3), by expressly mentioning that designated bodies acting on behalf of victims have an interest in ensuring that the provisions of the directive are complied with.
On Amendment No 14, on equality plans and the company level, the Commission can accept this idea in part, but with a new formulation for Article 8(b).
On Amendment No 15, on reporting on positive action measures, the Commission will propose an alternative text so as to report on positive measures only every three years.
On Amendment No 16 on gender mainstreaming, the Commission accepts this amendment partially and in spirit, but only to the extent that it respects the wording of the Treaty.
Now I should like to turn to those amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission.
Amendment No 4, rewording the common position's definition of sexual harassment, in order to take into account Parliament's definition of sexual harassment.
Amendments Nos 7 and 17 reformulating the text of the common position on maternity and paternity leave by reintroducing inter alia the idea of maternity and paternity leave where children are adopted.
The common position was hotly debated in the Council on this issue and a delicate compromise was reached.
It is unlikely therefore that any further change would be accepted.
Here I would just like to remind you that there is, of course, the paternity leave directive - the first to be adopted following an agreement between the social partners.
The Commission did not accept Amendment No 11 on group action in cases of discrimination - especially without the consent of the victim of discrimination.
On Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12, the Commission considers that the content of these amendments is already covered by the common position.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in part or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
It rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
6th, 7th and 8th EDF discharge for 1999
The next item is the second report (A5-0337/2001) by Mrs RÃŒhle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year.
I shall now give the floor to Mrs RÃŒhle, who has five minutes' speaking time.
Mr President, I am today proposing that the Commission should be given discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year.
Unfortunately, we had to postpone the discharge in the spring, because I as rapporteur had received insufficient information from the Commission.
This information is now available and I would like to specifically thank the Commission for its cooperation.
I can recommend discharge today without any reservations.
Nevertheless, I hope and indeed expect that the fruitful cooperation which we have had with the Commission since the spring will continue when it comes to future reporting relating to the Development Fund, because such cooperation is needed to jointly solve problems in this area.
However, my report is still a very critical one.
It refers to 1999, and 1999 was the first budget year for which the new Commission was fully responsible.
However, full responsibility does not mean that the Commission can be blamed for the mistakes of the past.
We all know that reforms take time and we can see that the necessary measures have been initiated.
Despite that, I would like to briefly reiterate my criticism.
It is implementation that is at stake here. For example, there was a gap between commitments at EUR 2.69 billion and payments actually made in 1999 at EUR 1.27 billion.
Unfortunately, the same also applies to the implementation of the debt relief initiative for the poorest countries in the world.
I am, of course, aware that this reflects the general crisis in development aid, and that this situation is not unique to the Development Fund or to the Commission's work, and that all the Member States, together with the Commission and the Parliament, need to consider new approaches to development policy.
The problem is a failure of political will to provide aid on a generous scale, combined with a lack of instruments to effectively implement the available funds.
That is the problem in a nutshell.
In view of the lateness of the hour, I do not want to go into great detail, but I would like to emphasise that the Commission's approach to solving this problem is a step in the right direction. It involves strengthening local delegations, providing them with better equipment and preparation, in short, making local delegations more competent.
However, I would also like to make an appeal to Parliament in this context.
In the Committee on Budgets, we had protracted debates on the need for higher staffing levels, particularly for delegations, and the Committee on Budgets put pressure on the Committee on Budgetary Control to make these posts available and not to play spurious political games with a view to making the Commission deliver reforms before we approve staff changes.
This is absurd of course, because these posts in local delegations are needed above all else so that reforms can be made in the first place.
The further efforts at reform described in the Commission's internal audit report are also important and need to be discussed in detail between the Commission and the Parliament.
I would like though to briefly mention a couple of expectations following on from the report of the Court of Auditors. I hope that in future these will be the hallmark of the discharge process and of cooperation between the Parliament and Commission.
One important point is that we need an ongoing assessment of progress in implementing measures to reform public administration in the ACP States.
We need to monitor progress achieved in the key sectors of health and education, using meaningful indicators such as the increase in the number of teachers or doctors, thus providing more qualitative checks instead of quantitative checks.
This would also mean the discharge process in the Parliament itself having to change.
In order words, we would have to shift our examination towards quality control and refrain from making a great hue and cry about points of detail.
We would also have to carry out an annual audit of accounting and sound management of resources on the basis of samples and, lastly, apply clearly defined sanctions - such as the reduction or suspension of payments - in cases where the agreed reform measures are not complied with.
If we implement these measures together, then I believe that we will be jointly taking an important step towards enhancing the structure of development aid, and that we will be better placed to convince the EU's taxpayers and to secure approval for the necessary expenditure.
I say this because the situation prevailing since 11 September has demonstrated how important development aid is.
It will be a pivotal factor.
Furthermore, the EU has now become the world's largest provider of development aid.
That is why we urgently need this joint reform.
draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. (ES) Mr President, the difficult circumstances which have accompanied the management of the 1999 budget, of which we are all well aware, have especially affected funds for external relations and, even more, aid to third countries, including the European Development Fund.
For the Socialist Group, the good management of the European Development Fund is not only essential for reasons of correct and transparent accounting, but because this fund and all Community aid resources are essential if we are to contribute to reducing poverty, which is one of our priorities.
We are therefore closely monitoring the Commission' s action in this area.
The eventful journey of this report through the competent committees, leading to its approval, is a testimony to this interest.
Last year we made our 1998 discharge conditional upon the orientation of Community spending towards reducing poverty and we improved the structure of the budget in this respect, in order to reduce the risks of dispersal of aid funds.
This year we have delayed, on one occasion, the discharge, while awaiting a series of reports from the Court of Auditors.
We are now in a position to approve it, now that the Commission has adopted a series of measures to improve the effectiveness of aid, in particular the creation of Europe Aid, but at the same time certain data leads to some reservations: in 1999 the level of payments from the EDF was disappointing when compared to the level of commitment appropriations and payments achieved in previous years, as Mrs RÃŒhle has said.
Initiatives such as the reduction of the debt of the least-developed countries are not being complied with in accordance with the commitments the Commission has made.
Contracts funded by the EDF essentially benefit companies in the Member States, to the detriment of local companies and organisations.
The Commission is not yet sufficiently directing its aid towards reducing poverty.
We want simplification of procedures, integration of the cycle of cooperation, transparency in management, assessment in such important sectors as health and education.
We will monitor compliance with the recommendations of the resolution we are debating today.
The Commission knows that it has the support of the Socialist Group in its efforts to improve the management of the EDF and the Socialist Group trusts that we will see these improvements during the coming financial years, so that we are able to discharge the budget with fewer problems and conditions than has been the case so far.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs RÃŒhle's report on the discharge for the European Development Funds presents an honest picture of the contradictions in our development policy.
On the one hand, there are complaints that we are not willing enough to make generous development aid available, and, on the other hand, it is undeniable that the money actually made available is often only disbursed very slowly.
There must be something wrong with a system under which at the end of 1999 resources of almost EUR 10 billion had been promised and made available without any specific deadlines, but had not been taken up.
The Commission will, of course, say that since then there have been signs of improvement here and there.
Nevertheless, it is a fact that we need to fundamentally review our approach.
The aid we offer through the Development Funds is reaching its limits, because it is geared towards supporting states that in some cases only exist on paper.
There is often a lack of an even semi-functioning public administration, there is a lack of democratic control of those in power, and many countries are in a state of open civil war or on the verge of it.
In a civil war situation, we first need to concentrate aid on conflict resolution and on humanitarian aid.
In other cases, we should concentrate our efforts to a greater extent than before on establishing properly functioning public administrations, which are a prerequisite for meaningfully applying aid from the EU or other donors in the international community.
Such administrations are also a prerequisite for ensuring that countries use their own tax revenue responsibly and in the interests of their citizens.
Our aid must therefore always be linked to reform programmes for public administration.
If these reforms make progress, aid is given, but if they do not progress or if there are setbacks we should not be afraid to turn off the tap.
I know that is a difficult thing to do, but it is precisely in such circumstances that the Commission needs to stand firm and adhere to its principles.
Finally, I would like to say one more thing about this discharge procedure. The discharge had to be postponed because the Commission did not initially provide the necessary information.
Furthermore, there was again the problem that certain confidential information was only forwarded to the committee chair and to the rapporteur.
As I have often said before, and I shall say it again now, this leads to two classes of Member of the European Parliament - those with and those without access to information.
The committee made it patently clear in its report that this situation should not be allowed to recur, and that the provisions of our Rules of Procedure in respect of the discharge procedure should be fully implemented in future.
In other words, all Members of this House should have access to all confidential information.
Mr President, the Commission is now to be granted discharge for 1999, but Parliament has, in actual fact, achieved a lot by postponing the discharge first time around.
The Commission has been pressed to take initiatives it would not otherwise have wished to take.
I think the rapporteur has delivered a splendid piece of work, but I also think the Commission deserves to be warmly congratulated when it makes progress - as, I believe, it has in fact done.
I would therefore recommend, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we grant discharge for the development fund. At the same time, I want to assure the Commission that all the outstanding problems will be followed up in the discharge for the year 2000.
The Commission has carried out a major investigation of the counterpart funds and of the roles and responsibilities of the delegations.
An investigation has been carried out into whether the delegations have complied with their responsibilities, and it would appear that they have done so, for disciplinary enquiries are not to be carried out.
I can, of course, ask Mr Nielson if the Commission will confirm that disciplinary enquiries will not be carried out on the basis of its investigations.
I can also - perhaps rather teasingly - ask if the Commission will confirm this report, which will not be sent to Parliament.
The internal audit service has done good work from the start with its investigations of the counterpart funds.
It is a good report which is critical about the way in which the system operates.
The counterpart funds amount to direct budgetary support, and neither the Commission nor the delegations in the beneficiary countries have any direct control over the money.
The report emphasises that direct budgetary support is risky, irrespective of what is done.
Mr Nielson has said that that form of subsidy should nonetheless be maintained.
How, though, does he think that control over the funds can be improved?
The Commission must also be praised for sending this report to Parliament immediately.
It shows it has learned something from this whole course of events.
Discharge was postponed primarily because there were problems with the supply of information. Reports were sent to the wrong people, were seriously delayed or never arrived.
I think, however, that it is a good result we have achieved, and I therefore recommend discharge for the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to pay Mrs RÃŒhle a compliment.
It is clear that her instincts were good when she postponed the discharge for the European Development Funds back in spring.
We in the Committee for Budgetary Control had at that point not received any substantial information at all on follow-up measures in connection with cases of fraud discovered in 1999.
However, we now very definitely know what we could only assume at that point, and that is that both the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, have had to lower their sights.
For example, fraud in the health sector in the Ivory Coast was discovered in 1998/1999.
Medical equipment including disposable syringes and baby scales had for years been claimed at many times their actual value.
The loss was estimated at around EUR 27.4 million.
When this case came to light, the, at that time, newly appointed Commission said that this money would of course have to be repaid.
We now know that this money has not been returned to the European Development Fund.
According to the Commission the reason for this is that it was legally impossible to demand the money back!
I do not want to go into any further detail here, but this demonstrates how difficult it is to take corrective action once money has been transferred.
Furthermore, in the ACP States, OLAF does not have the same powers of control as it has in the EU Member States, not to mention the fact that it purely and simply does not have the staff to run a comprehensive anti-fraud operation out of Brussels.
It is therefore vital for us to exert pressure to ensure that there is a general improvement in the way public money is looked after in the recipient countries.
Countries that cannot protect their own tax revenue against fraud, corruption and waste are unlikely to be able to provide effective protection for EU funds.
However, for the Commission this also means that it should step up its presence in the recipient countries - and on this point I am in agreement with the rapporteur - but not only by increasing the number of officials in the delegations, but, also, by giving those local delegations more authority.
It should not, after all, be possible to circumvent local delegations in practice by coming to special arrangements direct with Brussels.
Once again, my heartfelt congratulations on your report, Mrs RÃŒhle. We are very happy to vote for it.
Mr President, the closure and the reduction of the status and the staff of twenty-odd delegations in ACP countries, recently decided by the Commission, deals a harsh blow to the commitments to development given in the Cotonou Agreements.
If there is one lesson that we have learnt about monitoring the Community' s external action for development, it is that the key to its success is the existence of a strong, responsible, independent and credible presence in the recipient countries.
The arguments of budgetary neutrality used by the Commission are fallacious, because opening a delegation in countries such as Saudi Arabia cannot be compared with the overall costs of maintaining a European presence in those countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
Furthermore this is not only a question of looking at the cost of a delegation, but of looking at the very real damage done to the effectiveness of public spending as a result of not monitoring such spending.
The European Union cannot do without an autonomous and meaningful policy for the less developed world and replace it with a form of regionalisation undertaken in agreement with some of the former colonial powers.
I hope that the Commission rethinks this course of action and treats the ACP countries and the management of the EDF with the importance that they deserve.
Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent and very serious work on this discharge exercise covering EDF 1999 which was the year in which this Commission took office.
This means that I feel especially responsible for the last four months of that year.
Mr Blak mentioned that Parliament has gained much by having this discharge delayed.
I think this is true, but it should be noted that the Commission feels equally pleased with the outcome.
This is like a good love story - it is always worth waiting for.
But it was wrong that the delay had to do specifically with information being held back in contradiction to the agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
The main reason for the delay was that the report from the internal auditor service was not finished and could not be finished because we, on both sides, found it necessary and a good idea to broaden its scope in order to get a serious and deep study of how to handle this method of development cooperation.
So we have solved problems that went beyond what is normally dealt with in the discharge process and this is what we can congratulate each other on tonight.
One remark to Mr BÃ¶sch concerning the Ivory Coast - we did get full recovery even though they had a military coup!
We grilled them.
We stuck to what I told Parliament: that we wanted to maintain a position of zero tolerance, and the new military dictators in the Ivory Coast accepted their obligations within the deadline.
We have not, in my time as Commissioner, experienced any case so far where we did not manage to get full recovery when the audit results indicated the need for that.
Our cooperation through the EDF has kept growing, while the support of other major donors for developing countries and especially for the least-developed countries has been declining.
The Funds constitute an increasingly important source of finance for these countries and so, of course, we owe it to them, and to our European taxpayers, to use these resources as effectively as possible.
By the same token, the Commission should be concerned to verify that the beneficiary countries are doing all they can to improve their own capacity for effective budgetary and financial management.
This has been a major theme of this discharge exercise, and it has succeeded in focusing attention on an important area of development cooperation.
The question of sound financial management of budgetary support is, I think, better understood, as a result of the work carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Commission' s internal audit service, in cooperation with the various Commission services responsible.
I do not see any need to amend the Cotonou Agreement to reflect this.
I am confident that there is a clear consensus between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and Parliament on the right way ahead, and in particular on the importance of budgetary support.
This is a key tool to enhance stability and economic governance.
By doing this in cooperation with other main donors and in a manner that emphasises the responsibility of the recipient government, we are playing a very important role.
I am deeply grateful to Parliament that this perspective has been understood for this budget period.
We need to continue to do this.
No other donor is able and willing to meet this challenge as we are.
Of course, we cannot turn a blind eye to the cases of corruption or of negligence in the management of public funds, and I can reassure you that we will continue this policy of zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption.
But we have to be aware, as you must, that the strengthening of financial control systems in these countries is a long-term process.
It has to be tackled with realism.
We have to make an assessment of the risks involved in each action that we consider for EDF finance, and go into action with a clear understanding of those risks.
It has to be based on a common approach with other donors.
An isolated approach by the Commission would be unrealistic.
It must rely on the development of internal accountability.
Cooperation with other donors in this field is better than ever.
We all need improvement, and this is definitely being pursued in good cooperation.
This covers the discharge for 1999, and the performance for 2000 is in several ways somewhat more encouraging.
One of the main objectives of the reform of the management of the Community' s external assistance programmes is, of course, drastically to reduce the gap between commitments and payments.
The Commission has been implementing measures since May of last year to tackle this problem.
For instance, we pressed ahead with the closure, wherever possible, of old and dormant commitments, and we proposed also the introduction of a so-called 'sunset clause' to limit the time during which funds allocated to an action can be used for contracts.
We, therefore, have reason to hope that the situation will gradually improve.
In relation to the slow rate of payments, the figures already available indicate that payments in 2000 increased from EUR 1.27 billion to EUR 1.55 billion.
We still have incredible inertia in the pipeline, in the way in which these figures move.
We have been increasing the total volume of what we do in this area and this is something that will gradually occur as a result of more and more activity year by year.
This is, of course, the challenge we are facing.
I have said, on several occasions, that the lack of comprehensive data about our operations is a real embarrassment.
We have made some progress towards more effective management information systems.
I know that Parliament, and particularly the Development Committee, is anxious to see us make progress in this area, and we are doing our best.
Nevertheless, there is still much to do and we are very conscious of the need to press on with reforming the management of our programmes.
In particular, we are concerned that the process of deconcentration, or delegating to delegations as I prefer to call it, should move ahead smoothly.
The Commission has been asking for additional staff, but the numbers required have been assessed on a very conservative basis and we need every single post.
I therefore hope that Parliament in its decisions on the budget for 2002 will support us in this effort.
It was encouraging to listen to Mr Casaca in this respect.
I thank you for your enthusiastic support and hope you can deliver.
We are determined that the deconcentration exercise should not end by simply exporting from Brussels to the delegations the problems caused by inadequate staffing.
This is serious.
Concern is expressed in the resolution about the percentage of EDF contracts going to companies from the ACP countries, and it requires the Commission to increase this from some 25% to 40% in five years.
The ACP countries win a much higher percentage of contracts under the EDF than from almost any other major donor.
This should not be forgotten.
ACP companies already benefit from a substantial preference margin in cases where offers are technically equivalent.
If it is to operate a transparent and fair tendering system, the Commission cannot envisage any kind of fixed quotas which would discriminate against European companies, and which would be contrary to WTO rules.
Nevertheless, we share the political intention of Parliament to maximise the benefits of our aid for local economies, particularly where there is a technically competent and well-structured private sector.
I would point to the new investment facility, part of the Cotonou Agreement, EUR 2.2 billion, which is architectured in order to stimulate the emergence of this activity in our partner countries.
This is a way in which they may improve their position in exactly this respect.
We have already identified this as an area where we should push forward.
I am anxious to reassure Parliament that the Commission is strengthening its monitoring procedures on the follow-up of audit.
This is an important part of the reform of the Commission' s financial management and control.
We also plan improvements to the presentation of the accounts, in response to the comments from the Court of Auditors.
We are ready to enter into a direct dialogue to find out how this is best done.
I will say a few words on the points in the resolution which refer to the transmission of confidential documents.
The respect of confidentiality and the application of correct transmission procedures remain crucial.
The 1999 discharge procedure showed that the framework agreement provides an effective and satisfactory framework for cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.
What we are discussing tonight has been following that set of rules.
I want to make that perfectly clear.
The 1999 discharge procedure was the first to which this framework agreement was applied.
The Commission sought to apply the agreement fully and loyally throughout that procedure.
In the Commission's view the framework agreement has proved to be an effective mechanism, one benefit being that it allows Parliament to receive confidential and similar information.
The understanding of the importance of development aid seems to be growing as we understand more and more about globalisation.
And in the light of recent events we have come to better understand the reality and urgency of interdependency in this world.
We cannot act alone.
The challenge of reducing poverty is one in which the whole international community is involved and we share with others the framework for providing aid and for assessing the results.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Mr President, I was rather surprised to hear the Commissioner state that we have recovered the money from the Ivory Coast.
I would be very grateful to the Commissioner if, within or without the framework agreement, he could inform me - in writing if necessary - where all this has been recorded, so that we can understand this.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can see that Mr Nielson is in agreement.
You will without doubt receive all these details as soon as possible.
Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)
The next item is the report (A5-0335/2001) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) (COM(2001) 83 - C5-0065/2001 - 2001/0046(COD)).
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy is pleased with the initiative to lay down the classification of territorial units for statistics in a Regulation, thereby providing it with a legal basis.
Until now, because there has been no such legal basis, changes and updatings have been carried out by means of gentlemen's agreements between Member States and Eurostat.
I believe that statistics are neither neutral nor politically innocent.
I therefore believe that this proposed regulation is of great political importance, not only because it will be applied when determining which regions will receive Structural Funds, but also because it provides a certain vision of Europe, of its territorial reality, of its regional and provincial organisation and hence of its disparities and imbalances.
The proposal divides the territory of the States into statistical units organised hierarchically into three levels, and proposes criteria for the definition of these regions in the candidate countries, criteria which demand that they continue to be defined on the basis of territorial organisation and within the current demographic borders.
The Committee on Regional Policy shares the objectives which the Commission expresses in its proposed Regulation, but nevertheless considers that the classification obtained is not entirely suited to those objectives, which means that it is perceived by some citizens as an artificial division of European territory.
In fact, in the annex, the Commission restricts itself to presenting the existing administrative territorial units in each Member State, mixing them with others which do not have the same institutional character, which means that there is a clear lack of homogeneity.
The Committee on Regional Policy believes that the proposal should include a European approach which is capable of overcoming the framework of borders between States.
In this respect, NUTS level 1 should take account of large territorial units which transcend these borders, which are intended to serve as a basis for the future planning of European territory.
Ladies and gentlemen, NUTS level 1 has clear shortcomings.
Only the regions of Germany and Belgium are considered units, while in other Member States, such as Spain, France or Italy, NUTS 1 level corresponds to enormous conglomerates or regions which are totally artificial and almost always arbitrary.
At the other extreme, the proposal names the Finnish Island of Aland as a NUTS 1 unit, despite the fact that its 25 000 inhabitants are way below the minimum of 3 million required for that demographic bracket.
I still believe that the Commission' s proposal should have been more daring, more coherent and, perhaps, if you will allow me, more European.
There are even more disparities in level 3, where a single Member State, Germany, has more units than eight Member States put together: France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg.
In relation to the surface area of the territorial units, the imbalance is also evident, since in the proposal the prevailing criterion is population rather than geographical size.
The Committee on Regional Policy urges the Commission and the Member States to work towards the creation of NUTS level 4 and even NUTS level 5, which would represent local bodies.
The Committee on Regional Policy is presenting Parliament with eleven amendments to this proposal.
I must point out that this report was approved in committee by 43 votes in favour and one abstention.
As rapporteur, I support these amendments and reject the other amendments presented in Parliament, which were rejected in committee.
I believe that the report approved by the Committee on Regional Policy should be accepted by Council and the Commission.
Its acceptance could prevent a second reading and a conciliation procedure and would allow the Regulation to enter into force on 1 January 2002.
If that is the case, we should be pleased that we have produced a legal text providing the basis for determining the territorial units necessary for gathering statistical information in this great Europe of the future.
Let us not fall into the trap of statistics being the art of indicating that two people have eaten well, when, in fact, one of them has eaten two chickens and the other has eaten none.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur.
On the basis of a Commission proposal with the best of intentions and leading us in the right direction, I believe that the rapporteur presented the committee with a good draft report and that the result achieved by that committee, as the rapporteur pointed out, is highly satisfactory.
It would be a good thing if the Commission and, subsequently, the Council could take up the proposals of this Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy.
Europe is constructed on the basis of agreements and consensus.
We are dealing here with an example of what, in many cases, this way of operating has consisted of: gentlemen' s agreements.
But from now on many of these agreements must be reflected in the Treaties, with a relevant legal basis.
This is an extremely important issue, as the rapporteur has pointed out very effectively.
We are dealing with European territorial construction.
For this we need clear, homogenous and geographic criteria. These criteria must be based on politico-administrative criteria - forgive my repetition.
We must not create fictitious units which, in the end, only lead to a lack of confidence in European construction on the part of the different States, the different regions and the citizens.
I am therefore pleased with the proposal from the committee.
I would lastly like to point out an amendment which rather reflects what we are talking about: the amendment by Mrs Cerdeira on the division of the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, which are politico-administrative units, each with its own status.
In this specific case I would like to point out how Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, from my group, also fought for this recognition for a long time, and I believe that tomorrow, when the report presented by the Committee on Regional Policy is approved, we will have achieved a satisfactory result. This is an example and a reflection of what we want in terms of the division and structuring of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the classification of territorial units for statistics is not a formality, as might appear at first sight, it is not a technical debate about statistical terms, it is a material question because adopting any classification has direct repercussions on how the development of each territorial unit is supported.
With the forthcoming enlargement, or to be more precise, enlargements, given that candidate countries will integrate in groups, we need to move towards objective criteria for classifying territorial units, so that new members know the rules of play.
The simplest way would be to adopt fully unified criteria for each classification level and for all the Member States.
However, the many and varied specific characteristics of the countries in the Union make this idea unfeasible and impracticable.
So we must agree with the rapporteur and endorse her satisfaction with the Commission initiative which, with the proposed regulation, creates the legal basis for classifying territorial units for statistics.
We should also congratulate the rapporteur who, with her sense of moderation and what I would call female perspicacity, has proposed and accepted feasible improvements to the Commission opinion in order to achieve a better approach to the basic objective, which cannot be but to formulate truly comparable territorial units, in every sense of the word, so that we can establish a universal European statistics system.
Given past injustices, the reasonable doubts of European citizens should not be brushed aside with replies along the lines of "this area is supported, even though it is better off than yours because it is a NUTS II territorial unit, whereas yours isn't".
Rationalisation at all operational levels in the Union should be our basic and fixed aspiration.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, for this excellent report.
She has raised important questions and also taken the proposals of others into account.
Our group supports the Commission' s proposal and, furthermore, the rapporteur' s view regarding the creation of a proper legal basis for verifying nomenclature.
The issue is also a timely one, as the applicant countries are receiving guidelines for verifying territorial classification in their own countries.
With the present NUTS classification system one problem is that classifications by country have shaped themselves according to each country' s own needs and traditions.
One cause for criticism is the fact that the land area of regions has not been used as a basis for statistics.
Units vary in size and, for example, a low population density or gradual depopulation are overlooked.
The aims of the regulation regarding clear rules, comparability and impartiality deserve support.
It is also important to determine rules for dealing with amendments and to ensure that the NUTS classification does not change too often.
We would ask you to support our group' s amendment, whereby islands and the outermost regions are added to the Subparagraph of Article 3 (4) in order to avoid unnecessary reclassification.
Our group stresses the importance of also having flexibility in classification so that administrative factors and, for example, geographical, social and economic circumstances will be taken into consideration as appropriate.
Our group supports the rapporteur' s opinion that the Commission should investigate the inclusion of a new level NUTS 4 in the regulation.
The goal relating to the comparative classification of territories will be difficult to achieve, and will take time.
It is essential, however, that we establish a fair classification, which will help to allocate the right actions to the right areas.
Mr President, it is a great pity that Mr Barnier is not here himself, because the NUTS classification is not just a purely technical or statistical question, it is one of the most important political issues for our future cohesion policy.
It is about whom will receive European funding in future, how much they will receive, and about who decides how it will be spent.
These are pivotal issues for the future of the European Union and of the cohesion policy, and that is why this subject, which we are now discussing at the midnight hour, is more important than has been evident hitherto.
The Commission has always adhered purely to statistical criteria for the classification of territorial units and has not taken such political issues into account.
So there was ultimately always a tendency to distribute resources from the structural funds using a scattergun approach, rather than concentrating these resources in any efficient way on the regions in greatest need.
Looking at the candidate countries, the Objective 1 areas have been extended to include high-income regions and centres such as Warsaw and Riga, and these regions receive just as much by way of funding as the poorest regions of the enlarged European Union, Latgale and Masuria.
I am sure that cannot be right.
This runs counter to a credible cohesion policy and I regard it as being totally absurd!
That is why I would like to ask whether the same agency that grants the authority aid funding should also be the control agency.
As I see it, the proposal before us does not adopt a bottom-up approach.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, as being sensible and clear in terms of both statistics and administration.
However, we must ensure that any amendment to the classification also requires the prior approval of the Member States.
We must also ensure that the definition of employment market regions under the 'shared-task' mechanism can also deviate from NUTS level III in future.
The two-year period provided for between an amendment to NUTS being accepted and coming into force should either be significantly reduced or else totally dropped, as Commission financial support for the Member States can depend on the regional structure.
Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with the Commission proposal, and would in fact be happier without the rapporteur's amendments that were adopted by a majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Although I said 'by a majority' , they were in fact adopted unanimously with one abstention, and that abstention was mine.
I voted against certain amendments in committee. This was because the report repeatedly referred to the adoption of additional criteria for the definition of regions as an objective.
I regard that as a problem, as taking account of, say, economic, geographical and social criteria in the case of non-administrative units will lead to a blurring of these clear criteria.
I believe that a key criterion for the definition of regions should be the number of people living in a region, as in the final analysis they are affected by any decisions regarding the NUTS classification.
When the rapporteur says in one recital that there should be at least three hierarchical levels, the use of that little phrase 'at least' implies that further levels ought to be created for classifying territorial units.
However, it needs to be borne in mind that the introduction of new statistics for the areas affected would involve a significant additional administrative burden, something that I believe should if anything be limited.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs MiguÃ©lez and everyone who has spoken in this debate.
I would like to start by clarifying two points that seem essential to me.
It is up to you to interpret whether statistical classification can have a political impact or not; but I can assure you that that is not the objective of this document, nor was it the Commission' s intention.
The document is based on a Eurostat proposal which intends to achieve the most equitable treatment possible for all the countries and regions of the European Union.
Nor does this document in any way prejudice regional policy: we do not know who will be objective 1, who will be objective 2 or whether the current regional policy system will be the same in the future.
We are talking about statistics here; and we are talking about making the statistics better and as equitable as possible for all the countries of the Union.
What is our intention?
Our intention is that a practice we have been applying up until now should become a rule. And we want to do this because it seems essential to us to give a legal character to something which so far has been a consensus between the Member States and the Commission.
But it also seems essential to us as a means of establishing principles for enlargement and in order to continue applying the same criteria that have been applied up to this point.
Until now, the NUTS had no legal basis, now they are acquiring it: this is the objective of the present regulation.
What criteria have we used for the definition of the NUTS?
Our document is essentially based on three principles.
The first is that the NUTS are legislative regions; we have therefore tried to define their territory in accordance with existing legislative political definitions: a good definition, recognised by the Member States, of units which in many cases already have governmental structures and comparable statistics, which makes them sufficiently reliable.
The second principle is that we propose three hierarchical levels of NUTS.
In your amendments you have gone further and asked for at least three levels.
With our current room for manoeuvre, from the point of view of producing statistics, to work with more than three levels would create financial problems for Eurostat.
This is one reason, but, furthermore, we believe that three levels will provide us with sufficient and valid information.
The third principle is to try to make the regional statistics comparable.
This is why the size of the NUTS has to be as homogenous as possible.
But we are also aware that there are historic realities and legal situations in each of the countries which mean that this principle cannot be applied in an automatic or mechanical way, and that specific situations have to be taken into account.
There is a consensus between Member States that these principles we have been using until now should also form the ideas behind the new regulation, as I have already mentioned, not only for application in our countries as they stand, but also in the countries which are going to join us in the coming years.
That is why the regulation responds to a series of objectives which you have been able to debate in depth and for which you have made some corrections.
We are heading towards having NUTS that are classified in accordance with the current regional systems, because we believe that this is the most effective instrument we have today for the collection, calculation and diffusion of regional statistics.
Furthermore, in the regulation we set criteria for defining regions in such a way that the candidate countries will have guidelines for regional classification within their own territory.
This objective is essential at this time.
I would also like to stress the need for statistics to be as comparable and as impartial as possible.
These statistics must not be produced and used for political ends, whatever they may be.
It would be very difficult to establish political interests which undoubtedly would lead us to clear contradictions.
This issue is essential for the Union' s regional policy, but, as I said before, statistical classification must not prejudice the nature of the Union' s future regional policy.
We intend to create clear rules for future modifications to the classification of NUTS because this will prevent future disputes, which have arisen in the past.
Modifications are inevitable.
We cannot speak of absolutely permanent situations, but NUTS must not be modified too often and of course we must have a system which is based on certain rules and certain pre-established principles.
We therefore believe it to be appropriate that modifications would not take place within a time period of three years, or else we will be faced with monitoring problems.
The regulation, as it is drawn up, allows us to move forward and improve on what we have at the moment.
You have contributed 11 amendments which, in our opinion, help to clarify and improve the regulation.
The Commission can therefore accept the 11 amendments presented by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I would like to end by stressing that the NUTS Regulation will be an important instrument for achieving comparable and impartial regional statistics in the European Union, on which we will be able to base the regional policy which we will decide on, politically, at the appropriate time.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.09 p.m.)
Madam President, I want to raise an issue on the floor of the House which I am sure will be welcomed.
I do so as the Labour Party spokesperson on Northern Ireland.
The House would surely like to welcome the news on the peace process in Northern Ireland and the decommissioning of weapons.
It serves as an example of what can be achieved through peaceful negotiation.
Tribute must be given to those involved in the difficult times of the peace process and the ongoing negotiations.
Mention must be made at the determination of those involved, including David Trimble, and not least a Member of this House, John Hume, who has fought for peace for over three decades.
Mr Cashman, I am even more pleased to hear this good news because I was on an official visit to Ireland last week, and, naturally, we were all waiting for this announcement.
Thank you for your comments.
Madam President, as you were informed earlier this week, I was in Scotland protesting against the Trident nuclear submarine base there and I was arrested.
What is the situation concerning our immunity in other Member States?
I understood that we could not be arrested in such circumstances.
I have nothing against the Scottish Police.
They were extremely courteous.
They were aware of the concept of peaceful demonstration.
Maybe they should train the police in places like Genoa and show them how to react to peaceful protests.
What is the situation regarding our immunity?
I was not breaking the peace, but trying to keep the peace by helping to rid the world of nuclear weapons.
Secondly, in relation to my immunity: Does that not count when I am in another country?
Mrs McKenna, I had, of course, been informed of the situation that you were in and I am pleased to see that you are back with us.
We shall thoroughly examine the issue regarding protocol.
I shall of course take the appropriate steps to ensure that Members are properly protected, if this is necessary.
Madam President, after that intervention inspired by naked self-interest, may I come back to more important matters of the day.
I would like to support my colleague, Mr Cashman, and in particular point out that this Parliament has been a very active supporter of the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland.
It has been a long, and at times faltering, road to achieving peace and no one knows that better than our own Nobel Peace Prizewinner, John Hume.
I grew up in Northern Ireland in the shadow of violence, terrorism and intimidation.
We are now witnessing another milestone in the return to peace for future generations.
May I ask you therefore to write on behalf of the European Parliament to all those involved and congratulate them on this major initiative?
I would also hope that the Belgium presidency would do the same on behalf of the Council for the 15 Member States.
Mrs McCarthy, I shall certainly do what you ask.
I can tell you that all those I met were more than aware of the European Parliament' s long-standing contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Madam President, I do not wish to delay proceedings, but just to follow up on the point, which has been made on a number of occasions, about parliamentary immunity.
I could be wrong, but my understanding is that the purpose of parliamentary immunity for Members of Parliament acting in the Parliament - not outside the Parliament - is to allow you to represent the people who elected you.
It is not so that you can necessarily represent your own views in whatever manner you choose.
In other words, when you are outside this House, you are just the same as anyone else.
You are on your own.
Mr Beazley, questions of immunity are always very delicate, as you know, and Mr Duff has been appointed to draft a report on the issue.
I suggest that he also take account of all the very interesting points that you have both brought up, so that the document written on this is as comprehensive as possible.
I would like to thank Mr Duff for doing this.
Madam President, as an Italian, I would like to thank Mrs McKenna for urging the Italian police to follow the example of the Scottish police.
I would also like to express my sorrow at her unfortunate experience and my appreciation of her commitment to social concerns.
I would like to thank her on behalf of the Italian police, which, however, I feel is no worse than any other police force in Europe.
In all probability, the Scottish police were polite and courteous because, if one police force should imitate another, it may be that protesters should imitate other protesters too. What I mean is the Scottish police were polite and courteous because the protesters who were with Mrs McKenna did not follow the example of the protesters in Genoa.
Thank you, Mr Santini.
European Council meeting (Ghent, 19 October 2001)
The next item is the European Council report and the Commission statement on the meeting of 19 October 2001 in Ghent.
Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that the Commission welcomes with great satisfaction some good news, at last, which has come in recent days, namely that the Irish Republican Army has started to decommission its arms in accordance with the Good Friday agreement.
The Commission will follow the consolidation of the reconciliation process in Northern Ireland closely, not least through our Peace programme.
Following the attacks on 11 September against the United States - our longstanding allies - the European Union has publicly committed itself to doing all it can to help bring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these acts to justice, and to holding accountable those hiding, supporting or harbouring them.
We thus pledged our complete solidarity with the government and people of the United States.
Over the days that followed, I was very pleased to see this declaration of solidarity translated into swift, concerted action at European level.
Mr Patten, the Belgian foreign minister, Mr Michel, and Mr Solana went first to Washington and then on to Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria to help build a global alliance against terrorism.
European authorities began rapidly stepping up intelligence and police cooperation, both within the EU and with third countries, especially the US.
On the basis of emergency legislation agreed at Community level, the European Union froze over EUR 100 million of assets of people suspected of terrorism.
It drew up uniform, Union-wide standards to improve security for air travellers.
It tabled proposals for a common definition of terrorism, for a system of EU-wide penalties for terrorist offences and for a European arrest warrant.
These proposals were firmly supported by the European Council at its extraordinary meeting on 21 September.
On that occasion, the Council called upon each European Union country to 'contribute according to its means' to the new global campaign against terrorism, and this is, indeed, what has been happening, with some countries mobilising or offering troops and others providing intelligence or making available air bases.
Despite the importance and success of this joint action, the fact is that media attention has largely been focused on what individual countries have been doing.
This has somewhat obscured and tainted the ongoing debate on the specific role Europe as a whole should be playing on the international stage.
That is precisely the issue I want to focus on today.
From the very start of my term of office, one of my Commission' s objectives has been to consolidate Europe' s influence in the world.
This has become even more urgent in the light of the new world situation.
If the European Union is to be a leading actor on the world stage, it must speak with a single, clear, dynamic voice and it must support its words with unified action.
The Union has made progress in this direction, it cannot be denied.
You only have to compare, for example, the disparate attitudes of our Member States to the Gulf War, a decade ago, with our recent united stance on the situation in the FYROM and our present coherent response to terrorism.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Belgian Presidency for the excellent work it has done to promote this process and for the courageous and intelligent way in which it has maintained support for the Union' s common, shared goals.
However, we are still a very long way from achieving the genuinely common foreign and security policy we so badly need.
I am therefore very glad that, in the Union' s declaration of 14 September, we publicly committed ourselves to developing our common foreign and security policy and to ensuring that the Union really can speak out clearly and with one voice.
A common policy is not, of course, the same thing as a single policy uniformly adopted by every Member State.
No, a common policy pools the different strengths of the individual countries, enabling them to pursue shared goals using shared instruments.
Has Europe been 'absent' , as some people allege?
My answer is 'No' although we need to make a certain distinction here.
Europe is taking very specific, effective action in those fields where integration is a possibility or a practical reality.
This is not at all surprising, since the Community method has, for the last fifty years, ensured that Europe can act effectively, rapidly and visibly in all the fields in which this is possible.
It is in areas where Europe is less integrated, where the Community method is virtually or wholly absent, that the European Union seriously lacks effectiveness.
This hard fact should make us even more resolute in our preparations for the major future political developments in the Union.
A common policy ensures that the different national policies are co-ordinated within a Community framework according to the Community method so that they serve the interests of the Union as a whole.
In the field of the common foreign and security policy we have not yet reached that point because the necessary consensus has not yet been achieved. We are in a transition period, so to speak.
However, that must be our objective. We must lose no time in establishing a policy that builds on our experience of Community action and makes full use of the tools available to us.
Our first priority must be to be united in our action.
In my view, individual action taken by only a few countries is in the interests neither of the Union as a whole nor of its individual Member States, be they large or small.
At Ghent, I noted that no Member State wants to move in that direction, but the Commission will remain vigilant, on behalf of us all.
Secondly, we need specific institutional mechanisms for taking policy decisions.
That is the kind of common foreign and security policy we must develop, building on the progress we have already made, and we need to develop it fast if we are to make any useful impact on the world now emerging after the tragedy of September 11.
I am pleased to note that Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs has discussed at length and with great care the implications of the common foreign and security policy for the functioning of the institutions and, in particular, of the Council.
I welcome the proposals put forward in the Poos report and I commend Mr Poos for his achievements in addressing these so very delicate and sensitive issues.
I call upon this House to endorse them fully today and upon the Council to undertake to implement them as soon as possible.
The Commission is ready to play its full part in this necessary process.
The statements issued on 14 September have important implications for the Union' s foreign policy priorities.
In the short to medium term, we must focus even more on our dialogue with the Arab and Islamic worlds, on the Middle East peace process, for the Middle East is at the centre of the current world events, and on exploiting the full potential of the Barcelona process - and this is where our task lies.
The time has come to make new moves in our Mediterranean policy.
The results we have achieved so far have not been altogether satisfactory, though this has not always - or rather has often not - been our fault.
We must now take full advantage of all the opportunities open to us to ensure genuine progress.
The Euro-Mediterranean region must aim at genuine economic integration and at setting up institutional mechanisms for taking common decisions.
We are also widely expected to play a new role in the Middle East.
We must take practical, joint action to respond to this challenge which, although tough, is within our capabilities.
Further afield, we need to review our policies on trade and co-operation with Pakistan, India and Iran as well as with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States.
Tangible progress has been made with regard to Pakistan in recent days.
I also believe we should be ready to respond to the renewed signs of interest in joint action on shared goals - such as the fight against AIDS - coming from countries like Libya.
This is a completely new development.
Once again, Europe is in an excellent position to respond to these political signals and to help such countries join our alliance.
We also need to work energetically to develop a consistent, active policy in relations between the Union and all its neighbours. Partnerships with specific goals, institutions and resources, particularly in our relations with Russia and the Ukraine.
Partnerships that will ensure lasting stability in our continent. This time of change is also the right time to boost these policies.
Lastly, world wide, we have to build fresh confidence, and one key way we can do so in the immediate future is to successfully launch a new round of world trade talks.
At the same time, we must work harder to offer the world' s poorest regions a genuine chance of sustainable development.
I have said it before, and I will say it again: we must guide the process of globalisation so that it works for the good of all, poor as well as rich.
We Europeans must be proud of the policies we have been pursuing as we prepare for enlargement, for they are the only democratic globalisation policies thus far developed in the world, and I would stress that: the European Union project is the only democratic globalisation process in existence.
We therefore have to tackle, energetically, boldly and imaginatively, the global issues that breed resentment and discontent such as poverty, widening gaps in income and the now intolerable economic and social imbalances.
These are the things that sow frustration and tension in relations between the developing world and the West.
The anti-terrorism alliance must advance hand in hand with a development alliance, with the Union leading by example.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Extraordinary European Council Meeting of 21 September asked the Commission to analyse the economic impact of the terrorist attacks.
We did so immediately, and the Commission presented its report to the Ghent European Council.
The European economy was clearly slowing down even before 11 September.
The immediate consequence of the terrorist attacks was a further loss of consumer confidence and a widespread sense of uncertainty.
However, there are several positive factors to bear in mind, factors that enable us to face the current shock much more calmly than in similar circumstances in the past.
Firstly, the fundamental aspects of our economy.
The European economy, unlike that of the United States, is free of trade imbalances and Europeans still have a very strong tendency to save.
Moreover, unlike in previous crises, the Union has been largely protected from possible shockwaves of devaluations and counter-devaluations of currencies by the existence of a solid, reliable single currency, the euro.
Just think what would have happened if we had not had the euro!
The events of recent weeks should make us even more proud of the quantum leap forward that the euro has allowed us to take.
Secondly, our programme.
We are undertaking structural reforms, following a strategy carefully defined at Lisbon.
The reforms are far from complete, but the present crisis should strengthen our political resolve to see them through.
I therefore call upon this House and the Council to stop hesitating and to speed up the approval of all the decisions taken at and after Lisbon to make the European economy more efficient.
Only if we meet the Lisbon objectives and targets will we be able to minimise the extent and duration of unemployment and maximise growth potential in the medium and long term.
Thirdly, our instruments.
We have achieved significant control of taxes that will still give us some room for manoeuvre during the slowdown.
However, the problem of coordinating our economic policies arises at this stage in all its severity, and it arises because, in this sector too, we continue to have difficulty in applying the Community method.
On the basis of this, I conveyed to the European Council two messages.
Firstly, the information currently available shows that our economy is genuinely resilient. If not an optimistic message, this at least gives no cause for concern.
Secondly, however, we need to continue to monitor economic trends closely, not only in the Union and the euro zone but also worldwide. If the situation changes we must be ready to act using the instruments available to us.
Once again, let me stress the importance of co-ordinated action.
With the current degree of integration, all action must be properly co-ordinated at Eurozone and European Union level.
In the present uncertain situation, we must show that we are acting in a co-ordinated manner and that we have the will to use all the available instruments.
Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, this is a time for the greatest possible unity, determination and resolution.
We must ensure that lasting hope comes out of the evil of 11 September.
Our peoples' reactions to the recent events show that Europe needs to be more, not less present.
If Europe is to fully live up to its pledge of solidarity - solidarity with the United States but also the safeguarding of global solidarity - the Member States of the European Union must genuinely act as one Community.
The Commission will continue to work tirelessly to achieve this.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the Ghent statement on terrorism, but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we also say that words must now be backed up by deeds.
It is not acceptable that this is the second time that the Heads of State and Government have made recommendations which are then not promptly put into effect by the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice.
We call upon the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice to act with speed.
We also say, above all, that cooperation merely between States cannot continue as at present.
Important issues of home affairs and justice policy must also be dealt with on the basis of Community law, and the Commission must have a central role in observing the situation and implementing Community law.
Continuity is not achieved by the Presidency of the Council rotating every six months.
Continuity must also be ensured by the European Commission and the European institutions.
I ask you also, in your capacity as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium, to resolve the issue of the security of the European institutions, including the European Parliament in Brussels, with a solution that will be satisfactory both in principle and in practice.
We have to make Europe's voice heard more.
It was surely right for prominent individuals from the European Union to go to visit the American President, but I find it no longer acceptable that, for example, the situation arises where the American Secretary of State appears before the television cameras with three prominent Europeans alongside him.
We will have to learn lessons for the future from this; a crisis is always also an opportunity. We need one European face to represent us to the world!
(Applause)
We now have a coalition against terrorism.
Our group supports it unreservedly.
We now, though, also need a coalition to rebuild Afghanistan.
I welcome the position you have taken on this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Afghanistan has been suffering for twenty years.
We must make an effort as a Community, also at an international level, to give Afghanistan a good future.
You and the President of the Commission have spoken rightly about the Middle East.
Our group rejects the deliberate killing of people, be it in Palestine or in Israel.
We call on the parties involved to at last give a signal for peace.
We want there to be cooperation, we want there to be a Palestinian state and we want Israel to be able to live within recognised and secure borders.
We urge all those involved to take a step away from the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and towards one of cooperation, peace and mutual understanding.
(Applause)
We see the Mediterranean dialogue as an important challenge.
It is for that reason that we have proposed the Euro-Mediterranean Meeting in Brussels on 8 November.
I wish to thank Mrs Fontaine for promptly implementing our joint decision in the Conference of Presidents.
We hope that this will send a message about cooperation with the Arab and Islamic world.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are in broad agreement with you as regards Laeken, but please ensure that the Convention does not only have the task of enumerating options.
Its task will be, rather, to present a majority proposal.
There may of course also be a minority vote.
This must not lead to negotiations without binding effect.
That is not what we expect of the Convention, but rather a proposal which can then go to the Heads of State and Government for discussion.
We also expect this Convention not to have too large a bureau.
It is crucial that five persons should be represented in it: the chairman/chairwoman and the representatives of the four institutions involved.
This body must exercise real leadership, taking the Convention into a better future.
We would like to see this Convention's work timetabled in such a way that it can conclude a Treaty in 2003 under the Italian Presidency, a Treaty that we hope will lead to the fundamental treaty of which you have spoken.
Let me make another observation, a very practical one. In Ghent, you discussed transfers between bank accounts in different countries of the European Union, a question which one might think not to be so important.
Our Parliament, though, has put forward a proposal by means of Mrs Peijs' report.
We have made clear that the high costs incurred in bank transfers are not acceptable.
I think that the Heads of State and Government have done the right thing in taking this issue on board.
Please permit me one final observation: there has been a certain amount of friction between the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, which is very regrettable in view of the Presidency of the Council being held by Belgium.
At issue was our common presentation of ourselves to the public - who said what, and when.
There was a certain annoyance because three Member States had met together.
I want neither to play that up nor to ignore it.
I would, though, like to point out to all the European institutions that our Europe is so complicated that it must not be a Europe of vanities or a Europe of dominance, but all the institutions must meet each other halfway.
It is important that we understand each other and work together, for our common European future is at stake.
I hope that the crisis in which the world currently finds itself will bring the European institutions together and lead them to common action for Europe.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, following the European Council in Ghent, my group feels both hope and concern.
Hope, because in Northern Ireland arms are being entombed in concrete, and concern, because we are facing a long fight against global terrorism, which we must pursue with conviction, perseverance and courage.
This fight is not limited to what appears in the television pictures, whether they be from Al Jazeera or from CNN.
We must deal with the response measures authorised by the United Nations, but we must also make a significant effort in the humanitarian field and in terms of reconstruction and stabilisation, both in Afghanistan and in many other parts of the world.
The European Union can play an important role in this context.
With regard to what the President-in-Office of the Council said about the Ghent meeting, I would like to point out that in Helsinki the European Council decided to create a rapid intervention force which is still not operational.
The prior meeting of certain Member States was inappropriate.
I also believe - and I address this to both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission - that we must show unity at all times and it is highly significant that, after a European Council, the President of the Commission should appear shoulder to shoulder with the President-in-Office of the Council to announce the decisions adopted.
With regard to the relationship between the European Council and the specific Councils, I would point out that the European Parliament is making an effort to speed up the negotiation of the measures you have proposed, but this is not being treated in a corresponding fashion by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would recommend that, before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken, you read in detail the report by my group colleague, Mr Poos, who is the person with the most historical experience of the Council.
It may help you to present interesting proposals.
With regard to our relations with the Islamic countries and the Arab world, we believe that the forum we are going to relaunch at the beginning of November may be positive.
My political family is also trying to re-establish links and the new tour of the Middle East which you have announced is very important, with an active approach by the Union to the resolution of this absolutely key conflict.
As for the economy, please allow me to make a brief point: inflation is decreasing, there are margins, but the European Union' s policy must be active and anti-cyclic, and we still have a Central Bank which takes decisions and a Council which makes recommendations.
The Union needs economic leadership.
And since you have said that you are going to the University of Ghent for a debate on globalisation, I would also ask you to take the European Parliament' s report on the reform of the international financial system.
With regard to the Tobin tax, your political friends have voted against what was proposed in ECOFIN and what my group presented as an amendment.
As for the future of Europe, I would like to point out that the Convention is not a war of opposing positions, but must be a joint effort.
We are making progress and you are gradually retracting, and that is not good.
I am grateful that the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs have been convened.
On behalf of my group, I can tell you that we have two concerns: one, that there should be balanced representation between European parliamentarians and those of the Member States, both in the Convention and in the Presidency; secondly, that the Convention should make a difference and not just be a talking shop or a debating club, and should make coherent proposals.
Lastly, the proposals should lead to a decision by the Intergovernmental Conference before the 2004 elections in order to honour our commitments in the field of enlargement.
And in relation to enlargement, I must say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - and here there have also been some interpretation problems - that the final exam will be taken at the end of 2002.
I am pleased that you were in Poland yesterday.
I was there on Saturday and I would like to say that I am surprised that the conservatives of the Union are beginning to say that Poland is becoming a problem because a party of the Left has won.
Poland was a much bigger problem before, because it did not have a solvent government and I believe that, although there always has to be a degree of political competition, we must support Poland, which now has a strong government with a clear desire to take part in the future of Europe.
Madam President, I should like to begin - as other colleagues have done today - with a reference to the milestone event in Northern Ireland.
The verified decommissioning of IRA weapons has been a necessary and required act for a considerable period of time.
It was long overdue, but now that it has happened, it is hugely welcome.
Particularly since 11 September it has been increasingly inevitable that such an act should take place.
I hope it represents a new dawn, a rebirth, a renaissance for the peace process in Northern Ireland and that all the political actors will now seize this moment to ground and root the peace in the institutions of that agreement.
I add my voice to those who have asked all the institutions today, in the clearest terms, to welcome what has happened on behalf of the European Union.
I want to say to Prime Minister Verhofstadt, with regard to the Ghent Council, that my group totally supports the clearest and most unequivocal assurances you have given of total solidarity with the United States.
That is an important act of solidarity, and an important point of departure.
I reiterate, for my group, that we totally support this.
If I do not dwell on this, it is simply because there are one or two questions I should like to raise with you, Mr President-in-Office.
In particular, we have had rather a long debate about the potential humanitarian crisis.
Clearly for areas within control of the Taliban, we cannot blame the world community for Taliban unwillingness to engage with the United Nations, NGOs and others. But I would like to know what specific initiatives we, as the European Union, with our commitment of resources in this area, are now taking to urge Pakistan to open more space for refugees.
I appreciate the enormous difficulties.
I appreciate they already have two million or more Afghanis within their territory, but can we not, with our financial and organisational capacity, reassure those authorities that if the borders are opened to cope with this crisis they will not be left alone or have to pick up the tab on their own?
I should like to turn to the question of the role of the Council of Ministers in following up on the action plan to fight terrorism.
In particular, I note the strategic leadership which you offered through the Council at the extraordinary meeting on 21 September.
There you made a clear plea to the institutions to seize that moment and act.
Here I congratulate the Commission for taking the European Council at its word and bringing forward with extraordinary speed a comprehensive measure to freeze the assets of terrorist organisations.
I can tell you in this Parliament that within 24 hours of receiving that, and with the proviso that we should review it in the lifetime of this Parliament, we too seized the moment.
That had no precedent ever in European law making.
It was with some regret then that one noticed that, if there was a delay, it was among your 'line managers' from the European Council down to the Council of Ministers.
I have a number of questions: What is the Council doing on the freezing of assets?
But I have an important question around it.
Can you explain to me, Prime Minister, what does this mean about the quality of governance in the European Union?
After all, the Council is there to give a strategic lead.
You gave it, the Commission followed; this House followed.
The question is: Why did the Council of Ministers not follow with the same alacrity?
I would like to pose one other question in relation to the Convention.
The Prime Minister has explained to us that the candidate states will participate.
I very much welcome that.
I ask the Prime Minister to clarify, in the light of the agreement at Helsinki, that all candidate countries will be treated on an equal basis.
Does that invitation extend to Turkey?
It is important that Turkey should be included, based on the principles clarified at Helsinki.
I know it is not a negotiating state, but Helsinki established a clear principle of equality of treatment for candidate states.
To summarise: What will we do with Pakistan and humanitarian aid?
What does the example of the freezing of assets tell us about the rather dysfunctional quality of governance?
Will Turkey be a participant in the process?
Finally, I am glad to see that the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office, today at least, are sharing a platform in the European Parliament.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, we know that when all European Councils draw to a close, they either give us grounds for satisfaction or grounds for disappointment.
One of the grounds for satisfaction is always the number of well-intentioned declarations, and one of the grounds for disappointment is usually the way these are implemented.
I shall restrict my comments to the chapter on the follow-up to the 11 September attacks and the fight against terrorism and I would like to give my views on this on behalf of my group.
We welcome the statement that humanitarian aid for Afghanistan and neighbouring countries is an absolute priority, but unfortunately, we do not welcome the specific actions taken.
If we want to take specific action and provide vital and essential food aid to the civilian population at risk, we must respond to the appeals by numerous key figures and NGOs and suspend the bombings.
We have had enough indications and warnings, spelling out that a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent, as winter in Afghanistan is approaching, which is usually extremely harsh.
We now know that the civilian population is paying a high price for the war, and the Council, in declaring its staunchest support for the military operations, is turning a blind eye to this situation.
The pre-summit meeting between the Heads of State and Government in Ghent, other than the fact that, to my mind, it is a failure compared to the real summit, demonstrated that the Heads of State and Government give military cooperation with the United States priority over a concerted political approach at European Union level. It also relegates the humanitarian, diplomatic and all other types of initiatives to the background.
With regard to the commitment to fight against terrorism and to protect the population against these acts of terrorism, it goes without saying that the commitment made by the Council is to be welcomed, but an unambiguous definition of terrorism is clearly needed as far as legislative initiatives are concerned in order to avoid any confusion and the criminalisation of any anti-establishment behaviour or activities, which are, however, political in nature and legitimate nonetheless.
Our group has a number of concerns regarding the declaration in which the European Union states that it is willing to undertake reciprocal initiatives with the United States, particularly to facilitate judicial assistance and extradition.
Regarding extradition, we are aware that the death penalty is still in force in the United States and therefore this poses a huge problem for the European Union.
Regarding judicial assistance, we are concerned about ensuring that civil liberties are protected and that personal data protection is not diminished as a result of this cooperation with the United States.
One of the important chapters concerns the protection of the population, and we welcome the joint efforts made with regard to non-proliferation and export controls on weapons and chemical, bacteriological and nuclear substances capable of being used for terrorist purposes.
Therefore, intensifying our joint efforts is a very positive move, but we may wonder why the important question of industrial activities has not been mentioned at all, particularly with regard to nuclear power stations and re-processing plants, where large quantities of radioactive and fissile substances are stored, which could cause an ecological and social catastrophe in the event of an aircraft crash, intentional or otherwise.
The Council statement does not contain a single reference to this issue, and I think that this is a serious oversight.
To sum up, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, I think that it is true to say that we are particularly disappointed by the outcome of this Summit.
I do not wish to have to relive this disappointment at the Laeken Summit, and I am pleased to note that Mr Verhofstadt is determined to give the European Union a new role and to open up genuine dialogue on a topic that has been slightly overworked in recent weeks, in other words, globalisation.
I am pleased that he has changed the vocabulary he was using to refer to this matter, since he has rejected the term 'anti-globalisation,' which was essentially inappropriate.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the four weeks that passed between the Extraordinary European Council of 21 September and the Ghent Summit of 19 October were filled with events of strategic importance.
In what ways did the Fifteen analyse these events?
In the meantime, the targeted response, for which the Member States had already declared their support the month before, has escalated into real war, causing wide-spread devastation, civilian casualties and distraught people heading for the borders.
On numerous occasions, targets have been missed, with refugee centres, hospitals, residential areas and even Northern Alliance positions being mistakenly attacked.
The ultimate goal of these operations, which are being stepped up, is becoming increasingly blurred as each day goes by and their vague strategy is startling.
There are growing protests...there is mounting criticism...the feeling of unease is spreading, including amongst fervent supporters and key allies of a consistent fight against terrorism.
What is our objective?
Do we sincerely believe that this is the way to win the necessary fight to close down these criminal networks and deprive them of their fertile breeding ground?
How does the European Council view this development, that is worrying to say the least, particularly in the wake of the announcement that American soldiers will soon be deployed on Afghan territory, and even more so because both Ramadan and winter are almost upon us?
Well, the European Council - and I quote - 'confirms its staunchest support for the military operations [...] and [...] notes that these targeted actions are in accordance with the conclusions of the Extraordinary European Council meeting on 21 September 2001.'
In some ways, therefore, there is nothing new in this statement...I am saddened and concerned by this attitude, as it almost puts Europe out of the running altogether, at a time when much is expected of Europe, of a political Europe, not of a military Europe, and of a Europe which, admittedly, has expressed solidarity with the United States in tracking down these terrorist networks, but failed, however, to provide unconditional support for the unilateral choices made by those in Washington.
In the weeks before the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union had, in fact, begun to play a role on the international stage, in the Middle East, in Macedonia, at the Durban conference on racism, and the EU knew how to make a mark on events.
This was also true on the day after the attacks, when Europe supported the most realistic and responsible movement within the Bush Administration, helping to do away with the worrying concept of a crusade in order to set up a global coalition on an unprecedented scale.
Unfortunately, since military operations got underway, the European Union has been acting as if it were paralysed.
The new global situation means proper intervention by Europe is more pressing than ever on some crucial issues that are at the heart of the current world crisis, and most importantly, on the Middle East question.
Mr Verhofstadt briefly touched upon this point and Mr Prodi came back to the issue: the European Council statement rightly reiterates that the UN resolutions must be respected in order to find a lasting solution to this conflict; the US leaders themselves now seem to agree that Mr Sharon' s policy is feeding the spiral of violence and is a fundamental barrier to peace.
Now then is the time for straight talking before things once again spiral out of control and thus give another chance to those who fish in troubled waters.
No one is better placed than Europe to give fresh hope to the forces of peace in the region.
I believe that this should now be our overriding ambition.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, President Prodi, firstly, I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the comments that have been made by colleagues here this morning and by you, Madam President and President Prodi on the good news from Ireland on the decommissioning of arms.
I very much want to put on record once again the important part Parliament and the Commission played in helping the peace process at a time when this help was very much needed.
We have had a dramatic breakthrough in the last 24 hours, but let nobody here take it for granted that the road to peace - a just and lasting peace - is going to be easy.
Of course, the great majority of people on the island of Ireland are genuinely in search of this just and lasting peace, but, regrettably, a small minority will do their best to try and derail the process.
We must all be on the watch for that.
I very much welcome the fact that the European Union leaders unequivocally stated their full support for the action that has been taken in the fight against terrorism in all its aspects and reaffirmed their solidarity with the American government.
They have agreed that the fight against terrorism must continue within a United Nations framework.
I believe that the United Nations has a very important and leading role to play in this regard.
Present and future actions in the fight against international terrorism should and must emanate from the membership of the United Nations.
We are all concerned that civilian populations must be shielded from the attacks which are taking place in Afghanistan at this time and, in a war situation, there is nothing more sickening than one hearing commentators refer to civilian deaths as 'collateral damage'.
We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected.
Humanitarian aid for the Afghan people must be a priority and such aid must cover the needs of the Afghan population and Afghan refugees, EU governments are fully committed to ensuring that such aid reaches these people in need.
We want to ensure that this is done.
Winter is due to start very shortly in Afghanistan, and these winters are exceptionally cold and difficult.
I believe that the international community, including the European Union and the United Nations, must estimate the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the next few months and ensure that all the necessary humanitarian aid is delivered.
We must also, remember that the war against terrorism is being fought on many different fronts.
Within the Union, there must be formal adoption of the EU directive on money laundering.
We must be able to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism so as to help cut off the money supply which is the financial oxygen for its evil operations.
We can confiscate the financial proceeds of drug barons in Europe and we must be able to extend these powers of confiscation to other financial proceeds of crime.
There must be a speedy ratification by the Union's Member States of the United Nations Convention for the suppressing of the financing of terrorism.
EU governments at Ghent supported the implementation of a common European arrest warrant, and our EU Justice Ministers are due to meet on 7 December 2001 to put in place the final terms governing the operation of this warrant.
It is very important, in my view, that there is a clear definition of terrorist acts, as a national cannot and should not be extradited from one country in Europe to another unless the specified crime is a crime in his or her host Member State.
Finally, we live in challenging and uncertain times and the political situation in the Middle East is very volatile.
The present instability and violence cannot and must not continue indefinitely.
I believe that the Israeli troops must withdraw from the territories of the Palestinian Authority.
I would appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to do everything possible to negotiate a settlement based on the recommendations of the Mitchell report.
Madam President, Prime Minister and President of the Commission, at the Ghent Summit we saw the trinity, or 'dictorium' , of the big three countries make an appearance.
The preliminary meeting between Great Britain, France and Germany suggests a model that is as far from the federalists' vision, or illusion, of a democratic federal State as it is from the Eurosceptics' more realistic desire for a Europe of democracies.
Cooperation between the big three is engaged in on an intergovernmental basis, behind closed doors and without democratic control.
In this way, the big three decide what the others are to think.
For the small countries, intergovernmental cooperation between the big countries may come across as supranational dictates.
The summits are also conducted behind closed doors and without democratic control.
European integration is now modelled on the way in which private holding companies operate.
A minority of the largest shareholders is able to make decisions on behalf of the majority.
Cooperation can thus be intergovernmental and supranational at one and the same time and combine the defects of these arrangements with the maximum lack of openness, democracy and proximity to the people.
The summits must be transformed into well-prepared meetings in which small and large countries and all parliaments have an equal part to play in the preparations.
Summits must be opened up to elected representatives so that representatives of the national parliaments are able to exercise democratic control by being present there.
Summits should also be opened up to the press whenever prime ministers discuss legislation and other issues which, in our Member States, are dealt with openly.
Mr Verhofstadt is still a young prime minister from a country that has traditionally opposed the big countries' dictatorial way of thinking.
Have nothing to do with this, Prime Minister!
Invite elected representatives to the next summit in Laeken.
Do not make a decision to begin a constitutional process without its first having been discussed with the electorate in our countries.
Let the next treaty be formulated through the input of grassroots contributions instead of its coming like a thief in the night to limit our democracy.
Make sure, too, that the 49% of the electorate that voted against Maastricht in France and the majority of the electorate who recently voted 'no' in Ireland and Denmark can feel they are properly represented in the forthcoming convention.
Promise, above all, that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the countries. In that way, you will be obliged to design a treaty that can be adopted, that is to say, a treaty characterised by openness, democracy and proximity to the people.
President of the Commission, I am speaking on behalf of the European radical Members of the Bonino List. We welcome the European government' s support of the United States institutions, although we hope that they will manage to continue to resist the anti-American, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist instincts which are so powerful within the political groupings in Europe.
However, we would criticise the delays in presenting a humanitarian aid plan and its lack of practical content in the face of a potential humanitarian disaster.
On a more general note, it is not right to focus on the difficult nature of the European Union' s political role without addressing the issue of the democratic nature of the institutions themselves.
We have talked about how important it is for the Fifteen to act in unity and with all speed and to assume a common position.
In our opinion, unity between the Fifteen is valuable when it is achieved through public - and therefore accountable, democratic - debate.
It is of much less value when it is reached in closed meetings held in secret meeting rooms which are inaccessible to democratic scrutiny.
An example of this is cooperation in justice and home affairs.
We are all in favour of the European area of justice and police cooperation, but these are extremely sensitive areas which involve fundamental rights and freedoms and the 15 penal codes of our Member States.
It is unacceptable for any democratic debate to be dispensed with, either in the national parliaments or the European Parliament, on issues relating to rights guaranteed by constitutions, in the name of the need for rapid action.
That is the real obstacle: the real obstacle is the democratic nature of the European Union!
We would make this clear, in particular, to Mr SchrÃ¶der and Mr Chirac, who publicly lamented the lack of rapid action.
Be careful: fundamental rights and freedoms are involved!
The democratic nature of the institutions of the European Union is at stake.
Madam President, as someone who was born and bred in Ghent, I should first of all like to express my satisfaction at the peaceful process of the demonstrations during the European Council in Ghent.
What went wrong in Gothenburg and Genoa did not in Ghent.
That is undoubtedly linked to the changes since 11 September, but also to the sound preparation, the sensible approach by the police and certainly also to the open dialogue that has led to a different atmosphere.
As Mr Verhofstadt has already underlined, the original intention of this informal summit was to prepare for the Laeken Declaration.
The Fifteen defined the parameters and the timeframe for the convention.
As the European Parliament, we should be able to recognise that this was a true tour de force.
Six months ago, this would have been absolutely unthinkable.
Another positive development is the fact that the Union has taken a unanimous and firm stand in the fight against terrorism, has emphatically confirmed its solidarity with the US, but at the same time, has highlighted its own political role.
Strictly speaking, Ghent has thus fulfilled the expectations.
But the way in which European unanimity was brought about has once again exposed the cracks in the European edifice.
Ghent has also painfully accentuated the fact that Nice' s two areas of tension, namely that between the large and small countries, and that between the intergovernmental and community approach, is still heavily mortgaging the European Union' s future.
This applies first and foremost to the CFSP.
The French President is right, strictly speaking, when he states that the European Union is not authorised to deal with military matters.
However, the question is whether we are prepared at all to change this.
The three largest Member States should realise that they cannot continue to be only half-committed to the cause.
This ambiguity cannot remain concealed behind fine sounding final declarations in which attempts are made to keep up appearances of European unanimity.
Let us hope that 11 September and the need to reform the institutions prior to enlargement will encourage Member State governments to look beyond their own national policies and return to the roots of the European Union, namely to promote peace and security in Europe and in the world by intense cooperation between the Fifteen, rather than just three, Member States.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency, as I think that the excellent way in which the Ghent European Council fulfilled its duties and its responsibilities is a positive and hopeful sign that our institutions are working well.
I believe that this European Council was worthwhile, and was acting perfectly within its powers, in other words, in the role of providing guidance.
I would like to make three points in relation to this.
The first point concerns the issues that are called JHA in our jargon.
These issues involve a great deal of intense and difficult work, and the Ministers for Home Affairs and Ministers for Justice of each of our Member States will not be able to make progress on these, unless they have before them bold proposals such as those that Commissioner Vitorino made, and unless they are constantly reminded of the political direction favoured by the European Council.
These are difficult subjects, which require will and political determination in order to make progress.
Thank you, Mr President, for giving these conclusions.
As for the economic situation, I think that the European Council worked hard to point out where the room for discussion between the economic and monetary authorities must be.
If we really want to put in place a policy to support growth, and this is, without doubt, necessary for the European Union, we need everyone to shoulder their responsibilities, to fully utilise the room for manoeuvre in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the monetary policy, to mobilise the European Investment Bank, so that we finally get across the idea that this is a major undertaking, even if it means going back to square one.
This is also the direction that you described, in relation to the launch of the WTO negotiations.
We must not, however, forget our responsibilities, the contribution we can make, for example, to a subject as important as that of cancelling the debts of developing countries.
The third area on which you gave some guidelines, and I would like to thank you for doing so, is that of cross-border payments.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the delicate issue of cheques.
At a time when we are changing over to the euro, we know that these cheques are used primarily by vulnerable sectors of society.
So, let us stop creating obstacles and let things take their course, as, for once, we are not in a great rush.
Lastly, Mr President, you stated that you hope the question of Europe' s position on the world stage will be discussed openly at Laeken.
And Mr Prodi, you asked if Europe was absent from the world stage.
No, Europe is not absent!
Europe did everything it could do and everything it should have done.
The only difficulty is that Europe is not always heard that is the problem.
At Durban, we made ourselves heard, but when it comes to having a real influence on the political, diplomatic and military situation, we still lack the support from the European Union.
We are expecting a great deal from the Convention in this respect.
Mr President, when the two planes crashed into the World Trade Center they demolished more than the twin towers.
We also saw the destruction of the European Union's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht and our response today requires a fully integrated approach involving trade, finance and security.
The Ghent European Council showed that the Union enjoys both the capacity, and the will, to provide an increased sense of European security, solid in support of American self-defence, and sharing in the campaign to combat terrorism.
This is a European Union increasingly active in its civilian role and far more present in the Middle East peace process.
For us to succeed, we need to put aside our petty squabbles and the interinstitutional rivalries.
The Commission and Council should reflect the impressive cross-party consensus that we have created in Parliament.
In that context I would like strongly to congratulate the Belgian presidency on brokering such a successful deal on the setting up of the convention.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of this House, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office was right to express with some pride that, fortunately, after Gothenburg and Genoa, Ghent was a different G.
We were able to catch our breath in peace for a while.
In fact, Ghent was a ghost town.
When I protested there along with the so-called anti-globalists, Ghent had been totally stripped of its character of a bustling city.
Nevertheless, I am pleased with your statement about the dialogue with the world of the anti-globalists, which is an incorrect way of saying that a growing number of people are concerned about the direction that the world is taking.
We want to move away from the privatisations and liberalisations which are plunging large parts of the world into de facto exclusion.
What action will the Belgian Presidency be taking in order to reform the WTO, for example?
We are looking forward to your efforts, for the introduction of the Tobin tax is a promise which I may have heard in Belgium, but of which I have seen little evidence on the international forum.
However, the spectacle involving the European institutions was not a pretty sight, and I am very disappointed about this.
The Council was overshadowed by the triumvirate of the United Kingdom, France and Germany.
Is that what other countries can expect from a Council?
The Big Three running the show - is that the kind of Europe we want?
The Commission is failing to get a grip on events and the frustration in that respect is culminating in a row about speaking times and the threat of an empty seat in Laeken.
Does the President of the Commission fear that Laeken will be a failure?
The European Parliament is still feeling marginalised, and I am uncertain as to whether a convention can have any real effect in this.
Many people have witnessed the start of the war in Afghanistan, but we do not know where it will take us or how it will end.
We are facing an economic crisis.
We cannot afford failure at Laeken.
Europe simply has to succeed, and the three large institutions must cooperate with that goal in mind.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, I have noted with satisfaction that preparations in Ghent for the Laeken Summit also included a debate on the complex subject of 'The Future of Europe' .
You, Prime Minister, announced that the Laeken statement on this theme would not be a classic statement but an ambitious one that would acknowledge the EU's weaknesses and its citizens' fears and would clearly point out the way to be taken by the enlarged EU in the world of the future.
I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will do everything possible to bring about a resolution in December that really will live up to this high aspiration.
In my judgment, there is an absolute need for the following to be taken into account when calling a Convention to prepare the next Inter-Governmental Conference: First, the balanced proportional composition of the Convention with representatives of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament analogous with the Convention to draft the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Secondly, members of the national parliaments and representatives of the acceding countries' governments must be involved to the full in the Convention's work and have at least observer status.
Thirdly, the composition of the Convention must ensure that the principle of political pluralism is guaranteed.
Political debates need arguments on both sides which alone ensure that the debates come alive and are interesting, and only if the most diverse political forces from the Member States really work together can a politically sustainable result be achieved which will then enjoy popular support.
Fourthly, there must be complete transparency in the Convention's work, both as regards the conduct of its debates and discussions and also public access to its documentation, which must be guaranteed by all means available.
There is, fifthly, a need for a purposeful and structured dialogue with civil society, and I hope that the Presidency's proposals in this regard will find support among the various governments.
Mr President, I must say that the Ghent Summit was very revealing, both in terms of the process and of the content.
It was revealing in the sense that it, to a fault, confirms the objections on grounds of principle which we Eurosceptics and opponents of the EU have been entertaining.
The very procedure is, of course, based upon its being the big countries that decide.
A secret summit is held in which an agenda is set, effectively preventing the small countries from independently making known their opinions of the political decisions, and that naturally applies first and foremost to the decisions made in the light of the events of 11 September.
Unconditional support is declared, a total acceptance of the United States' s arrangements.
In that way, the objections and reservations that are undoubtedly entertained among the small countries and that find expression in growing opposition to the American strategy are successfully stifled.
The summit' s reference to resolution 1368 is absurd.
As if it legitimised anything!
We are concerned here with a war of aggression contrary to international law.
