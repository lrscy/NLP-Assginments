I shall come back to that later.
We have taken an important initiative as regards the development of SMEs in the new, and also in the existing, Member States.
The third point is that we have to facilitate the integration of the new Member States with the existing ones as much as possible.
As has already been said several times in earlier debates, this 2004Â budget has a number of particular features.
We are to present a budget for 25Â countries now, when we all know that we shall not have a European Union of 25Â Member States until 1Â May next year.
Hence, we shall be voting in December on a budget for 15Â countries, with a technical annex for the ten new Member States.
We shall then vote on a supplementary budget for those ten new Member States during next year.
Another new feature of the 2004Â budget is activity-based budgeting.
We have discovered some more flaws in this, which we hope it will be possible to rectify in the course of this year.
Particularly important as far as Parliament is concerned is that we are able to look into the extent to which the programmes are being implemented and what kind of evaluation techniques are available.
By and large, we have voted in favour of an economical budget.
The payment appropriations have been increased, including other payment appropriations, but, on the whole, I think that this result is suitable for presentation, even at a time when the whole of Europe is economising.
I should like to say another thing about the various chapters of the budget; firstly, the agricultural budget, ChapterÂ 1.
We are of course awaiting the letter of amendment, which is due to be issued shortly.
We hope that Parliamentâs initiatives, which are reaffirmed in this budget and which were also put forward in earlier resolutions, will also appear in the Commissionâs letter of amendment, to be issued shortly: namely the pilot projects, or preparatory actions, regarding the environmental indicators, funding for animal diseases, the development of better vaccines and the development of a quality policy for agricultural products.
It will also undoubtedly become clear then what impact the more expensive euro has had on agricultural policy.
In addition, the Committee on Budgets has voted in favour of a number of further points: we want more research into animal welfare, and we want more alternatives to tobacco-growing in the EU, among other things.
As regards ChapterÂ 2, the Structural Funds, we have increased payment appropriations in line with the figure the Council considered reasonable.
We did this for two reasons.
Firstly, the Member States think that they can spend a great deal more than the Commission proposes each year, and we wanted to accommodate the Member States.
Secondly, we are concerned about the slow pace of implementation of structural policy.
We think that increasing the payment appropriations will enable us to make improvements there.
I hear you saying âIs it appropriate to increase the payment appropriations at this time?â
If we look at the amount of the increases in payment appropriations in previous years, I think that this is actually a very modest increase in comparison.
Regarding ChapterÂ 3, internal policies, we consider the promotion of SMEs in the new Member States to be the most important initiative.
It is possible to do this with a relatively small amount of money.
With EURÂ 33Â million more than in the Councilâs budget, and with an attendant multiplier effect of the order ofÂ 20Â toÂ 30, we can provide SMEs in Eastern Europe with a good deal more guarantees that they will be able to develop.
At the same time, we shall tag a training programme for bank managers on to it.
The chapter on internal policies contains another reduction in relation to the Commission, but an increase in relation to the Council, in respect of measures to be taken in connection with the ever increasing marine pollution.
There is the European Maritime Agency, which of course has to do its work, but we have found it necessary to limit the appropriations proposed by the Commission, since there is no legal basis as yet.
We hope that that will be put in place this year, however.
This year, we also paid a great deal of attention to the agencies.
More and more of these are appearing; and even newer ones are on their way.
We want better parliamentary control over these agencies.
This control over their work programme will be entrusted to the parliamentary committees, and even Parliament itself.
We also want to pay more attention to the organigram of the agencies, in the same way as we take an interest in the organigram of the Commission itself.
This is not a difficult thing to require of the agencies.
We hope that we shall be able to find a solution to this for the second reading.
A few more points need to be mentioned in connection with ChapterÂ 3.
In our opinion, the Council must take a decision as soon as possible regarding the seat of the agencies.
Great uncertainty will reign until this has been taken.
We believe that VAT fraud must be further investigated.
The Info-Points Europe are a matter of great concern for Parliament.
Owing to the new Financial Regulation, there is a possibility that some of these Info-Points will go bankrupt â will have to close their doors â and this whilst virtually everyone in Parliament is convinced that they play a very useful role.
Finally, we are all familiar with the Eurostat problems.
We have put 25%Â of the funds for Eurostat in the reserve pending the final report, which we anticipate towards the end of October.
There has also been a great deal of discussion on ChapterÂ 4: the external policies of the EU.
The situation in Iraq predominates here.
We are of the opinion that something must be done in Iraq.
We have entered a provision of EURÂ 30Â million in the budget, and we are aware that the Commission has proposed the sum of EURÂ 200Â million, EURÂ 40Â million of which, in all probability, will be paid out of the 2003 budget and EURÂ 160Â million of which out of the 2004Â budget, possibly using the flexibility instrument.
In addition, the Committee on Budgets has adopted an amendment that envisages making EURÂ 500Â million available for Iraq.
We shall be voting on this next Thursday.
The prevailing view is that, whichever programme is brought in for Iraq, it must not be at the expense of the existing programmes in ChapterÂ 4: namely Afghanistan, the fight against poverty and so on. We are also of the opinion that all the aid to Iraq must be given under the auspices of the United Nations.
A further point regarding the Common Foreign and Security Policy is that EURÂ 5Â million of the sum earmarked by the Council has been put in the reserve.
We want a vigorous dialogue with the Council about the agreement that we recently concluded regarding the provision of information.
We are aware that the Council may want a little more in this sphere.
We shall pay this due attention in Parliament, but, first and foremost, we think that, if agreements are concluded with the Council, they must be carried out faithfully.
We still have some doubts about this at the moment.
I should like to discuss one last point in connection with the budget, namely administrative expenditure.
The Commission requested additional staff, but this has only been half-honoured by the Council.
Parliament takes a different view.
First of all, we think that the Commission could well do with that staff, in principle.
Before we say a definitive âyesâ, however, we attach a number of conditions: the ones set out in the budgetary resolutions and in the resolution by Parliament itself.
I can give you some examples: the number of vacant posts in the Commission must not exceedÂ 4%, the new posts are to be allocated exclusively to citizens of the new Member States, the Commissioners must respect the code of conduct that they agreed at the beginning of their term of office â particularly with regard to âparachutageâ, as we always call itÂ â and, last but not least, the Commission must, in our opinion, give its full attention to the implementation of the budget.
That last point still leaves something to be desired, however, especially regarding the pilot projects and the preparatory actions.
We shall keep a close eye on this.
Finally, I should like to thank my fellow MEPs, the Council and the Commission on this occasion, too, for the pleasant cooperation I have enjoyed up to now.
I have tried to achieve a consensus as far as possible, as befits a rapporteur, and I hope that this cooperation may continue in future, too.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin where Mr Mulder left off by first thanking all my colleagues too.
I would particularly like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the staff for their support and their contributions.
I would especially like to thank the chairman, Mr Wynn, for his support.
This particular budget is for an historic year, 2004, which will see not only enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States, but also European elections.
My main aim for this budget has been to equip all the other institutions to meet the challenges of enlargement and to ensure proper functioning after accession takes place.
However, I have to admit to being somewhat disappointed that the economies of scale that I had hoped for as a result of enlargement have not been evident.
I believe that enlargement has been used in some cases as an excuse by some institutions to create posts for which there is little justification.
It is a pity, therefore, that the Council did not put sufficient emphasis on securing greater efficiencies.
As I have said before, the Council has been quite generous to all the institutions in its draft budget and, as a consequence, Parliament has had to correct this position.
I am pleased to say that my amendments, which were adopted, will lead to operational improvements and increased efficiency.
One of my objectives for this budget was to improve transparency and to achieve greater accountability.
In this vein, I am calling upon all the institutions to adopt measures which will lead to these objectives being fulfilled.
To do this, we need to ensure that their policies, procedures and systems are reviewed regularly, especially in relation to reimbursement of travel and subsistence allowances.
It appears to be an annual occurrence that one or other of the EU institutions is charged with wrongdoing or lack of control in relation to financial management.
It is therefore important that every institution ensures that it has best practice and sound financial management procedures in place.
When it comes to allowances, it is critical that there should be clearer rules governing reimbursement and action to be taken in cases of misdemeanour.
It is imperative, in the interest of the credibility of all the other institutions, that this be done and that all the institutions act now.
Furthermore, we need constantly to review our policies and management of systems to ensure that there is no scope for fraud, and I regret that we have not made the further progress we hoped for on the activity-based budgeting that the Commission adopted.
I believe that all the other institutions need to follow suit, to ensure greater transparency and accountability.
Let me give you just one example from Parliament.
I spent quite a lot of time pushing for this internally and I visited the Swedish Parliament to look at their system, where they have made a great deal of progress.
I have also looked into some of the smaller issues such as the car service for Members.
We have looked at numerous proposals from the administration, some of which would have been very cost-effective.
Yet unfortunately these proposals have had a very short life-span, because they were unacceptable to certain parties.
It is because of this lack of transparency and accountability that we have a situation where a majority of the Committee on Budgets was totally against a pilot scheme for a Members' car service.
The scheme proposed instead would reimburse Members an additional 50 euro a week for the cost of taxis.
This is complete nonsense, because we already have an adequate daily allowance to cover such costs.
However, I understand this is to go ahead despite the huge misgivings that I and many other Members have, because the Bureau has approved it.
It comes from a budget line that is underspent.
This sort of example of piecemeal decision-making does not really give a very good impression of Parliament and it is very damaging to the public standing of this House.
If we had more transparency and accountability, decisions like this would be avoided.
President, when I spoke in March, I expressed my reservations about the funding of political parties being included in Parliament's budget.
My concern was that we would leave ourselves open to allegations of feathering our nests and being seen to be looking after our own political interest.
These concerns appear to have been vindicated, since the funding of political parties has now been included in our budget and already the proposed amount has been increased from 4.2 to 8.4Â million as a result of Mr Watson's amendment.
Now there are moves to take this amount out of reserve and put it on the line, before we have a clear set of rules governing the deployment of these funds and a clear code of conduct.
Do not get me wrong.
We all want the European political parties to have the necessary means to function and to be independent of Parliament and the political groups.
I want to take this opportunity to remind colleagues that the principle behind the statute for political parties was to enhance transparency, something which appears to have been forgotten by some groups in this House.
They have tabled amendments that undermine this transparency and suggest that this money should be allocated unconditionally.
I would urge them to withdraw these proposals so that we can put a clear set of rules in place and make the statute operational.
Another controversial item, and one that has been raised here before, is the question of health insurance for former Members.
My position on this is quite clear.
I have said previously that I do not think it is a good use of taxpayers' money and I hope that the study that is undertaken will prove this point.
Now I just want to say a couple of words about some of the other amendments which have been tabled, beginning with the WTO.
I am extremely concerned about further extending Parliament's budget, which is meant to be purely for administrative purposes, to non-parliamentarians from other parts of the world.
What this amendment is proposing is to extend funding from Parliament's budget to other participants at the WTO.
We already have this line in the Commission's budget and, while I appreciate that there are administrative problems in obtaining some money from Parliament's budget and some from the Commission's, I do not think that is any reason to move it all together.
I think it is right that it should stay in the Commission's budget.
We just need to deal with whatever glitches and hitches appear in the budget.
At the end of the day it would be quite cumbersome for Parliament to take it all on board, as this would also have internal implications for staffing and so on.
With regard to the EPP amendment putting Council salaries into reserve, I think it is very regrettable that we have this proposal in front of us, I would like to remind Members that we have a 'gentleman's agreement' saying that we do not interfere with each other's budget.
I do not really understand the motive or purpose of the proposal and I have heard no arguments or rationale in support of it.
I do not find it very helpful at this late stage to put forward something like this and I would like to know more about why it is proposed to put this money in reserve.
Finally, on the amendment on bicycles from MrsÂ Buitenweg, given what I have said about cars, I am all in favour and I think we should all get on our bikes now.
Anyway, to conclude, can I say that one of our fundamental aims has been to bring ourselves closer to citizens.
Can I say that I am extremely frustrated at the pace of progress with our information and communication policy.
And I am even more frustrated at the Commission's efforts, which may result, I understand, in closure of many of the Infopoints.
In my region of the West Midlands the ordinary person really has no idea of what we are doing in this House.
We need to do more to make citizens aware of our work, to increase their interest in it and to increase their participation.
Â Â  .
Mr President, honourable Members, around this time next year, the European Parliament, having been elected by the people of twenty-five European states, will discuss the first budget of the enlarged Union.
The debate will be conducted in twenty languages.
Parliament will then have 732 Members, and it will be the last budget to be prepared by the Prodi Commission, which will by then comprise 30 members.
The discussion of the 2005 budget could coincide with the debates on the financial programming for the period after 2006.
At the same time, the Member States will probably be ratifying the new Constitutional Treaty in accordance with their respective internal procedures.
The draft general budget before you today reflects the enormity of this challenge.
The budget has been drawn up for a fifteen-member EU for the first four months of 2004 and for an EU with twenty-five members from 1Â May onwards.
Moreover, it is presented in a new form, based on the principle of activity-based budgeting, which enables us to discern the precise cost of the various Community policies.
Under the present parliamentary proposal, the budget for 2004 would allow for financial commitments amounting to EURÂ 112.3Â billion, as against the figure of EURÂ 111.9Â billion set by the Council and the EURÂ 112.2 billion proposed by the Commission.
So we are not actually dealing with very wide divergences.
Of the aforementioned amounts, a sum of EURÂ 12Â billion is to be earmarked for the ten new Member States.
Of the commitment appropriations made in the 2004 budget, 79% cover the domains of agricultural policy, including support for rural areas, and of the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund.
This represents a 13% increase on this yearâs allocation to these subsections.
Since the allocation to the Structural Funds is laid down in the financial programming for the 15-member EU and in the Accession Treaty for the new Member States, there are no differences between the Council, Parliament and the Commission with regard to the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund.
In the domain of support for rural areas, however, you will be voting on Thursday to determine whether you propose that the amount laid down in the financial programming should be exceeded.
I agree with the rapporteur that the Interinstitutional Agreement should be preserved.
As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, the Commission will present its customary amending letter at the end of the month to take account of the latest market trends.
I do not intend to anticipate the content of that letter, since it still has to be confirmed by the Commission, but I can indicate that most of the proposals made by the rapporteur, MrÂ Mulder, which have been the subject of intensive discussion, will be adopted, particularly the proposals that additional funds be allocated to finance a study examining whether and how farmers throughout Europe could be at least partly insured against losses arising from epizootic diseases and that funds be earmarked for the production of environmental indicators, which are playing an increasingly important role, as you know, in the context of the agricultural reform process, and for examination of the possibility of introducing a European quality label.
Scope is provided for more intensive research into marker vaccines against epizootic diseases within the resources allocated in the preliminary draft budget.
MrÂ Mulder, you have convinced the Commission of the soundness of your proposals.
I am confident that you will succeed in convincing the Council too.
I should certainly like to add my own plea to the Council not to reject these proposals out of hand simply because they relate to compulsory expenditure.
There would be no substantive justification for such rejection, nor would it be consistent with the prevailing spirit of constructive cooperation.
On behalf of the Commission, I can certainly welcome wholeheartedly the restoration by Parliament of the 272 new posts requested by the Commission for enlargement-related tasks, which the Council had deleted from the establishment plan.
On this point may I address a special word of thanks not only to the rapporteur but also to Mrs Gill and to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
You will initially enter these posts in the reserve, which I, naturally, see as less than ideal, but I can assure you that I shall do everything in my power to meet the prescribed requirements so that the funding for these posts can be released at the second reading.
With regard to the administrative appropriations in the budget, I should like to deal with two more points.
The first of these concerns contributions to European political parties, to which MrsÂ Gill has just referred.
This expenditure will be included in the EU budget for the first time, now that the legal basis for its inclusion has, I am glad to say, finally been adopted.
I believe that a good and transparent arrangement has been devised, but I am naturally critical of the statement that this expenditure is to be financed outside Parliamentâs 20% share of the appropriation for administrative expenditure.
The Commission, needless to say, will be willing to negotiate in order to find a solution that is acceptable to all parties.
My second point concerns the new Financial Regulation.
This successful product of our joint reforming activity entails many changes.
These changes are reflected in the new division of the budget into policy areas, and associated with this is another new rule, whereby financial assistance in the form of grants from the EU budget to institutions, such as the Institute in Florence, to name but one, requires a legal basis.
This means that it is no longer enough for these amounts to be entered in the budget; instead, there must be a legal basis for the authorisation of such grants, and they are also subject to the new conditions laid down in the Financial Regulation, which lays special emphasis on the need for transparent decision-making.
Parliament has made painstaking efforts to discuss the Commissionâs proposals on the budget headings under chapter A-30, which have been on the table since May.
In the case of the Council, however, progress has been anything but satisfactory, and I wish to take this opportunity to appeal once again to the Council to make every effort to ensure that, at the next trilogue session, we are able to foresee when the relevant legislation can be adopted.
I ask the Council to approach the implementation of the Financial Regulation with the same enthusiasm that it invested in its reformulation.
As was the case last year, the Commission will inform Parliament in writing, in the first half of November, of its assessment of the feasibility of your proposed measures, especially the new pilot projects and preparatory measures.
I shall ensure that due consideration is given in this assessment to the importance that your House attaches to these activities.
There is another important respect in which conditions are set fair for the budget of the European Union, namely the fact that the budgetary authority is due to take a joint decision in November on the adjustment of the various support programmes, the so-called internal policies, in preparation for enlargement.
There are, of course, very many important programmes â the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the YOUTH programme and the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE), to name but a few.
May I express my gratitude to MrÂ BÃ¶ge and MrÂ Colom i Naval for their efforts to coordinate the work of all the specialised committees, and I am naturally delighted that we agree with so many of their proposals.
This close cooperation is another reason why I can truly say that it has been a great pleasure to work with you on the preparation of the budget for the enlarged Union.
With regard to foreign aid, we face a new challenge in the 2004 budget in that it is our duty and our desire to make European aid available to the people of Iraq.
We have spent EUR 100 million on humanitarian aid this year.
Now it is a matter of playing our part in the reconstruction effort.
We have addressed this point in our committees and in the trilogue framework, and it has also been discussed by the General Affairs Council.
The Commission is proposing a further injection of EUR 200 million between now and the end of next year, over and above our humanitarian aid.
But this aid cannot actually be disbursed unless the security situation improves, and the umbrella of the United Nations must be available for the implementation of projects.
There are still various different opinions in this House on the appropriate amount of aid for Iraq.
The Commissionâs proposal has been carefully weighed up, and I should like to remind you that you are due to vote on this matter on Thursday, the day before the donorsâ conference in Madrid.
For this reason, I urge you, on behalf of the Commission and particularly on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Patten, to give the Commission a clear mandate by signalling that the European Union speaks with one voice on this issue.
Let me close with a few figures on the volume of next yearâs general budget.
The Commission had proposed expenditure of EURÂ 100.6Â billion, the Council has proposed EUR 100.1Â billion, and you, in Parliament, will probably propose a volume of EURÂ 103.5 billion.
The European expenditure-to-GDP ratio in this domain would therefore lie somewhere between 0.09% and 1.01%.
There has never been so little divergence between our proposals in recent years, and I am certain that we shall iron out these small differences in the course of the budgetary procedure.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to state the position of my group on the MulderÂ report concerning the draft general budget for the financial year 2004.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his hard work to achieve a consensus.
The latter is always difficult to reach at first reading when all the parties involved are intent on promoting their own priorities.
The rapporteur has done a good job.
The draft now before us is supported by most of the House.
My group endorses the draft presented today.
We believe it is in line with the key tenets of our strategic position.
It seems a moderate approach to the increase of payment appropriations has emerged from first reading.
Account is taken of Member Statesâ need to comply with the Stability Pact and the requirement to absorb the balance.
Account is also taken of requests by observers from future Member States.
They would like an increase in payments, in line with the sums agreed at Copenhagen.
Nonetheless, these modest figures for the increase of payment appropriations should become a threshold for Parliament.
In principle, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not envisage further negotiations on subsequent reductions by the Council between now and second reading and conciliation.
As regards the MulderÂ report, however, we retain the amendments consequent upon our groupâs position.
Firstly, there is the reference to the financial perspective after 2006.
We can agree to an internal debate on this subject being launched by the current Commission, although we believe it is far too early for such a debate to be leading to decisions on the subject.
Once the new Parliament and Commission come into being in 2004 it should fall to them to take the decisions.
We call for provisions to this effect to be included in the resolution.
Concerning the debate on the former A-30 lines, my group is very concerned that failure to reach agreement within the Council could delay adoption of the new legal bases.
A Council proposal for conciliation on 24Â November is required.
Should the aforementioned agreement be delayed, there might be unfortunate consequences for organisations currently receiving subsidies from the Union.
There needs to be some means of putting pressure on the Council.
We are therefore retaining our amendment regarding the basic remuneration of the Councilâs staff.
I refer to the EUR 1Â million in reserve.
The rapporteur, MrsÂ Gill, is aware of all this.
In addition, we call for the reference in the resolution to be stricter and more specific.
Turning to HeadingÂ 4, all the groups have reached a most satisfactory agreement to safeguard the European Parliamentâs priorities concerning geographical areas.
The Commissionâs preliminary draft proposal was inadequate.
It contained two interrelated problems.
Firstly, it distorted the very structure of the budget, creating an unrealistic margin.
Decisions on allocations for the Union's external action cannot be taken solely on the basis of accounting criteria or criteria for budget implementation.
The credits approved amount to political signals sent out by the Union to third countries.
Secondly, the Councilâs first reading took place on the basis of the figures in the preliminary draft proposal.
Credits were further reduced, as if that were feasible.
The wrong political signals were sent out, and no account taken of the European Parliamentâs traditional priorities.
I should emphasise that this House is sovereign.
It is responsible and well able to reconcile political priorities with desirable levels of implementation.
Thursdayâs vote will be on a real margin, not on a virtual one.
Lastly, I am sure the amendment will deal with the following issue, and that other speakers will speak on it at greater length and more eloquently.
I simply wished to ask honourableÂ Members to consider whether in the light of the UnitedÂ Nations resolution, the Union should actually offer to the DonorsÂ Conference that scant sum proposed by the Commission and agreed by the Council.
In such a scenario, what would become of the Unionâs political initiative if the only amendment tabled is rejected?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me thank both the rapporteurs for the work they have done this year.
I believe that we have been able to incorporate in this Budget a number of things that not only consolidate what we already have, and make clear where our priorities lie, but also make it abundantly clear that, whilst retaining what has stood the test of time, we also want to demonstrate a flexible approach to the tasks with which the future will present us.
Let me give as an example our desire to use more funds for the prevention of crises rather than for trouble-shooting.
We want to combat the VAT fraud in Europe, so that the European Unionâs receipts can be improved, and so that we do not have to extract from taxpayers money that other people should be honest enough to pay.
Fraud stands at a high level, and that is something we want to combat.
There is consensus on the need for us to take action to deal with it.
We are preparing the European Union for demographic change and for the demands that this will bring with it; at any rate, we have taken this as our theme, and we want more and improved cooperation in the war on organised crime.
This Budget reflects our desire to strengthen and support Eurojust and Europol.
This European Union of ours will continue in future to be characterised by small and medium-sized enterprises, which, as they give life to the economy, we want to support and enable them to enjoy the advantages of the internal market and use them to the utmost.
We will orient this Budget as far as possible towards savings.
What this means is that our group has looked closely at the various areas with an eye to ensuring that what is demanded of the Member States â which are themselves currently having problems with their budgets â is nothing more than is unavoidable and necessary.
We will stick to that line in each of the various categories, as it is clear to us that the multiannual financial framework that we have laid down following negotiations with the Council is not merely optional, but a fixed point of reference, and it sets the bounds within which we want to manoeuvre.
In category 1B, then, we will not be advocating that the upper limits be exceeded, nor will we vote for it.
All those in this House who want to do that must know that this resolution may well be only at first reading stage â and so it can be said that it does not count, as the counting is done at the end â but it does indicate whether or not we want to keep to the upper limits in this area.
We will not, in any case give our support to any attempt to exceed the upper limits.
In other areas, too, we want to ensure the targeted use of the money at our disposal, but also that we keep to what we have promised.
We will make available the staff that enlargement requires.
We will adjust the multiannual programmes in order that nothing of what they contain should be lost.
We will also make sure that the Structural Funds contain sufficient payment appropriations for the candidate countries, to whom it will have to be made plain that this means that, next year or right through the period we have negotiated with them, they will get not one euro extra; there is only the possibility of certain obligations being discharged earlier.
We will call for payments from the Structural Funds to be increased, for we believe that the existing backlog in payments must not be tolerated.
We have to ensure that what has been announced and promised is actually kept to, and that we actually do whatever we can to help support the regions.
We will therefore be asking for additional funding, which is also what the members of the Council, the individual Member States, will say that they want when asked individually.
As soon as the Council meets as a body, it always has a problem with making sufficient funding available.
So, although we will be calling for additional funding, that will â as you have said yourself â of course remain within the bounds of what is necessary.
Commissioner Schreyer has said that there has never before been such a small difference between your and our proposals.
The biggest problem is with category 4.
As Mr Garriga Polledo has said, we have seen to it that our traditional areas are maintained, but this House has before it an amendment on aid for Iraq, in which EURÂ 500 million are asked for â EURÂ 500 million, even though we know from the most diverse published sources, especially the Commissionâs own, that it will not in any way be possible to properly administer these EURÂ 500 million in Iraq next year.
No administrative structures are in place, and there is nobody on the ground who can put the money to proper use.
Even though there are no projects to which the money is to be allocated, this figure of EURÂ 500 million has been put before us, and a majority in the Committee on Budgets has even adopted it.
To those who tabled this amendment, I say that, just as involvement in the war in Iraq split the European Union, so their amendment divides this House.
They are not interested in a joint solution; rather, they want the EURÂ 500 million to serve as a warning that we could use it now, and want to be congratulated on doing so.
The money must, however, be properly applied, as we have to demand it of our taxpayers, who know that it must also be found within the framework of the Financial Perspective, and that the framework of the Financial Perspective will not come up with the money.
They are urging that the Financial Perspective be cancelled.
That we will not do under any circumstances.
We will be in favour of sufficient funding being made available, in which respect the Commission proposal is a very good one that deserves to be taken seriously, and we unreservedly endorse it.
We will insist that these funds be used in accordance with a UN mandate.
We will support Commissioner Patten in his line, we will see to it that the debate on how the money is to be spent focuses on helping people to help themselves, for Iraq must get help, but we have had to help others in the past.
Afghanistan did not get more than this; it got less.
Iraq has the potential to be a rich country.
Giving it more than we gave Afghanistan would be criminal; it would be to treat with disdain the other regions of the world that we supported in the past.
Under no circumstances will a single vote of ours support this amendment.
Â Â  â Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the budget, MrsÂ Neena Gill and MrÂ Jan Mulder, for their excellent and constructive work.
My group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is proud that Mr Jan Mulder, who is one of our members, is general rapporteur.
For that we particularly want to thank the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, with whom we reached political agreement on the matter at the start of this parliamentary term.
I likewise want to say how highly I regard the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, MrÂ Terence Wynn, and the Budgets Commissioner, Michaele Schreyer, for their friendly and expert cooperation.
Next yearâs is a historic budget, because for the first time it is being drafted for a Union of 25 Member States.
Formally it is being made legally binding on 15 Member States, but politically the budget is to be agreed this year to apply to a Union of 25 Member States.
Secondly, the budget has been drawn up as an activity-based budget. This is something the ELDR Group has been consistently calling for for a long time now.
In this way we can monitor with greater accuracy the costs associated with different policy areas, how administrative expenditure relates to operational expenditure, as well as general efficiency.
This is a big reform, which at the same time emphasises the importance of personal accountability, and it will create a basis for later activity-based management in the Commission.
The proposal in the wake of the debate by the Committee on Budgets contains many important areas of focus.
I would like to mention a few of them.
With regard to agriculture, the committee gave export aid for live cattle its own separate budget heading. This means we will be in a better position to monitor this controversial activity.
I think the budget heading under which appropriations are being earmarked for the development of marker vaccines is especially important.
Up till now the European Union has worked on the principle that, for example, animals should not be vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease, as this way one cannot tell whether immunity is due to the infection spreading the disease or the vaccines.
It is clear, however, that vaccines also have to be used to achieve lasting prevention of animal diseases.
Appropriations for rural development exceed the finance ceiling.
Our group cannot support this amendment proposed by the PSE Group, as it does not accord with good administration.
It is furthermore questionable whether these funds could be used because equivalent regulations on the subject of finance are already in force.
We think it inevitable that Structural Funds payment appropriations will have to be adequately increased, to prevent outstanding commitments, or RALs, from growing out of control, as they have up till now.
The biggest problem with the draft budget concerns the reconstruction of Iraq.
Our group cannot support the proposal by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to spend EUR 500 million on assisting the reconstruction of Iraq.
Instead, we are prepared to support extra financing of around EUR 200 million in addition to the EUR 100 million granted in humanitarian aid.
It is our opinion, however, that the main share of this â EUR 100 million approximately â should be financed out of the flexibility instrument, as otherwise Parliamentâs priorities would run into trouble.
There is an argument within Parliament over aid relief earmarked for organisations and bodies.
The ELDR Group strongly favours doing away with it as it is in contravention of the current Financial Regulation.
At the end of the day, it is a sort of favouritism.
In our opinion, the European Parliament is not a committee or an agency that deals with applications for assistance or grants.
That is why we should abandon this system.
With these observations we support the reports by MrÂ Mulder and MrsÂ Gill.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I have followed the work of the budget rapporteurs, Mr Jan Mulder and Mrs Neena Gill, carefully on behalf of my group.
I want to thank them for their diligence and the transparent way in which they have worked, even though our conclusions for next yearâs budget are not the same in all respects.
Our group would have liked MrÂ Mulder to meet us halfway in Category 4 of the budget so that our proposal for appropriations for Palestine and East Timor could have been adopted.
The serious problems of the Middle East have had too little attention paid to them in the debate on next yearâs budget.
Not everybody in our group likes MrsÂ Gillâs proposal to take an appropriation from the budget to start support for European political parties using Parliamentâs funds.
Many in our group feel that support for European parties will only restrict democracy, not increase it.
That way the big parties in the big countries could subjugate the small parties in the small countries.
I would focus your attention on the fact that the Council deleted the clause in the regulations governing the parties which said that a European party could not provide funds for national parties in national elections.
Now it can, and this means European taxpayersâ money will be spent on national election propaganda.
On the other hand, we support the ideas put forward by MrsÂ Gill on the committee regarding how necessary it is to make the work of the European Parliament more efficient.
For example, the excess on the allowances for Parliamentâs car service this year must be looked into carefully, and next year we cannot introduce a new system for claiming expenses for the use of taxis without a decision made in plenary.
We also have to make a determined effort to endorse the Membersâ Statute, so that we can do away with a system that allows travel expenses to be claimed for no clear reason.
Most of all our group criticises the EUR 500 million appropriation in next yearâs budget for the reconstruction of Iraq passed in the committee by a vote by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
That is not solidarity aid for Iraq, but for the United States of America.
The Right in Europe seems to be lying prostrate before the United States.
It wants to share in the costs of the US oil war in a way that greatly exceeds the need for aid set at EUR 200 million, as proposed by the Commission.
By this means, the Right wants to use tax revenue from the citizens of the EU to support Americaâs illegal war, Americaâs illegal occupation and the puppet government America has set up in Iraq.
Our group is prepared to discuss the Commissionâs proposals to assist Iraq, but we reject the PPE-DE Groupâs political gesture to President Bush and his war coalition.
Other representatives of our group will adopt a position on problems relating to the Structural Funds in their speeches.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to start by addressing the rapporteurs on behalf of my group.
My compliments to Mrs Neena Gill, who has succeeded in placing the emphasis in the budget and in the resolution on value for money.
I know how important it is for her and I share her vision in this.
Likewise Mr Jan Mulder, who in the Netherlands would by no means be my natural ally, I should like to thank very much for the flexible cooperation we have had and the openness he has shown towards our proposals.
Of course, I am prone to consider this a sign of openness and rationality, for the very reason that a great number of our proposals have actually been adopted.
For this I thank him.
I would however like to concentrate on a number of difficulties, because some do still remain.
On Thursday we are voting on the budget.
This is quite specifically about what we do and do not want to spend tax money on.
But the PPE seems above all to want to play symbol politics, I really cannot interpret their proposal for 500Â million for Iraq in any other way.
The European Commission has investigated how much money the European Union can effectively set aside in Iraq.
It was EUR 160 million for next year, not counting humanitarian aid.
This does of course seem miserly compared with the billions from the United States.
But Bushâs cheque also covers the troops on the spot and investments for companies.
In its assessment for the absorption capacity the Commission expressly looked at the security situation in Iraq.
All kinds of PPE pipe dreams are involved here.
Because the more than tripling of the amount that the Commission is proposing must above all be a signal that the US has the situation under control, that things are really going fine in Iraq.
But for the time being it is above all also a signal that the PPE is not really concerned about spending of tax money carefully.
This big-heartedness stands out starkly against the PPEâs plans for Afghanistan.
Because this is a country that is poorer than Iraq and with considerably fewer development opportunities.
Here the PPE suddenly makes all kinds of new requirements for the spending of the money that are completely impractical.
That you know.
But the Afghans will be receiving as much as EUR 35 million less if the Commission fails to curb the drugs trade and to bring about a changeover to the cultivation of other crops.
What is interesting is that the PPE, which usually harbours a somewhat natural suspicion of the European Commission, is now suddenly convinced that the European Commission can succeed where the United States has failed with the war on drugs in other countries.
So here too we have an instance above all of symbol politics, but in this case with potentially dangerous consequences.
The Greens are also sometimes criticised for playing symbol politics.
I am talking for instance about our amendment with regard to the financing of the structural funds to say explicitly that no European money may be spent on projects that are inconsistent with European directives such as the Habitat Directive or the Birds Directive.
Superfluous, the Committee on Budgets decided almost unanimously, because it is logical that you do not use tax money to contravene laws â and that I find logical too.
Were it not that I can give you a whole list of projects in which in some cases even the court has judged that they violate European directives.
I will just mention a few of the projects that receive money from the structural funds: the dam over the Odelouca River in the Algarve in Portugal, the Alqueva dam in Portugal, the RÃŒcken bridge project in Germany, the Ebro basin in Spain, the Boyne estuary in Northeastern Ireland.
In the last five years 529 breaches of European environmental legislation have been recorded.
Let us in any event ensure that this is not happening with European tax money!
A moment ago, rapporteur Gill gave her support to my amendment for a few bicycles, so that parliamentarians can cover short distances cheaply and sustainably.
This led to great hilarity, which to some extent is perfectly understandable.
But of course you are not under any obligation to cycle.
As I would refuse to throw away those EUR 50 a week, which come on top of our generous daily allowance, on a taxi ride, you do not have to get on your bike.
But do give those who want to the chance to do so!
I said yesterday in the Committee on Budgets that in return for the support of this House for this amendment I would be glad to take the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets on the back for a test ride.
I should hereby like to repeat this promise in public.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the Commission, MrÂ Wynn and the Secretariat staff, excellently led, as always, by MrÂ deÂ Feo.
This budget, ladies and gentlemen, with which the Europe of 15 comes to an end, is historic because it brings us, at last, to a Europe of 25; furthermore, it can be seen as a pre-election campaign budget.
The solutions that we found apply to everything and everyone.
What I am concerned about in this case is what happens next, what I am concerned about is definitely the accession of ten countries.
How will we cope afterwards?
We must start thinking about this today, endeavouring to revise the Financial Perspective, endeavouring to inject new resources, endeavouring to thoroughly revise our procedure, because there will, inevitably, be some complications when there are 25 of us debating matters rather than 15: we need to start today, now, and not when we find ourselves in a state of emergency or urgency.
I want to stress this point because we could have serious problems, irrespective of the political line-up.
There are three things I would like to focus on.
Firstly, Iraq.
There is a huge debate on the proposed amendment, but I do not see why there should be outrage.
We have provided over EUR 1 billion for Palestine, we have provided over EUR 1 billion for the Balkans, we have also provided a lot of money, EUR 1 billion, for Afghanistan.
I do not believe that appropriating EURÂ 200 million, and then asking the day after to increase this figure to EURÂ 500 million, is outrageous, unless we want to treat international crises differently according to our political assessments, which would not affect us politically but would affect the people in question.
Secondly, I would certainly like to focus on investment in the TENs, which is important and which we must try to support because it means development and jobs.
I would, therefore, like to thank you for supporting this amendment, but I would call, at this point, for even more resources to try to make TENs become a political instrument across Europe and not just a technical decision.
Thirdly, one of the amendments tabled is extremely important, and I would ask all the political groups to take notice of it: an amendment regarding the accommodation centre for disabled officials, the centre.
We are going to vote for the amendment and I would ask everyone to raise awareness on this matter.
We will be proud of it and we will do ourselves credit, both now and in the future.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
To begin with some remarks about Chapter 4, the central discussion point.
The Commissionâs proposal to move support to Turkey from Chapter 4 to Chapter 7, pre-accession support, is of course premature.
That country is not after all a candidate Member State with a concrete prospect of accession.
Then the support for the reconstruction of Iraq.
We find it embarrassing that members from the left in particular are unwilling to go beyond EUR 200 million.
This is a mere pittance compared to the EUR 1.5 billion that Japan is voting and the 22 billion that the United States is setting aside on top of the expenditure that it has already incurred for the liberation of that country.
The amendment by Mr Wurtz and others is nothing less than a slap in the face of every Iraqi who suffered for years under the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, the bloodhound who was openly acclaimed by Arafat and many Palestinians even after the extent of his atrocities had become known.
Besides, Arafat channelled hundreds of millions into secret accounts.
As long as that money goes to help terrorism we cannot tell our voters that the European Union is still the main sponsor of the Palestinian authority.
As far as the Gill report is concerned, we agree with MrÂ Walterâs Amendment No 1.
He rightly points to the need to coordinate the support of multilingualism, both here and in the other institutions, with actual need.
The culture surrounding travelling and meeting expense claims at the Committee of the Regions continues to concern us greatly.
The internal auditor must have sufficient assistance to do his job adequately.
Finally, we ask the Council to honour the modest requests of the Court of Auditors in full.
Prevention of new frauds requires not only sound financial management but also strong external control.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen â I cannot address the Council since it is represented only by very worthy officials, but I hope the absence of the Presidency is a good sign, meaning that the Council agrees with the provisions which Parliament is about to adopt and that we shall have an uncontroversial and therefore very simple second reading.
I, too, should like to thank both rapporteurs for their work and acknowledge all those who have taken part in this collective effort.
Mr Mulder deserves thanks for having, in particular, pointed out that this yearly exercise of ours is in danger of being reduced to political fiction, a string of good intentions and good proposals.
We have become merely an expensive NGO, allowing ourselves to amend and comment on the budget and make recommendations which are then invariably not implemented.
One just has to look at the billions of euro that we return to the Member States every year; regrettably, one just has to look at the total outstanding commitments.
I have taken note of Commissioner Schreyerâs commitment to give us a practical answer right away, so that the 2004 financial year may be an historic one in this respect too, in other words so that there may, at last, be some similarity between what the budgetary authorities decide and what is then actually implemented with regard to the 2004 budget.
Out of the great many positive and negative points to underline, I should like to focus on the question of the amendment on Iraq.
Mr Walter has told us that his group, and he himself, do not intend to support this amendment.
In addition, we have read in the newspapers that the German Government will not even be represented in Madrid, as, indeed, it was not at the European Council meeting.
This is starting to become a habit; I do not know whether it will be represented by France there too.
There is, however, no doubt that, in view of the Security Council resolution and the new phase that is beginning, we now have the problem that Europeâs response is still the same as before the Security Council resolution, which â I repeat â is ushering in a new phase in which all the political groupings, or many of them at least, even the hostile ones, have modified their positions.
I believe that we cannot stand still and send Commissioner Schreyer to the Conference with this tiny and, quite frankly, laughable sum for what I consider an important proposal, which, although it will wreck the Financial Perspective, is, at least, an attempt to achieve unity and a common policy, requiring support from the budget.
That is why we shall support that amendment.
Lastly, on the Gill report, I should like to underline what the rapporteur has said about the need to provide the citizens with more information, an area on which we are delighted to agree.
I thank the rapporteur for having accepted this amendment aimed at strengthening the on-line information policy and arranging for all our debates to be transmitted to the citizens over the Internet from next year.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to raise two amendments that were tabled by the PPE-DE Group but rejected in committee, which we have retabled for the plenary.
The first has been mentioned several times already today, and that is contributions to European political parties.
Here most of the items our group wanted were included in the final version of the paragraph, except that there is a reserve against the whole amount.
We want to see that reserve lifted.
We would point out that far from there allegedly being no code of conduct, there will certainly be measures to secure separation between types of expenditure â between information and political expenditure â and a code of conduct on the use of appropriations entered under this heading.
We want to see that reserve lifted.
It is evident that there will be no spending before June of next year, that is until after the elections take place.
And we should trust in the good faith of people in the political parties in the European Parliament.
The second item is the very small item of EUR 37 000, which relates to the creation of an A7 post in the Commission office in Washington.
Again this afternoon we have heard several speakers who really are not particularly in favour of good relations between the European Parliament and the US Administration.
This small investment will pay off extremely handsomely in terms of two-way cooperation and understanding, and I would urge that the majority of only one vote in committee should be overturned by a successful vote in plenary.
The third point is not contentious.
I urge the PPE-DE Group, as shadow rapporteur on the Gill report, to support the amendment tabled by Mr Walter, on behalf of the Socialist Group.
This relates to the need for the verbatim proceedings to be looked at carefully again.
First of all, I applaud the very speedy and accurate work done by Parliament's staff in producing verbatim versions of speeches in this Chamber.
These are translated into the main languages within a few days, but it is unrealistic to expect that full verbatim translations should be produced in all the languages of the enlarged European Union.
We need to achieve better value for money and to tailor the scarce interpretation and translation skills to best advantage.
Individual requests, as called for in the amendment for particular needs, must surely be the way forward.
The European Union needs to use the latest technology available to meet these needs.
I appreciate that there will have to be an authorisation and monitoring system, but this will show the real needs of people and deliver the flexibility we should aim for.
In this way we will be responding to the wishes of European citizens, instead of producing mountains of paperwork that destroy forests and also stand the chance of not being read.
My final two points are again on the language items, firstly regarding full controlled multilingualism.
In Amendment No 4 we are calling for the adoption of specific measures by the Bureau and 'the evaluation of the report by the Committee on Budgets on the basis of a working document drafted by its rapporteur'.
This is a very important matter.
It would involve the Language Centre in Luxembourg and a greater focus on teleworking.
My final point concerns taking account of the extended multilingualism of the new Parliament.
We need to make sure that we have proper, concrete measures introduced to help the accession countries find their way around more easily than we were able to a few years ago.
Â Â  Mr President, in the light of some of the matters that have been discussed in this debate, I have to keep reminding myself that this is the first reading.
One of the problems is that the debate is concentrating on what we have voted in committee already and what we may well vote in plenary on Thursday.
The final outcome may be the same; then again it could be different in certain areas, such as category 1(b), where in committee we voted for a figure above the EUR 83 million margin for the less favoured areas.
My friend and colleague, Mr Walter, has made the point that there may be a change in the vote of his particular Group, in which case there would not be a qualified majority and therefore the problem would be solved.
However, if it did secure a qualified majority, let us not forget that this is the first reading and the question could be resolved in due course.
Much has been said about the one issue that is dominating category 4: namely, what is to be done about the funding of Iraq.
Whether we adopt or reject the amendment for EUR 500 million, let us not forget that â as I keep saying â it is still the first reading.
On the issue of Iraq, it is also worth mentioning that the Council for the first time has invited Mr Brok and myself to go to Madrid for the donors' conference, an extremely generous and welcome offer.
Unfortunately, neither of us can go, but we will be replaced by Baroness Nicholson from the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Mrs Jensen from the Committee on Budgets, so we will at least be represented.
As Chairman, it is my job to respect the committee's position, not to oppose it.
I realise that I am the servant of the committee and I try to reflect what we have voted.
Then again, after the vote in the plenary, it is my job also to reflect that position.
When it comes to the EUR 500 million, there is confusion in my mind.
I know what we voted, but I also know what has been said.
For instance, when Commissioner Patten addressed the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets â MrsÂ Schreyer sent her apologies, she was at another meeting at the same time â he made it clear that EUR 200 million was, in the Commission's opinion, the maximum that could be utilised, based on the assessment of needs.
At the Brussels summit last week, which I followed with great interest, not one Member State asked for any amount above the EUR 200 million.
When Commissioner Patten made his proposals, he made the point that this was the figure he would be taking to Madrid for the donors' conference.
I also heard this morning â whether it is true I do not know â that the US congress had rejected President Bush's amount for aid for Iraq.
They have cut it in half, saying that half the amount could be provided as grants, but the other half would have to be in the form of loans.
This information needs to be checked, but it is what I was told this morning.
If we do not vote the EUR 500 million, and EUR 200 million is the final figure that the Commission settles upon, Commissioner Patten has also said that should that funding be spent rapidly and efficiently, then the Commission would come back with a supplementary and amending budget.
I would ask Mrs Schreyer if she can confirm that.
It is essential to know â before the vote on Thursday â whether, if the EUR 200 million is agreed by Parliament and then spent quickly, the Commission will come back and provide more money next year, based on needs.
Let us not forget that if the EUR 500 million is rejected then our position is EUR 30 million.
Then, of course, we would have to look at the proposal for the EUR 200 million and I would hope that, if the EUR 500 million is rejected, we do not decide that EUR 30 million is the amount to which we are totally committed.
I would hope that all the political groups opt for the maximum of EUR 200 million, albeit spread over two years.
Let us not forget that a codecision agreement is still needed and that the Council will also have to agree to that figure.
Then comes the hard bargaining during conciliation as to where the money will come from.
If we are naive enough to believe that it will all come from flexibility, then we will have some long nights in conciliation when the matter has to be negotiated.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as several people have said, this year is of course the first time that we are working with a budget designed to be activity-based, the idea being that the budget should be far better at reflecting the political priorities and that it should also be easier to see where we are investing our money.
I think, however, that we are failing fully to notice the improvement this year, because, as has been seen from todayâs debate, we still of course have the budget divided up into areas of expenditure and we still have to keep within the fixed limits for these areas of expenditure.
This means that the budget work is still a very technical exercise in which it is easy to lose sight of the political choices.
I hope that, as you, Commissioner, have suggested it will, the situation will improve in the future.
It is of course important, among other things, that we see the agenciesâ â the decentralised agenciesâ â budgets in the context of the political priorities.
It is of course true to say that we in the EU are acquiring more and more decentralised agencies, each individual one of which is to fulfil tasks with high political priorities, such as food safety or the approval of medicines.
We must beware that establishing the decentralised agencies does not lead to unduly high expenditure for the EU, but we must of course also ensure that these agencies have the financial frameworks to enable the tasks in actual fact to be carried out.
That is why it is important for us to have obtained the activity-based budget.
I also very much agree with Mr Mulderâs demand that we acquire greater transparency and the ability on the part of Parliament to control the agenciesâ budgets.
I have a couple more individual points to make.
I should like, where this yearâs budget is concerned, to emphasise that, in connection with enlargement, we have appropriated more money to guarantees for loans.
This may strengthen the European Investment Bankâs and the European Development Bankâs work on developing the banking sector in the new Member States, and I believe that, in return for very few resources, we shall obtain a very large dispersal effect and shall be able to obtain considerable economic growth, in the way we have heard about during the hearings in the Committee on Budgets on the work of the two banks.
Last but not least, I hope we can find a solution to the problem of the information offices, or what are known as Info-Points and Carrefour centres, which, as from next year, have had their subsidies cut back because of problems with the Financial Regulation.
I hope that we can find a solution and that the Commission will help us find a solution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the 2004 budget will be the first budget for the enlarged Europe.
It is a good opportunity to welcome the ten new Member States, even if it remains the case that the drastic conditions of membership have imposed shock treatment upon their populations.
I wish, however, to stick to one question at the present time: is this budget equal to the challenges that the EU should now be taking up in the interests of a fairer world, characterised by greater solidarity?
It is permitted to have doubts and worries.
I am thinking in the very first place of Palestine.
What is Europeâs ambition faced with the deterioration in the conditions of life in the occupied Palestinian territories and with the extent of the destruction of the basic infrastructure, in particular that funded by Europe?
One amendment by my group therefore requests the Commission to assess the growing needs of the Palestinian population and to create a specific budget line for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the territories administered by the National Palestinian Authority.
That, I think, would be a strong political signal at a time when Sharonâs policy is aimed, above all, at delegitimising the claims to a Palestinian state, without which, however, no peace will be possible.
In the same spirit, my group is pleased about the introduction of an amendment by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, designed to guarantee aid to the people of the Western Sahara and to make sure that it is not interrupted.
Aid to Iraq will constitute one of the important points of the budget.
The issue of credits for the countryâs reconstruction enables us, once again, to send out a strong political signal.
Is the basic problem, however, that of the amount of the aid, whether it be EURÂ 200Â million or EURÂ 500Â million?
I do not think so.
The urgent issue is to put an end to the occupation.
Political aid, enabling the Iraqi people to recover their sovereignty and freedom of action as quickly as possible, is a prerequisite of their being able themselves to put figures to their needs and to organise the means for satisfying them.
Let us not in fact be fooled by the hidden face of American aid which, for its part, is in any case calculated in billions.
The Bush administrationâs desire is, firstly, to open the door to the US enterprises that, as announced at a recent meeting, are already poised to do business in Iraq.
It certainly intends fully to exploit the legislation that at present authorises foreign companies to acquire 100% of the shares in the various sectors of the Iraqi economy.
Is that the way in which it will be possible to satisfy the countryâs huge needs?
In saying that, I am thinking of the whole range of collective services, from the water supply to electricity, taking in education, social services and health.
I do not think that is the way.
The idea that the funds should be administered by the American Federal Reserve therefore remains unacceptable.
The Commissioner speaks of the need to improve security in Iraq.
As long, however, as the sovereignty of the Iraqi people is scorned, none of the problems will be resolved.
The vote on the last resolution, 1511, of the Security Council witnesses to a symbolic Franco-German climb-down on this subject, symbolic of European nervousness in the face of American pressure.
The EU would, however, benefit by speaking up more clearly in favour of strict respect for the interests of the Iraqi people, so that they might regain their dignity as quickly as possible, and in favour, at a budgetary level, of a multilateral fund of special allocations in which the United Nations would finally have its rightful place.
In this connection, the voice of the Iraqis needs to be heard.
The Iraqi people must, as quickly as possible, play a part in the reconstruction and democratisation of their country.
Europe would benefit from being a partner in the process and a party to it.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to add my tribute for the huge amount of work that has been put into the process of the budget so far by the rapporteurs, coordinators and indeed the chairman of the committee.
I welcome much of the output of the committee so far.
In one of the smaller budget lines they proposed an increase for town twinning.
I would invite the Commission to put an end to the annual skirmish on this subject and accept that this is a budget line that is relatively small but very keenly felt, appreciated and depended upon by many Community organisations.
On agriculture and rural development, I support the idea of increasing aid to less-favoured areas where agricultural production faces very serious and particular challenges in economic terms.
I would like to encourage, in general, moves to boost rural development to get a more appropriate targeting of available resources in rural areas from EU funding, while ensuring that the incentives are there in order to encourage the rearing of livestock and the growing of crops by the most natural methods possible.
On fisheries, I am very disappointed that the Council seemed so unwilling to fund adequately its own CFP reform programme.
I am particularly disappointed that Parliament's proposal to provide an additional EUR 150Â million to address some of the serious economic and social consequences of the current crisis in white-fish- dependent areas has been blocked by Member States, in particular the UK Government.
I agree with those who have commented upon the idiotic proposal to award ourselves additional taxi allowances outwith the budgetary process.
I do not see how that particular idea is going to help the reputation of this establishment or make a contribution to activity-based budgeting.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to address one particular aspect of the draft general budget for 2004 in so far as it relates to the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, of which I am a member.
I should also like to compliment Mr Mulder on his work.
In relation to agricultural expenditure, I fully agree that more emphasis must be placed on the environment, food safety, traceability, animal welfare and consumer information.
All these aspects will come to the fore even more in the coming years through the recently-reformed common agricultural policy.
Our consumers expect European agriculture to deliver on these multifunctional aspects, and our farmers are prepared to do this.
We know that there are extra costs involved vis-Ã -vis our trading partners, but it is a price the European taxpayer is prepared to pay for peace of mind.
This is what we mean when we refer to the European model of agriculture and rural development.
It is well worth defending, particularly in the context of the WTO.
Animal welfare is an area that concerns all in the sector.
To those colleagues who are seeking to eliminate export refunds for live cattle, I would ask them again to consider the trade implications of what they are suggesting.
The proper forum for dealing with this issue is the WTO, where the EU must ensure that there is a level playing field.
'Unilateral trade disarmament' is unacceptable.
We cannot stop supporting our farmers while the Americans and others continue with their export-enhancing schemes.
I am as interested in animal welfare as the next man, as indeed are all farmers, and all those involved in the live export trade.
It is in the financial interests of the producer and the exporter that the animals arrive in tip-top condition.
There will always be demand for live cattle exports.
If we in Europe do not take up market opportunities in the Middle East and elsewhere, our competitors from Australia and New Zealand will ship their animals half way around the world to meet that particular demand.
Â Â  MrÂ President, since I only have very little time, I shall concentrate on three points: subsidies for tobacco cultivation, the administrative expenses of the Environment DG, and Natura 2000.
In my opinion, the draft budget anticipates the reform of the common organisation of the market in tobacco, planned for 2005.
As for the overall reform â the talk now is of totally decoupling aid and no longer of simply adjusting the current system â this should not take place before 2005.
Tobacco cultivation remains a distinctive sector of activity, affecting 110Â 000 families and generating 400Â 000 seasonal jobs.
Reducing or abolishing tobacco subsidies would entail the disappearance of small family businesses dotting the European landscape and would open wide the doors of the European market to American producers.
It would be undesirable in terms of the environment and of national and regional development, and it would be bad for the health of our fellow citizens, who would not stop smoking because of such measures.
As for the administrative expenses of DGÂ 11, these are increasing exponentially, rising from EURÂ 58Â million in 2002 to EURÂ 83Â million in 2004.
That is a huge rise of 43% in two years.
All that to increase the number of civil servants responsible for noting breaches of environmental legislation.
If these breaches represent 45% of current business, it is because the Community regulations are unwieldy, ill adapted and difficult to implement.
As in the case of Natura 2000, they are contrary to the will of the people, as France pointed out at the Environmental Council in June 2003.
That being said, is it necessary to create a technical assistance department endowed with EURÂ 3Â million, which would sort out neither the difficulty of implementation nor the funding after 2006?
In our view, this department would be a source of further confusion for people, who already have difficulty making sense of all the roles devolved to each level: Community, national and regional.
Does not, however, the Commission wish, in this way, to have a stranglehold on the implementation of this Habitat directive, which does not fall within its competence?
Because of all these issues, we shall not vote in favour of this budget.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, changes, or new features, have clearly been added to the European budget for 2004: it has been described as a budget for a Europe of twenty-five, with a new nomenclature, based on activities, objectives and targets.
This does not necessarily make the budget easier reading when, for example, we have 215 activities instead of the distinction previously made between administrative and operational expenditure.
Furthermore, we will soon also have the new feature that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure will be removed and, one of these days, we will see the budgetisation of the European Development Fund (EDF).
When that day comes, however, will we in this House still be able to complete a discussion on the matter in two hours as well as take a vote on EURÂ 100Â billionâs worth of spending?
There is, therefore, a deficit in budgetary democracy, ample proof of which is the fact that this Chamber is completely empty!
There are also other budgetary deficits, first of all in the reliability of the forecasts.
There are the figures for outstanding commitments: between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion of unused appropriations each year, and this is a problem, especially when, on top of this, we do not have enough money to give to beekeepers, sheep farmers, fishermen, and so on. There is also a deficit in budgetary justice: year after yearÂ âÂ this is a truismÂ â Europe has its winners and its losers and they are always the same people!
The Spain of MrÂ Aznar, who preaches to the whole world about budgetary balance, receives royalties worth EURÂ eightÂ billion every year and without this income Spain would enjoy no budgetary balance at all.
At the same time, other countries that form a majority, pay up â France and Germany, for example.
In France, we lose between EUR 2 and EUR 4 billion every year, which is the equivalent of one TGV line every year!
Something is clearly wrong!
There is also a deficit in the hierarchy of budgetary priorities: it is all well and good to earmark EUR 200Â million for the reconstruction of Iraq, to give another EUR 200 million to Afghanistan, and EUR 240Â million to Turkey to cover pre-accession costs, but should these really be priorities when the whole of Europe has only EUR 600Â million in 2004, with which it can build the equivalent of a few kilometres of TGV line?
Should we be spending EUR 640Â million on Afghanistan, Turkey and Iraq â which nobody forced us to destroy â when we cannot even build high-speed rail links or major transport networks?
The budget contains a perversion of solidarity, which in turn reveals a fourth deficit; a deficit of coherence.
This is a Europe that, at Lisbon, stated its desire to be the number one world power in the field of knowledge, which Nikita Khrushchev wanted for his country as long ago as 1960, in order to beat the United States.
This is a Europe of ErasmusÂ Mundus, which wants to be a global university, a Europe of major works Pericles, a Europe of universal external policy, a Shiva with one thousand arms, in Cotonou or Mercosur, in Asia, in South Africa, âeverything but armsâ, for the poor and even for the rich.
And yet, this Europe of global dimensions has a truly provincial budget of EURÂ 100Â billion, in other words, oneÂ perÂ cent of its GDP, and this percentage is not increasing.
Given the contradiction between these global ambitions and this laughable budget, the question is raised as to where the truth about Europe lies.
The answer is to be found in the budgets: year after year, Europe churns out impressive-sounding speeches which, in reality, fall considerably short of what is needed.
Â Â  Madam President, we have indeed been set challenges by our two rapporteurs, but I would like to focus on three issues in particular: enlargement, Commission reform and, last but not least, Iraq.
I fully accept, as does my Group, that the major goal for this budget as set out by Mr Mulder is enlargement.
From the outset we wanted to ensure that a full budget will be available for the new Member States, and that the commitments will be effectively implemented.
We still realise, however, there will be many difficulties ahead as regards the day-to-day running of an EU with 25 Member States, particularly where translation and interpretation are concerned.
This leads me to reform.
In my Group we believe that as far as the reform of the Commission is concerned, we really need to make sure that there are signs that something has changed since 1999.
We have therefore put the 272 posts in reserve.
One of our main conditions is that an assessment be carried out of the changes that have occurred and the action that still needs to be taken.
The Eurostat affair and the issues concerning whistleblowers and the position of OLAF show that the Commission is slow to tackle things.
We would like to see the latter issue raised as a separate discussion on the basis of an oral question in the November part-session in Strasbourg.
As other speakers have highlighted in this afternoon's debate, it seems to our Group that Iraq is the major issue for our budget in 2004.
I thank those who have had the courage to speak in favour of our amendment.
There are three reasons for this: first, for us, this is a major political signal to the outside world that Europe is prepared to play a significant role in humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Iraq.
Although Iraq is different from Afghanistan, we have given EUR 1 billion to Afghanistan over a five-year period, and, if we take into account the Commission proposal, we have given EUR 200 million to Iraq over an indefinite period.
However, I read in â presumably one of Mr Wynn's favourite newspapers â that the Japanese Government has pledged USD 5 billion over several years for Iraq's reconstruction in contrast to our EUR 200 million.
Second, in the light of last week's unanimous vote in the UN and 's revelation that the US has agreed to allow a joint UN Development Programme/World Bank agency to administer the funds, it is now easier for us in Europe to think of allocating more funds for Iraq's reconstruction.
It should be recognised, Mr Walter, that certain countries will be less enthusiastic because of their position on the war, but I understand that the page has turned, and that those who are forward-looking in our Parliament â and indeed those who support America in its hour of need â will be supporting the PPE-DE Group's amendment.
Lastly, we believe that this particular amendment is not incompatible with financing other areas, and will not affect existing funding â the amendment itself mentions this.
Mr Wynn, you commented that the Commission proposal is not based on assessments, it is based on availability.
We believe that the monies will be needed for 2004.
You also mentioned that this is a first reading.
We should actually be able to vote our amendment quite within the bounds of the financial perspective and should our amendment fall, we as a Group will, of course, reserve our right to consider whether the Commission's proposal is the right one.
Therefore, in this budget we want to prepare the Union for enlargement, we want to make sure that reforms of the institutions are carried out, but above all we want a Europe which is going to play its role in the world.
That is why we ask the House to support our amendment earmarking EUR 500 million for Iraq.
Â Â  â Madam President, this is the last budget this Parliament will approve and therefore perhaps the last one many of us will vote on.
I therefore believe this is a good time to assess our budgetary work throughout this legislature and I confess that my assessment is not wholly favourable.
We would like just to focus on positive aspects, such as the improvements in the budgetary procedure, the functioning of our own Committee on Budgets and the achievement of the first review of the financial perspectives since 1993.
But we must not forget that the proportion the budget represents in relation to GDP has been reduced, and this is clearly insufficient in view of the Unionâs objectives, and paradoxically, each year there is a surplus of appropriations as a result of poor implementation.
I believe it is the duty of both the Commission and Parliament to express its opinion on the future financial perspectives so that the next Commission and the next Parliament can use them as a basis for their considerations.
Despite its miserly size, the Unionâs budget appears all-encompassing and I thank the general rapporteur for his cooperation in fitting in all our various requests.
We note that everything from the protection of hazelnut cultivation to a pilot project for helping victims of terrorism has been included.
I would like to stress that the regulations on COMs and on the Structural Funds must be complied with and the budget is not the correct stage of the procedure to amend them.
Now, if there is one star issue, one objective, ladies and gentlemen, in this 2004 budget, I believe it is preparing the Union for enlargement, for the integration of 10 new States and, based on my experience of having been myself an observer in a candidate country â some years ago now â my prediction is that the integration will be a success.
I would add my thanks, in particular, to Parliament for its tenacity and ambition, since the Councilâs first reaction was more worthy of obsessive accountants than of politicians aware of the historic challenge facing us: the greatest and most difficult enlargement ever undergone as part of the project of European integration.
The Council tried to have everything tied up, refused to review the financial perspectives for several months and has also refused to include the 25 from 1 January.
I believe that would have been a political gesture worthy of consideration.
Nevertheless, in an almost unprecedented display of frivolity and political demagoguery, some people have tried to cast a shadow over this central objective of the budget by presenting an unjustified amendment which would add EUR 500 million to the appropriations already planned for Iraq.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have approved, and on Thursday we are going to approve in plenary session, EUR 100 million in humanitarian aid for that country.
The European Commission is asking for, and can only justify, EUR 160 million for 2004 for the Community contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq.
I can guarantee that many millions of European citizens who opposed this illegal war, which did not have the support of United Nations, do not understand why the European Union has to provide anything other than humanitarian aid in Iraq.
I can guarantee that it will be very difficult for me to explain this to my citizens â very difficult â and the only way I can understand this amendment is as a reflection of a desire to clear a bad conscience after having supported an illegal war.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no justification for this.
The only thing we can justify â now there is a United Nations Resolution â is to contribute to what the Commission is proposing to us in a reasonable manner.
Furthermore, I would also like to ask â and I know that Mr Salafranca is about to speak â where the honourable Members from the European People's Party are going to get it from.
From Latin America?
From Asia?
From Africa?
From the Mediterranean?
Where are you going to get it from?
Because you are perfectly aware that there are no appropriations anywhere, even by stretching the flexibility instrument to its limits.
I would therefore ask you to be responsible and aware and to withdraw the amendment, in order that we do not make fools of ourselves and so that the European Union may have a budget which makes it capable of dealing with enlargement and which brings peace.
Â Â  Madam President, on the eve of the donor conference on Iraq, I, as the budget rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, would like to endorse the Commissionâs realistic proposals to release a further EUR 200 million for the reconstruction of Iraq on top of the EUR 100 million of humanitarian aid previously promised.
Anyone in favour of more European money for reconstruction must go and argue and must knock on the doors of the Member States.
As a matter of fact, it surprises me that countries that at the time were very enthusiastic advocates of a military intervention in Iraq are today willing only to release very limited funds or even no funds at all for its reconstruction.
It is plain cynical to have to conclude that certain donors want to advance loans to Iraq as if the debt burden of the Iraqi people were not already high enough.
The conditions laid down by the European Union for a financial contribution for reconstruction are a .
The central role of the UN must be strengthened.
The European money must therefore only be deposited in a new Trust Fund to be set up by the UN and the World Bank.
Secondly, the aid must not be spent exclusively on large-scale construction projects that are made to measure for companies that have good relations with the White House.
Thirdly, I am also arguing for 35% of the annual credits to be used for elementary health care and primary education.
Whatever, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy does not wish to see funds for the reconstruction of Iraq being at the expense of other commitments of the Union, such as those with regard to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Latin America.
Failing to make good on agreements made would seriously harm the credibility and the reliability of our foreign policy and for me that is far more important than the political rearguard actions in this Parliament.
Â Â  Madam President, the 2004 budget is an expression of the anti-grass roots, autocratic policy of the European Union.
For yet another year, a budget is being presented which strengthens big business and the expansionist imperialist policy of the European Union.
The restriction on the budget items to less than 1% of Community GDP, especially in a year in which it is being called upon to fund not 15 but 25 countries, with enhanced convergence requirements, throws into relief the picture of the promotion of plans to restructure, privatise and liberalise the markets and of the indifference towards the needs of the workers, the poor and the small and medium-sized urban and rural classes, who are being called on to pay the price of the crisis.
The general guidelines for the European Union budget for 2004 consist of cutting spending for the Structural Funds and limiting funding for the CAP so that the repressive and aggressive European defence and security policy can be funded on the pretext of fighting terrorism and addressing immigration and creating and funding repressive mechanisms, such as the European army, police and border guards, the central personal records system and so on.
The murder of Palestinians by Israel is being funded under the agreements and the invasion of the USA in Iraq is being funded and legitimised.
The austerity imposed on the workers and working classes in order to serve the interests of the monopolies is being continued under the Lisbon philosophy, with more intense exploitation, violation of workers' employment and insurance rights, rising unemployment, the destruction of the environment and the continuing commercialisation of health, education and social welfare.
The pompous statements on economic and social conversion are categorically refuted by this budget, which presents no substantial redistribution of income to the less developed areas and the working classes suffering from unemployment, underemployment and poverty.
Quite the contrary!
Any convergence happening is happening downwards, dragging even broader sections of society into poverty and penury.
The cutbacks in Community spending on agriculture, within the framework of the philosophy of the WTO and in agreement with the USA, come within the anti-farming framework of the partial reform of the CAP.
At the same time, restructuring is being imposed and pressure is being exerted for alternative crops, such as for tobacco cultivation and other Mediterranean products in which the European Union has a deficit, while genetically-modified organisms are being promoted under pressure from the Americans and its multinationals.
The budget is funding the extermination of small and medium-sized farming.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against this budget because, instead of resolving, it will create new problems for the workers, farmers and small enterprises in the regions and instead of contributing to peace in the world, it promotes war and the imperialist hegemony.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to draw Parliamentâs attention, as the budgetary authority, to two lines of financial aid which are different to those mentioned recently.
The first is the line for projects of common interest for the trans-European transport networks.
The Treaty of Maastricht gave the Community the task of contributing to the creation and development of trans-European infrastructure networks for transport, telecommunications and energy.
These networks fall within the framework of the general objective of social and economic cohesion.
In this regard, on 9 October the Commission presented to the Council of Ministers its new proposal containing a statement of projects of European interest.
It is a very ambitious proposal, but it does not have the necessary resources.
I am therefore proposing in an amendment that priority must be given to sea and river transport, rail and cross-border connection projects, but, above all, to those projects to which the Member States are already committing significant resources.
For the latter, please refer to the Van Miert report, presented on 30 June 2003, because there are many other projects which have been on the table since the Essen European Council in 1994 and today, nine years later, they have yet to be dealt with.
I therefore suggest that the Commission should demand the cancellation or even return of the aid allocated to an action in the event that that action has not been completed within 10 years of its approval.
Nevertheless, the Commission would have the power not to apply that time limit in the case of an extraordinarily large project or an unexpected delay.
Secondly, tourism will soon be the European Union's most important service industry.
The World Tourism Organisation expects the number of tourist arrivals to double, to approximately 720 million a year in 2020, and the 9 million people for whom it provides work will increase by between 2 and 3.5 million, to 12.5 million jobs.
We therefore proposed that resources be allocated at European level to assist the promotion, monitoring and assessment of an ecologically and socially sustainable tourism policy, which, however, was rejected.
I trust that, in the future, the Constitutional Treaty will consider this activity as a Community objective, because it affects all of us, service providers and users.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, there are just a couple of points arising from the Budget for 2004 that I would like to single out.
I would like to ask the Commission whether it really thinks it makes sense, now, at the beginning of the new year, to cease to provide funding for the Euro Info Centres, the Carrefours, or, indeed, town twinning.
I find myself wondering even now whether the Commission really thinks it has such a good image in the eyes of Europeâs people that it can afford to do without the few who are working for Europe in these areas.
I really am slowly coming to wonder about that.
The fact is that we, not only in our capacities as MEPs, never stop trying to advance these things and to motivate them, yet the Commission does nothing about making immediate arrangements for the funding of these bodies to be continued.
This, I think, is where it should do something as soon as possible to enable us to fund â let me say it again â the Euro Info Centres, the network of Carrefours, and also town twinning arrangements.
If you no longer have the people on your side, you will soon be very alone, and the Commission will find that far from pleasant.
Let me take up another issue, that of the agencies.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposed that 10% be put in reserve for these, and thank God that was accepted.
This is about making it possible for the agencies to be monitored.
We have seen all this happening before in many other areas.
We will see to it that adequate controls are ensured in the agencies in the future.
Let me add something political.
Up to now, I have assumed that category 3 exists to fund internal policies.
There are already over ten agencies in this area, and I really am slowly losing the desire to fund more and more administration using the parts of the Budget that are actually meant to be for political activities.
This category is for funding policies rather than red tape, and that should be set out clearly.
There is only one thing I would wish to add to the great deal that Mr Elles had to say on the subject of Iraq.
It is that those of our fellow-Members from other groups who are already calling for a supplementary budget should be honest enough to vote in favour of our amendment and thus enable us to have sufficient funds available for the whole of 2004 and not have to ask for additional funds in six monthsâ time.
I do believe that a true and transparent budget involves it being specified at the beginning of each year just how much money is available.
For my final point, I would like to address myself to the Council.
Last November, we expended a great deal of effort, between first and second reading, on negotiations towards extending Parliamentâs right to be consulted on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
I am disappointed by the way that three Council Presidencies have told us that this resolution would, at last, be activated if we were to give EURÂ 10 million for the Police Mission.
Let me make it perfectly plain that what this boils down to is that either we agree to something, or the negotiations are stalled.
It really is a pretty poor state of affairs if the Council thinks it can wrest something from us by making promises in respect of something that has already been agreed.
I would also like to point out that our group has always called for funding for this Police Mission.
I do not actually have the time to thank the rapporteurs, which is what I wanted to do, but I will do it all the same.
Thank you very much!
Â Â  â Madam President, with the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation, the subsidies of the former Part A and some of them from the former Part B of the Budget, which did not have basic instruments, required those basic instruments to be adopted in order to be implemented.
To this end, the Commission presented seven basic instruments which are currently under discussion in five parliamentary committees.
The initial objective was that they would be approved for the action programmes to enter into force from 2004.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the seven proposals, I can only deplore the Commission's delay in presenting them, because this means that the various Parliamentary committees involved are also working behind schedule and against the clock, and this makes it difficult for us to respect the strengthened cooperation between committees which is applicable for this procedure.
Furthermore, we must also remember that some of the proposals pose particular difficulties, as in the case of pre-allocations, amongst other things.
In addition, if we bear in mind that the various competent working groups in the Council are also significantly behind schedule, as well as the difficulties we are expecting in terms of reaching a consensus between Council and Parliament â four of the proposals involve the codecision procedure â we must recognise, as realists, that the outlook is not very encouraging and that it may, therefore, be very difficult to fulfil the compromise which Parliament and the Council reached in the conciliation of 16 July so that these legal bases could be adopted before the end of 2003.
The Committee on Budgets, by means of the Mulder report, requests, Commissioner, that the European Commission provide for the implementation of exceptional transitional measures which allow subsidies to be allocated during 2004, as laid down in the presentation of its proposals.
Regardless of the final result, therefore, in the basic instruments relating to the issue of pre-allocations, at first reading the Committee on Budgets has maintained the pre-allocation in the corresponding lines for the 2004 budget, as was done in previous years.
All this will allow the various associations to be able to benefit from subsidies in 2004 under the same conditions applicable until now.
Above all, however, the rapporteur believes that, if we can have a transitional period, we will be better able to prepare the negotiations for the conciliation procedure with the Council, as well as the second reading, and not once again be slaves to the timetable; otherwise, not only will the rigour and responsibility required of this institution be prejudiced, because we are legislating, but, in particular, so will the action programmes and their beneficiaries.
Â Â  â Madam President, I will make a few comments in relation to heading 4.
I have always argued that the tasks of reconstruction, rehabilitation, pacification and democratisation in Iraq must not be the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but that they fall within the competence, or should fall within the competence, of the international democratic community.
Moreover, this Parliament, Mr Colom i Naval, will decide democratically on the amount it wishes to allocate to this priority, and the Committee on Budgets has already decided on it.
Our political group believes that this contribution must be as ambitious as possible, but also that it should not prejudice other geographical areas.
This has been stated in the resolution approved by this Parliament, Madam President.
Mr Elles has already explained quite correctly how this priority can be funded without prejudicing other geographical areas.
Further to that, I would like to point out that the plan to reduce other policies does not originate from this Parliament, which has increased external action, but was the niche prepared by the Commission precisely in order to fund this priority of Iraq.
Madam President, I would simply like to make a clear demand and draw the Commissionâs attention to the fact that this Parliament wishes to fully exercise its budgetary competences, and I would like to refer specifically to a decision which has been taken by the Committee on Budgets in relation to a fund for regional solidarity between Europe and Latin America.
The European Council has established very clear conclusions on the situation in Bolivia.
This Parliament is going to hold a debate tomorrow and adopt a resolution and, therefore, Commissioner, I would like to remind you that this Parliament wishes to fully exercise its responsibilities as an arm of the budgetary authority and behave like a Parliament which debates, which rejects, which ratifies and rectifies, and which does not wish to be â as Mr DellâAlba said â an NGO or an accountant, but which wishes to fully exercise its responsibilities in accordance with its competences, according to the Treaties.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something about the general lines on the agencies, which I have agreed with the general rapporteur in my capacity as permanent rapporteur on the agenciesâ budget.
Apart from one small change, we have, in dealing with this yearâs agencies budget, followed the Commission proposal and have, as a rule, reinstated the Commissionâs preliminary draft budget in order to take into account the agenciesâ increased requirements in consequence of enlargement.
It should be noted in this regard that some agencies have done very well out of this, whilst the reinstatement of the preliminary draft budget has meant that others have not received the funding they need in order to successfully complete the tasks allocated to them.
We must nonetheless hold fast to the principle that it is the budget that determines activities and not the other way round.
It is not acceptable for the administrative boards or managers of agencies to exceed their budgets without obtaining approval for this from the Commission or the budgetary authority.
As regards the agenciesâ establishment plan and Mr Mulderâs proposal concerning it, I would like to point out that Parliament, being part of the budgetary authority, must get better at monitoring the agenciesâ personnel policies, to which certain principles must apply.
Firstly, and as a rule, the agency must, when recruiting staff, use the procedures generally customary in the EU.
Secondly, when recruiting specialised staff, who can only be allocated to higher grades, approval must be sought from the budgetary authority in each individual case.
Thirdly, agencies must not grant established official status without the budgetary authorityâs permission.
The object of this is to enable us to eventually get some sort of grip on the expansion of personnel and the inflation of costs.
As the Member States have already announced their intention to set up even more agencies, we can see even today that this will go beyond the scope of category 3.
I would ask the Commissioner to join with her fellow-Commissioners in giving some thought to whether it might not make sense to establish a category specifically for the agencies, enabling control of them to be improved and made transparent, and also guaranteeing Parliamentâs right of co-determination.
Â Â  â Madam President, first of all, I, too, should like to thank Mr Mulder for the work he has done with such great balance and commitment that it has achieved a substantial consensus within the Committee on Budgets.
The 2004 budget is very much a continuation of the 2003 structure.
The main objective for next year is to provide sufficient funds and a sufficiently well-structured system to cope with not only the challenge of enlargement but also the new responsibilities that an enlarged Europe will have to take on on the world stage.
I should like to focus on just a few points, because many things have already been said.
I would mention, in particular, the support that Parliament is reserving for the reconstruction effort in Iraq, especially after the recent UN vote; the confirmation of its commitment to Afghanistan and the reaffirmation that ongoing programmes must be supported and maintained, despite the current difficulties; and the principle whereby aid to developing countries should be precisely targeted, especially in the case of priority objectives such as combating poverty.
I therefore feel it is essential to ensure that the Tacis, LRRD and MEDA programmes are preserved, and I see a need for a new instrument to update the policy of proximity and to put it into practice.
Lastly, I would mention the protection and promotion of children, especially those who are victims of wars and natural disasters.
Finally, I should also like to thank the Commission, which has, once again, been extremely open to working with the Committee on Budgets, and I hope that, by next year, we will have succeeded in this challenge.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, members of the Council Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, the Budget resolutions are about setting down in figures the policy that one wants to implement; it is about turning oneâs own political priorities into a proper structure of figures that will stand up.
This year, my group, that of the Party of European Socialists, has again been successful in playing its part in this.
We agreed, early on in the year 2000, that we would make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, with qualified full employment and greater social cohesion.
This, the Lisbon objective, is our guiding star, and we must not lose sight of it even when we are fighting over the many minor lines in the Budget.
It is precisely there, among these rather minor lines, that we find expenditure on our action plans, âEurope 2002â and its offshoot, âEurope 2005â, which are meant to prevent regions and people from being left behind by the headlong developments in our information society.
In this regard, it is also important that we should have sufficient funds available to be able to promptly and effectively integrate the new information and communications technologies into Europeâs education and training systems.
Not only does Learning, a multiannual programme, work towards social cohesion and towards bridging the digital divide, but it also improves opportunities for lifelong learning and enhances the European dimension in education, and that is something we need.
We need people to be innovative and mobile, people who are capable of putting the new technologies to work in innovative production processes.
Innovation creates new jobs, most frequently in small and medium-sized enterprises, support for which needs to be further stepped up.
We know that small and medium-sized enterprises employ over half the EUâs workers, that they produce something like half the total turnover in the European Union, and that they are innovative and geared towards growth.
All this adds up to sufficient reason for a Social Democrat like myself to keep harping on about the importance of support for SMEs, whether this be by implementing the lines for action from the Charter for Small Enterprises, by helping SMEs to put new technologies to good use, or by improving their financial environment.
In all this, we have to pay particular attention to the very small firms, the micro-enterprises, even though the Commission is proving to be a bit clumsy about this.
The fact is that they make up the majority of our businesses.
Our average SME employs five people.
From this moment on, we need to make greater efforts towards achieving the targets we set ourselves in Lisbon, indeed much greater efforts in view of our having twenty-five, rather than only fifteen, Member States, from May next year.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, and the rapporteur, Mrs Gill, on the excellent work they have done.
I am convinced that the 2004 budget is going to contribute to the success of the Unionâs most crucial enlargement and, despite what we have heard here this afternoon, I also maintain the hope â because that is the last thing we lose â that in terms of the budget we will reconcile the profound differences we have suffered in relation to the action in Iraq.
I would like to say something on another fundamental issue, however: immigration.
Immigration is no longer a national issue, and has become a European issue, including the most dramatic aspects of it.
It is essential to dedicate more resources to this political priority.
We need to improve border control, combat illegal immigration effectively, which leaves victims on our coasts almost every day, and we need countries of origin and transit to manage migratory flows effectively while respecting human rights.
We therefore unreservedly support the increase in resources for programmes such as ARGOand we welcome the new programme of financial and technical aid to third countries in this field.
Madam President, I believe it is very appropriate in this debate to stress, as other Members have done, that the 2004 budget creates a line intended to introduce elements of European solidarity into assistance for the victims of terrorism.
This pilot project recognises in a special manner this group of European citizens and sends the political message that the Union is listening to them and is showing solidarity from a budgetary point of view as well.
Finally, Madam President, the draft 2004 budget takes the Council's traditional approach of austerity and expenditure control.
We agree that this budgetary policy must contribute to healthy and stable growth.
Only if we are rigorous, if we opt for quality spending and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, will we reduce the gap between us and our most direct competitor, the United States.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, Council Representative, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to thank our two rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, for the method they have used and for the quality of their work on this new budgetary framework.
This has enabled us to vote on a budget for twenty-five countries, taking up the traditional budgetary priorities and Parliamentâs constant concerns, relating specifically to our core traditional policies, but also to the concerns that we have been expressing for years on the subject of micro-enterprises, citizensâ information and policies of justice, security and solidarity.
Having said that, the problems raised by the draft budget that the Council submitted to us do not bode well for the future, in particular the historically low level of payment appropriations: less than 1% of GDP, the likes of which we have to go back more than seventeen years to see.
The Council, which is obsessed with the health of national economies, is acting like an accountant but certainly not like a manager and even less as if it had a vision for the European Unionâs future.
The discrepancy between the codecision agreements and what has been included in the budget, the discrepancy between the projects for economic recovery, the project for a knowledge-based society for all twenty-five countries and the reality of the budget sap the credibility of the Union as a whole.
So what has happened to the spirit of Lisbon?
The EU budget does not match our ambition, or our expectations.
This year, two headings fail to comply with the financial perspective.
First, EURÂ 83Â million too much has been earmarked for rural development, which highlights the needs created by the CAPâs new approach.
Nevertheless, observing budgetary rigour, I propose that we give up this surplus and prepare better for the 2005 financial year.
Let me now turn to external policy, where the problem is quite different.
The Commission has made proposals for the reconstruction of Iraq that are reasonable and acceptable in budgetary terms.
What is the point, then, of the proposal for EURÂ 500Â million, apart from reviving splits that have cost us so much credibility on the international stage?
All Europeans should quickly find the path of realistic wisdom and mutual respect.
Lastly, I wish to recall the importance for Parliament of policies for communicating with the citizens.
The serious incident between the Commission and Europeâs information bodies weakens this policy and demonstrates the difficulties that the Commission has in respecting the priorities set by Parliament.
The new financial regulation must not be called into question, as it allows for greater transparency in relations with the bodies that receive European subsidies.
Having said that, the implementing arrangements endanger three hundred essential information organisations.
It is therefore obvious that a solution must be found to ensure that their work can continue.
This serious incident nevertheless warrants one fundamental observation: why did the Commission not warn us in time?
Like any administration, it has a duty to inform political representatives.
This course of action was not taken even though it was stipulated in the confidence pact concluded during the implementation of the administrative reform.
We voted in favour of giving confidence; we gave you the resources and in return we expected the promised effectiveness for the implementation of our political choices and particularly of our entire budget.
This is an essential requirement if we are to be able, in future, to develop real policies of growth and solidarity and policies for the future in the context of an enlarged Union that wishes to succeed for the benefit of all its citizens.
Â Â  Madam President, firstly I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, for the excellent work they have done.
We look forward to the continuing cooperation that we have had, both inside and outside this House.
Secondly, I would like to mention that our committee wishes to maintain all its amendments at this stage, especially those relating to Eurostat.
I would also like to welcome the PPE-DE Group's proposal for an oral question to the Commission for the November Strasbourg part-session about the appalling information flow in Eurostat, the problems involving whistleblowers, the audits that lay untouched in Eurostat and the lack of political responsibility in the Commission.
We would also like to ensure that our amendments on the Committee of the Regions are maintained in the light of what we have just read in the OLAF report in the confidential reading room.
The report says that, in the case of printing contracts, the investigation revealed systematic and flagrant incompetence within the Committee of the Regions.
As regards the Financial Controller, the most threatening aspect for the Committee on the Regions seems to be the endemic culture of unprofessionalism and improvisation, where lack of transparency is preferred to openness, for instance in reporting facts to OLAF.
The Committee of the Regions will have to answer some serious questions.
If we had known those facts when the amendments concerning it were tabled, my committee would have made them more forceful, not only cutting some of the Committee of the Regions' budget, but putting a substantial additional amount into the reserve.
We are also very keen to see the amendment tabled by Mr BÃ¶sch on the live export of animals adopted and I know that our rapporteurs are working actively to achieve that.
I finish as I started by thanking the rapporteurs.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin, of course, by congratulating our rapporteurs, MrsÂ Gill and MrÂ Mulder.
What I would like to say to you is this: we have on the table the last budget to be adopted in this Parliamentary term, and our minds are turning more and more towards the multiannual financial framework which will guide our budgetary policy in the medium and long term.
The Commission is discussing the foundations of that framework, and Parliament will have to deliver its opinion on it.
The report ordered on this issue by PresidentÂ Prodi gives us some cause for concern, as, of course, does the crucial question of economic and social cohesion.
The overriding feature of the budget of any federal state â which is increasingly what we want our budget to be â must be its redistributive function.
In a democratic, politically coherent and socially responsible Europe, such redistribution can only be achieved if economic and social cohesion is the central aim.
That, moreover, is the case in those Member States which have a more federal structure, such as Germany.
The Sapir report is based on the premise that there is a conflict between cohesion and growth.
To us, that premise seems ideologically motivated and unsound.
Good cohesion policies are, by their nature, good economic growth policies, just as bad cohesion policies are also, by their nature, bad economic growth policies.
What is worrying about the way the Community budget works at present is precisely that budgetary redistribution sometimes redounds to the benefit of more central countries or regions, and even large companies or multinationals.
That tendency can be seen in product sale subsidies and export refunds.
These are the areas which should be reviewed more thoroughly; these are the mechanisms and distortions which the next financial framework must tackle, and which must continue to act as the ultimate guiding principle of the Community budget.
Â Â  Madam President, I would also like to offer the rapporteurs my heartfelt thanks and with regard to social policy I would say that a number of problems do still remain.
I am pleased that Mr Mulderâs programme for small and medium-sized businesses in Central and Eastern Europe can also be used for health and safety.
I hope that he will confirm this, because otherwise the value of the programme is less than I had thought.
I believe that fortunately this is not the case.
So much for my first point.
My second point is that of the celebrated 500 million.
I have EUR 10 here in my hand and perhaps I can give them to the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Then they can offer them to the Conference in Madrid, they are just as much a pittance as the 200 million that they are willing to give at the moment.
It is of course very bad that we say to a country that is in such difficulty, a country that in theory could be one of the richest countries in the world and that perhaps one day will be again, that we say to it: âNo, we can give you 200 million,â â although money is always given back by the European Commission at the end of the year â âMore is out of the question and anyone who asks for more is behaving irresponsibly.â
Then it seems we are concerned with bookkeeping and not really with the resolution of problems.
Sure enough, we can also put up EUR 10, then we are being even more responsible and then perhaps everything will be fine.
However, I believe that we are then failing in our duty, that we are then acting as bookkeepers and not as politicians.
However, we are meeting here in this Chamber as politicians and therefore we must also talk about the actual problems.
It may of course be that there is some other reason, but we must be prepared to reveal what it is.
I would very much like to hear what it is.
Â Â  Madam President, unfortunately, I could not resolve the problems of the Structural Funds with EUR 10.
However, in all events, I must say, Commissioner, to start with this issue, that we in the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport consider that the Committee on Budgets has moved in the right direction as regards category II, the budget for the Structural Funds, by basically replacing the amounts set out in the preliminary draft budget and sometimes going higher.
This was also our position when we gave our opinion on the budget and consequently there is no need for me to refer to this further.
As far as transport is concerned, while I welcome the fact that the amounts in the preliminary draft budget for transport safety have been replaced âÂ and for us the question of transport safety is a matter of absolute priority â I wish to say that we disagree with Amendment No 553 by the Committee on Budgets, which refers to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
Here, in an effort to limit appropriations horizontally as far as personnel are concerned, I think that problems are being created for the âtake-offâ of this agency, which needs to operate efficiently and quickly at European level, so that there is one contact for these issues with the Federal Aviation Administration (FÎÎ) in the United States.
I think that the Committee on Budgets has gone further than it should have done on this specific issue.
One last comment on the trans-European networks.
We welcome the fact that the levels of the preliminary draft budget have been increased by 5 million for commitment appropriations and 52 million for payment appropriations.
We would like to hope that these sums will be taken up.
We would also like to believe that the Member States will honour the undertakings they have made, including recently at the last European Council in Brussels, to make the question of the European networks an absolute priority.
Â Â  Madam President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposed a number of amendments to the budget.
One main concern was with regard to the resources allocated to the various agencies and institutions that carry out statutory duties on our behalf or provide data and statistical information.
We cannot demand that, for example, the European Environment Agency provide environmental indicators to enable us to link common agricultural policy reforms to the achievement of environmental goals if their budget is not adequate.
Last year Parliament voted to allocate resources to help address the continuing health problems in the Republic of Belarus as a direct result of the Chernobyl incident of April 1986.
Radiation affects 23% of the territory of Belarus.
In the Gomel Oblast, which is contaminated, there are 2 million people, including 500 00 children.
Rates of sickness have increased dramatically.
For example, the number of children who suffer from thyroid cancer has increased fivefold.
Most of the children were not even born at the time of the incident.
In July I visited Belarus.
I visited hospitals where they were trying to treat the casualties of the problem.
I saw equipment that was 20 years out of date â radiotherapy equipment that was Soviet built and was broken down, with spares unavailable.
Even if spares were available the government could not afford to repair them.
They do not have access to the iridium sources needed for this equipment to work.
So what have been the priorities of the European Union in the last 12 months in terms of spending?
We have spent EUR 180 million on the ridiculous pilgrimage to Strasbourg; we have wasted EUR 60 million on the Committee of the Regions â a talking shop that nobody listens to; EUR 5 million have been nicked by corrupt officials in Eurostat.
How much have we spent solving the health problems in Belarus?
Not one penny.
We are told that the Commission intends to commission a study.
That is not good enough.
We need to address the problems in a country that is going to be on our borders in July next year.
Â Â  Madam President, I would also like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur, MrÂ Mulder, on the way in which we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been able to work with him.
We are not satisfied in every regard, but we have made good progress.
We have a clear message for the Council.
Because the interim reform of agriculture policy has very far-reaching consequences for the European countryside.
Now that this reform is a fact it seems as if the Council, witness its draft budget, does not understand what the said reform actually means for farmers and country people in the European Union.
What is being asked is that the countryside and agriculture be more market-driven and that more countryside policy lead to more dynamism in the countryside.
If the European countryside wants to survive this reform, then it is advisable to use the money available more appropriately.
After all, to give just one example, the average European dairy farmer alone gives up some EUR 6Â 000 in income per year.
In my own country it is double that: EUR 12Â 000.
Nor will the enlargement of the European Union have its intended effect.
A new, longer external border makes the risks of epidemic animal diseases such as foot and mouth, swine fever and fowl pest greater.
Add to this that the food safety, animal welfare and the environmental requirements in the European Union for the producer are the highest in the world, then we must have all hands on deck to structure the 2004 budget so that allowance is made for both the consumer and the farmer.
Given the high ambition level of the European Union, a small consumer supplement on a number of products, such as milk and meat, would for that matter be very easy to defend.
Madam President, as rapporteur for the agriculture budget I have on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development submitted the following change proposals for the treatment of this first reading.
To begin with we would like to see more money being set aside for the LEADER programme.
The same goes for the SAPAR programme, extremely important for our new Member States.
We would also appreciate the introduction of a new budget line for the LEADER EAST programme.
In addition, we want EUR 23 million extra for control and prevention. We would also like to see EUR 6 million extra for promotion payments by the Member States, in particular to give the market-driven policy more substance.
In addition, EUR 1 million extra for promotion payments by the EU.
With regard to the information supply for the amended agriculture policy, we would like to see 3 million extra being set aside.
And in the area of animal diseases in particular we would like EUR 12 million extra to be set aside for veterinary measures and animal welfare and public health measures.
We would also like EUR 18Â million extra to be set aside for the animal diseases emergency fund.
Â Â  Madam President, when the previous budget debate was held in plenary at the end of September, I expressed concern about the reports on the irregularities at Eurostat.
The Commission has since presented reports on the activities, but it is, however, unfortunate that these do not make clear what has happened and who is responsible.
It is essential, in this connection, to emphasise the important role played by Eurostat in monetary union.
The European Central Bank depends upon reliable statistics in order to be able to take its decisions on monetary policy.
It is therefore extremely important for the irregularities to be investigated without delay and for correct procedural routines to be devised, so ensuring that Eurostatâs activities are focused upon producing statistics.
I also believe it is time we began to conduct a more general debate on how the EU budget is really used.
I should like to draw attention to some of the recommendations presented in what is known as the Sapir report, which observes very correctly that the EU budget is out-of-date.
Expenditure, income and procedures are incompatible with the present and future situation.
The report proposes, among other things, that the costs of agricultural and regional policy must be considerably reduced and that funds must be set aside from the budget in cases where they can create basic conditions for employment and growth.
Everyone seems to agree about the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises for economic growth.
Action should also be taken to benefit such enterprises.
In the future enlarged EU, it will be necessary drastically to cut back on agricultural aid, to reform structural funds and to create room for growth through private enterprise.
Both the issue of Eurostat and that of how the EU budget is to look in the future are about credibility.
If people are to have confidence in the EU, it is of fundamental importance that their money should be neither misappropriated nor squandered, but used in a sensible way that benefits people and development in the EU.
Â Â  Madam President, I too would like to add my thanks to Mr Mulder for the way he has carried out his work as budget rapporteur this year.
I will be supporting the budget proposals for 2004, but with a certain amount of reluctance, and I will certainly be supporting amendments to them.
In particular, I commend the amendments proposed by the Committee on Culture and ask Parliament to think of those organisations such as the youth parliaments and the Youth Orchestra, which do wonderful work for young people but need their funds to be paid in a prompt and efficient manner, something which is not always the case.
I would particularly commend the remarks by MrsÂ DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop, and the Commission must get the legal base in order so that those funds can be paid next year promptly and on time.
I think I am the last speaker from Parliament before the rapporteur and the Commission and I just want to make three fundamental points.
The level of the European Union budget, at just over 1% of Europe's GDP, is about right.
When I started my political life an elderly gentleman said to me 'always remember that when you put your hand up to vote for expenditure, you are actually putting it down into my pocket'.
One penny in the pound is acceptable, one cent in the euro, but no more.
Secondly, the Commission must get its accounts in order.
All the good work done by European Union programmes is totally destroyed by these regular accounting problems.
Is there not a single Commissioner prepared to accept responsibility for this and do the decent thing?
All the while they do not do so, the European Union is the loser.
Finally, we must have proper democratic control.
Last year, for instance, the budgetary authority voted EUR 3Â million for Euronews.
I heard only yesterday that to this day not a single cent of that money has been given to Euronews, which is one of the best ways for citizens in the European Union to find out about European affairs.
I fear that the Commission could not care less whether Euronews fails.
Worse than that, it is ignoring the budgetary authority, which it should do its best to respect.
Â Â  â Madam President, we have heard various speakers on behalf of the committees, and I would like to know why we have not heard from all of them; for example, there is no speaker listed for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I would have thought it would be normal procedure for a speaker from each committee to be given the opportunity to put forward his committeeâs opinion.
Â Â  â Mr RÃŒbig, I take note of your comment but, as you know, all Members who have spoken were entitled to do so because they had put their names down to speak or because their groups had put their names down.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate and I thank you all for the encouraging words and sometimes also for the disapproving words.
That is part and parcel of normal debate.
It will be clear to you that I cannot respond to everyone.
I would like to touch upon the main points.
I am in any event pleased with the comments of Mrs Schreyer, who says that in comparison with previous years the budget on which we are about to vote is one that shows the smallest increase in comparison with the proposals of the Council and the Commission.
I very much appreciate her remarks about the acceptance by the Commission of initiatives with regard to agriculture.
This I find a good thing.
Once again I hope that the Council too will adopt them, but to be on the safe side this Parliament has amended all the preparatory actions and all the pilot projects in both category I and category III should the Council reject the actions in category I. I can only recommend: try to finance it from category I. The margin is greater here than in category III.
Mr Garriga and Mrs DÃŒhrkop have expressed their concern about the progress of the codecision procedure on the A 30 lines, etc. I share this concern.
I hope that come the end of the year we do not find ourselves in a situation in which we have serious difficulties about how to continue funding these projects.
I think that it is of the utmost importance for the reputation of the European Union in general and in the interest of everything that we fund that these programmes continue.
Nor do I think that we should make legislation in haste.
It seems to me that the Commission would be wise to reflect as soon as possible on the possibility of a transitional period, so that we can in any event continue with the funding of those projects that we have funded in the past.
As regards the issues touched upon by various speakers, I would wish, as rapporteur, to adhere to the maintenance of the financial perspectives as they have been agreed.
I can only express the hope that when we vote, certainly where category 1B is concerned, we do not exceed these financial perspectives.
I do of course agree with Terry Wynn, who says that this is only the first reading.
Nonetheless, I think that even in the first reading we must adhere to this principle as far as possible.
Mr Dover, he is no longer in the Chamber, expressed doubts about the need for the many languages in the European Union.
This is a recurring theme in many speeches.
I think that we must simply comply with the Treaty.
Mr Terry Wynn has, I think, given an excellent account of the problem, both as regards category 1B, about which I have already spoken, and as regards the Iraq question.
I think that we must simply await the result of the vote and decide what we are going to have to do on the basis of it.
Mr Ferber and many others also spoke about the importance of the info points, I have already talked about them myself.
In this matter too I think that the Commission must come up with proposals quickly, so that we do not cause these info points any irreparable damage, because they are highly regarded by the European public.
Even with new financial regulations we need to take measures so that we can continue with them.
As for Mr Kuckelkorn, so far I have been pleased with the satisfactory level of cooperation with regard to the agencies.
I hope that this remains so in the future too.
Two points about these agencies, on which a decision will probably be made on Thursday: putting 10% in the reserve and talking about the organisational charts of the agencies.
I hope that everything can be worked out in close cooperation with both him and the agencies, so that we can resolve this whole issue before the second reading.
There is no intention to make unnecessary difficulties, but a Parliament does need to exercise its democratic powers properly.
Mr Bartho Pronk, he is no longer in the Chamber, but I can confirm that the guarantee funds for small and medium-sized businesses will also apply to those small and medium-sized businesses that are concerned with health and safety at work.
There is nothing to prevent this.
Finally, Mr Goodwill, who was wondering about us giving the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen extra duties without making new resources available to it.
There has been close consultation with the agency and it feels that it would be able to perform these extra duties within the draft budget handed over by us.
So if they themselves say that, then who am I to give them extra money?
That is why I have come to this viewpoint.
I am hoping for continuing good cooperation with each and every one of you and once again can I express my thanks to everyone who has contributed to this debate.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by again thanking MrÂ Mulder for his kind words.
I think it likely that we will be able to continue to enjoy excellent cooperation at the next stage of the Budget procedure.
I would like to respond briefly to Mr Perryâs comments on the way our accounts are kept.
Our accounting is consistent.
Year in, year out, the Court of Auditors confirms to us that the accounts accurately reflect the receipts, outgoings, assets and liabilities as at the end of the year.
We are modernising it, but this accounting is consistent.
As several speakers have mentioned the Infopoints, let me reiterate that it is not the legal basis that is at issue here.
Rather than being an issue identical with that of the A-30 lines, for which a legal basis appears to be needed, these are information channels, in respect of which the Commission has a prerogative.
There are various aspects to this, and I know that the committee is discussing them.
I have to point out to you that there are thousands of Infopoints that function without loans from the Commissionâs budget, and we must indeed not forget them.
The other question will be dealt with by a group of Commissioners in preparation for the next meeting of the Inter-Institutional Group on Information.
If I may turn to the A-30 lines and the basic acts, I would like in particular to return to what was said by various speakers, notably by Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop, who has the hardest of tasks here in attempting to show the committees how urgently necessary this legal basis is.
The Councilâs failure to put sufficient emphasis on this issue is something that I find unacceptable.
We simply have to bear in mind the timeframe involved.
If an intermediate solution were now to be decided on, only for the Council to say, âmarvellous, now we donât need to do anythingâ, then we would very soon be facing a situation in which Parliament would be meeting for the last time before the European elections without there being a new legal basis in place.
I also think that the attitude exemplified by some elements in the Council, who say, âThese grants are in Parliamentâs interestsâ, to be absolutely wrong.
It is also, quite obviously, in the interests of the Member States that the grants to such bodies as the Institutes in Florence and Bruges â to name but two â should be secured.
To do so is, after all, in the common European interest, and that is why it is also in the common interest that these legal bases should be established as soon as possible.
Let me conclude by returning to the very important issue of aid for Iraq.
The splitting of the European Union into two camps over whether or not there should be military intervention put us in a difficult position.
We are agreed, though, that we want to help the people there not only with humanitarian aid, as we have done this year, but that we who belong to the European Union also want to play a part in reconstruction.
At the moment, however, our actions are subject to imponderables.
Who in this House can say what the situation will be in â for example â six monthsâ time?
As things stand, the situation is that the United Nations itself removed its personnel from Iraq a number of weeks ago, so someone will have to implement on the ground whatever aid we decide on.
What matters, after all, is that what we do is realistic.
Our commitment to Afghanistan, Mr Elles, was for five years.
What we are trying to do right now is to make a commitment up to the end of this year, and I urge you not to lose sight of that fact.
If the EURÂ 500 million amendment were to be adopted, what commitment should the Commission make in Madrid in view of the Councilâs talking at the same time in terms of EURÂ 200 million?
If you do not want to make cuts in category 4, the money would soon end up having to come out of an expanded flexibility reserve, and that requires a joint decision.
That would mean that the Commission would be unable to make any firm commitment in Madrid, and so I ask you to reconsider this.
Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, asked me a specific question about the possibility of a supplementary budget.
I can tell him that it is likely that there will â as a direct consequence of the Member Statesâ hesitancy â be another donorsâ conference, possibly next year.
I would therefore ask you to consider whether it might not be possible for Parliament, at the present first reading stage, to make, by means of a motion, a declaration on the 2004 Budget in which it calls upon the Commission to present a report on the implementation and evaluation of this aid halfway through next year.
If a different security situation and the resolution of other political issues then makes it possible for aid to be provided on the ground, it will be possible to consider adopting a different resolution on the amount of money involved.
For the moment, I really do ask you to give the Commission a clear mandate for the donorsâ conference and to make it abundantly clear that, where aid is concerned, the European Union and its Parliament now speak with one voice.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, fellow Members, support for Iraq? 160 million, 200, even 500 million are being mentioned as if they were nothing.
Whatever it ends up being, I want to make it very clear here that the funds for development aid must not be drawn on for this!
Combating poverty is the main aim of European development cooperation, this is what the money must be used for.
In my opinion the reserve and the flexibility instrument are the proper sources for the European contribution to Iraq.
As rapporteur I have made out the case for the modification of the nomenclature of the budget lines for development cooperation with Asia and Latin America.
The majority of the people living below the poverty line of 1 dollar still live in these two regions.
These budget lines must come under development cooperation and not under external relations.
It is a matter of activity-based budgeting here and not of the internal structure of the Commission as a basis for the breakdown of the budget.
Another point is the know-how in the EU delegations.
If the level can be boosted here through training and extra investments, not only will we achieve the target figure of 35% for the social infrastructure in developing countries, but we can also ensure that at least 20% of this can be spent on primary education and health care.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B5-0279/2003).
We will take a series of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to point out that Germany notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a system of tolls, based on the distance travelled by goods vehicles, proposing a fixed average price of 12.6 cents per kilometre.
On 6 March, Germany notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a system of reimbursement of tolls â reimbursement, partial at least, or payment â based on special charges, which could allow payment of up to a sum of 15 cents on average.
The Commission must assess whether the notified measure is compatible with the common market and conforms to the applicable Community legislation.
Given the doubts raised by this measure, on 23 July 2003, the Commission decided to begin a formal investigation, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, so that Germany and other interested parties could make their observations.
On 27 August 2003 the text was published in the Official Journal of the European Union and the Commission is scheduled to make the final decision by the end of the year.
The Commission believes that the system of tolls could be discriminatory if certain technical problems are not resolved before it is introduced.
The Commission and the German Government, therefore, created a working group intended to examine the technical problems raised by the introduction of the system of tolls, and this group is demonstrating that it works well.
I would also like to point out that the Commission has asked the German Government to ensure that the installation of tolls hinders the free movement of traffic in Europe as little as possible and that, if problems arise once it is in operation, the Commission would take the appropriate measures.
In any event, however, I would like to say that we in the Commission have acted in defence of the Treaties, and that, since the end of August and the beginning of September, we have established channels of cooperation with the German Government which are operating in a more than satisfactory way.
Â Â  Commissioner, I also emphasised in the various questions that the Commission acted appropriately on this matter.
My concerns merely lie in the fact that the toll has been postponed indefinitely and that this working group, which you have already put in place, has also helped us to show that shortcomings have arisen and that this has also led to discrimination between various Member States.
My question is, therefore, whether the working group will be able to continue its work in this transitional phase.
If it will not, will the Commission open infringement proceedings?
I think that it is clear that the toll system in principle is not being called into question, rather that, amongst other things, the control apparatus, which will be used to collect this toll for Germany, is a system that, firstly, has shown technical shortcomings and, secondly, will not be available to all businesses.
That is enough, as far as I am concerned, to continue this investigation, that is to say, the monitoring.
Â Â  . I would like to say that there has not yet been any discrimination, amongst other things because the toll is not operational.
What I would like to point out is this: it is the German authorities themselves who have decided that the date for the toll to become operational will be delayed, as a result of the non-compliance of the industries in the consortium with which the construction of the equipment and the implementing of the system had been agreed, and in view of the faults detected.
