Mr President-in-Office. We are relying on your leadership to keep this ship afloat and keep it steaming, just as impressively as Manet's 'Steamboat Leaving Boulogne', which is on show at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your Presidency will be judged by how well you manage two subjects in particular: the Financial Perspective and the decision on Turkey.
On the first point, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance remains extremely worried, because the figures you insist upon, as when you enthusiastically signed the infamous âpenny-pinchersâ letterâ or attacked the Commission for daring to propose that the budget for the Union of 25 should reach the monstrous level of 1.14% of Europeâs GDP, just do not add up.
We agree on the need to reopen the debate on the European Unionâs spending priorities.
We should like to be able to support a proposal of yours to eliminate agricultural export subsidies or to re-examine certain monumental and costly trans-European network projects.
It is not by aiming at making savings indiscriminately that the European economic system can be made ecologically and socially sustainable and also competitive.
You yourself seem to admit as much when you speak of the need to give the European economy a boost by encouraging employment, innovation and research.
You also used the word sustainability, a very fashionable term these days but one that for many has very little substance.
Even so, there will be a lot to do over the next six months to encourage not only producers but also governments to make economically sustainable decisions.
For instance, greater effort could be put into implementing the Kyoto Protocol, standing up to the pressures from the chemical industry on the Reach directive, truly enhancing the action plan for environmental technology, cutting aircraft fuel subsidies, or re-examining the Bolkenstein directive.
MrÂ President, we shall meet again in six monthsâ time to judge how sustainable your Presidency has been.
Lastly, in relation to Turkey, we support your approach and are delighted that you have stated that Islam in itself is not a topic of debate for its accession.
This statement is particularly significant to us because it comes from a leading Christian Democrat.
Perhaps you can make a contribution to this discussion in other countries too.
In this you can certainly count on our support.
Â Â  Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has referred to the feeling of distrust expressed by European citizens on the occasion of the recent elections.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is precisely the main thrust of your actions over the next six months that will show our fellow citizens to what extent Europe has listened to the message that the European people have sent it.
The social partners, and in particular those who will be meeting in October at the European Social Forum in London, will certainly pay close attention to the three principal issues which you yourself, as well as Mr Prodi, have just mentioned, and which my group would like to put on the agenda right now.
First of all there is the draft directive on the liberalisation of services, known as the âBolkestein Directiveâ, which you described as a step in the right direction.
At the heart of this text, however, lies the principle of the law of the country of origin, by virtue of which the social law of the supplier country would apply everywhere.
That would leave the door open to all kinds of abuse involving social dumping.
The perverse system of flags of convenience would thus apply to more than half of all economic activity.
For that reason, we see this text as unacceptable.
Next, there is the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact.
As far as reform is concerned, at this stage we have still not managed to put an end to our obsession with reducing public and social expenditure, or even to the 3% myth.
On the contrary, and even worse, there is talk of the reform having a hidden face, with particularly severe treatment for those States with a pay-as-you-go system, which would be treated the same as hidden indebtedness.
We must be aware that such a measure would give rise to strong public disapproval in the countries concerned.
Finally, there is the revision of the Lisbon Strategy.
The working party chaired by Mr Kok is due to submit its report in October, but you are already calling for more flexibility and deregulation, as a way of helping countries with a very low level of social acquis.
We would urge you to beware of the temptation to make a headlong dash towards liberalism. Even the Commission, in its report to the European Council in March, admitted, in its own way, the failure of that strategy, which was supposed to lead the Union into full employment and an economy of dynamic growth by the year 2010.
I would also like to add that the very restrictive measures which you have outlined regarding asylum seekers, migrants and refugees, as well as your vision of the WTO negotiations, are also certain to give rise to legitimate debate.
In other words, Mr President-in-Office, we are waiting to see what the Dutch Presidency will do.
See you in September.
Â Â  I should like to warmly welcome to this House the Netherlands Council Presidency in the person of our Prime Minister.
The theme of this Presidency is innovation.
Now we have a new Parliament; soon there will be a new Commission.
In this connection, we ought to focus on the challenge that this entails rather than the threat emanating from excessive aspirations.
Many new people with fresh ideas bring with them a wind of change, and that is what we need, for the public are still not excited by the European Union and the European institutions.
Despite this, if everything goes well, they are the ones that really matter in all of this.
All those good intentions, though, have led to an endless stream of regulations, and it is unclear which of them we really need.
That is why I applaud the fact that the Presidency is prepared to work on keeping objectives realistic and in tune with the expectations of Europeâs citizens.
How does the President-in-Office of the Council intend to achieve that?
The Presidency wants to devote attention to a possible temporary application of parts of the so-called Constitution.
In so doing, is the Presidency not running ahead of the ratification process, which also involves referendums?
Are we, then, still taking our citizens seriously?
After all, we take complete freedom of choice between a yes and no to this Constitution as a basic assumption.
Another thorny issue is the position of Turkey.
Will there be a serious assessment of the question of whether Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria, or is it the case that, after 40 years of promises, we cannot do anything but say yes, even though we should, in actual fact, say no?
What is the President-in-Office of the Councilâs opinion about recent statements by some Heads of Government who apparently no longer need such an assessment and already know that everything is in order with Turkeyâs application?
The human rights situation in the world remains worrying.
In large parts of the world, intolerance, repression and exploitation are more the rule than the exception.
A chilling illustration of this is the religious law that was adopted yesterday in Sri Lanka and which, in effect, bans evangelising on pain of a long prison sentence.
Are you prepared to take up this serious infringement of religious freedom with the Sri Lankan Government?
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I want to thank the Presidency of the Council for their well-prepared programme for the next six months.
I should, however, like to make a few recommendations.
Firstly, it is true that enlargement of the European Union with ten new Member States has made it even stronger globally than ever before and particularly as regards such matters as trade policy and coordination of development.
Therefore we expect that when leading and possibly completing negotiations on Russia's admission to the World Trade Organisation, the Dutch Presidency will be successful in getting Russia to lift its discriminatory tariff policy on transit cargo, in particular by rail, which Russia continues to impose on the European Union Member State, Latvia.
Secondly, the Presidency's wish to ensure the safety of energy supplies in a liberalised market is commendable, therefore the Council wishes to intensify talks with Russia on the compatibility of electricity and natural gas pipelines.
One should, however, bear in mind that Latvia has experience in cooperating with Russia regarding energy supplies â unfortunately Russia does not always operate according to market principles.
Thirdly, the Dutch Government justifiably refers to its wealth of experience in matters of human rights as Chair of the OSCE.
In your opinion that would allow you to carry on negotiations with Russia and tackle conflict situations.
We should, however, like to inform you that despite Latvia having met all of the OSCE's recommendations, this does not prevent Russia from continuing to exert pressure on Latvia and Estonia supposedly on matters of human rights, but for an entirely different purpose â to legalise the consequences of occupation.
Be vigilant in your work and I wish the Dutch Presidency every success.
Â Â  Prime Minister, there is no doubt that the thorniest issue you will face during your European Presidency will be Turkeyâs membership application.
Not only because your Cabinet appears divided over that issue; you will meet with very heavy pressure to assess Turkey not on the basis of meeting the Copenhagen criteria, but merely on the basis of the progress it has made to date.
As you talked about a strict application of the criteria laid down in 2002, I can now only hope that you will put your money where your mouth is.
It is, in any case, clear that Turkey failed to meet the prescribed criteria yesterday, fails to meet them today and will fail to meet them in December too.
You spoke a moment ago about the people of Europe whom this is all about.
Well, it should be possible for those people to have their say about an essential, fundamental issue such as the accession of a non-European country to the European Union.
A country that, in some 20 years, will not only boast the largest surface area within this Union, but also the highest population.
A country whose accession would constitute a financial and social drain and would set in motion a new and massive wave of immigration.
Are you convinced that this is backed by democratic support?
It also remains to be seen whether we should give much credence to a Turkish Prime Minister who claims he will respect the lay state and democracy but who, a few years ago, was still making statements along the lines of âthe mosques are our barracks, the minarets our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers our soldiersâ.
Indeed, we should think very carefully about how consistent this is with our European values.
The European Constitution will prompt a referendum in various Member States.
If we want to avoid the people in Europe turning away from the European Union even more, we must keep this referendum linked to the issue of the Turkish application.
Â Â  Mr President, during this Netherlands Presidency, all 25 Union partners are for the first time responsible for the success of these six months of cooperation, six crucial first months.
As President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Balkenende can, and must, provide considerable impetus in vital areas.
In so doing, the Council itself will need to develop and apply new and effective working methods.
This is necessary so as to ensure that the progress of the Union of 25 is not at a snailâs pace.
In the same spirit, the Council needs to approve the European Parliamentâs new statute rather than standing in its way.
Democratic transparency is what the public expects from us, and rightly so.
I should like to hear from Mr Balkenende how he intends to give the necessary signals in terms of approach and communication.
From my own experience as a national member of parliament, I know how capable he is of forceful policy and of perseverance in his policy, even if that is unpopular or even controversial.
That is why we can rely on his political vision and his ability to do what is needed.
His speech yesterday in Berlin, in which he paid tribute to Count Klaus von Stauffenberg, was another illustration of this.
The President-in-Office of the Council was right to make an actual link between the civil and moral courage and conviction of Stauffenberg and his sympathisers and the chance of reconciliation which Europe was given following liberation.
It is in the same spirit that we must now also do what is needed following the liberating enlargement to 25 Union partners.
What is to be done?
Europe must be more visible.
Rather than deny that its public image is that of a complex Moloch, it is important to change it in a concrete manner.
Europe should, together, dare to address the big questions of this time, which directly affect each citizen.
These range from a coherent and humane asylum policy that immediately tackles human trafficking, to a united stand against worldwide terrorism.
This requires concrete action and the exchange of information and signals for citizensâ safety, and one clear line must be adopted in tackling criminals and their networks, including in relation to the drugs trade, across the national borders.
In the context of credibility, I agree that no fresh requirements should be added in respect of candidate Member States such as Turkey.
Instead, we must hold firm to the requirements already laid down in the Copenhagen framework and not yield to any pressure regarding these.
If we Christian Democrats want to ensure that the community of values is not a pious platitude but an item on the daily agenda, we must specify what lines common and concrete policies must take.
Also in terms of the economy, the document by Mr Kok, our ex-Prime Minister, would be ambiguous; I therefore expect clear proposals of their own from the Council and the Commission and essential action points in order to give the Lisbon agenda a shot in the arm.
There is every reason to ask a great deal from this Presidency in those areas.
Mr Balkenende has been graced with a huge opportunity and with much energy and decisiveness, and of those to whom much is given, much may be expected.
Mr Balkenende knows that, in terms of decisiveness, he can count on the complete confidence and support of MEPs, myself included.
We have every confidence in the personal vision, attention and decisiveness of this President-in-Office of the Council, and we wish him every success.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Dutch and European Social Democrats, I warmly welcome the Netherlands Presidency in the European Parliament.
Your European Affairs Minister has asked us, above all, to lead the political debate.
As European Socialists, we gladly take on this challenge.
You spoke about modernisation, competition with the US and Asia, and about achieving the Lisbon objectives.
We Socialists fear that, with those enticing words, you intend to do something quite different in fact, namely to press Europe into the conservative corner.
While a few years ago, enormous efforts were being made to combat unemployment by reducing working hours and introducing job sharing, there is now all of a sudden talk of extending the working hours and you mention shorter holidays.
What is so modern about that?
Whereas we used to concern ourselves with job quality, care for the workplace, the prevention of illnesses and accidents at the workplace with a European-wide regulation, you now talk about deregulation.
Have, along with this, the objectives of higher labour participation and lower absenteeism through illness disappeared?
We used to talk about more flexibility within the labour market with greater legal protection; you are now talking about deregulating that protection.
It therefore seems that your objective of abolishing the administrative burden is more of an excuse for abolishing certain social and administrative achievements.
At the same time, you fail to address the European tendering rules that are throttling the small and medium-size companies.
Whereas we used to talk about investing 3% of the GDP per Member State in research and education, areas where, incidentally, the Netherlands has so far been lagging behind badly, you now only talk about the Stability Pact, economising and holding firm to the deficit of 3% maximum, without making resources and scope available for holding just as firm to 3% investment in research and education.
This is something I would have liked to have seen fought out before the Court of Justice.
In all fairness, the Kok report on âwork, work, workâ would take this really seriously.
Whereas in 2000, we used to talk about high-quality public provisions not only in infrastructure, you now talk about liberalising and privatising the service sector, which involves electricity, health care and public transport.
Are you actually prepared to stop those disastrous proposals by Mr Bolkestein to liberalise the services?
After all, they would enable Poles to offer their services in the Netherlands at Polish prices without being subject to prices current in our country, and this would, in fact, lead to social dumping.
To the Social Democrats, it appears that the Lisbon agenda is being used to your advantage to adopt a hard conservative economic agenda, under the guise of modernisation.
In our opinion, you are turning back the clock and refusing to create jobs that require brains and to commit to quality, research, education and high-quality public services.
We fear that, as a result, unemployment will increase in Europe, that the weaker members of society will pick up the tab of the cost-cutting measures and that you, with your candidate Mr Barroso, are not going about things the right way if we want to win the fight against Asia and the US.
We are throwing down the gauntlet before the debate.
Although we warmly welcome you and your Presidency, we are still struggling to accept your political choices, and we are looking forward to the debate under your Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in a former political life, I was on the council of Amstelveen, a medium-sized town in the Netherlands.
A fellow member of the council, who is now well known in Europe and to you, once entertained us about what he referred to as the paradox of the mediocre brass band.
To cut a long story short, the conductor of such a mediocre brass band had a dual task.
He had to ensure that the players started and finished simultaneously.
What happened in the middle was not that relevant.
Mr President, an analogy with the Council of Ministers urges itself upon us.
The programme of the Netherlands Presidency is good.
I really mean this.
Moreover, I am delighted that, following his somewhat qualified rhetoric during the election campaign, Mr van den Berg has simply continued on the old-fashioned Socialist path.
I think your programme is a realistic one.
Unlike some other presidencies, you do not underestimate your task, but then you face a different challenge.
The European elections have demonstrated that voters are not only indifferent, as you quite rightly pointed out; they are also outraged by the European institutions.
People say that things cannot go on the way they are.
It is not good enough that, for example, the Councilâs brass band starts and finishes at the same time; the tune should also be worth listening to.
This should, in fact, also be of concern to Parliament and the Commission.
Europe must regain a human dimension.
I am pleased with what you had to say on the matter, for I have not heard this enough in the Council so far.
If you succeed in this, your Presidency will be successful in my view, and I wish you every success in this endeavour.
Â Â  Mr President, at long last we see JP the NP in the EP.
I should really like to warmly welcome the President-in-Office of the Council to the European Parliament.
In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Balkenende has appointed himself as the man of standards and values and, in Europe too, he is keen to seize upon the Presidency as a means of having a debate on European standards and values, which I welcome.
I just hope that the debate does not turn out to be a vague and insipid discussion.
My group would be in favour of measuring asylum policy against the yardstick of decency.
For example, the Dutch insisted that the European directive on asylum procedures, which the Justice Ministers adopted in May, should allow asylum seekers to be deported before the final outcome of their appeal procedure.
If that were to be the case, they could follow the appeal procedure via video conferencing, provided, of course, that they had not, in the meantime, been put into prison in their country of origin.
That would be as good as useless and would also be completely at odds with international standards.
I can say that my group will be proposing to the European Parliament that this directive be nullified before the European Court of Justice.
I do, though, also want to congratulate the Netherlands Presidency.
I have, at any rate, understood that countries where referendums will be held about the European Constitution have been asked to keep those dates as close to each other as possible.
That is really an excellent initiative, but it would be even better if an actual Europe-wide referendum were to be held.
I would therefore ask the Netherlands Presidency in any case to make the necessary arrangements.
An important advantage of the Constitution is that the Council of Ministersâ legislative meetings will from now on be held in public, something about which I am delighted.
It is also absurd, of course, that at the moment, laws are still being adopted behind closed doors.
There is absolutely nothing that stops you from introducing public access today.
My group would therefore urge the Netherlands Presidency to throw open the doors, allowing citizens to follow the discussions and their governmentsâ voting behaviour from today.
On a final note, I would like to mention the Stability Pact.
It becomes inevitable that the Stability Pactâs future is at risk.
We need a smarter Pact that is less fixated on the annual budgetary balance and, instead, makes greater use of long-term indicators, such as public debt and pension duties.
The Commission has already tabled some suggestions in this connection, and it remains to be seen whether the Dutch Government will take decisive action in this area.
I do indeed hope that it will.
Â Â  Mr President, the Dutch Government is calling for priority to be given to economic growth and to the fight against terrorism.
It embraces the now outmoded illusions of the Lisbon Summit in 2000, which assumed that before 2010, Europe would be able to beat the United States and Japan in a competitive battle by making things as bad here as they already are over there.
It has meanwhile transpired that the resources for education for the benefit of the expected knowledge economy are insufficient.
The drawbacks of Lisbon may have become more visible by now, but the much touted benefits have not.
The same is true of the Stability Pact.
Without acting contrary to democracy, the 3% standard is becoming increasingly unfeasible.
The Netherlands is increasingly being seen as the Goody Two-Shoes of the European Union and NATO due to its requirement of stricter compliance with the Stability Pact, its contracting-out of public transport to international companies, its introduction of longer working hours, Commissioner Bolkesteinâs pressure for a service directive and its continuing military involvement in the American protectorate of Iraq, which is drawing the terrorist threat closer to Europe.
I sometimes hear other Member States remark that it would be good if the Netherlands left the European Union, because that country has become the motor behind the lamentable aspiration for restricting public expenditure and disposing of public provisions.
That aspiration involves exchanging hallmarks of European civilisation for Americaâs tough and ruthless system.
If Mr Balkenende wants to transform the whole of Europe in this way, he will bring about major social conflict, because public opinion is heading in a different direction.
Although the Lisbon Summit has decided to dispose of public services, this Parliament subsequently decided, at my proposal and by a large majority, to dispense with this requirement concerning public transport.
Instead of striving for unbridled economic growth at the expense of social security, public services and the environment, it is preferable to keep taxes to an adequate level and seek a redistribution of national and European income for the benefit of the weakest and of useful community tasks, and also for the benefit of integrating immigrants and removing poverty and despair in the world, which are still providing a continuous breeding ground for terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, indeed we have much to look forward to in the course of the next six months and I notice in these proposals that there is an absolute mass of proposed financial services regulation.
The Dutch presidency is going to push for the reinsurance directive.
It is going to push for the third money laundering directive.
It is going to push for the capital requirements directive and much, much more.
Financial services is Britain's biggest and most successful industry.
All of this agenda is nothing less than a disaster for the City of London, and it is a policy of beggar thy neighbour because the businesses of investment and insurance is not going to move from London to Frankfurt or Paris: it is going to be forced outside the European Union. It is going to move to the offshore centres.
Frankly this is a deliberate policy that is being pursued by the European Union year after year after year, and it is costing my country a great deal of money.
That said, I do admire your sense of humour because you are still banging on about the Lisbon Agenda.
Do you remember that - the great proclamation a few years ago that we were going to create the high-tech, dynamic economy with full employment?
Here we are half way through the programme and we see high unemployment, sclerotic growth and not a cat's chance in hell of any of the Lisbon Agenda being realised.
And then you want to renegotiate Britain's rebate and we will lose a further GBP 2Â billion a year!
This is all so bad that it is really very good because the genie of public opinion is now firmly out of the bottle.
We know that this is a political project.
Frankly what I would like you to do is to press this programme as aggressively as you can because you will make the British public and the public in many other Member States so furious that when we get our chance in these ten referendums we will say no and we will say it loudly.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to ensure continuity between Presidencies.
I should therefore like to begin by referring to the IrishÂ Presidency.
It proved a historic Presidency, because it saw the enlargement of the EuropeanÂ Union through the accession of ten new MemberÂ States.
That was a momentous event for the new MemberÂ States and indeed for the Union as a whole.
The issue of the draft of the new Constitution also fell within the IrishÂ Presidency.
During the coming presidencies, these drafts will be considered. They will be debated at EuropeanÂ Union level and in all the MemberÂ States.
I believe it is important to make it clear at the outset that a full assessment will only be possible after the new Constitution has been endorsed.
But to achieve this, several concerns must first be addressed.
In a number of countries notably my own, Poland, very large sections of public opinion are gravely concerned by the decision to omit all reference to God and to Christianity from the preamble.
There is concern too about Union legislation taking precedence over national legislation in certain fields.
The change in the voting system presents a further difficulty.
We cannot agree to it.
There is also the matter of the unfair advantages granted to the eastern German .
Ladies and gentlemen, Montesquieu said that local legislation and traditions must be respected when establishing central legislation.
There is much talk about bringing the Union closer to the people.
It is important to give very careful consideration to the implications of increased centralisation of the EuropeanÂ Union and of extending the economic competence of the central bodies of the EuropeanÂ Union.
In theory, the principle of mutual support must always be applied.
Will this actually be the case in practice?
Will Montesquieuâs warnings be heeded as the Union gradually strengthens its central bodies?
Â Â  Mr President, allow me to wish you all the best in your new role.
The Dutch Presidency has set out aÂ programme for us which is also aÂ challenge, namely the signing of the European Union Constitutional Treaty.
As aÂ member of the European Convention, I can guarantee that this Treaty contains the basic principles for aÂ future strong and prosperous Europe.
As we look to the future, I feel it is incumbent on me to mention some of the steps taken by the Slovak Republic in the past.
This very month sees the 12th anniversary of the signing by the Slovak parliament of the declaration of sovereignty of the Slovak Republic.
This was the first step in the creation of an independent Slovak state.
The second step was the adoption of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic on 1 September 1992.
This period culminated in November 1992 with the peaceful division of the Czechoslovak federation into two independent states â the Czech and Slovak republics.
IÂ can assure you that despite this separation of their states, relations between Czechs and Slovaks have improved substantially.
The foundation of the Slovak Republic was aÂ step towards the EU and it was my own party, the Movement for aÂ Democratic Slovakia, led by Mr Meciar, which submitted the application of the Slovak Republic to join the European Union.
IÂ therefore regard our current membership of the EU as the fulfilment of our goals, our ideas and our programme.
We are interested not only in the removal of borders that hinder the free movement of individuals, but also in overcoming the separation between Old and New Europe or, as I heard it referred to yesterday, the separation between Western and Eastern Europe.
The three Members representing the HZDS, the movement for a democratic Slovakia, Mr KozlÃ­k, Mr Baco and myself, are working in the Group of Non-attached Members, but IÂ would like to assure you that our efforts will be directed towards the building of aÂ future Europe that is both prosperous and ever more closely unified.
We support the steps taken by the Dutch Presidency and the programme that has been presented to us.
Thank you.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to propose to you that we suspend the debate and proceed, as scheduled, to the vote on the Quaestors.
Otherwise, many Members who have come with the intention of voting will not be able to do so.
Before suspending the debate, however, we are going to give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council, so that he may respond to the comments made so far.
Â Â  . Mr President, surely it is the intention that I first listen carefully to the views from the European Parliament.
I think it would be best if you proceeded with the vote first and if I gave my reaction once all the speakers have taken the floor.
That means that, in principle, I too will be taking to heart the responses to the European Council Presidency.
Â Â  The debate is suspended.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry that I have to repeat the request I made yesterday to have the candidates identified so that we can see who we are voting for.
We have no idea as to who some of the candidates are.
It would be good if they could stand up, be identified and, ideally, say something.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Gill.
Yesterday you asked that the candidates for Quaestor speak for a minute so that the Members may know them in more than just a physical sense, but a majority of the political groups did not consider it appropriate.
Nevertheless, I believe there can be no objection to their standing up as I name the candidates so that at least you may know them by sight.
I do not know whether this is going to help in terms of their election but at least they will not be entirely unknown to you.
Mr James Nicholson
Mrs Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl
Mrs Mia De Vits
Mrs Genowefa Grabowska
Mrs Anneli JÃ€Ã€tteenmaki
Mrs Astrid Lulling
You will have noticed that it is a list predominantly comprising women.
Now, at least, we know what one another looks like.
We are still waiting for the electronic system to load.
It is a difficult system to load, it would appear.
Ladies and gentlemen, technology has rebelled against us.
The system is refusing to load and I cannot tell you how long it may take.
In these circumstances, I think it would be reasonable not to carry on waiting.
I therefore feel obliged to schedule the vote for 3 p.m. and resume our debate.
Â Â  Mr Nassauer, I feel obliged to give you the floor in order not to waste any more time, but I would ask the honourable Members to remain silent.
I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to forgive this technical incident and to remain in our debate.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by giving the new President of the Council, on behalf of the CDU/CSU delegation, a very warm welcome to the European Parliament and assuring him of our support should he need support from this House.
It has been apparent even from the very first minutes of this debate that the issue of the European Unionâs relations with Turkey will have a major part to play.
We see the relationship with Turkey as being of fundamental significance, and Turkey as a dependable and important partner.
We have to make that clear without reservations, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that involves not constricting this relationship or reducing it to membership, but instead bearing other options in mind as well.
The newly-elected chairman of the Socialist Group has now made it known to us that negotiations are to be commenced with Turkey, provided that it has complied with the necessary conditions by the autumn, and, in so doing, he has acted as if Turkeyâs compliance or non-compliance were at present a hidden mystery, one to be revealed in the autumn when the Commission produces its report.
There is, of course, not a shred of truth in this.
Far from it; everyone in this Chamber knows that Turkey, at present, does not comply with the conditions for the commencement of negotiations.
That is apparent from the dominant role that the armed forces still play there.
It is evident from â and here I am resorting to charitable understatement â the problematic position as regards the rule of law in Turkey, and I am mentioning only two of the conditions.
Let me tell you, Mr Schulz, that we cannot reckon on any change in this regard before the autumn.
I fear, therefore, that it amounts to something very like misrepresentation, not to say hypocrisy, to assert that we are starting negotiations once the conditions have been fulfilled.
Are you seriously trying to tell us that they will be by the autumn?
The fact is that I cannot seriously believe that they will be.
It follows that honest dealing with Turkey is also about nobody, come the autumn, fooling us into believing that the Turks already fulfil the conditions, so that we can negotiate with them.
It is also about the issue of negotiations â and of when they are to get going â not having the inevitable conclusion that they have to be started; instead, we have to be honest and frank in our dealings with them.
I think it very important, Mr President-in-Office, that you should bear this point of view in mind as you set to work.
The second relevant point is that the European public have, as we know from the elections, considerable reservations about us.
If I may adapt Berthold Brechtâs phrase, we cannot elect a new public in Europe; we have to live and work with the one we have.
I am therefore firmly convinced that we have to seize the opportunity presented by the debate on the Constitution to bring Europe and its citizens closer together.
The debate on the Constitution offers us a unique chance to do that.
Implementing the Constitution and making the public more familiar with it is a matter of obligation for us all.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your Presidency will have to prepare the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
The least that one can say is that the European Union is a long way from achieving its objective of becoming, by the year 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.
On the contrary, throughout Europe there is growing concern about businesses relocating, about workers being blackmailed into accepting longer working hours, and about continuing unemployment.
The recovery is all the more fragile for not being based either on internal demand or on sustained public investment; instead, it remains exposed to the impact of external factors such as the rise in the value of the euro and the increase in the price of oil.
More than ever, Europe needs a strategy for sustainable growth and employment, and for investment in research, in major trans-European networks, in education, in knowledge and in the environment.
It needs economic and social cohesion.
It needs the Lisbon Strategy.
Yet certain people are trying to use the present economic slow-down as a pretext to return to an ultra-liberal programme, and to destroy the achievements of Lisbon and the integration of the various economic, social and environmental dimensions into the policies of the Union.
In that respect, your Presidencyâs priorities cause us great concern.
You say that you support the Lisbon Agenda, and we have heard you say so.
Yet your priorities â and here again we have read what you have written and we have heard what you have said â show that your approach is very unilateral and does not take into consideration the coherence of the Lisbon Agenda, which comprises the liberalisation of the market, in particular in the services sector, deregulation, and the reduction of administrative costs.
As for the financial perspectives â another major area for action during your Presidency â you want to restrict the Unionâs budget to 1% of GDP.
Yet such an initiative is incompatible not only with the efforts which have to made in research, and on the subject of which Romano Prodi has put forward some proposals, but also with the policy of territorial cohesion in the new enlarged EU.
You reject any revision of the pact to take more account of economic cycles and, in particular, public-investment requirements.
As far as you are concerned, public-investment policies, employment regulations and environmental regulations are really no more than obstacles, unnecessary burdens and restrictions on growth.
We, on the other hand, believe that all these things make the EU more competitive, and we also believe that respect for the integrity of the Lisbon Agenda will be a test of your Presidencyâs success and will determine what support we shall be able to give it.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to wish the Netherlands Presidency every success with its priorities.
The Presidency is working under the motto ârealism and ambitionâ, and that is something that appeals to me greatly, because, over the past few years, we have witnessed a growing trend of ever more fresh priorities being added to the agenda, and while solemn declarations are made at every Council summit, in reality they often turn out to be hollow phrases and no action is taken at all.
Public disappointment and scepticism should therefore come as no surprise, and no manner of promotion campaign can do anything about that.
It is therefore time we rolled up our sleeves, and that also applies to the Lisbon agenda, because, a moment ago, I heard a number of speakers on the Left of the political spectrum, and, ironically, to the right of me, saying that this Lisbon agenda is not social.
However, in my opinion, the interpretation of this Lisbon agenda is extremely social.
We are faced with 9% unemployment in Europe and with unemployment among young people, some of whom will never get a job.
It is high time we implemented this agenda, and I would actually like to point out that we can learn an awful lot from the ten new countries in the European Union, because although they have carried out many difficult and painful reforms over the past 15 years, they have, in the process, managed to accomplish greater economic growth, from which everyone stands to gain.
I therefore find it incomprehensible and also irresponsible that some parties try to undermine the Lisbon strategy.
Finally, agreements should also be made about EU funding.
It is a well-known fact that the Dutch Government is in favour of drastic financial cutbacks, and I should like to find out from you how this fits in with the ambitions which you mentioned in the motto, because, in addition to an effective treasury, at the moment, what Europe needs more than anything else is vision, decisive action and political leadership, and I look forward to a successful Presidency.
Â Â  I should like to thank the President-in-Office for putting innovation and environment at the heart of the mid-term review of the Lisbon process.
Both the current climate change threat and the current crisis in the prices of a series of commodities, like oil, copper and other resources show us that we urgently need a de-linking of resource efficiency, energy efficiency and the economy.
Europe has an answer to both these questions, and that is to strengthen Europe as a leader in environmental technology and services.
Already today German and Swiss companies are leading the world in providing clean water and air.
Dutch companies are leading the world in urban planning.
Why?
It is because Europe has the strictest and most ambitious legislation on these policies.
Therefore, it is not by watering down environmental policy and regulation in Europe that we will give the necessary impetus for innovation in our industries.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all allow me to congratulate the Irish President, Bertie Ahern, for the work he has done in bringing to a successful conclusion a task of historical importance, namely the signing of the European Constitution.
If, as I fervently hope, all twenty-five EU countries ratify the Constitution over the coming months, this twice-yearly examination of the Unionâs priorities will be abandoned in favour of a system of presidencies lasting two and a half years, which will be more stable and therefore more effective.
The priorities of the Dutch Presidency include enlargement, the consolidation of the reunification of our twenty-five countries, and the continuation of negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, and soon with Croatia too.
Above all, however, in December the European Council will have to take a crucial decision on whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey.
On this point, may I remind you of the position of the French MEPs belonging to the (UMP) and of many in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We say âyesâ to a preferential partnership with Turkey, but ânoâ to its accession to the Union.
In adopting that position we are absolutely in line with the statements made by Hartmut Nassauer.
We are counting on you, Mr Balkenende, you who are leading your country with determination and success, to strengthen the European economy by freeing it from its administrative and fiscal obstacles, by giving back to our businesses the ability to adapt to a globalised market in a European Union marked by both freedom of movement and the defence of its humanist values.
The famous European model will be neither an illusion nor a mere magic formula, provided that we equip ourselves with the necessary political resources.
Political resources include financial resources too, because the European budget has solidarity: solidarity between new and old Member States of the Union, between more and less favoured areas, between net contributors and beneficiaries.
I should like to congratulate the Commission on the courage it has shown in lifting the taboo of the British rebate, and I should also like to congratulate the Council of Finance Ministers on having approved, at first reading, an ambitious draft budget for 2005.
At the last elections, European citizens showed their desire to see the creation of Europe as a reality. Let us not disappoint them.
It is a heavy responsibility, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and we shall be there at your side if you contribute towards making Europe a political and effective Union.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we agree with the priority document of the Dutch Presidency where it states, in relation to the new financial perspectives, that we will face complex negotiations which must begin on time so that they can be completed before the beginning of the 2007 budgetary cycle.
There is no rush.
In fact it could be said that it is rather risky to make spending forecasts almost ten years in advance; and what is more, perspectives which â as we in this House know - become entirely rigid rules.
However, we must begin now.
When I talk about negotiations, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am referring to negotiations with Parliament.
I am therefore delighted with what you said earlier: with Parliament and not just between national delegations in the Council.
If you wish to lay the foundations for proper negotiations, you must remember that, throughout the process of discussing the new financial perspectives, including at the point when they are approved, the European Constitution will not yet be in force.
This Parliament will not, therefore, be content with simply saying yes or no to what the Council has discussed.
Without going into detail, since time does not allow it, I would like to say that the Socialist Group believes that the priorities within these new perspectives are, in short, cohesion between the different regions, which has become even more important with our recent enlargement, and the disparities in income it has brought; job creation and, finally, development aid for third countries, the current Category 4, the category which has grown least since 1999, the year when the current financial perspectives began, despite the many new obligations.
Â Â  â The programme of the Netherlandsâ Presidency relies on realities and we welcome these endeavours.
One of these realities is the accession on the first of May of the ten to the Unionâs institutions, in other words, a big step towards the re-union of Europe.
From this point of view, I would like to deal with two objectives of the Presidency.
First: the Presidencyâs programme lays down fast and effective integration for the ten in the Councilâs decision procedure. This is important but it is not enough.
In order to have a successful enlargement and for Europe and the European economy to strengthen itself by its own means and also to be an active player in the Lisbon process, it is essential to consider not only the technical integration, but also the existing hurdles and their gradual reduction and the deepening of the content of the integration.
Connected to that, is the second important objective: the preparation of Agenda 2007.
The aim of the Presidency is to have the basic principles and directives discussed by December 2004.
Well, we are facing interesting and exciting debates.
However, it must be the objective of all of us to have the successful integration feature amongst the basic principles.
If I were to re-formulate this sentence in the spirit of the Netherlandsâ Presidency, then I would say that it is an ambitious but realistic objective to count the successful integration as a basic principle.
Prime Minister, you mentioned the brain drain to overseas.
This particularly affects us Hungarians.
We support all your endeavours that bring this opinion into the basic principles of the budget.
Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the Netherlandsâ Presidency for having initiated a dialogue and communication from the richness and colourfulness of our European culture.
We are indeed very strong in this.
We wish you much luck!
Â Â  â Mr President, if Lisbon taught us anything, it was that strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy, of companies, does not suffice for us to have jobs and social cohesion and to protect the environment.
That is why Lisbon laid down these criteria as a separate pillar in its development.
The work programme of the Netherlands Presidency appears to ignore this.
It proposes a series of measures to reduce administrative controls of the market, to reduce costs, even hinting at increased working times, but it makes no reference to social viability.
In other words, the Netherlands Presidency implies, in a way, that liberalising the market will automatically create jobs.
This, however, is precisely the philosophy that Lisbon refutes, which is why it emphasises the rest.
Therefore, what we want from the Netherlands Presidency is to hear specific policies on full employment and sustainable developments: simple things.
As far as the financial perspectives are concerned, it is hypocritical of all of us to say that we need cohesion targets and market integration without, at the same time, increasing the budget of own resources.
We cannot have it both ways.
For us, 1.24% of GDP is the minimum threshold for financing the new European Union.
As far as immigration is concerned, if I understood correctly and did not misunderstand the views of the Netherlands Presidency, you can address it primarily as a police matter and look on immigrants as criminal elements.
In other words, you can instigate fear in immigrants, instead of primarily integrating them.
However, the emphasis on police work, rather than on integration in the programme is particularly worrying: it is a vicious circle which will bring about racism and crime.
Finally, as far as terrorism is concerned, of course we all know what it is and we all want to combat it, but we cannot have a work programme of a Presidency of the European Union which only talks about police measures and makes no reference to the human rights and personal freedoms which these measures often infringe.
We, in Greece, experienced this problem on a daily basis during preparations for the 2004 Olympic Games and we are trying to strike the right balance.
The Netherlands Presidency should therefore do likewise and stop focusing solely on policing.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, those who bear responsibility at the outset of things â Mr President-in-Office of the Council â have a decisive influence on what happens in later years.
Mistakes made at the outset, or a failure to successfully carry out the programme of work, amount to liabilities for later Presidencies.
Yours is a double responsibility in that your Presidency of the Council coincides with the beginning of a new Parliament and the allocation of portfolios to a new Commission.
While this is an opportunity for continuity and for adjustments, you have also taken on long-standing liabilities, and so there are two things I call upon you to do: one is to put a stop to the Councilâs blocking of a decision on the Membersâ Statute and give us, by the end of this year, the Membersâ Statute that we have demanded.
Secondly, we need a new system for travel expenses, for only then will we be able to practically implement the new travel costs arrangements that we have decided on.
The second burden you have shouldered is that of the declining turnout of voters to the European elections.
What we need is for regions, Member States and European institutions to adopt a uniform strategy for information and communication.
This is where the signing of the Constitutional Treaty offers you an opportunity; use it as the beginning of a professional information and communication campaign.
Rather than have this great European project returned to the national level, see to it that there is a Europe-wide referendum.
Use the Financial Perspective to plan political priorities up to 2013, use the consideration of the Commissionâs report on Turkish accession to have a debate on the European Unionâs geographical boundaries and on what it is capable of doing, and produce alternatives to full membership for Turkey.
And, in order that we may speedily conclude the road-pricing directive, I ask you to bring the Council round to a single line on transport policy.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have little time, and so I will not go into the reunification of Europe, in respect of which, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you quite rightly indicated that confidence is the key word, although it is not because it is necessary that it is adequate, but I am sure you do not need me to tell you that.
I will also refrain from saying anything about the composition of the new Commission, even though I hope that, together with the Commissionâs new president-designate, you will, in tandem, strive to form a strong team, and will also succeed in doing so.
Needless to say, that should be a strong team of men and women.
Neither will I say anything about the Constitution, the ratification of which, I do of course hope, along with many fellow Members here, will really be brought on track.
I would like to sketch out three other points.
First of all, the financial perspectives.
In Flanders, we have a saying âde gierigheid bedriegt de wijsheidâ â penny-wise, pound-foolish.
There is a lot of truth in that, and I am convinced that people north of the border, and even in the north of Holland, will understand this.
Secondly, the Lisbon objective.
It is important for everyone, including Member States, citizens, trade unions and NGOs, to be convinced that the efforts required to achieve these objectives are actually quite small compared to the risks for the future generation of our possibly doing nothing quite comfortably.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are convinced of this, and I hope that you can propagate this conviction during your Presidency of the EU.
Thirdly and lastly, I should like to say a few words about the service directive.
Needless to say, barriers to the free movement of services in the internal market should disappear.
That does not mean, however, that everything has to be thrown out, that all protective and corrective measures have to be done away with.
In my view, at least part of this service sector is socially too delicate for such action.
Mr President, your workload is considerable.
I hope that you can achieve your ambition.
Europe needs this.
You can count on our constructive attitude and I wish you every success.
Â Â  Mr President, speaking as a European Democrat, it is about time that the Lisbon strategy of driving forward competitiveness and innovation in European economies be properly implemented.
Can the presidency deliver?
That is the question.
As European debates become more idealistic and polarised many people are simply turned off, as evidenced in the recent European elections.
Policies adopted by socialist governments have stunted the growth of economies and drowned us and our vital businesses in costly regulatory frameworks.
The world economies outside Europe will show no mercy to us, nor should we expect them to.
They will exploit our weaknesses and our citizens will suffer as a result.
The demographic time-bomb is ticking, as more people become unproductive too soon.
Nonsensical ageism removes experience and expertise often where and when it is most needed.
The response from all of us must be direct and urgent.
We must re-energise economies, cut the cost of the state, cut superfluous regulations, complete the single market, and encourage innovation to revive the manufacturing sector in particular.
Above all we have to show the people that Europe is working in a friendly way: supporting them, not smothering them, giving them more freedom to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of those close to and around them, and to achieve their aspirations in the medium and long term.
That is our first duty and we should discharge it.
I wish them well in the presidency.
Â Â  . Mr President, let us begin by once again expressing our thanks and appreciation to Commission President Prodi and his Commissioners.
You have rightly pointed out that much has been achieved over the last few years: the euro, enlargement, the new Constitutional Treaty and, in this, the Commission too has played an important part.
For this, very many thanks, and I look forward to working with you until the inauguration of the new Commission.
You have heard words of appreciation, from Mr Poettering for example, who is also proposing to upgrade you where the team photograph of the European Council is concerned â the same goes for the President of the European Parliament for that matter.
It seems a good idea to me to take another closer look at this.
I would also like to thank the speakers for their contributions.
Thank you for the support you have expressed for the Netherlands Presidency, but also thank you for your critical observations.
When I spoke earlier, I said that criticism is not at all bad, it is part and parcel of democracy.
Far more serious is indifference, and today I have seen no indifference at all, and that means that we are engaged on the same thing here today and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Then Mr Watson told us that it is indeed a short Presidency â three-and-a-half months in fact â in part because of the summer recess.
This means that we must work effectively during our Presidency, and of course it also means that, for this reason, we are glad to be working with you, for example as regards progress in the legislative process.
On behalf of the Minister of European Affairs, I should also like to appeal to you to cooperate as much as you can on this legislative process.
Then you said that you have just under ten minutes.
I have had 26 speakers, which would work out at around 23 seconds per speaker.
It seems better to me to combine the subjects somewhat, and I would like to do this with reference to three subjects that you also mentioned.
I believe that there are three important things for the Europe of the future.
First of all, credibility and fair play, secondly, being forward looking and thirdly, having time for the citizens of Europe.
Firstly, something about the subject of credibility and fair play: let us begin with the discussions of the Copenhagen criteria.
If criteria have been laid down, then they must be taken seriously.
This is true for a country such as Romania.
I have spoken to Prime Minister Nastase about this.
It is their move, and they will have to change their legislation and other things.
The same credibility and fair play must characterise the debate about Turkey.
I have listened carefully to you.
There are different views in the European Parliament, but at the moment I would like to say: let us pay heed to consistency in decision-making and procedures.
The term ââ has been mentioned here, and it is all about an honest process in which we are strict in the verification of the criteria, but at the same time do not change the rules during the game.
This means, moreover, that we shall listen with interest to the findings of the European Commission when the report on Turkey is published at the beginning of October and this will also set the tone for the decision-making in December.
The Netherlands Presidency is working on a decision so that, in a few years, people will be able to say: it was a tenable decision and it was the right decision.
Again where credibility and fair play are concerned, a brief word about the Stability Pact.
Many of you have spoken about this as well.
As far as the Presidency is concerned, the Stability Pact is not simply a matter of a few criteria, it is about the goals that are sought with them, and I have, for example, heard that there has been talk of the future reliable funding of pensions; it is important to look at the objectives behind the Pact again and, partly for this reason, a declaration about the Stability Pact has been attached to the recently agreed Constitutional Treaty that once again confirms that it is a ârule-based systemâ and that we must also take these criteria seriously.
The debates will of course continue; the Commission is working on it, and we shall also be discussing it further at the level of Ecofin, and the debate about this will undoubtedly continue with you too.
It is of course important that we take the rules seriously precisely in view of the credibility of Europe.
A third point concerns the ratification of Europeâs Constitutional Treaty.
Many of you have spoken about the referendums to be held, the debates that will take place.
Let me first consider what Mr Blokland has said.
He says: are we not running too far ahead of the new constitution?
I do not think that we can run ahead of it to the extent that no decisions are being taken that have a legal basis in the constitution.
That means that you cannot run ahead of it, out of respect for the ratification process.
On the other hand we can also see that 25 governments have ranged themselves behind the constitution, and the constitution is going to be signed in Rome on 29 October.
That too is a political fact; we are going to have to take account of the ambitions in the constitution in our planning.
This is true for example of the discussion of public access â Mrs Buitenweg spoke about this.
It is of course true that matters will be settled once there is a new treaty, but we can see what â even running ahead of it â we ought to be able to do.
There has also been some discussion of whether we should not work on a referendum on a single day.
Moreover, I understand this wish.
This point has been raised regularly by Austria too.
I should, however, refer to the fact that the constitutional traditions are different.
The position of a referendum is not the same in each Member State. For this reason too it will not, I think, be possible to organise everything on one day, simply on the grounds of the different constitutional traditions.
On the other hand, it is important that we have time for coordination, for a proper debate and, in that context too, there will be discussions with one another about it in connection with RASEP.
Where credibility and fair play are concerned, another brief word about the financial perspectives.
We all know that this is a sensitive subject, with major differences of opinion.
Reference has been made to a letter about the 1%.
I am not standing here as the Dutch Prime Minister.
I am standing here as the President of the European Council, who is responsible for a fair process in which the different arguments are exchanged.
A process that must be characterised by openness and transparency.
A process that will also have to be characterised by good contacts with your Parliament.
I know that you appreciate the intensive involvement of Parliament and, as part of the conciliation, agreements were made on 16 July about contacts between the Presidency and the European Parliament.
I think that there is a need to have an honest debate about posteriority and about priorities, about the question of how we could also do things differently in Europe, and I think that we should also heed the observation from Flanders, âpenny-wise and pound-foolishâ.
I have listened carefully to you.
On the other hand, we must also always see that we apply the funds as best we can, are efficient and that we also see how, sometimes with the same money, we can achieve more.
All these elements must have their place in an honest and open debate.
I now come to my second point: being forward looking.
For I have so clearly sensed in your contributions that you are saying âlet us have time for the Europe of the twenty-first century, time for the futureâ.
Many speakers have spoken about the importance of the European economy and the strengthening of the economic structure and, in that context, you have asked for a lot of attention for the Lisbon process.
Mrs In 't Veld for example has raised this in no uncertain terms.
It is good to say again that the Lisbon process will have to be characterised by three elements: it is about growth and about the strengthening of technology, of knowledge and of innovation.
Secondly, it must be about social cohesion, the social cohesion of which Mr Wurtz, Mr Poettering, Mr Schulz and others have spoken.
I have also nearly already had a debate with Mr van den Berg, my esteemed countryman, who made a number of critical remarks.
Moreover, after Mr Schulz had already said let us have time for social cohesion, you said again âhow does that fit in with this agendaâ?
May I remind you of Mr Kokâs report, the first Kok report of the employment task force, the âjobs, jobs, jobsâ report.
In my view a good connection is made in that report between dynamism in Europe and social content and, in preparation for the discussion here and in preparation for our work, I have this week also had discussions with the representatives of the European trade union movement.
I asked them whether they can identify with that first Kok report, the report of the employment task force, and I had a positive response to the content of this report from the Secretary-General of the European trade union movement.
It seems to me that we could go a long way with the content of this report.
My third point is sustainability.
When I spoke earlier, I referred to the importance of concern for the environment.
This too is part of the Lisbon agenda; and, if we are talking about strengthening the economy, then, Mr van den Berg, this includes doing justice to reduction of the administrative burden.
We all know that it is sometimes difficult to be innovative and to be successful even as a company.
We may then do very well to take a look at this administrative burden.
I am looking forward to a good debate with you about this very important subject, because we can talk about a treaty, we can talk about the citizen, but it is in the interest of this citizen that there are more jobs in Europe, that there are opportunities for our children and grandchildren and that, in 30 or 40 years, Europe will still be in a strong position, on the global stage as well.
It is indeed a combination of growth, of social cohesion and of sustainability.
A second point, when it comes to Europeâs focus upon the future, concerns the Justice and Home Affairs Council agenda: doing justice to the constitutional state in Europe, responding to security and fighting terrorism.
Mr Schulz has rightly said âmake sure that the institutions are in orderâ.
In this context you referred specifically to the director of Europol.
Last Monday it was decided that the procedure should be restarted, and there is a commitment from all the Member States that, precisely because of the arguments you mentioned, a new director should be appointed during the Netherlands Presidency.
You are quite right: if you are working on security, then the institutions have to be in order.
Of course it goes further when we talk about the Justice and Home Affairs Council agenda.
There will have to be a follow-up to the Tampere process.
We shall, for example, have to ensure that the discussion of asylum and migration can be moved forward.
Mention has been made of whether we should not have more QMV, majority decision-making, and I think that it is good to say again that the general aspiration is of course towards QMV.
However, we are of course dependent on the Member States and when there is more room for manoeuvre, then this area too will become easier.
I have listened carefully to you, to Mrs Buitenweg for example, who is critical of a directive relating to asylum.
We were aware of your point of view, and here you have raised it once more in no uncertain terms.
The point now is that there is a directive requiring asylum seekers to have a right to an actual legal remedy.
Moreover, the question of whether an appeal must have standard suspensive effect is left to the Member States, as you know.
How does that happen, because the different legal systems vary enormously?
Which is why this formula has been chosen.
If, moreover, there is no question of a standard suspensive effect of an appeal, then the directive requires that the Member States determine when an asylum seeker can ask for suspensive effect.
With regard to the question of whether it is possible first to expel asylum seekers and only then to allow them to lodge an appeal, I would say the following: the directive states that all regulations must be in conformity with international law, including the European Human Rights Treaty.
The standards that are contained therein and in the jurisprudence of the Court will therefore have to be observed.
Then it is good to refer to another point, the point about the constitutional state, and in this context Mr Schulz has referred to Guantanamo Bay.
This subject has your interest and rightly so.
The European Union has always demonstrated its concern about the situation in Guantanamo Bay and, on several occasions and at several levels in its contacts with the United States, has spoken out in favour of the treatment of the detainees meeting the standards of the Geneva Conventions and human rights.
Just last week there was consultation at official level between the European Union and the United States in which the US explained the setting up of combatant status review tribunals following the recent judgments of the American Supreme Court.
The EU representatives passed on the concerns that remain on the European side, including those relating to the creation of a new category of detainees, the so-called hostile combatants.
You are aware of this.
In its contacts with the United States, the Netherlands Presidency will keep seeking attention for the concerns that exist regarding the status and treatment of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay.
Finally, I come to my last point, and you have said it clearly, it is about the Europe of the citizen.
How does the citizen experience Europe?
What does Europe mean for welfare, for the prosperity of citizens?
I then discern two voices.
One voice says: we see mistrust in the citizen, there is euroscepticism.
Is there sufficient support in the population, for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy for example?
That was one sign, the critical comment.
On the other hand there are also voices â Mr Eurlingsâ was a very clear one â in favour of an efficient Union with the ability to take action, and I would like to underline his words; if we want Europe to mean something to the citizen, then we must make progress in the areas of security, asylum issues, the economy, subjects that must be taken up with vigour, and I believe that you gain the trust of the citizen when Europe is a living force that can operate with authority and that contributes to the resolution of issues that concern the citizen.
That is what it is all about.
What appealed to me in the words of Mr Poettering was that he said let us also have time for the psychological dimension, because we have a Europe of 25, and Member States and people must be able to identify with the other Europe, and it is good to bring this psychological side closer from time to time, because we are so accustomed to talking in terms of what does Europe cost me, what does Europe do for me, how are the finances doing?
However, let us also have time for the question of what makes us Europeans?
What is the psychological side of it all?
What are the values in Europe that bind us?
Often we have far too little time for this.
I noticed in 2002 on the eve of enlargement that there was a kind of enthusiasm about us becoming one again and, afterwards, we were talking worldwide about Iraq and difficult issues, but let us ensure that the European fire lives in people, that Europe is not something abstract, something belonging to bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg or even to ourselves, but that it is something that lives in the hearts and minds of people.
In my view that will also be the attitude if you talk about values in Europe.
We shall take initiatives on this point.
Freedom, solidarity and respect.
You are dedicating yourselves to the community of values of the twenty-first century and, as President of the European Council, I am very conscious that, when it comes to progress in the area of the fight against terrorism, a powerful implementation of the Lisbon strategy, having time for the follow-up to Tampere and all those other subjects, we can only be successful when we have a high level of cooperation between your Parliament, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council, and therefore I am so delighted with the contributions you have made this morning and this afternoon, not only your observations of support, but also your critical observations.
I have listened carefully to the critical observations; they were probing, and we shall take them into account in our Presidency.
If we are having a discussion here, it is not for its own sake or because we are working simply as politicians.
We are doing all this with a view to the interests of citizens.
This is what it is all about, and this is what we are dedicating ourselves to.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, just a word of thanks, partly to prevent the Members from dying of starvation.
I thank Prime Minister Balkenende for his speech, his response and especially for the cooperation with which his term has begun.
We have started to work together and we are in perfect agreement as to our objectives.
I should just like to make two recommendations.
First, when we talk of the Financial Perspective we really must remember that the Commission has made an incredible effort to put on the table the minimum resources needed to achieve the objectives that the Member States have given us and to use these resources in the best way possible.
Secondly, the Commission has listened very carefully to the dialogue of cultures.
Over these years, we in the Commission have been deeply committed and have succeeded in setting up the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for a Dialogue of Cultures, which will begin its work under the Dutch Presidency.
I ask you to launch this instrument, to use it and to really make it a forum for the active dialogue that we need.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  . â The declarations by the Netherlands Presidency on its work programme are a provocation to the workers and peoples of the European Union.
The speedier and more efficient promotion of capitalist restructurings, the changes in the labour market and to working times, further privatisation of public-sector services, pressure for new reductions to pensions and leaner social security systems and insistence on the Lisbon strategy and anti-grass roots policies in general demonstrate once again that the ÎU only serves big business.
The shaping of the Tampere strategy and the promotion of new measures to repress the grass-roots movement which blatantly infringe personal and social freedoms, such as personal files on workers, monitoring all telecommunications, handing data over to the USA and strengthening the prosecuting and intelligence authorities on the pretext of terrorism, are all meeting with vigorous reaction on the part of the workers and the legal world.
The strengthening of the mercenary European army, its now definitive presence in the Balkans, the creation of direct intervention units and the synchronised defence of the new order and imperialist interests by the EU and the USA, run counter to the will of the people for peace and social progress.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn this policy and stand by and with the grass-roots movement in its fight against these measures.

Â Â  Mr President, I want to sympathise with you as I assume that, because of the time of day, you also encountered the problem that I and a number of other colleagues experienced in trying to get to this vote this afternoon.
Could you try to get the services to do something about the state of the lifts in this building?
I and other colleagues waited ten minutes for a lift down to this floor.
If there is a vote taking place and it is a normal procedure, a ten-minute wait means that we will be late for the vote.
We came out as soon as the bell rang for a vote.
Could you try to get something sorted out so that we can restrict access to main lifts during voting sessions to Members only?
That seems to be the problem.
Â Â  We take note of your comment and we shall try to resolve any material problem that hinders the proper functioning of this House.
Â Â  It shall appear thus in the Minutes.
Â Â  .
Mr President, my dear JosÃ©, I warmly congratulate you on your election. I wish you and the institution you preside over every success.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall not be taking the same tone as the previous speaker.
My problem is not so much the Council as the policy that the future Commission President will follow.
My group has appreciated the readiness with which MrÂ Barroso has submitted to this crossfire, this barrage of questions from Members who were not among his closest political friends. This capacity for dialogue is a real quality, but it does not of course hide the well-known differences there are between us over the essential directions of European integration.
Economically and socially, Mr Barroso is a liberal.
He has amply demonstrated that in the exercise of his national responsibilities.
Even though the choices he made as Head of the Portuguese Government do not automatically mean he will take identical decisions in the European offices for which he is proposed, they clearly show where his preferences lie.
They are revealing.
I would have liked Mr Barroso to have told us about the lessons he has drawn from his national experience for his European mandate, if he receives it.
The severe cuts in public expenditure, including on education, in Portugal, for example, or the uncompromising application to the hospital sector of management criteria commonly used in private enterprise. Some have described it as shock therapy.
If it was a real shock to the population, I think the truth is that the therapy itself is more than debatable for the economy of a country that has undergone a severe recession and is suffering from a chronic lack of investment in human resources despite these being the key to modern development.


What is your assessment of that experience, Mr Barroso?
Do you think that is the way forward, or should we close our ears to the liberal siren song?







Up until now, we have been less familiar with Mr Barrosoâs big international policy options, apart from one far from minor one which projected him on to the world stage; I am speaking of the famous Azores Summit of March 2003, of sad memory for us.



I have already had occasion to emphasise what the question of war and peace meant for our group and I will not return to it. I will say in more general terms that in my opinion for all the major positions of responsibility within the Union we need men and women who are prepared to consider far-reaching challenges to the severe trends that are plunging Europe into crisis before our very eyes and making it helpless in the face of many of the worldâs problems.
We are not suffering from an excess of lucidity in this regard but rather from a cruel lack of critical intellect that means we do not have a vision for the future that is capable of motivating us.
The world needs Europe, but a different Europe. We know that six million â yes, six million â people died of Aids, tuberculosis or malaria last year, that global warming is advancing much faster than the measures devised to contain it, not to mention that those measures are not being adhered to, that there are a billion people without jobs, that one human being in six has no access to drinking water, that war is brewing in the Middle East, continuing in Chechnya and bathing Darfur in blood; it is therefore our duty, at whatever level decisions are taken in Europe, to see further than the market and further, too, than mere Atlantic solidarity.
That, I think, is the challenge Europe has to face today. We really are not up to it.
That is why, if we refuse to put our confidence in Mr Barroso tomorrow, that will not be a vote against an individual, it will be the expression of a universal call for change.
Â Â  The results and the low turnout in the recent elections to the European Parliament demonstrated that there is enormous dissatisfaction with, and alienation from, the Community policies and moves towards integration enshrined in the European Constitution.
No one wants to admit that a policy of indifference continues to be pursued in the face of the worsening economic and social situation, turning a blind eye to high levels of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion and an increase in social inequity, and a deaf ear to the protests of workers threatened by relocation and restructuring by multinationals.
We cannot ignore the situation in the Middle East, in Iraq and in Palestine, and the consequences of an absurd, illegal and unjust war, nor can we maintain a policy of following in the wake of the Bush administration's American imperialism or maintain an ambiguous attitude towards Sharon and his state terrorism.
We cannot accept that the candidate for the position of President of the Commission, DrÂ DurÃ£o Barroso, should be telling us to expect more of the same, despite the fact that we now have ten more Member States in a difficult economic and social situation, which means that we should be giving priority to social issues, and to an in-depth review of our economic and social policies, paying particular attention to the new Financial Perspectives and to a significant strengthening of them.
The formula that he is proposing continues to be based on the Lisbon strategy, but the only decisions taken there that have elicited a positive response have been liberalisation and privatisation.
It is unacceptable that in the name of so-called competitiveness emphasis should be placed on flexible and precarious working arrangements, on reducing wage costs and on wage moderation, on attacking public services, in short on the neo-liberal agenda of economic and financial groups, instead of focusing on living and working conditions, on sustainable development, on greater economic, social and territorial cohesion, on high-quality jobs combined with full rights, and on restoring public and social investment, particularly in the railways, health services, the environment, education and research.
This requires a review of economic and monetary policies, a halt to liberalisation, and a review of the Stability Pact, failing which we cannot fight poverty and ensure social inclusion and a high quality of life for the entire population. This implies revisiting the Commission's mandate within the World Trade Organisation to defend fair trade, food sovereignty, European industry and jobs in particularly vulnerable areas, and in particular sensitive traditional sectors such as textiles, glass-making, the extractive industries and shipbuilding, which involves giving dignity to workers, adopting measures to promote equal rights and opportunities, and placing welfare, social progress, stronger democracy, cooperation and peace at the heart of decision-making on Community policies.
That is why we shall be voting against DrÂ DurÃ£o Barroso tomorrow, which will also represent a vote against the policies that he has presented to us here.
Â Â  The President was in fact right that Catalan, like Sorbian, a language spoken close to my Berlin constituency, is not an official language, neither an official language of the European Union nor a working language.
We can however work on getting minority languages made official languages so long as we provide the necessary capacities.
Mr Poettering would be willing to agree to my home cityâs Berlin dialect as an official language. Thank you very much for that.

Â Â  First of all, I would like to say well done Portugal, congratulations on your football team.
There is no doubt that your players were the best in Euro 2004.
Nevertheless, they did not win.
Unfortunately, at this point you are not the best player in the political game, but you are going to win.
We know that the world is not fair.
Â Â  DrÂ DurÃ£o Barroso, just as in other speeches you have made to this House, your message today was one of fresh hope.
In your address you managed to touch upon issues such as terrorism, environmental degradation, an ageing population, regional and social asymmetry, the problem of long-term unemployment, the alienation of the public from the European project and issues relating to the approval of the Constitutional Treaty and the Lisbon strategy. You also referred, by omission, to the feebleness of our Common Foreign and Security Policy, and were also wise enough to mention the serious problems we are going to have to confront as regards the diversity and complexity of a Europe of 25, and before long one of 27 or 28.
It is against this background that it is essential to nurture the idea that it is possible, in the face of all these challenges, to achieve consensus, to establish dialogue and to build bridges, and to do so without dogmatism or prejudice, while making available to everyone, rich or poor, large or small, new or old, the option of helping us to define relevant parameters and objectives for Europe. I would quite simply say that we need a Delors-style Commission, a Commission with leadership and ambition, but also an effective Commission.
DrÂ DurÃ£o Barroso, weak people do not go down in history â they never have done.
I know your qualities, I know what you are capable of, and I know your determination, your common sense and your moderation.
Combined with your youth and your love of parliamentary debate, I am convinced that your term of office will usher in a new era in Europe, and a new partnership between Parliament and the Commission that is vital if Europe is to move forward, to carry on building and to assert itself. I therefore have a question for you: I would like you to tell us in greater detail about your ideas for a relationship between a strong Commission and a European Parliament that we also wish to see becoming ever stronger.
Â Â  Madam President, Candidate for the Commission Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, what is at stake with tomorrowâs vote?
As many have already said, tomorrow is about our trust.
It is a vote of confidence.
Do we have the confidence that the Councilâs candidate will be up to the tasks that await us in the next five years?
Do we trust him to play his part correctly as guardian of the Treaties amid the constant tension between Council, Parliament and Commission? I would like to say loud and clear that I trust the candidate and I am sure that a majority in this House will be able to place the same justified confidence in him.
At the same time, I would like to point out, however, that the issue is also that this confidence must not be abused.
Is the candidate capable of maintaining his independence when it comes to putting his team together?
I do not think it is acceptable that there are and were Member States who made their assent to you, Mr Barroso, conditional on having particular wishes granted in the allocation of Commission portfolios, but I am confident that you are independent enough for that not to happen automatically.
You have said as much very clearly today.
We are now entering a period where we will no longer be in a permanent Intergovernmental Conference but where we shall have to bring this European idea to life politically.
Over the next few months, we will of course have to draw up the work programme together.
In that connection, I hope that you and the European Parliament will cooperate closely and there, too, I am confident that you will make that cooperation a success, because we will have a lot of questions to answer together.
Subsidiarity: how can we bring this concept to life, how can we ensure that rules are only created where Europe is really involved and that in all other cases the Member States, regions and local authorities can continue to act as they think fit? How can we help to make Europe more competitive?
There, too, I would ask you, when you are in office in the Commission, to give some thought to whether there are not proposals from the old Commission that deserve to be withdrawn. The policy on chemicals, for example.
It does not fit in with the Lisbon process of âincreasing competitivenessâ and surely needs to be rethought.
I might mention the Budget Regulation. We are suffering because we are no longer able to do what the legislator, Parliament and Council, decide in the budget because the Budget Regulation, the Commission, puts so many shackles on us in the administration that the legislatorâs intentions can no longer be carried out.
We are looking to you for initiatives here and I therefore hope that you will not abuse this trust, but that together we will be able to ensure that Europe makes progress in the next five years and will therefore in five yearsâ time, too, regain the citizensâ confidence.

Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the debate on the statement by the President-designate of the Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this legislative period, our Parliament has to take on a new role, one that is also prefigured in the draft of the constitutional treaty.
It is generally said that this treaty will give the House new rights; on closer examination, it appears that this House gains a role for itself only when it can rely on an absolute majority of its Members in doing its job.
That is particularly the case when it is engaged in making laws.
Only if Parliament acts with an absolute majority does it play its part in the triangle of power formed by it, the Commission and the Council.
Such, it is becoming apparent, is the constitutional reality in this House, and there are political conclusions to which we must come as a result.
In the past, it was all too often the case that Parliament was ground down between the Council and the Commission, for lack of any solid majority, and because either the Council or the Commission could play Parliament off against the other.
For that reason, we are convinced that we in this House must, from now on, make the effort to take up a position and also accept our responsibilities.
That presupposes political cooperation in this House.
Looking at the relative strengths of our political groups, it is inevitable that even the two big ones will have to consider whether they can cooperate with each other, and, if so, in which areas.
The fact is that, numerically speaking, that is the only way in which a majority in this House will come into being, and that is why we are presented with the unaccustomed sight of parties that, in their domestic, indigenous, national reality are as a rule the complete natural antithesis of each other â Socialists on the one hand, Christian Democrats and Conservatives on the other â attempting in this House to work together from time to time, which, in many cases, evokes misgivings back home.
Here, though, politically speaking, the natural order of things is different.
I do not think we should allow the rules whereby we come to decisions to be subject to merely national considerations.
We should possess sufficient self-confidence to make it clear that we have ways of coming to policy decisions that differ from the national, indigenous realities of our nation states.
For that reason, we urge the need to attempt to establish solid majorities, for only then will Parliament, along with the Commission and the Council, be able to play a part in the triangle of power.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Barroso, as chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I must say one thing to you today.
For ourselves in the PSE Group, the vote we are to have in a few hoursâ time is not a chance occurrence.
It is not an impulsive act.
It is the result of a carefully planned hearing in which, MrÂ Barroso, we put a list of very practical questions to you which are of absolutely crucial importance to social democratic populations throughout Europe.
We did not spare you.
We put some tough questions to you because we are serious about the issues on which we stood for election in the European Parliament elections in June.
MrÂ Barroso, we have listened with great care to what you have said to us.
We have taken note of your answers, and I have to say today that you have used the right words.
You have said what we wanted to hear but, even though the right words about solidarity, progress and security are important, they are not enough.
They must be accompanied by practical and specific political content and focused action and by programmes that are politically binding and that the people of each of the European countries can use in their day-to-day lives.
MrÂ Barroso, we are concerned here with more and better jobs and with European cooperation that strengthens the social security that people feel is under threat.
In an international context, we are concerned with cooperation that combines economic efficiency with social security and more jobs.
It is not a case of first the one and then the other, but of both at the same time and in the same place.
As Portuguese Prime Minister, MrÂ Barroso, you in practice pursued the opposite policy to that which is fundamental to us in the PSE Group.
We would therefore ask you again today, MrÂ Barroso, if, firstly, you are going to commit yourself to reforming â and I emphasise the word âreformingâ â the Stability and Growth Pact so that we obtain more and better jobs.
Secondly, will you today genuinely commit yourself to pursuing the objectives we set ourselves and decided upon four years ago in Lisbon concerning progress in employment, social security, education and equality between men and women?
Thirdly, will you genuinely ensure that European enlargement becomes a day-to-day reality for people?
MrÂ Barroso, we have the market.
We do not have the policies.
You have not so far provided us with clear answers.
We are anxious to hear whether we are to be given them today.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Barroso, allow me firstly to congratulate you on your nomination to the post of future President of the European Commission, and allow me also to make a few comments on three points I believe to be important.
Firstly, on the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President, secondly, on the common foreign and security policy and, thirdly, on diversity, subsidiarity and shared sovereignties in the European Union.
Firstly, the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President.
For the moment, you have been nominated by the Heads of Government, by the European Council, and it falls to this Parliament, to this House, to approve your nomination, which will finally be ratified, together with that of the other members of the Commission, by the Governments of the Member States.
With the new Constitutional Treaty, which will enter into force during these five years of your coming term in office, and also that of this Parliament, this issue is going to change, and it will be the European Council which, taking account of the result of the elections, will propose to Parliament the candidate to be elected President of the Commission, who will then be elected by the European Parliament.
I believe this to be a step forward, although I do not yet consider it to be a decisive step.
I would like to ask you, Mr Barroso, whether you believe that, with the new Constitutional Treaty, the Commission is really going to become a genuine executive government for the Union; whether you believe that, when the citizens vote in the elections to the European Parliament, they are truly going to feel that their vote is decisive and that with it they are going to be electing a President who will govern the Union over the coming years.
We have had an entirely negative experience, because turnout has been extremely low.
I believe this is because the citizens have not felt that their vote would achieve this.
Secondly, you hosted the meeting in the Azores which determined the invasion and war in Iraq.
I would like to ask you whether, in your new post, if a similar situation arose, you would allow individual Member States of the European Union to take a similar decision without having first consulted the Council, without there previously being a common position amongst all the Member States of the European Union.
And thirdly, with regard to diversity, this Constitutional Treaty talks about the powers of the European institutions and also of the state institutions.
It talks about the Union's exclusive competences and about shared competences, but there is real diversity within the Union which has not been considered: the stateless nations and the constitutional regions, which have competences which the central governments of the States cannot decide upon.
What do you intend to do during your mandate to genuinely integrate the Union's true cultural and institutional diversity into the European Union?
Â Â  â Mr President-designate, you are aware that my group has decided not to support your candidature.
We have misgivings that you will be the Councilâs man, somehow put there by the Council to weaken the Commission.
It will be up to you to show that we are wrong and, as we are open-minded, we shall be quite ready to admit that we were wrong.
I should like to take the opportunity to underline three issues about which, if you are elected, we shall really keep bothering you.
You said that being the Portuguese Prime Minister and the President of the Commission are two different things and, when you were the Portuguese Prime Minister, you said that if there should be a war between Saddam Hussein and the United States the choice clearly had to be the United States.
Â Â  I would ask the honourable Members to be seated and to allow the sitting to proceed normally.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am just coming to the point that justifies this demonstration, which for us is very important.
I believe my fellow Members have the right to know â although I think most of them do already â why we chose to make ourselves visible like this to Mr Barroso.
Right now in the Council there are nine governments that are in favour of authorising the entry of new genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the European Union; nine are against and seven are abstaining.
This means that the Council is unable to express a position.
Eighty per cent of public opinion is against GMOs.
The current Commission has nonetheless decided to use its powers and systematically authorise new GMOs, with incalculable consequences for the quality of our products and for European agriculture.
MrÂ Barroso, we believe this is a very serious mistake.
What is more, the current Environment Commissioner thinks it is unnecessary to label seed contaminated with less than 0.5% GMOs, thus contradicting the European Parliamentâs position which was passed by a huge majority at the end of the last parliamentary term.
Within a few years, then, all organic and non-organic crops will be contaminated.
I am very well aware that you are not keen on this topic, and you told us this quite clearly during our meeting by hiding a little behind the notes that the Commission and its staff had prepared for you.
Even so, if you are elected, we invite you really to look closely at this matter; we ask you to be brave and open-minded enough to change the current Commissionâs attitude.
We ask you not to bow to the multinational lobbies or our Big Brother in the United States, because it is our Big Brother who wants to call the shots on these issues.
MrÂ President-designate, if I may I should like to return to the matter I was talking about before: the war in Iraq.
I should like to ask you to give us some idea about the future in your reply.
Unfortunately, when you came to see us, you did not succeed in getting beyond a complaint about your decision as Prime Minister of Portugal to support the war.
I ask you, therefore, also regarding the relationship that the Commission should have with the United States, to tell us what political subject you, as President of the future Commission, have in mind for your relationship with the United States.
At the moment, we as the European Union have our own independent position on a number of subjects and I should like to know how you intend to act on foreign policy, particularly on issues on which we hold distinct views, such as GuantÃ¡namo Bay, the WTO and Kyoto, because your replies have been rather vague and come more from the Portuguese Prime Minister than from the future President of the Commission.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, no change can ever be brought about without constant and open consultation with the people affected by that change.
Our absurd experiences in Central Europe of the exercise of power have been described both in HaÅ¡ekâs novel âThe Good Soldier Å vejkâ and in Robert Musilâs âThe Man Without Qualitiesâ.
It all began with the Habsburg monarchy, which was in some respects similar to the present-day European Union.
During the peaceful seventy-year reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I, a committee was set up to search for a big idea for the monarchy.
War broke out, the Emperor died, but the committee continued its work.
It continued to search for a big idea whilst ignoring the views of entire nations.
The situation has also changed for us.
The old European Union has ceased to exist; the new European Union must be far more flexible, more cost-effective and more transparent to its citizens.
I fear, however, that the Commission has up to now behaved and continues to behave exactly like the committee set up to glorify Emperor Franz Joseph Iâs seventy-year reign of peace.
Karel Äapek said of the modern era that the end has been replaced by the means.
We are preoccupied by procedures and become involved in trifling matters, but the end goal escapes us.
I should like to ask our President-designate a question.
How will the new European Union differ from the old European Union?
What new forms of consultation with the public does the Commission intend to offer and, finally, Mr Barroso, what is your big idea for the new Europe?
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like a different voice to be heard in this Chamber.
Our Independence and Democracy Group in fact challenges the very principle behind this system, which is a carbon copy of that in use in states and involves appointing the President of the Commission as if he were a Head of Government.
The adoption of this system boils down to the European institutions functioning in exactly the same way as states, as if it were our common vocation, by means of this procedure, to inch our way towards becoming a state.
We call this system into question because we believe that the Commission cannot be anything other than a mere administrative college.
We challenge the very principle underlying this appointment, along with the new Commissionâs programme, in particular its twin objectives of Turkish entry into the European Union and the future adoption of the Constitution of a federal superstate.
I would like to take this opportunity to say that there is a connection between Turkish accession and the future Constitution, which determines power and influence by reference to population size.
For all these reasons relating to the system, the principle itself and the programme of the new Commission, our group will be voting against Mr Barrosoâs appointment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a major enlargement of the European Union took place just a few months ago.
For recent entrants to the Union, MrÂ Barrosoâs term of office will be the first full term of a President of the EuropeanÂ Commission.
This is a momentous event.
MrsÂ Muscardini, our group leader, has already stated that MrÂ Barroso can count on our full support.
I would like to assure MrÂ Barroso that he can also count on the full support of my home party in Poland, the TruthÂ andÂ Justice Party.
It is through that party that I find myself in this august assembly.
The initial challenge facing MrÂ Barroso will be to ensure the consolidation of this new-look Europe of twenty-fiveÂ MemberÂ States.
That will be the first problem he must tackle.
Of course, he will also need to ensure that the next group of candidate countries is ready for accession.
Consequently, priority must be given to economic consolidation and to levelling out the differences between countries of the so-called OldÂ Union and the New.
Two crucial issues spring to mind in this connection.
Firstly, free market principles must continue to be upheld.
This means recent entrants to the Union should not be subjected to political or practical pressure to change their systems of taxation.
That would be unacceptable, when the existing systems can create better conditions for their economies than the higher taxes levied in countries of the OldÂ Union.
The second economic issue arising is the budget.
We cannot agree to cuts in the budget. This is because after allowing for standard budget expenditure, the funds remaining for aid to recent entrants would be inadequate.
Yesterday I referred to the concerns expressed on the subject of the Constitution.
Clearly, these represent a further challenge for the next President of the Commission.
In conclusion, I shall simply remind the House of Montesquieuâs assertion that respect for local legislation and traditions is essential for the efficient operation of a centralised body.
Let us say âyesâ to mutual support and ânoâ to centralisation.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of the independent Slovak members of the peopleâs party, the HZDS, IÂ can assure Mr Barroso, that, as realists, we support his development plans, and particularly in science, research and education, aÂ limiting factor, however, in the progress of the European Union is the rationalisation of the common agricultural policy, which is aÂ highly challenging area in terms of budget.
The current common agricultural policy and the reforms to it are, alas, common only in name, since, for example, the common agricultural policy gives support to the original Member States of the EU in the form of direct payments several times greater than the amounts given to the new Member States.
As aÂ result, up to aÂ third of the market for food products in the new Member States is accounted for by products from the 15 original Member States, despite the fact that the new Member States were, until recently, net exporters of foodstuffs.
This common agricultural policy, by promoting lower levels of activity and production, significantly worsens the prospects for all of us as regards remaining competitive vis-Ã -vis third countries.
The new agricultural policy of the United States in particular is almost aggressively focused on development and expansion.
At the same time, the US is already producing food at half the cost.
After the next meeting of the WTO our position will be distinctly worse.
We are therefore prepared, Mr Barroso, to support the kind of agricultural policy that, rather than provoking administrative battles within the European Union, will enable us to concentrate our efforts on growing competitively-priced food, our own common European Union food.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on behalf of the Polish group within the Group of the EuropeanÂ Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and EuropeanÂ Democrats I would like to express our high esteem for you.
The speech you made yesterday, as well as your address to our group, the EuropeanÂ PeopleâsÂ Party, leave us in no doubt as to your ability to provide the strong leadership needed.
From the perspective of the new MemberÂ States, you hail from a distant country.
Indeed, your candidature fills us with expectation, because you come from a country that has undergone far-reaching structural changes, much like our own.
Your candidacy does bring certain questions to mind, however, which I shall now put to you.
In theory, enlargement has been successfully accomplished.
In practice, reintegration is still not a reality.
This seems to be the greatest challenge for your term of office, MrÂ Barroso.
Europe was torn apart at Yalta.
Will healing those wounds be a priority for your Presidency?
That is our first question.
You have two major tasks before you, MrÂ Barroso.
One is to uphold, nurture and develop European solidarity in its political and economic dimension.
The other relates to the Eastern dimension, which is a new dimension for the EuropeanÂ Union.
This leads me to the next question.
Do you intend to do all you can to persuade the Council to make adequate provision for the additional tasks of properly integrating the new Member States into the body of the Union through the allocation of funding in the 2007-2013 FinancialÂ Perspective?
The new Member States must be given the opportunity to make up for lost time.
Social and economic cohesion policy needs to be fostered too.
As you rightly pointed out yesterday, MrÂ Barroso, it is not possible to have more Europe for less money.
This latest enlargement was done on the cheap.
There can be no question of making further savings.
Any cuts would deprive the poorest countries in the Union of the opportunity of catching up in terms of development, an opportunity that was enjoyed by Spain, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, southern Italy and the eastern German
Unfortunately, the amendment to the Constitution agreed at the EuropeanÂ Unionâs JuneÂ Summit enables wealthier countries to block budgets they disagree with.
Hence my next question to MrÂ Barroso.
Will you retain the ProdiÂ Commissionâs proposal for 1.24% of GDP as a basis for calculating the budget?
We are also concerned that the principle of solidarity has been linked to proposals for harmonising corporate taxation across the MemberÂ States.
We cannot agree to this if it means putting pressure on recipient states by threatening them with the loss of structural funds unless they raise their already high taxes.
We call on you, MrÂ Barroso, to defend the fundamental principle of fiscal competitiveness between the MemberÂ States.
We believe this would be the best way to keep faith with the LisbonÂ Strategy.
I shall now turn to the second task, namely the Eastern dimension.
We look to you, MrÂ Barroso, to ensure guidelines are consistently adhered to, and to defend the related financial neighbourhood instrument.
The Unionâs commitment must be conditional on beneficiaries respecting human rights and the principles of the rule of law.
We hope for substantial developments in the Unionâs Eastern policy.
Nonetheless, such a policy has to be demanding, rather than permissive.
After all, our aim is to change for the better the lives of millions of people in the MediterraneanÂ Basin, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldavia and Russia.
The Portuguese have long been renowned as great mariners.
The EuropeanÂ Union is now setting sail to the east.
We trust you will have a firm hand on the wheel, MrÂ Barroso, as you steer the European Unionâs course through those uncharted waters.
Good luck.
Â Â  â Mr President, over the next five years, the European Union needs to strengthen its institutional and democratic functions.
It needs to implement an efficient development policy which targets full employment and it needs to guarantee social rights and regional and social cohesion.
It also needs to be able to speak to the world with one, strong voice as a force of peace and cooperation.
Mr Barroso, you are the President-designate of the European Commission, but the policy which you exercised as prime minister and your statements yesterday before the European Parliament do not convince us that you can respond to these priorities.
When you visited the Group of the Party of European Socialists yesterday, you told us that you are not a technocrat; you are a politician who makes political choices.
We today are making a political judgment of the economic policy of your government, which led to a dramatic drop in development and social spending and to unfortunate economic results in your country.
We are making a political judgment of your stand on the war in Iraq, your identification with the choices made by the United States and the famous meeting in the Azores.
We are making a political judgment of your choice to support a war without a United Nations resolution, causing a schism within the European Union.
We are also making a political judgment of the lack of self-criticism in your speech today, now that it has been clearly demonstrated that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
The question that I should like to put to you, as President-designate, is this: how do you believe you will respond to these major priorities of the European Union through vague proclamations when your policy, all these years, has constantly served different perceptions?
We believe that the vote for the nomination of the President of the European Commission is a political vote; it is a vote which relates to the European priorities we are setting for coming years.
That is why we are not persuaded by your political pronouncements and we are against your nomination.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-designate, my colleague Marco Pannella and I will support your appointment and we will do so primarily for institutional reasons.
We believe that only a Commission with strong parliamentary support can perform its role, which must first of all, as the Treaties themselves state, be the result of a strong connection between Parliament and the Commission.
This is a natural alliance for anyone who believes in the evolution of Europeâs institutions.
Please allow me, however, to offer a comment and a recommendation for what I hope will be strong parliamentary support.
First, you remarked on widespread Euro-apathy throughout Europe, as shown in the recent elections.
In my view, this Euro-apathy is precisely the consequence â the other side of the coin â of the apathy of the European institutions and European leadership, starting with ourselves, starting with the fact that nearly all of us campaigned on national issues, starting with the fact that we ourselves, you yourselves, the leaders of Europe themselves very often give the impression of an introverted, frightened, often paralysed Europe, a Europe that prefers to deny problems rather than tackle them and accept the associated responsibility, risks and consequences.
Without risks, leadership and responsibility, I wonder how we can have citizens who are passionate about Europe when, in the vast majority of cases, we are not passionate ourselves.
Lastly, I put an important political request to you.
You have obviously mentioned the need for an agenda for prosperity, stability, solidarity and a Europe that promotes peace and stability.
I am quite sure that nobody would want an agenda for poverty, war, instability and so on. The problem, in effect, lies in the means.
We Radicals are convinced that even prosperity, peace and stability make no sense and cannot be achieved without a strict, clear and coherent agenda to promote and support the rule of law, democracy, freedom, and civil and political rights, not only for the 400 million European citizens but also for the people of the whole world, starting with the world close to us.
It is up to you and us together to express this deep-seated conviction that there is no development without freedom, there is no peace without freedom, and there is no stability without the rule of law.
This is Europeâs identity.
We are not a religious project or a geographical project, but we are a political project based on the rule of law.
I believe this is what we should be promoting, with strength and leadership.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having listened to Mr Barroso with a great deal of interest, both here and in his hearings before our group, that of the Greens and European Free Alliance, my opinion of him has not changed.
I am still not satisfied, as you, Mr Barroso, have not responded to our questions concerning REACH, for example, which includes among our policies a bold policy on chemical products, or to our questions concerning comitology, a barbarity according political power to the Commission and not to the representatives of the people, namely ourselves.
As you will have gathered, the Greens do not accept a system that involves electing Europeâs future head by pulling a name out of a hat at the last minute.
Mr Barroso, much as I, of course, appreciate your willingness to take up the cudgels in the European cause, it really is stating the obvious to say that this House is largely pro-European.
It is on the project that our opinions differ, and by your project I am not convinced.
You headed the delegation representing the Council in Rio.
I was there too, Mr Barroso, and I do not feel that, since then â and it was fourteen years ago â you have taken on board the facts that justify a radical change of course on development matters.
I get the impression that you are not convinced that climate change calls into question our model of growth; that global warming will have indescribable consequences for Europeâs economy and the worldâs; that the energy crisis risks dragging us into conflicts right up to our own â at present peaceable â borders, if petrol runs out, which the Hubertâs peak theory confirms that it will; or, finally, that there are immeasurably more victims of environmental disasters than there are of terrorism, unacceptable though that latter figure certainly is.
It is the winner of our own Sakharov Prize, Mr Kofi Annan, who has highlighted these facts.
By their lack of interest in the latest European elections, our fellow citizens have shown that the EU is not bringing to pass the European dream that we promise them.
Your project is not equal to dealing with what is at stake for Europe and the world, or to making our fellow citizensâ European dream a reality.
Â Â  Which would you rather believe: a promise of independent relations with the United States or the fact that the candidate was photographed in the Azores with the leaders who decided to go to war?
The importance you attributed yesterday to social, environmental and cultural issues or your acknowledgement that when you were Prime Minister the important was never regarded as urgent?
Your praise for the Community method or the fact that governments including London, Bonn and Madrid have been giving precise voting instructions to their Members?
In two hours' time we shall see whether the electorate can be convinced that democracy is a system under which those who lose elections in their own country can win them in Strasbourg.
We shall see what wins the day â fine words or having the courage to accept one's responsibility.
Â Â  Madam President, my party cannot support the candidature of the President for the institution because we do not support the institution over which he desires to preside.
My constituents do not doubt the authority or the legitimacy of this democratically elected Parliament, but they do not wish to be governed by it.
They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament â and they will be during the lifetime of this Parliament.
Believe me.
For the same reasons we â and they â do not wish to see the Constitution enacted because they see it as based on obsolete economic and political theories of the 1950s, of the fear of war and an outdated threat of communism.
They see it as creating a Europe that is inward-looking, that is bureaucratic, that is restrictive, whereas we should be creating a Community that is innovative and outward-looking, that reaches out to the rest of the world, that is flexible and democratic.
That is not the institution that we are creating here in Europe today and we wish to have no part of it.
We will not support it.
My constituents do not want to see the creation of a federal state called Europe.
They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament.
They do not wish to give their destiny, their independence and their sovereignty to a group in Brussels, or indeed in Strasbourg.
Some 20 years ago Mrs Thatcher went to Fontainebleau and said: 'I want our money back' â and she got some of it.
We want our country back and, believe you me, we are going to get it.
Â Â  You naturally have the right to use the time available to you as you wish.
However, you well know, as we all do, that Irish is not a working language of the Union.
Therefore our colleagues and Mr Barroso could not understand what you said, although it sounded very nice.
You can work towards having Irish as a working language of the Union.
We will see how successful you are, along with our colleague who spoke Catalan yesterday, or my German colleagues who speak Sorbian.
Â Â  Madam President, we made arrangements that Irish would be interpreted.
It is a Treaty language and it should have that status.
I am very disappointed that those arrangements were not made and that this is the attitude of this House or its services.
I will speak English when I have to, to explain, but my own language comes first.
Â Â  I appreciate that, but at Council meetings the Irish Government will have to try to make Irish a working language, alongside English.
It is not a working language at the moment.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a non-attached MEP from a small Member State like Austria, one cannot avoid a feeling of total powerlessness when this House takes important decisions about who is to do what job, and of having absolutely no influence over them.
It is well known that the election of the President of this House was organised beforehand behind closed doors, and the same is equally true of the election of the President of the Commission.
I nevertheless want to ask the new President of the Commission, who is evidently already firmly established, as a matter of urgency, not to overlook the views of the broad majority of EU citizens on what will be one of the most important issues of his term of office, namely that of the accession of Turkey to the EU.
In my own country, Austria, before the European elections on 13 June, people were more or less clearly promised that Turkey would not be joining the EU, as it was not a European country and was not ready for Europe.
Negotiations with Ankara are now to be set in motion, and it is reported that you, Mr Barroso, have declared yourself to be in favour of Turkeyâs accession.
In Austria, at any rate, people feel they have been duped about this important issue; they sense that Turkeyâs accession to the EU is yet another done deal, and that whether or not they are in favour of it is quite irrelevant.
That being so, we in this House cannot be surprised that there is growing disenchantment with Europe in every corner of the EU, whilst you, Mr Barroso, speak in terms of a few people being sceptical about Europe and many being apathetic about it, which is much more dangerous.
This Euro-apathy will become rejection of Europe if we go over the publicâs heads in this way.
Mr Barroso, I urge you, in future, to fight for a citizensâ Europe, to listen to public opinion, and that includes where Turkey is concerned.
Â Â  Madam President, in his speech yesterday, the chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe compared the project of European integration to a pilotless aircraft.
That reminded me of an anecdote from the chess player Bobby Fischer, who has recently been in the news as a result of his arrest in Japan.
One day, the chess playerâs teacher wished to teach the champion a lesson and, with a swipe of his hand, threw all the pieces from the chess board and said: "Now, with the board empty, invent the great move".
Mr Barroso, to see the end before beginning and to see what cannot be seen, is an ability which, in politics, is not within everybodyâs reach.
Many of us in this Parliament hope that you have a political vision for the European project and that you can set the course for it.
There were things that I liked in your speech yesterday, such as when you spoke of a strong, political and credible Commission which must be based on the great wealth of resources represented by the Commissionâs officials, who must be motivated and enthused.
In my opinion, this project must be carried out with the emphasis placed both on its internal dimension â the internal market and economic and monetary union â in line with the Lisbon process, and its external image, so that the Union may carry weight on the international stage in line with its economic, financial, commercial and industrial weight.
Mr Barroso, the European Commission is rather more than the honest broker you referred to in your speech yesterday, or the .
Contrary to what has been said this morning in this House, the Commission is not an Aeropagus for stateless bureaucrats, but a key and fundamental institution to the project of European integration, the political driving force behind the project and the promulgator of its advances. I therefore very much agree, Mr Barroso, with your comment to the effect that the Commission must restore that positive collaboration with this Parliament and that harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission which has led to so much progress in the project of European integration.
We therefore want a strong Commission, with a strong Parliament which controls it democratically, which invests it, which legitimises the project of European integration, which debates, which rejects, which ratifies and which rectifies.
Mr Barroso, we hope that, on this occasion, a large majority of this Parliament ratifies the European Council's proposal â because you deserve it and your career bears this out â to appoint you as President of the European Commission.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, President-designateÂ Barroso, I note that MrÂ Barroso declared his support for the LisbonÂ Strategy.
He stated that it is supported on three pillars economic, social, and environmental.
I note too that MrÂ Barroso failed to mention the reasons why the LisbonÂ Strategy has not yet been satisfactorily implemented.
A number of politicians and economists believe one of the main reasons for this failure is that implementation of the strategy requires unpopular political decisions to be taken.
Are you prepared to take the necessary unpopular political decisions, MrÂ Barroso?
I would also like to ask how you intend to persuade the MemberÂ States to take such decisions.
I hope you will provide a detailed response, as rather too many general statements have been made in the House today.
Turning to a second issue, you said that one cannot have more Europe for less money, MrÂ Barroso.
As a representative of Poland, I fully agree with you on this.
Nonetheless, we are all aware that several MemberÂ States are strongly opposed to increasing the Unionâs budget. Indeed, they actually advocate cutting it.
I should like to enquire how you intend to act on your slogan âMoreÂ Europeâ, MrÂ Barroso.
How do you plan to go about influencing those particular MemberÂ States and convincing them to agree to increase the Commissionâs resources?
Only then will it be possible to make economic and social cohesion a reality, and bridge the income gap between old and new MemberÂ States.
My third concern is the recent infringement of the rules of the StabilityÂ andÂ GrowthÂ Pact.
This caused alarm in certain MemberÂ States. They felt others were infringing jointly agreed rules in order to promote their own interests.
It also undermined confidence in the European institutions.
I should like to ask you, MrÂ Barroso, whether you are prepared to insist on compliance with fiscal policy within the EuropeanÂ Union.
I should also like you to state which instruments you plan to use for that purpose.
In particular, do you intend to modify the StabilityÂ andÂ GrowthÂ Pact MrÂ Barroso, and if so, how?
Â Â  Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my pleasure at speaking for the first time in this Chamber as a Member of the expanded Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
I am extremely pleased at this development.
Mr Barroso, I admit I was somewhat prejudiced before I heard you.
You were appointed through a process of rather squalid intergovernmental bargaining, which was not very impressive.
I was not keen on your enthusiasm for the Iraq war, which I regard as misguided and illegal.
However, I have been favourably impressed by your presentational and communication skills and your clear attachment to a successful Europe and a strong European Commission.
I am also impressed by your assertion that you intend not to be beholden to the Member States and in particular that you do not want super-Commissioners.
I will therefore vote for you.
However, I am wondering how consistent and truly reliable you will prove.
For instance, you say you will strive for eight or nine women Commissioners, which, of course, I support.
But what will you do if the UK insists on appointing Peter Mandelson, France Jacques Barrot, Germany GÃŒnter Verheugen, and Italy Mario Monti?
What will you do if the smaller countries say that, as you have failed to change the gender of these big boys, why should we carry out the sex-change operation?
Everyone wants gender balance in theory, but finds a pretext to fail to deliver it in practice.
I wish you every ounce of conviction and determination on this issue, but I will watch with interest to see the outcome.
I cannot quite marry your concern for women with what is happening in Portugal, where some women are being prosecuted for carrying out abortions.
In a situation where the Bush administration has withdrawn funding for international organisations on women's reproductive health if they even include abortion advice in their functions, it is crucial that the new Commission carries on the work led by Poul Nielson of substituting EU funding for the American cuts.
This means standing up to George Bush.
I hope we can rely on you.
Secondly, I worry that you will be all things to all people.
You describe yourself as a centrist, a reformer and a Social Democrat, but you belong to the conservative group.
You somewhat remind me of your mate Tony Blair.
I am not sure in what political direction you are really heading.
Pragmatism has its virtues, but we need to know the hard political choices that you will make when the chips are down and the principles that you will not compromise on.
Lastly, I hope we can rely on you in the field of civil liberties and human rights.
Your compatriot, Mr Vitorino, did a great job and, on the whole, struck the right balance between freedom and security.
However, there are ever-increasing pressures to sacrifice personal freedom to the quest for security, to compromise our humanitarian obligations to refugees and to fail to integrate legal immigrants.
The European Union failed to take a united stand on GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
I hope we can rely on you to prioritise civil liberties and human rights in the future.
Â Â  â Madam President, the reasons why we shall be voting against the candidature of Mr Barroso are very simple.
We find ourselves in a rather paradoxical situation.
We have just had elections in which practically all the governments were defeated, not because the citizens did not understand or were not informed, but because there was mass protest at decisions such as those on the war, some of which Europe made itself and some of which it did not oppose.
What we have here is a protest at liberalist policies, deep social malaise and a social, economic and environmental crisis, all due to the failure of these liberalist policies, starting with the Stability Pact and the privatisations.
A certain approach to European integration is in crisis, and rhetoric is not enough to resolve this crisis.
In view of this, there is swing to the right, to conservatism, and an attempt to propose a philosophy of compromise in the name of so-called governability, which means taking a position between bureaucracy and governments without facing up to the problems.
We, however, take the opposite view, that Europe needs a change inspired by the movements demanding rejection of the war, social policies, democracy and citizenship through residence.
Frankly, these are all things that Mr Barroso does not represent.
Â Â  Madam President, our groupâs Dutch sub-group is contemplating backing Mr Barrosoâs candidature despite our constitutional reservations.
The reason for this is that he, during his visit to our group, underlined a number of our policy priorities.
Like us, Mr Barroso values good solid relations with the United States.
During this time of global threat and terror, close cooperation with Washington is preferable by far to a European policy that aims to compete with the United States.
We are also pleased with the attention Mr Barroso gives to the family as the cornerstone of society and his striving towards solid financial economic policy within the Union.
With the near future in mind, we would like to commend two important matters to Mr Barrosoâs attention.
First of all, we would ask the European Commission to take an objective approach to Turkeyâs possible accession, which is a politically sensitive issue.
This autumnâs progress report should therefore be based on the factual situation in Turkey, and not on the positive attitude of a few Heads of State and Government in the Council.
Secondly, we would ask Mr Barrosoâs attention for the Palestinian Authorityâs serious loss of authority.
We expect from him, and from the Commission, as much support as possible for the urgent reform of this Palestinian Authority, which is a necessary stepping stone if we are to have the prospect of a real peace process in the Middle East.
Â Â  (Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, whilst listening to you, I was pleased that you referred to the significance of the justice and security package.
Therefore I should like to address current issues related to European security.
Mr Barroso, you will have to give due consideration to the fact that the European security policy has, unfortunately, been too slow in meeting its objectives.
Europe's real military and crisis management capabilities are still insufficient.
It is important that you realise this.
There is no need to convince you that twenty-first century asymmetric and transnational threats are not just illusions, but a reality.
Despite what we may hear here about the coalition forces involved in operations in Iraq, one must remember that until such time as Europe's military capabilities and security instruments have reached the necessary level of effectiveness, it is important to maintain the existing EuroAtlantic link, by improving Europe's cooperation with NATO.
Countries still need to be encouraged to allocate adequate resources for European security needs.
An effective exchange of information and trust among countries must be ensured, which would guarantee timely European counter-terrorism operations.
Thank you for your attention. I wish you every success.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-designate, ladies and gentlemen, I represent men and women in our continent who hope for a political Europe that is free and independent of the geopolitical and geoeconomic interests of the United States today and of anyone else tomorrow.
We hope for protection for our markets and the products of our agricultural, industrial and service sectors, which are threatened both by imports from outside Europe and by relocation. This is the result of financial and economic globalisation, against which few have so far raised the arguments of sovereignty and identity, first for our nations and then for Europe itself.
We hope that demographic and family policies will be developed within a broad framework of social protection.
We hope that policies that threaten job security and thus the individualâs livelihood will be scrapped.
In order to have a strong, credible and independent Commission which can, as you have stated, interpret the needs and expectations of what has to be a social and cultural Europe, it is necessary to work towards everything I have mentioned and thus aim at introducing economic policies that revise the Stability Pact.
That does not come across in what you have already announced, in your actions or in your intentions.
We shall vote against your Presidency because the policies you pursue and represent have already shown themselves to be Atlanticist and hyperliberalist.
On a number of occasions you have publicly supported US policies and have come out in favour of a further transfer of powers from the Member States to the Union, a Union that will centralise and manage the future of the peoples of Europe without regard for traditions or identities.
Moreover, you are in favour of enlargement to include countries like Turkey that have nothing to do with our culture or history.
We shall therefore vote against this Presidency, which represents policies favouring the interests of the banks, global finance and countries whose interests and policies are at odds with those of the nations of Europe.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome Mr Barroso as a dynamic representative of the Europe which we all envision for the twenty-first century, of a Europe whose main objective will be to meet the expectations of the people, by bringing different countries together in a common ambitious future, in which there must be smooth cooperation between the twenty-five countries today and, later, between more members following their integration into the European Union.
We welcome his assurance that the confidence of European citizens in Europe and how it operates will need to be strengthened.
The objective of us all must be for Europe not to be an abstract concept, but to be experienced by the citizens and to express them.
Following enlargement, the primary objective of the European Union is to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, which will confirm the agreement of the people to a Europe in federal form, and to create the preconditions for it to make fast strides towards a single foreign policy and security policy.
In this new era, European citizens are demanding support for diversity and, at the same time, participation in an even more democratic future, which needs to provide a feeling of security and prosperity.
It is our common conviction that democracy is strengthened through criticism and I am certain that Mr Barroso will, with our support, accept this position also.
The Lisbon process includes both development and the strengthening of knowledge and technology, together with social cohesion, environmental sustainability and strengthening Europe by creating employment conditions and equal opportunities.
We shall monitor exactly how these will be adhered to. We shall also monitor the emphasis which we are certain will be placed on dialogue between cultures.
We believe that Mr Barroso will, of course, be the leader of the European Commission.
However, his familiarity with issues relating to southern Europe doubtless gives him an awareness of the problems which these countries experience.
We shall contribute towards creative relations between Parliament and the President of the Commission, so as to safeguard constructive cooperation the two institutions.
I am also convinced of Mr Barroso's capabilities and of his awareness of the huge responsibility which he is undertaking.
That is why I wish him every success.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Barroso, I have just come from the Swedish Parliament where, in the last ten years, every other politician has been a woman.
Here in Parliament, there are all too few women, less than a third.
The Commission and other EU institutions have so far had far too few women.
Half of the electorate are women who, in many cases, are also doubtful as to what the EU can offer them.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists here in Parliament always looks nowadays at the proportion of women.
I turn now to my question.
If you are elected, MrÂ Barroso, how many women will there be in the Commission?
What policy on gender equality will you pursue?
Will women be included in the partnership you talked about?
In one speech, you talked about having âmore women in the Commissionâ. That is much too vague and woolly.
How many women do you aim to have in the Commission?
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr Barroso, as a left-wing MEP, I shall vote against you, because I want a Europe which does not act as Mr Bush's delivery boy, as you did in the Azores, because I am against your neo-liberal policy in Portugal and, furthermore, because I refuse to allow the European Parliament to simply ratify the orders of the summit.
As a Greek MEP, I should like to thank you for hosting the recent football championship in Portugal, congratulate you on the dignity with which you accepted the outcome of the final match between Greece and Portugal and wish you the same dignity in coping with the European Parliament's votes against action by the European Commission.
As a left-wing Greek MEP, I should like to invite you to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens.
My group is organising a meeting for people with disabilities on the 24 September.
We shall expect you there so that you can tell us what you intend to do and if you will be applying a Community directive.
You will be perfectly safe, because thousands of cameras will be watching you, as will ÎÎÎ€Î.
Mr Barroso, we are voting against you and we shall be waiting for you in Athens.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ President-designate of the Commission, DrÂ DurÃ£o Barroso, I wish you good luck.
