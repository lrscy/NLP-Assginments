I therefore voted in favour of the report, so that we can all enjoy the benefits of this positive step for the Community.
I should also like to emphasise that healthcare services are for people in need and cannot therefore be compared to goods for sale.
This issue therefore needs a separate Commission proposal and should not be included in the general services directive.
Lastly, now that the European Health Card has been created, the Commission must monitor its implementation in the Member States to ensure that they are providing clear and comprehensible information about how the card works.
Â Â  .â I have voted in favour of my fellow MEPâs, MrÂ Bowisâs, excellent report on patient mobility.
It is a document that points out a number of obvious facts: health care is a priority issue in the Europe of 25, since 10% of national GDPs is dedicated to it.
Health care is, in essence, a national policy, the great fabric of social cohesion, which is today faced with two major challenges: ensuring that every citizen has access to treatment and managing the explosion in health care budgets in the majority of the Member States, such as Belgium.
The specific nature of health care services justifies, in my opinion, removing health care from what is known as the Bolkestein Directive on services, as provided for by paragraph 4 of the resolution.
Health care policy must naturally be extended to European level.
That means that patient mobility must be promoted in the same way as that of citizen-tourists, students or businessmen.
That justifies the implementation on the ground of the European Health Insurance Card.
Launched in 2004 to replace the E111 form, this device is intended to allow citizens, in all cases, to assert their rights to health insurance in a simple and effective way.
Â Â  . Being utterly opposed to the acquisition of statehood by the EU and the compulsion of a single foreign policy for Europe, I voted against the Resolution urging that reform of the UN should embrace a seat for the EU.
This is a resolution driven by those consumed by a fanatical desire to usurp national authority and status.
In my view only nation states can and should represent their citizens in the United Nations, with each free to determine their own foreign policy.
With the defeated EU Constitution there is now even less justification than ever for this foolish proposal.
Â Â  The resolution contains quite a few constructive proposals about the ways in which the United Nations might be reformed, for example through an enlarged and more representative Security Council, more environmental work and an emphasis upon connections between development and the environment.
In spite of this, we cannot support the report because it is simultaneously aimed at strengthening the EUâs common foreign policy, firstly through the demand that the EU countries pursue a common approach to the work on reforming the UN and, secondly, through the proposal that the EU be represented in the Security Council.
The latter proposal clearly shows that the EU is ambitious to act as a state in international contexts, something to which we are clearly opposed.
In our opinion, the Swedish people should make its voice heard directly in the UN, not via the EU.
Â Â  . The true motives behind this resolution can be understood by reading the resolution on Transatlantic relations, debated in this plenary session, which calls for a partnership between the EU and the United States and their âactive commitment to a reform of the UN, and in particular its Security Council, including its compositionÂ ... with the authority to grant permission for the use of force to solve international conflicts and in order to make it more effective and accountable and increase its capacity to implement its decisionsâ.
In spite of its muddy language, the resolution is unable to conceal its intention to âlegitimiseâ and ânormaliseâ the adoption of âpreventative measuresâ âhumanitarian interventionâ and âthe possibility of using forceâ by armies of EU countries âconvertedâ into forces of external intervention.
In other words, the intention is to transform the UN into a body â with the USA pulling the strings, in tandem with the EU, by which I mean France, the United Kingdom and Germany â that âglosses overâ its imperialist policies, and its interference and attacks on the sovereignty of States and peoples.
The resolution therefore endorses the ongoing militarisation of the EU and covets a seat on the Security Council for this political and military bloc in the making, once the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ has been ratified.
Hail the ânoâ votes in the French and Dutch referenda!
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour PartyÂ shares the endorsement given in this resolution to the reports by the High Level Panel and the UN Secretary General, on reform of the United Nations.
The EPLP also fully supports reform of the UN Security Council, in order that it better reflects today's world, andÂ calls for further improvements in the way that the EU speaks at the UN.
However, it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat, as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members.
We would not wish to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Â Â  â The motion for a resolution on the reform of the UN forms part of efforts by the imperialist powers to conduct a reactionary reform of the founding principles of the UN, in a bid to record and 'legalise' the provisional imperialist rule as 'international law'.
The motion for a resolution and the statements by the Council and the Commission reveal how the ÎU and the USA are operating on the same frequency against the peoples and endeavouring to cloak their aggressive and barbaric policy in the mantle of the UN.
Among other things, they want to safeguard the right of intervention and of preventive war on the pretext of combating terrorism and to export democracy, so that they can strike at countries and grass-roots movements which oppose imperialism and do not choose capitalism as their social system.
The proposals by the UN Secretary-General dictated by the USA and the proposed EU and US positions seek to build a global mechanism consisting of the UN and the imperialist organisations (IMF, WTO, WB, G8 and so on) in order to consolidate the rule of big business.
Nonetheless, the disagreements and infighting between them are exacerbating and, at the same time, strengthening the people's fight.
The UN is not suffering from democratisation measures.
What it needs is for imperialist rule to be overturned and for the correlation of powers to change so that the preconditions can be created to international relations based on equality between states and peace.
Â Â  . Todayâs resolution of this House on reform of the UN (B6 0328/2005, moved by Mr Laschet) advocates disturbing and aberrant developments within the United Nations by calling, , for the introduction into international law of what are termed military âhumanitarian interventionsâ.
Most seriously, though, the resolution opens the door to the possibility of pre-emptive warfare being mandated by the UN Security Council.
Those who would like to see the UN mandating pre-emptive warfare tread international law underfoot.
Reforming the UN in such a way would amount to the UN hallowing the principle of âmight is rightâ.
Such a âreformâ of the UN would endorse the dangerous concept of pre-emptive warfare; it would be no more and no less than a programme in support of war.
This is one reason why I am very glad that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has repudiated this resolution.
Â Â  The resolution may be seen as the European Parliamentâs wish list in the run-up to the forthcoming EU-US Summit on 20 June 2005 in Washington.
It contains a variety of proposals concerning the form to be taken by cooperation between the EU and the United States in a range of areas, including security policy, the environment, energy and the economy.
Quite a few of the demands are constructive, but we do not believe that the EU should represent 25 Member States in relation to the United States, including within the field of security policy.
We are therefore unable to support the resolution, either.
Â Â  . The resolution tabled by the Right and by the âsocialistsâ âwholeheartedlyâ welcomes the âimprovement in transatlantic relationsâ ahead of the EU/USA summit due to take place in Washington on 20Â June, and the International Conference on Iraq, jointly arranged by the USA and the EU on 22Â June.
It seeks to give continuity to the dangerous objectives enshrined in the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ and in the âEuropean Security Strategyâ.
They then reaffirm the need for âcooperation between the transatlantic partners based on a sound institutional structureâ, to âresolve high-level political issues such as decisions regarding the use of force and issues regarding world orderâ, âon the clear assumption that working together brings more benefits for each partner than working in different, or indeed opposite, directionsâ.
Without concealing contradictions (rivalries), the resolution calls for partnership on the so-called âfight against terrorismâ, on the ânon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the use of nuclear energyâ, on relations with China, India, Japan, Latin America and Russia, on the situation in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, on negotiations at the World Trade Organisation and on the reform of the UN.
It also stresses that NATO should become âa genuine partnership of equalsâ and calls for âa closer relationship between NATO and the EUâ, which will strengthen relations between the EU and the USA.
In other words, this is imperialism in action ...
Â Â  . The US and Europe as two global democratic systems share the same ânon-stateâ threat: terrorism and weapons proliferation.
The need to act together to defend democratic and liberal values creates a new opportunity to renew transatlantic relations.
Ms Rice made clear recently that the US needs and welcomes a strong, unified Europe that can speak with one voice.
Nevertheless, this policy is not yet reflected in the US approach to EU citizens.
Despite the fact that citizens of the new EU member countries in particular long strived for democracy and liberalism in Europe, and offered strong support to the US in its global pressure for democratisation, citizens of the new Member States are still perceived as a security threat to US home security.
Therefore, I urge the Commission to start negotiations with the US authorities immediately, and tackle this issue as a matter of high political priority in its relations with the US.
I urge the Commission to start immediately to negotiate the application of Visa Waiver programme for all EU citizens.
I urge the Commission to use that call for strong, unified Europe and to ask the US to treat all EU citizens equally.
Â Â  .â On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, MrsÂ Annemie Neyts, coordinator of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, points out that the ALDE Group has voted against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and particularly against Amendments 8, 10 and 11 (climate change, new nuclear weapons and the Non-proliferation Treaty), in order to protest against the Greensâ habit of not joining in a common resolution and then of tabling amendments that have not even been debated during the negotiations on that common resolution in which the Greens played a part.
Â Â  â The motion for a resolution reconfirms the 'blood ties' between the ÎU and the USA at the expense of the peoples and the common 'values' of the imperialist barbarity which unites them.
Despite their differences over the division of markets and lands, their effort to cooperate in order to strike at countries and peoples is manifest and is expressed in the proposal to conclude an agreement between them based on:
â¢ the promotion of the 'democracy promotion' plan announced by Bush for his new term of office,
â¢ the application of the US/NATO plan for controlling the Middle East,
â¢ the common approach to increasing competition with China, India and Russia,
â¢ the joint arrangements for setting up governments submissive to imperialism,
â¢ the reactionary reform of the UN,
â¢ closer links between ÎÎÎ€Î and the ÎU in order to deal with grass-roots resistance.
The EU's overall policy, including the policy projected through the joint motion for a resolution signed by the 'conservatives' and social-democrat parties, proves that the USA and the EU are two sides of the same coin.
They highlight the need for the peoples to fight to overturn the imperialist system as a whole and to directly strengthen their struggles and their solidarity in order to repulse the new aggressive plans of the new order.
The Greek people must not allow their country to participate in the new imperialist plans.
Â Â  The resolution on the situation in Uzbekistan is another example of the European Parliamentâs ambition to strengthen the EUâs common foreign and security policy.
We are opposed to this development.
In our opinion, Uzbekistan is not in the neighbourhood of the EU.
We believe that, in this particular case, other organisations â such as the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe â have a mandate to engage in conflict prevention and to strengthen human rights.
We therefore support the call initiated by the UN with the support of, for example, the OSCE for the situation in Uzbekistan to be the subject of an independent investigation.
Â Â  . High levels of unemployment and low wages have once again prompted ordinary people to give vent to their displeasure in protest actions, this time in Uzbekistan.
A gentle revolution of the kind that took place in Georgia or Ukraine is made improbable by the absence of an organised opposition elite such as they had.
It is a matter of certainty that Islamists are trying to turn this situation to their own advantage and that they will endeavour either to spearhead more popular uprisings or use terrorist attacks as a means towards their ends.
Hence the threat of a civil war that would be even more explosive if reports of President Karimov being seriously ill were to turn out to be true.
The worldwide spread of Islamic terrorist activities makes it fundamentally important that this development be counteracted and a peaceful solution sought if at all possible.
It is for precisely this reason that the brutal repression of the uprising and the prevention of any objective investigation into it risk transforming popular dissatisfaction into an ever more frenetic spiral of violence.
Following the events with a USD 600 million contract to supply oil to China certainly sent out the wrong message.
Our trade agreement is worth EURÂ 16 million, and we should suspend it as a means towards âpersuadingâ the Uzbek Government to change course.
That is the only way we will ever get this crisis hotspot under control.
Â Â  . We voted against this report because it is a classic example of the neoliberal ideology supported by Parliament.
The proposals that we tabled were mostly rejected.
For example, they overlook the fact that the years since the establishment of the euro zone have been marked by slow economic and employment growth, rising unemployment rates and a transfer of productivity gains from workers to employers, as well as by the persistence of high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and income inequality in the EU.
They also take no account of the fact that the European Employment Strategy defined in November 1997, included in the Lisbon Strategy as defined by the Council in March 2000, has been the main instrument to promote the flexibility, adaptability and mobility of the workforce, wage adjustment and changes in wage composition, and the opening up to private interests of the bulk of social security services, including pensions and health, which had a negative impact on the quality and security of the jobs created, on workersâ rights and on income distribution, as well as on the general level of productivity.
Â Â  . In the increasingly globalised world markets, it is becoming difficult for European businesses to remain competitive.
Internally, European industry is undergoing a period of intensive reconstruction with jobs being lost and manufacturing units shutting down.
Certain regions and certain industrial sectors have seen radical changes to their employment model.
The fact that economic growth in the EU remains below 2% is a further factor in this gloomy scenario.
For the EU to continue to be an area of economic, social and environmental progress, the Member States must implement reforms in their labour markets with the aim of improving workersâ employability and of making work pay.
The reform of these social and fiscal policies must be approached in a coherent way, as prerequisites for sustainable development and growth.
Against this backdrop, the reform of the internal market, including the area of the freedom to provide cross-border services, will make it possible to achieve the economic growth that the EU requires if it is to generate more than 70% of the worldâs wealth and jobs.
Â Â  â The next item is the continuation of the debate on social inclusion in the new Member States.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Ãryâs report is, in my opinion, an important source of proposals, enabling the Commission and Parliament to take up the challenge of enlargement.
In actual fact â and one is well aware of this through the debates currently enlivening the old Member States â the fear of social dumping brought about by enlargement is omnipresent, and, in my opinion, unfounded if adequate elements of a response can be found.
I would first of all like, as is unfortunately the custom in this House, to point out to the Commission that, if funding is not made available immediately in order to implement the recommendations contained in this report, it will go unheeded, however comprehensive it may be.
The fight against all forms of poverty and all forms of exclusion is the prerequisite for putting Europe onto the road to social progress.
We had agreed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the responses required on the issue of social inclusion were not simply limited to the field of employment, but that they had to include other major social matters: access to education for all, without ethnic or social discrimination, in order to guarantee a common core of knowledge necessary for people to integrate effectively in society; access to quality health care for all: the fact that, even today, people can recover from cancer in one part of Europe and die from influenza in another will never be justifiable; access to housing for all, which is another of the themes of this report: council houses will have to be geographically spread out in an intelligent manner, in order to prevent any form of ghettoisation; the fight against all forms of discrimination, whether sexual discrimination in the workplace, racial discrimination or discrimination linked to disability or social circumstances, will have to be encouraged and supported.
Europe has now to offer protection: in order to progress, it must primarily be able to protect its people.
The basic principles of employment, housing, training and health care are the very foundation of what ought to be the construction of Europe, a Europe that serves Europeans.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report.
Many of the recommendations are valid for all Member States and not just the new countries.
I welcome the report in substance, but I think we should make a clear distinction between European and Member Statesâ responsibilities.
The first weapon in the fight against social exclusion is of course jobs, jobs, jobs.
We therefore need to revitalise our economy and reform our social security systems to lead people back to the labour market and not keep them in the poverty trap.
The more or less permanent exclusion of 10% of our labour force from the labour market is an absolute disgrace to our civilised society.
The rapporteur rightly states that combating social exclusion is best done at local level.
It is therefore worrying that in many countries â new and old, including my own â the financial position of local authorities is becoming increasingly serious.
Local autonomy is meaningless without the necessary financial resources.
In fundamental rights policies and notably the fight against discrimination, the EU can and should play a key role.
The EU has an outstanding track record on gender equality.
It should be equally active in fighting racism and discrimination and it should be proactively defending and promoting equal rights and equal treatment for all.
In my view, the European Commission should be less timid.
The European Union cannot turn its head and look away if blatant discrimination takes place, arguing that it is the responsibility of Member States.
European values are universal.
The report highlights the importance of investing in children as the best way of promoting social inclusion.
Giving children a good start in life and real prospects should be one of the key priorities.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the chance to state my opinion on the draft report on social inclusion in the new EU Member States.
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work and congratulating him on having made a distinction in the report between social inclusion and egalitarianism or corporatism.
When creating special conditions for certain social groups, we must never lose sight of the fact that all citizens must be considered equal.
Positive discrimination is as worthy of condemnation as negative discrimination.
It is a fact that certain social groups have more or fewer differences or problems.
I fully support solidarity with these groups.
I am convinced that the best way to achieve their social inclusion is to create equal conditions for all of them.
Administrative exclusion and preferential treatment for individual groups is not a path towards social inclusion, but towards continued social exclusion.
If we take into account the number of disadvantaged groups mentioned, and rightly so, in the report â or in other words women, single parents, people entering the job market, older people, the poor, those suffering ill health, disabled persons, carers, disadvantaged children, children under threat due to a lack of parental authority, linguistic minorities, refugees, immigrants, Roma, other ethnic minorities, the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts â it would not be much of an exaggeration to conclude that ordinary, non-disadvantaged citizens are a threatened minority in society.
I do not believe that we will need to set up support programmes for those who have not succeeded in being included in a single threatened group.
The report under discussion aims to fight exclusion, and I believe that â paradoxically â we have excluded 10 countries from the 25 Member States, all of which have equal rights, because they joined the European Union several years later.
I firmly believe that, next time, the European Union will also tackle this type of exclusion, and that the next report on social inclusion will evaluate the situation in all the EU Member States.
The draft report refers to the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
I am aware that the rapporteur wrote his report at a time when it was not yet obvious that the Constitution had been killed off.
Since the people of France and the Netherlands rejected the draft Constitution for Europe, these references are groundless and should be deleted from the report.
I thank the rapporteur for his good work, which is of benefit for the European Union and for my country.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, the rapporteur, and indeed the report itself, deserve credit for highlighting key issues and showing a great deal of sensitivity.
To reiterate a point made by MrÂ Cabrnoch and MrsÂ inÂ âtÂ Veld, however, the reportâs exclusive focus on the new Member States is a glaring error, since the problems it discusses affect the EU as a whole.
I should like to cite just one example, that being my own country, Poland.
Over 60% of judges in Poland are women, and given that this is a profession of considerable social standing, it is hard to see how there can be any talk of exclusion.
Similarly, women account for over 60% of doctors in the country, and Poland has more businesswomen in managerial roles than any other country in Europe.
This begs the question of why a distinction has been made in the report between the old and the new Member States.
I should also like to alert this House to the fact that events of the kind we saw a few days ago in France, when Perpignan became a battlefield between Arabs and Roma, would be unthinkable in either Poland or a great many other new Member States.
In my opinion, the cause of the clashes was social exclusion.
What is more, acts of anti-Semitism of the sort that occur regularly in France and Germany would also be unthinkable in the new Member States.
The primary cause of social exclusion is destruction of the social fabric, by which I also mean the weakening of the role of religion.
Religion, the Catholic Church and other religious organisations play an enormous role in weaving the social fabric and preventing social exclusion.
Once again, my own country is perhaps the best example of this phenomenon, as both the divorce rate and the suicide rate in Poland are among the lowest in Europe.
This shows that social exclusion is not in fact one of the countryâs most pressing social problems.
The modern-day state is taking on too many duties that it is incapable of performing.
The report says that the Member States should mobilise non-governmental organisations, confessional associations and the Church to participate in combating social exclusion, and yet it must be stated quite clearly that the state cannot issue orders of this kind.
The stateâs primary task should be to avoid interfering in such matters.
The final point I should like to make is that the term âsocial dumpingâ appears in the report.
This unfortunate phrase, which I find quite intolerable, now appears to have replaced the term âhealthy competitionâ.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the French campaigns for the referendum, we repeatedly heard the tenors of the âyesâ camp in the Netherlands maintain that, in the enlarged Europe as described by the draft Constitution, there would be little risk of delocalisation, immigration of cheap labour to the richer Member States and unfair competition for SMEs in the older ones.
In my country, Flanders, there is now evidence to the contrary, for we see the Flemish transport industry being dealt heavy blows by cheap transport companies from Eastern Europe, and there are other examples I could mention.
I am at any rate delighted that this report on social inclusion in the new Member States, maybe quite unintentionally, puts its finger on a number of difficulties, and indicates the immense structural social differences between the new Member States, many of which today are still struggling to come to terms with the catastrophic legacy from Communist times, and the fifteen Member States prior to enlargement.
Despite many sound proposals and suggestions â we all hope that the new Member States will achieve a level of prosperity comparable to that of their western neighbours as soon as possible â we should not be blind to the fact that social integration of the new Member States may also compromise the cohesion of the whole of the European Union.
Consequently, when no protective measures are taken in order to avoid the risks to which our economies are exposed, and to which I have already referred, including social dumping, the reinforcement of social cohesion in the new Member States must go hand in hand with stringent measures that rule out unfair competition within the EU as a whole.
If we do not do this, then the European leaders have not at all understood the protests by the Dutch and the French people over the past few weeks, soon, undoubtedly, to be followed by the Luxembourgers and the Danes.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, the subject of our debate today is one of enormous significance.
It is a problem that affects not only the old EU Member States, but all Member States, albeit obviously to differing degrees.
Although much research has been carried out into social inclusion in Western European countries, the scale of this problem still tends to be underestimated in the new Member States, and these countries lack the tools to measure this phenomenon in a genuinely rational and objective fashion.
In part, of course, this is a legacy of Communism, which was a system that attempted to eliminate social problems and to bestow transient joy on all its citizens by means of decrees.
We are still struggling with the consequences of Communism and its ideology today, and all the countries that were subjected to this system face similar levels of social problems and unemployment.
Our countries are still lacking large-scale and complementary action plans to coordinate measures in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
The measures that are taken all too often resemble a chaotic struggle by public services to respond to problems that have emerged, and that have usually become urgent.
There are a great many reasons why this is the case.
Even if we leave those social groups that suffer social marginalisation as a result of non-economic factors out of the equation, the excessively high unemployment rate remains the most pressing problem, and its causes are deeply rooted in the economy.
Unemployment in Poland affects several dozen out of every hundred people.
The unemployed frequently cut themselves off from society, and so this phenomenon is one of the reasons behind the sharp rise in todayâs most malignant social disease, by which I mean helplessness and passivity in the face of the simplest everyday problems.
These are always early symptoms of addiction in the broadest sense of the word, whether it be to help from the state or from others, or even to drugs or alcohol.
Of course, the governments of the Member States can and must be called upon to take decisive steps to speed up the process of social inclusion and to develop instruments that make it possible to improve the living conditions of those most at risk.
At the same time, however, we are all aware that substantial amounts of money will be needed to fund the majority of these measures.
One can only spend the money one has, and not the imagined sums one would like to have.
Any debate on genuine social inclusion must therefore be preceded by a discussion on how economic growth can be boosted in the new Member States.
Such growth would facilitate job creation, and more jobs and higher incomes would mean that social problems and poverty could be better and more effectively combated.
We will be unlikely to achieve our goals if we rely exclusively on public funding and social and welfare assistance.
I therefore welcome the Commissionâs assurances that it will cooperate more closely in the fight against social marginalisation.
At the same time, I should like to encourage the Commission to be consistent in promoting greater liberalisation of the market in services.
Such liberalisation will boost economic growth in Europe as a whole, or in other words in both the old and the new Member States, and hence reduce social problems.
This is our only hope of effectively combating a problem that poses a threat to all of Europe, and I would stress the word âallâ.
Â Â  â As the title of the report indicates, Europe is divided into new and old Member States.
The report discusses social inclusion in the new Member States, yet it does not address the general social problems faced by Europe as a whole.
Unemployment is a cruel fate for anyone, no matter where they live in Europe.
It gives rise to many other related phenomena, be it mental stress, poverty or homelessness.
In one part of the report, the rapporteur draws our attention to insufficient workforce mobility.
Yet Europeâs response to the mobility of unemployed persons is to impose what are known as protective or transitional measures.
One of the serious reservations many old Member States had about enlargement was a fear of âeconomic migrationâ and of the threat to jobs for their citizens.
What we have seen to date indicates that none of the countries that adopted transitional measures have so far filed any complaints regarding violation or avoidance of these measures.
The countries that did not impose transitional measures on our countries, on the other hand, have not yet experienced any problems with an increased inflow of cheap labour.
Moreover, many countries are benefiting from this cheap, well-educated and multilingual workforce, rather than complaining about it.
One such example is the granting of âgreen cardsâ to computer experts, or the massive recruitment of nurses for old peopleâs homes in the United Kingdom.
Social inclusion should not only be high on our agenda during the debate on this report; we should also apply this principle with regard to other reports considered by this House.
If I may, I should like to take this opportunity to mention the debate on problems relating to working time and compliance with the principle that all working time must be regarded as legal working time, and that all overtime should be properly remunerated.
However we conceal overtime, we tolerate a situation in which one employee works from morning to night, while others have no chance of finding employment and become homeless.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank my colleague Mr Åry for his outstanding report â his first for this House, and one that persuades by its clear and penetrating depiction of the problems that exist in the new Member States.
Congratulations, Csaba!
In the new Member States, around five million people are out of work, and the number is increasing, particularly among older people, women, single parents and workers without adequate skills.
People with disabilities are marginalised; their chances of employment and of a secure income are diminishing constantly.
My colleagues Mr Cabrnoch and Mr Libicki are quite right to point out that such situations also occur in the EUâs old Member States.
It is apparent from analysis of the situation in the new Member States that the transition from an economy directed by the state to a social market economy makes major structural problems inevitable.
There is work for all to do in ensuring that this problematic period is of only short duration.
Unemployment and deficient education are among the major obstacles to inclusion in society.
As the community of our Member States is founded upon social values, it must defuse this social timebomb.
I agree with Mrs in 't Veld that job creation must have the highest priority; jobs, jobs, jobs, are what we urgently need.
One way in which this may be accomplished is by decisive economic reforms that create favourable conditions for businesses.
Financial incentives will have the same effect â tax breaks, wage cost subsidies and the cutting of social security contributions spring to mind.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are in particular need of support, as is the case in all our Member States; they are potential creators of jobs and apprenticeships, for every single one of which we have to fight, for they are urgently needed.
The social partners have a crucial part to play in combating exclusion, supplementing the efforts of the public and private sectors, and dialogue between them must be stepped up.
I see the foundation of trade unions and employersâ associations as a good idea, for both are needed.
It is only when each has a large number of members that they will be enabled to take action, engage in dialogue and achieve a great deal.
Exclusion is generally associated with inadequate education and training, and so these need to be improved, while, at the same, disadvantaged sections of the population need to be included.
Let us use the experience we have already gained and involve businesses in this.
The last point I would like to make is that the fight against social exclusion is made all the more effective the more the Member States and social partners share information â including both innovative and time-tested practices â with one another.
Like our rapporteur, MrÂ Åry, I regard this as a priority objective.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hasse Ferreira, who is unable to be here today, and I, believe that effective action should be taken to promote jobs and fight social exclusion throughout the EU.
If we are to combat poverty effectively, we must create more and better jobs, and the quality of those jobs must be seen as no less important.
We wish to highlight the need to use incentives to encourage local organisations to support efforts to integrate more people into the labour market.
This activity is important, because as well as contributing towards economic growth, it will also help to ensure that development is characterised by solidarity.
In many Member States during the change of regimes and systems, labour rules and the nature of the labour market have also undergone significant change.
Ladies and gentlemen, under a new social and political model, the fight against unemployment and for social inclusion also entail improving the quality of education and lifelong vocational training.
Other important aspects of this debate are the notion that access to housing is a factor in social inclusion, and the need for effective support for bringing young people with degrees or other high-level qualifications into the labour market, in order to derive maximum benefit from the qualifications that they have acquired in the education system.
Including young people in the manufacturing sector will also help to modernise the economy.
Mr Hasse Ferreira and I would also like to highlight the proposal by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, which urges Member States to attach special importance to eradicating poverty, which affects women, children and ethnic minorities in particular.
In addition to attaching importance to competitiveness, the Lisbon Strategy also encompasses the European social model.
In this context, the promotion of sustainable economic development, including the creation of more and better jobs, within the context of social cohesion, is key to ensuring that people of all States of the EU can be in a single market within a developed Europe that is characterised by solidarity.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the new Member States have undergone complex economic transformation over the last ten years, which has had a negative impact on various areas.
The main factors contributing to social exclusion in many of the new EU Member States are high unemployment, almost no labour force mobility and problems relating to the social inclusion of people entering the labour market, women, older people, those suffering ill health, disabled persons and ethnic and linguistic minorities.
Strong economic growth and more jobs are basic prerequisites for the permanent sustainability of social welfare systems.
In order to boost such growth, I believe that the transitional measures in place on the labour market with regard to the new Member States must be abolished.
No statistical backing has been found for the grounds upon which these measures, which are intended to protect the domestic labour markets of some of the 15 old EU Member States, were introduced.
Education and vocational training systems that function effectively are further factors that boost growth.
The number of people leaving education and vocational training early must be restricted, and it must be made easier to move from school to work, especially for those leaving school with low qualifications.
Access to education must be improved for disadvantaged groups, and we must provide across-the-board support for life-long learning.
A high-quality education system is one that is able to adapt effectively to conditions in a rapidly-changing labour market.
The Member States adopted measures to deal with the problems of poverty and social exclusion in the shape of seven key political priorities.
Together with the implementation of this report, these priorities should contribute to an increase in the supply of labour.
An accessible, sustainable and high-quality healthcare system will contribute not only to the fight against disease and vulnerability to social exclusion, but also to the maintenance of a productive labour force.
Implementation of the content of the report on social inclusion in the new Member States can help improve quality of life in the EU Member States.
I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on his work.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am impressed by the involvement of this House and I want to thank you for this important and stimulating debate.
I feel that we share a common view on most of the problems you have raised.
Poverty and social exclusion remain very urgent challenges for the whole Union.
We have made significant, but not sufficient, progress since the Unionâs social inclusion process was instituted following the Lisbon European Council in 2000.
I can assure Mr Mann and Mrs in ât Veld that economic growth and jobs that promote social cohesion are among the priorities for Europeâs review of the Lisbon agenda.
Furthermore, enlargement has increased the scale of the challenge.
We have also been encouraged by the high level of commitment shown by the new Member States.
The Commission fully shares the view that this process must be accelerated and is thus grateful to Parliament for the strong political support it has given to the Unionâs social inclusion process.
In reply to Mr Libicki, I should point out that from now on the new Member States will be fully integrated into the process.
The current report relates to the period before the accession of the ten new members.
Mr Åry and Mr Falbr highlighted the need for cooperation and partnership.
I agree completely with this view.
Member States are the key partners in implementing the Lisbon Strategy and their commitment to effective inclusion policies is a key factor for success.
I equally share your view that the efforts of social partners and civil society are absolutely necessary in tackling the problem of poverty and social exclusion.
Mrs Bauer rightly mentioned the poverty risk faced by women, in particular single mothers, and children.
Parliamentâs Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, as well as the Commission, strongly advocate the principle of gender mainstreaming, an approach which is very useful for addressing the specific problems of women, particularly as part of social inclusion policies.
Hence I very much welcome the fact that many new Member States are already applying a gender mainstreaming strategy or including the gender dimension in some of their employment and social programmes.
Even in those new Member States where this has not yet been achieved, the joint inclusion memoranda have highlighted the need to pay more attention in this respect.
Child poverty is an EU-wide issue which touches the whole range of employment and social policies.
It very often occurs when parents are unemployed or good quality jobs are lacking, or â as some Members rightly pointed out â it may result from the exclusion of particular groups, such as the Roma.
The EU is fighting against this phenomenon via the European employment strategy, as well as through specific policies, and rightly so.
The fight will go on.
Â Â  . âI would just like to ask if there is any possibility â given that there are now so few of us left in the Chamber â of holding the vote on the report at the mini-plenary session scheduled to take place in two weeks time, rather than today?
Â Â  â In that case, MrÂ Åry, it would be more appropriate to request an adjournment at voting time.
Obviously, as I myself will be the President of the sitting then, I will not oppose it.
I believe, however, that it is more appropriate to request an adjournment at voting time.
Â Â  â Mr President, with all due respect to my colleague Mr Åry, I wish to express my strong opposition to that.
The item is on the agenda, and I think we should put it to the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ Posselt, I suggest that you give your opinion on the matter in due course.
We will debate it at voting time, and, if there is a request for adjournment, it will be submitted to the Assembly.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on five motions for a resolution on Bolivia.(1)
Â Â  . â Mr President, Bolivia is regularly troubled by civil unrest and is currently âon the brink of civil warâ, in the words of its President, MrÂ Carlos Mesa.
Violent clashes between security forces and protestors, calling for economic reform and more rights for indigenous people, have been taking place in the streets of La Paz.
The fear of escalating violence is growing by the day.
Such clashes should come as no surprise to anybody, since the causal factors have been in place for a long time.
First, there exists a huge and unjust discrepancy in wealth distribution.
Secondly, the indigenous population, peasants, and the long queues of the unemployed are largely excluded from economic and political life.
Thirdly, about 85% of farmland is owned by only 15% of the population, and fourthly, although Bolivia is thought to have the second largest gas reserves in South America, this natural resource is not sufficiently used for the benefit of the people of Bolivia and is to a large extent taken advantage of by foreign multinationals and a small group of elite beneficiaries.
All the above, and much more, has led to the potentially explosive situation that we see today.
The resolution before you mainly calls for continued efforts to deepen and broaden democracy in Bolivia and urges the EU and its Member States adequately to support the government to bring about a peaceful and just solution and avert a catastrophe of looming civil war.
Â Â  â Mr President, in accordance with this Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure, I believe that the initial proposer of this resolution, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, should speak first.
Â Â  â I am going to check this item of the Rules of Procedure, but, in the meantime, I will still give the floor to MrÂ YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Bolivia is struggling between chaos and civil war.
The collapse of the State institutions, the absence of authority and the disorder reigning in La Paz, in particular, make us fear the worst, if the worst has not already happened.
But what has happened in Bolivia to bring the situation to such extremes?
There are many reasons: a succession of bad governments, the failure of fundamentalist neo-liberal policies, the despair of the impoverished masses excluded from the system, the predatory behaviour of the multinationals and â we must accept as well â the lack of understanding â or even worse, the indifference â of the international community.
The truth is that, today, Bolivia is a failed, ungovernable and profoundly unstable State whose situation may get even worse, making any solution more difficult and more costly.
I was in La Paz and Santa Cruz de la Sierra just a month ago, sent by the Spanish Government to assess the situation and to propose possible initiatives.
Having re-read the report that I wrote, I regret that things have evolved in the way I predicted, but I do not deserve credit for that, I was not being a visionary; it was already obvious, as it was two years previously, that Bolivia was heading for the abyss.
On that visit, neither amongst the traditional parties nor the so-called âemerging partiesâ nor amongst practically any of the political leaders did I find the least shred of a sense of direction for the State nor any lucid or generous analysis of what may be good for the country.
All of them, or almost all of them, were calculating what was best for them personally: electing a constituent parliament, prefect elections in the nine departments of the country, a referendum on the emerging autonomous areas such as Santa Cruz de la Sierra ...
At that time I only came across one fundamental exception: the President himself, Carlos Mesa, whom I found to be a man with good intentions, who is trying to find solutions by means of dialogue and negotiation.
But he was, and still is, a lone man, without a party, without parliamentary support, faced with a multifaceted opposition that were demanding contradictory solutions from him.
At that point his only asset was high popularity and an unquestionable domination of television communications.
Since he was willing â and he has stood by his word â not to put down demonstrations and street protests, the pickets of the most radical parties and unions took over the streets and forced him to resign.
Furthermore, they have denied the Presidents of the Senate and of the Congress access to the presidency, though constitutionally they should be the successors to a resigned Mr Mesa, and have forced the President of the Supreme Court, the third in the order of succession, to become Head of State, but only so that general elections may be called in three months time.
Paradoxically, Mr President, that may be the only and the best democratic solution.
But not because of the demands and calculations of the most radical factions, not because that would give the citizens back their rightful role which has been seized from them in the street, because âthe street â has been taken over by minority sectors that do not have the support of the immense majority of the 10 million people of Bolivia.
What is the international community doing in the meantime?
Not much.
The issue has therefore been raised in this Parliament: the European Union must be a global player; the European Union and its Member States are the main investors in development aid to Bolivia.
Because we want governability and stability for Bolivia and because our interests are at stake, the Council must instruct its Ambassadors to ensure that Bolivia can find a peaceful, democratic and free solution.
Never again must Bolivia's wealth, such as silver, rubber or wood, be channelled abroad or towards an internal Ã©lite, rather than being used for the benefit of the Bolivian people.
Â Â  â Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I am going to respond to our colleague, MrÂ FernÃ¡ndezÂ MartÃ­n, who asked me to clarify an item of our Rules of Procedure.
MrÂ FernÃ¡ndez, when it is a case of speakers delivering a speech on behalf of their group, their order of speaking is decided on according to the size of the groups: hence, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, followed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and so on.
When it is a case of giving the floor to authors or of debating resolutions, the sequence is decided on according to the chronological order in which the requests to speak have been submitted.
It is therefore not a case of belonging to the largest group, but of being the quickest.
To return to your question regarding Monday evening, the order of the three groups was: the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
The PPE was not on the podium.
That being said, there will be no problem with you, in your turn, taking the floor.
I would remind you that it is a practice that is as old as our Assembly.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the current situation of tension and chaos in Bolivia was, I fear, to be expected.
We have been aware for some time that broad sectors of civil society, in particular the indigenous people, peasants, workers and the unemployed, have been marginalised from the country's political and economic life.
But we in Europe cannot act as if what is happening there had nothing to do with us.
Twenty-six of the recently privatised companies are in foreign hands, many of them European, but that has not helped to resolve the crisis and has not given the population greater access to gas and water.
The problem is that we in the European Union are constantly supporting privatisation processes in Latin America within international bodies, without any guarantees that the minimum principles of corporate social responsibility will be complied with.
So what happens?
Companies receive credits, they invest, they want to make money, but when there are mobilisations by local groups that have been excluded or due to price rises resulting from privatisation, the European companies then decide to leave and furthermore demand compensation for it, which aggravates the crisis even further.
For these reasons, if the European Union wants to retain a degree of credibility as a supporter of human rights in the world, it must investigate the actions of energy companies of European origin in Bolivia and in other places, and must be much more demanding in terms of compliance with the social responsibility rules by companies investing abroad.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we are alarmed by the situation in Bolivia, which is the result of poverty and enormous social inequality, yet we are opposed to any foreign interference or any attempt at a military coup.
We are also alarmed at the attempts at separatism on the part of certain economic interests in Santa Cruz, which are seeking to monopolise the countryâs energy resources.
As such we hope that Bolivian society can reach a consensus whereby the management control of the countryâs natural resources, especially the energy and water resources, can be returned to State hands and can contribute towards its development and towards the peopleâs well-being.
We also hope that the ruling by the Constitutional Court can be implemented, which stated that certain energy conventions signed by the previous government with multinational companies were illegal, given that they had not been submitted for consultation to the Bolivian Parliament.
Similarly, the perpetrators of the massacres of October 2003 must be brought to book and we urge the Organisation of American States to take precautionary measures on behalf of the leaders of the social movement who have been threatened, such as Evo Morales and Abel Mamami.
Lastly we call on the Member States to take action within the international institutions, and at bilateral level, with a view to cancelling Boliviaâs foreign debt.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we do not know what is happening right now in Bolivia, which is experiencing some of the most dramatic times in its history.
The Governmental Palace, the home of the Presidency of the Republic, is known by the Bolivians as the âburnt palaceâ.
It has been burnt down several times during the many popular uprisings in that country.
Opposite the Palace, in the Plaza de Armas de La Paz, there is a bust of President General Gualberto Villarroel, who was murdered, hung from a lamppost, in 1943 during one of the many insurrections that have taken place there.
Fortunately, according to the information I received just half an hour ago, the presidential palace has not so far suffered any damage and the resigning President has just made a dramatic call to avoid bloodshed and civil war.
I believe it is my duty to acknowledge, on behalf of my group, that President Mesa has honoured his commitment never to use violence to put down protest movements and I regret that such an exceptional attitude, which is so unusual in a country with a history such as that of Bolivia, has not been reciprocated by the opposition leaders who, in my opinion, have been overcome by events and whose statements over recent hours have become more radical.
At this moment, in Bolivia, power is in the streets.
At a time when the legislators are meeting in Sucre, because it has not been possible to access the Congress building in the capital, La Paz, due to the blockades, the foreign embassies have mobilised their emergency plans for evacuating the country.
Today, when we are getting ready to vote and to approve the resolution supporting the Bolivians and calling for respect and supporting the institutions and the constitutional laws, it only remains for me to call on God and on the Quechuan and Aymaran Gods to enlighten their leaders and to bless and protect the Bolivian people.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Bolivia, of all countries, a country named after its liberator and first president Simon Bolivar, a man symbolic of Latin America as a whole, is in a state of ongoing crisis.
Arriving in the La Paz basin, one is immediately struck by the glaring discrepancy between the beauty of the country and the incredible depression that hangs over the people.
Someone once described Bolivia as âa beggar on a golden throneâ, a throne at one time mainly founded upon ore, gold and other minerals, but now, increasingly, upon crude oil and natural gas.
In view of the obvious risk that the country could become helpless in the hands of political and economic powers, we are of course obliged to do what we can to help keep it stable.
Its neighbours include such major countries as Brazil, in respect of which my colleague Mr DeÃ has done such exemplary work by ensuring that measures are taken to ensure stability, particularly for agriculture, small-scale farmers and independent farms, along with the slow growth of a small business sector.
This is the approach we must take in Bolivia too, or else the country faces the threat of disintegration, with all the resultant consequences for the political map of Latin America.
It is for that reason that we must work with all the means at our disposal towards a peaceful transition by way of new elections monitored by the international community, but above all towards the countryâs speedier recovery, which will involve strengthening small farmers and small and medium-sized businesses, failing which the country, long at the mercy of conglomerates and conspiracies, risks generating conflicts that would suck its neighbours, including Brazil â particularly its Mato Grosso state â into their maelstrom.
It is for that reason that this House needs to finalise a strategy for Latin America.
Our Christian Europe forged the two continents of North and South America; there may one day be a bitter price to pay for our present neglect of the latter.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission is extremely concerned about the critical political situation in Bolivia.
We are following the situation very closely.
Many countries in the Andean region have faced serious political and institutional crises in recent years, but events in Bolivia have shown it to be a particularly fragile and vulnerable state, not least because it is one of the poorest, least-developed and most unequal South American countries.
The current increasingly anarchic climate, which culminated in Monday eveningâs resignation of President Carlos Mesa, is deeply worrying.
At this delicate moment the Commission urges all Bolivian citizens, rich and poor, of all ethnic origins and from all regions of the country, to pursue their respective demands and aspirations peacefully, by means of dialogue, within the framework of democracy and the rule of law and in accordance with the constitution.
Whilst we are relieved to note that up to now, as far as we are informed, there have been few injuries during the recent unrest, it is now absolutely vital that Boliviaâs political leaders and civil society work together to extricate their country from its current difficulties in a spirit of peace, dialogue, tolerance and national reconciliation.
The histories of both Europe and Latin America show that violence or non-democratic solutions do nothing to bring lasting peace or prosperity to their citizens.
Their heartfelt but often conflicting demands and aspirations can only be tackled successfully by working together to generate consensus and unity.
In that regard, the Commission hopes that the efforts of the Catholic church to organise a national dialogue and ensure a smooth constitutional succession will continue and will be successful.
The Commission has been making a real and practical contribution to supporting dialogue in Bolivia by using our rapid reaction mechanism to provide up to EUR 185 000 to the Club of Madrid to implement a six-month programme of high-level consultancy and support for consensus building and strengthening of leadership skills, which started in mid-April and will continue in the run-up to the long-awaited constituent assembly.
The Commission and the Council have also worked in close collaboration to prepare an EU action plan for Bolivia, which was adopted in mid-May.
It provides a framework for coherent and structured common action by EU institutions and by the Member States jointly and individually.
The action includes engaging in constructive political dialogue, providing support for the constituent assembly, respect for the rights of indigenous peoples, exchanges of experience with different models of regional autonomy and providing constructive input and the benefit of EU experience in securing the benefits of foreign investment for all Bolivians.
Bolivia has also been included in the list of eligible countries for the European initiative on democracy and human rights for 2005-2006.
In the Bolivian context, projects related to training, monitoring and consciousness-raising in the fields of democracy and human rights, projects that promote the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples and projects that support the role of civil society in conflict prevention are all eligible for support.
There is, unfortunately, only limited scope for such support to be implemented while Bolivia is gripped by its present crisis.
The Commission welcomes the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament, which would underline the need for full respect for democracy and the rule of law and would add a further very important EU voice to the calls for dialogue.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place presently, at the end of the debates.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on freedom of the press in Algeria.(1)
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to congratulate the secretariat of the ALDE Group, to which I belong, for submitting the application so quickly and thus giving me the privilege of being the first to speak in this debate.
In Algeria, President Bouteflikaâs Government continues, through judicial procedures lacking in any credibility, independence or justification, in its attempt to silence journalists who are considered by the governing regime to offend or attack the President or the government.
In fact, these so-called attacks are no more than the ordinary independent criticisms by political journalists we see on a daily basis in all free democratic countries.
As a result of this war on the free press, numerous journalists are being dragged before the courts and many have been imprisoned or savagely fined.
The list is long and the cases of the editor of the daily newspaper , Mr Fouad Boughanem, and the cartoonist, MrÂ Hakim LaÃ¢lam, who were sentenced by a court in Algiers to two months in prison and fined 250Â 000 dinars for defamation, are recent examples.
As indeed is the case of publisher Mohammed Benchicou, already in prison for libel offences, whose transfer to hospital for much needed treatment â requested by the prison doctor â the courts have refused to approve, even on humanitarian grounds.
We call upon the Algerian Government to respect the principle of freedom of speech and to stop harassing journalists in an attempt to silence the voices of the democratisation process and the opposition press.
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â There is nothing new about problems relating to freedom of the press in Algeria.
Since the early 1990s, journalists and intellectuals in the country have suffered constant pressure, attacks and arrests.
I need only mention the fact that around 60Â journalists were murdered during the civil war of the 1990s.
At present, the main problem is that the Algerian state authorities are openly hostile to the private press, and the international community must respond to this threat.
A number of Algerian publications are the target of frequent and routine persecution.
Official censorship is imposed, and the state is the sole owner of the printing houses.
Publishers are constantly in debt to the latter, which means that the state gains even greater control over both the press and the media market as a whole.
Journalists face huge problems, as it is inordinately difficult for them to work under such conditions.
They have no official status, no employment contracts and no regular wages, and in practice their trade union is not yet worthy of the name.
Lawsuits against many journalists are in progress, while a great many others have already been sentenced to prison.
It is not hard for the authorities to put pressure on the press and to control and curtail its freedom under such circumstances, and yet the press is a key source of information and a powerful tool for shaping public opinion.
In order to promote democracy and respect for fundamental civil liberties in Algeria, which after all is one of the EUâs neighbours, we should take firm action to boost the status of the independent media and to foster the provision of information that is both pluralistic and diverse.
I would call for the EU to give priority to freedom of the press, the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights in Algeria when pursuing its neighbourhood policy in the Mediterranean region.
Â Â  . â Mr President, freedom of expression and freedom of the press are one of the foundations upon which any democracy that wishes to respect human rights must be based.
It is for this reason that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights supports the development of pluralist media and the strengthening of independent media, including in Algeria, and it must continue to do so.
In this regard, I must say that I am worried about the current situation of the free press in Algeria, particularly following the reform of the Penal Code adopted in 2001 and, specifically, the provisions laying down long prison sentences for defamation.
It would therefore be an excellent gesture on the part of the Algerian authorities, within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean neighbourhood policy and the Association Agreement, to release the journalists convicted of defamation without delay, to lift the state of emergency and to cease persecuting the Algerian private media.
All of this would contribute enormously to developing and strengthening the rule of law and conforming to the provisions of Article 2 of the Association Agreement.
Â Â  . â The Republic of Algeria is a very important partner for the European Union Member States.
Wide-ranging economic interests are involved, and not only for France.
Millions of people come from there to work in the European Union.
There have always been several linguistic and cultural groups in the country, but alongside this wealth of languages and cultures there is still a sharp divide between the purely Islamist, hard-line Arab and quasi-European approaches, particularly since independence was gained.
The European approach is connected with the use of French as a second official language in public life and in schools.
Unfortunately, it must be taken on board that the Arab approach is often associated with suppressing traditional democratic freedoms.
The question now is how democratic tendencies can be supported in Algeria.
Ladies and gentlemen, before voting on the report I would ask you to give priority to promoting democracy.
From what I know of everyday life in the Czech Republic, a country where over 80% of the press is in the hands of two foreign owners from one of its neighbouring countries, I can say that, in certain circumstances, press freedom is crucial for countries.
The Confederal Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance naturally supports the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Algeriaâs history has not made it an ideal breeding ground for democracy, human rights and a free press.
The country was liberated after a very violent war of independence against the French colonial power, which lasted for many years, only for its budding democracy to be toppled by Boumedienneâs .
After years of stagnation that resulted from that, elections were called; had they not been cancelled, they would have been won by Islamic fundamentalists.
Since then, the country has been ruled by the military and bureaucrats who combine their fear of fundamentalism with an Arabic nationalism that is hostile to the Berber minority and turns its back on 130 years of French cultural influence.
The Neighbourhood Policy that the European Union intends to develop cannot be indifferent.
It would be a big mistake if we turned a blind eye to such fundamental rights as the freedom of expression of opinion and information.
At the next exchange with the Algerian parliament, we must at least bring up the measures against newspapers and journalists.
I hope that the Council and the Commission will rate human rights more important than gas supplies and other economic interests.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament and the international community on democracy in Algeria.
With the assistance of our delegation in Algiers, we are following events in the country very closely, particularly as regards fundamental freedoms, media and freedom of the press.
All these issues must be seen against the background of a political dialogue with Algeria that has been relatively neglected in the past.
So far, in the absence of a legal framework, the Commission has had somewhat limited scope for raising these issues with the Algerian authorities.
Even under those circumstances, however, in bilateral encounters with Algerian official counterparts or at EuroMed ministerial meetings, the Commission has always urged respect for fundamental values such as democracy, observance of human rights and the rule of law.
As you know, the EU-Algeria Association Agreement has recently been ratified by all EU and Algerian partners.
It is expected to enter into force on 1 September 2005.
The ratification of the Association Agreement has created political momentum for a renewed political dialogue on all sensitive matters, including those related to the enforcement of Article 2 of the Agreement regarding the promotion of democracy and the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms.
The first Association Council should meet by the end of the year, under the UK presidency.
On that occasion, the Commission will wish to establish links and contacts with its Algerian counterparts with a view to working on key issues relating to the implementation of the Association Agreement, including human rights and democratisation.
Once the key issues and links have been established, we intend to set up technical subcommittees as quickly as possible to implement the most important aspects of the Association Agreement, including human rights and democratisation.
Once Algeria is ready to enter a new phase in the reinforcement of its bilateral dialogue with its European partners, this preparatory work will be the basis for finalisation of a joint European neighbourhood policy action plan, in which issues such as human rights, democratisation, political and institutional reform will feature prominently.
In the meantime, the Commission will use all the means at its disposal to pursue a constructive dialogue with Algeria on those issues and will continue to encourage the Algerian authorities to abandon their attempt to criminalise defamation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place presently, at the end of the debates.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on Azerbaijan.(1)
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Government of Azerbaijan is continuing its crackdown on opposition political groups.
On 21Â May, the police and paramilitary forces beat up and arrested participants in a peaceful opposition rally in Baku.
The official excuse was that permission to hold the rally was denied and this despite an apparent order of 12Â May from PresidentÂ Aliyev, instructing government authorities to respect freedom of assembly.
Dozens of civilians were arrested in that incident and many journalists were beaten up by the police.
It is worth noting that the purpose of the rally was to voice the need for amendments to Azerbaijanâs election laws, in order to prevent the authorities from falsifying election results, to ask for the creation of an independent public broadcasting authority, and to demand the prosecution of the murderer of the independent journalist Elmar Huseynov, who was shot dead outside his apartment last month.
In other police operations, scores of known opposition activists, including the heads of youth organisations, were rounded up and mistreated.
Parliamentary elections are due in November and it seems that a repeat pattern of violence instigated and carried out by the State is starting again, as it did before the 2003 elections.
We call on the Government of Azerbaijan, and in particular President Aliyev, to proceed quickly with the necessary electoral reforms and to show the necessary respect for its citizensâ right to free, fair and democratic elections.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I do not want to say very much about this report other than to echo some of the remarks that have been made by the rapporteur.
Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the South Caucasus countries have clearly been through a very difficult period and some of them are making better progress than others.
I think we all want to see the human rights situation improved.
There are a number of internal conflict situations that are causing considerable concern and I think that we in this Parliament should be adding our support to the President and to the authorities in Azerbaijan.
My Group will be supporting the first, but not the second, part of the Verts/Ale Group amendment after recital J. However, I urge all colleagues to give their support to this resolution and we should do what we can to assist the people of Azerbaijan.
Â Â  . â Mr President, for 15 years, the collapse of the Soviet Union has resulted in major changes in Central Europe, while in the east, the authoritarian forms of government have remained virtually intact.
They have carried out privatisations and major cuts in the public sector, resulting in a large group of new poor people.
This led to anything but European-style parliamentary democracies.
The one-party states were replaced by small dictatorial profiteering cliques regarding themselves as answerable to nothing and nobody.
In Ukraine and Georgia, popular movements against such authoritarian leaders received support from the West, and rightly so.
In Belarus too, where such a revolution has not yet been successful, the opposition, though weak, can count on much external sympathy.
This is in contrast to former Soviet Republics, including Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, where America has now gained major military and economic footholds, but where there has, to date, been no such external support for popular uprisings.
The regimesâ opponents risk jail or the death penalty, and there is no chance of free elections.
In the coming weeks and months, Europe will need to manifest consistent solidarity with the opposition movements that focus their efforts on democratisation from the inside.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Azerbaijan became independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but has lost 16% of its previous territory in a short-lived war over the ethnic Armenian territory of Ngorno Karabakh with neighbouring Armenia and must now support some 570Â 000 internally-displaced persons.
Corruption is endemic in Azerbaijan and the promise of wealth from its oil reserves is, as yet, unrealised.
It suffers from terrible ecological problems in the Caspian Sea as a result of DDT and toxic defoliants used in cotton farming.
It enjoys close military and political links with Turkey, and the EU has strong interests in securing the energy corridor that supplies Western countries with its oil and gas, and also maintaining Azeri cooperation in the fight against international terrorism in the face of recent allegations from Russian sources that Azerbaijan has supported Chechen separatists.
President Aliyev was elected in October 2003 in a contested and deeply-flawed election condemned by international observers.
But Azerbaijanâs President has committed himself now to holding free and fair parliamentary elections this November.
The 4Â June opposition rally went peacefully, as just two weeks previously police had beaten back opposition protestors who tried to hold a rally in Baku despite an official ban, and dozens were arrested.
The final decision regarding the location of the rally was taken after negotiations between the Baku mayor and opposition leaders, who have now warned of dire consequences if falsification is used again in the November elections.
Some observers even predict that Azerbaijan will eventually see an uprising similar to those that occurred in the toppled regimes of Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan.
The recent unsolved murder of editor-in-chief, Elmar Huseynov, has raised accusations of government involvement and a relative of the exiled former speaker and opposition figure, Rasul Gouliev, the UK citizen Almaz Gouliev, has been arrested on the allegedly trumped-up charge of a pistol being found in her bag, apparently in order to deter Mr Gouliev from returning for the elections.
Azerbaijan is clearly far from being a model democratic and stable Council of Europe state and the EU must now do everything possible to promote democracy and human rights there.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the internal situation in Azerbaijan is highly explosive and deserves our attention.
The main reason is the growing dissatisfaction, not to mention downright disillusion, with President Aliyevâs authoritarian regime.
Worryingly, this popular discontent is finding an increasingly Islamic expression.
Suffice to say that at the moment, 20% of Azerbaijanis favour the introduction of , the Islamic law, and Azerbaijan does not have a Western outlook either.
This significant internal dissatisfaction can be attributed to several causes.
For example, the true unemployment rate, despite the oil and construction boom, is very high, being estimated at 20% to 30%.
Furthermore, the current presidential government owes its dire popularity ratings to its practice of silencing the opposition in the electronic media, obstructing, where possible, the oppositionâs public manifestations, and to a hardly representative voting system characterised by ballot-rigging.
The latter is, in fact, a national tradition, which is taking on ever more refined forms these days.
Can the European Union, as one of Bakuâs official partners, do anything at all to help Azerbaijan develop peacefully and democratically?
What is called for in any event is clear language from Brussels about how reprehensible its governmentâs repressive practices are, as is close, European observation of the ballots in the parliamentary elections planned for November.
I hope that the Council and Commission will be firm in calling President Aliyev and his political entourage to account about the enormous political risks of repressive policy not merely in a national, but also in a much larger, regional, context.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, no political transition is easy.
It is no doubt even more difficult for some of the former autonomous republics of the Soviet Empire: the conflicts taking place at the moment in the three countries of the South Caucasus are largely due to the ghastly legacy of Stalin who, in his âdivide and ruleâ strategy, had reattached Ngorno Karabakh to Azerbaijan.
Today, the deadlock over Ngorno Karabakh is one of the main reasons for the stagnation of the region.
As long as it remains unresolved, no prospect of development can be hoped for in that region, which is, however, a natural bridge between the European Union and Asia.
Azerbaijanâs difficult economic, social and political situation is a direct outcome of this tense status quo, if only as a result of the large number of refugees and of displaced persons from within the country itself, who are a heavy burden on the country.
Whilst there are renewed hopes of an improvement in the overall situation in the country, thanks to the opening of the BakuâTbilissiâCeyhan pipeline and the dividends accrued from extracting oil from the Caspian Sea, that in no way excuses the repressive attitude of the authorities towards the opposition.
Azerbaijan voluntarily made the decision to turn towards Europe by requesting accession to the Council of Europe.
Europe laid down the rules of democracy for guidance.
By first of all signing an initial Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in 1999 and by integrating it in its new Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union then indicated its willingness to support Azerbaijan in its democratic process.
Today, the Union has a right to expect progress along those lines.
Whilst there is reason to be very pleased about the release of political prisoners and the presidential decree calling for international laws to be enforced with regard to respect for citizensâ democratic rights, the events that took place in Baku in May â the ban on meetings held by opposition parties and the arrest and imprisonment of opposition activists â are not acceptable.
In view of the fact that we wish above all to support our friends in the South Caucasus, in general, and in Azerbaijan, in particular, we call on PresidentÂ Aliyev and his Government to make every effort to ensure that the forthcoming legislative elections in November 2005 are conducted in a legitimate and transparent manner and that the opposition candidates can freely conduct their campaigns, in complete safety and with fair access to the media.
That will be a powerful token of the governmentâs willingness to make a more in-depth commitment to the road to democracy, to which it had made an official commitment during the meeting with our parliamentary delegation.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, Azerbaijan is one of our partners in accordance with Europeâs neighbourhood policy, into which it was incorporated at this Houseâs insistence, even though â in common with all the other republics in the Southern Caucasus â it had not formed part of the first round.
In Azerbaijan, then, we have a relatively demanding programme; it is on the basis of our principles, our values and our rule of law that the Azerbaijani state, too, is to act.
The country report that the Commission has drawn up, which is intended to result, over the coming months, in plans of action, offers us the opportunity to give a shot in the arm to the process of democratisation and establishing the rule of law.
While not using the same language in every instance, we should weigh our words when articulating criticisms and denounce really serious human rights violations for what they are.
Nothing of what I have just heard from my fellow Members about the increasing number of arrests, about the absence of free elections â as Mr Meijer said â or the introduction of sharia law in Azerbaijan, which really is a tragedy â gets to grips with the reality of what is going on there.
We have to bear in mind in which region the country is situated.
This week, we have been discussing Uzbekistan, a country where the government had between 400 and 500 civilians shot for going on a demonstration, and here we are talking about what happened on 21 May, when a few demonstrators were arrested and then released after a few hours, and then on 4 June, when the government gave permission for a demonstration by the opposition.
That may well be nowhere near our idea of what democracy and the rule of law are like, but I think we have to bear these things in mind in our assessment of these events and in the language we choose when describing them.
It is indeed the case that we have to observe these elections.
They are due to be held in November, and the European institutions must not make the same mistake that they did in Ukraine, where we did not at first take the elections at all seriously and did not follow their progress.
Mr Solana, the High Representative, woke up to the situation only when the Ukrainian people took to the streets to demonstrate against the electoral fraud that had been going on.
It follows that we in this House should, over the coming weeks and months, keep an eye on how this process progresses.
We should send a delegation of observers and make use of the action plans now coming into force as a means of helping a country that is in a very difficult region, and parts of which are under occupation, yet which is determined to move towards democracy and towards becoming a good European neighbour.
In so doing, we will be serving our own European interests, as well as democracy and the rule of law and human rights, better than if we were simply, with words of harsh criticism, to lay into countries with whose circumstances we are insufficiently familiar.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I echo the fine speech of my Group colleague, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, in stressing how important the timing of this resolution is to Azerbaijan as it faces elections.
I visited the region last month with Scottish Parliament colleagues, because we are keen to reach out to these countries with our experience of social democratic and civic nationalism.
In that region, the events in one country all too often have serious ramifications in another.
In that vein, I would commend to you in particular paragraph 10 of the resolution and the reference to the fragile civil society in Azerbaijan, because that is the key to a long-term solution for the regionâs problems.
It is not for us to tell Azerbaijan, Georgia or Armenia how to run their affairs, but with the benefit of our experience we can reach out to a region that is looking to the EU for help, inspiration and perhaps even leadership.
I hope this resolution will give an added impetus to the Unionâs dealings with this troubled region and the positive experience that we can bring to its future.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, whenever I hear the name of the Caucasian republic of Azerbaijan, I think of enormous oil wealth and a presidential regime that is tough in comparison with the democracies in the rest of Europe; I also think of problems with neighbouring countries, in particular the conflict in Nagorny Karabakh.
The countryâs huge wealth is in stark contrast to the growing poverty among its population.
As mentioned by one of the previous speakers, those currently living as refugees still have no home, in contrast to the situation in Armenia, for example.
The logical result of this social tension is the undemocratic measures taken by the government that are criticised in the resolution under debate.
Of course, the aspect of the political system that has been the target of harsh criticism is the fact that it is possible to arrest large numbers of people for having participated in demonstrations or unrest, without any clear individual charges.
That they were released is another matter.
Journalists and opposition politicians were present among those arrested, and this is something that must be roundly rejected anywhere in the world.
Releasing them, however, does not solve the problem, in particular when the country in question is a member state of the Council of Europe.
We should support the development of common democratic values in this Caucasian republic, and not allow the mediaeval Islamist forces to be given the green light.
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â Today we are discussing violations of human rights and democracy in Azerbaijan.
This country is the latest in a series of Soviet republics to fight for independence, following Georgia and Ukraine.
At least several dozen protesters calling for democratic reforms in the country were arrested during the recent demonstration in Baku.
Even prior to this, over 100Â people had been sentenced to prison for expressing their political opinions and opposing the government, following the rigged presidential elections of 2003.
A great many opposition activists, journalists, teachers and casual bystanders have been caught up in the wave of violence unleashed by the authorities.
Azerbaijan is turning out to be a typical example of a country that has undergone superficial transformations.
Its much-trumpeted democracy is nothing other than a facade behind which the totalitarian leaders of the Communist party have exchanged their party membership books for cheque books.
They have amassed fortunes at the expense of society by manipulating people who have been deprived not only of their rights, but also of their property.
As Pope John PaulÂ II once said, the warped idea of freedom as entirely unencumbered liberty and licence still poses a threat to democracy and free societies.
We are in favour of justice and truth, so we support the oppositionâs demands that democratic principles and freedom of speech be respected and that there be no more intimidation or violence.
We also support their calls for the punishment of those who murdered MrÂ Huseynov and MrÂ Djalilov, those members of the opposition who died in unexplained circumstances.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, will Azerbaijan follow in the footsteps of Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan?
If only it could!
The situation in this country is worrying.
Not long ago a leader of the democratic opposition died in mysterious circumstances, following the death of another opposition leader earlier this year.
At the same time, however, even tragedies of this kind and other forms of persecution, such as the arrest of 29Â opposition activists in mid-May, do not alter the course of history and cannot reverse its tide.
The 70Â 000-strong crowd of demonstrators last Saturday in Baku was well aware of this fact.
The fight for democracy in Azerbaijan is also a fight for stability, of which there is an urgent need in the country.
To put it bluntly, Azerbaijan is a major centre of Caspian Sea oil production, particularly since the opening of the USDÂ 4Â billion pipeline between Baku, Tbilisi and Ceyhan in Turkey, which will reduce Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil.
The pipelineâs target capacity is one million barrels of oil per day.
Five days ago, following the recent demonstration, the leader of the opposition party Musavat said that Azerbaijan deserved democracy and was out to get it.
He was speaking the truth, and the European Parliament should help ensure that this is what happens.
Â Â  â Mr President, the opening of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline has ushered in a new era for Azerbaijan.
However, the new economic challenges which are arising must be followed by a series of reforms at political and social level.
Otherwise, they will lead the country to results which are the opposite of those anticipated, such as even greater unemployment and a wider social gap.
Azerbaijan must make good use of these developments and move towards democratisation.
We urge the Azeri Government in the motion for a resolution to respect democratic values, including the right to a different opinion, and to start an open dialogue with the opposition, in accordance with the undertakings which it has given within the framework of the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
A political environment needs to be created which will foster political pluralism, in order to ensure that the elections next November are conducted democratically.
We roundly condemn the murder of the journalist Elmar Huseynov, the ban on rallies, such as the recent rally cancelled by the Mayor of Baku on 21 May, and the cases of infringement of judicial independence, and we call on the country to dynamically promote institutional, legal and administrative reform.
It must be made clear to the present Azeri Government that the European Union roundly condemns all forms of antidemocratic practice.
I call on the House to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution which we are debating today and I express the hope that our intervention will be taken into serious account by the Azeri Government.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Laschet, opposition by three right-wing parties â three nationalist parties â has been suppressed in Azerbaijan, in advance of the opening of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline.
The mass arrests have, in fact, deprived of their leadership the political opposition and the local human rights watch organisations challenging the patently fraudulent election.
It is the usual story of the US sheriff controlling oil resources around the world.
Wherever US soldiers do not move in, as they have done in Iraq, their political mercenaries move in: this is what is happening in Colombia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Madagascar.
It is an operation begun immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union.
In order to safeguard its interests, the United States supplies millions of dollars in weapons and dispatches military advisers to the whole of the Caucasus region.
By condemning the Azeri regime, the European Union is in fact condemning the US policy of exploitation.
In order to protect human rights and democracy, we have to challenge US policy and interests.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament and the international community on human rights and democratisation in Azerbaijan.
We are following the events in the country very closely, particularly as regards fundamental freedoms, the media and the right of expression and assembly.
We are also closely monitoring preparations for the November 2005 parliamentary elections and urging the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure that they are conducted in full compliance with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections.
Some Members have asked if we should send a team of observers to the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan.
In line with standard practice in the OSCE region, a European Union election observation mission will not be deployed for the elections in Azerbaijan.
Instead, support will be given to the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission that is to be deployed.
The Commission will also consider whether, in line with recent actions and in connection with the elections in Ukraine, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan, financial support can be provided to the OSCE/ODIHR fund in order to widen participation in election observation missions, to enable more observers from central, eastern, south-eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to participate.
All these issues and activities must be seen against the background of Azerbaijanâs inclusion in the European Neighbourhood Policy, as decided by the Council in June 2004.
At its meetings with the Azerbaijani authorities, the Commission has always stressed that the European Neighbourhood Policy necessarily implies sharing fundamental values such as democracy, respect of human rights and the holding of genuinely democratic elections.
As you know, on 25 April 2005 the General Affairs and External Relations Council decided to offer Azerbaijan the opportunity to develop an ENP Action Plan with the European Union and I hope that will be finalised before the end of this year.
Human rights, fundamental freedoms, genuinely democratic elections and democratisation will be amongst the main priorities of this document, which will provide overall guidance for future relations between Azerbaijan and the European Union.
Moreover, the Commission is assisting Azerbaijan with its institutional, legal and administrative reforms through the TACIS programme.
This whole range of issues is one of the two main priorities chosen for the TACIS National Action Programme 2004-2005.
Last but not least, the Commission is also providing financial support through its European initiative for democracy and human rights.
Five regional projects are currently being funded in the southern Caucasus for a total amount of over EUR 5 million.
The Commission will continue to use all the means at its disposal to pursue effective protection of human rights in Azerbaijan and to make sure that the democratisation of the country progresses smoothly in the near future.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  . The reason why I voted in favour of the Ãry report is its topicality regarding the issue of social inclusion in the 10 new Member States.
The rapporteur has given a detailed account of the basic challenges faced by the new Member States in fighting poverty and social exclusion.
It was mostly MEPs from the new Member States who presented arguments highlighting the seriousness of this topic during the debate.
Their speeches centred on the theme of poverty, which also involves the social inclusion of children, or in other words has an impact on the prospects of the new generation.
By way of example, statistics indicate that in my country, Slovakia, as many as 21% of citizens live below the poverty threshold, mostly in less-developed regions of the country.
This report provides a basis for addressing the tremendous challenge faced by the EU in achieving the ambitious Lisbon goals of employment growth, social cohesion and sustainable development.
The EUâs progress will depend on its approach to the fundamental rights of the EU citizens who are most at risk, and who mainly live in the 10 new Member States.
This approach should be guided by social inclusion and the fight against all forms of discrimination.
Â Â  One report is on employment and productivity and their contribution to economic growth, and the other is on social inclusion in the new Member States.
Both reports contain general recommendations on how the EU Member States should conduct their economic policy.
Even though we are able substantially to support quite a few of the proposals, it is not for the EU to lay down such policy.
Through institutional competition, countries should of their own accord find suitable solutions as to the way in which economic policy is to be shaped.
Those countries that introduced transitional rules governing labour mobility in connection with the ten new Member States should be entitled to retain these.
It is a good idea, however, to revise the rules because the problems arising from the free migration of labour from the new EU countries have been dramatically exaggerated.
For the above-noted reasons, we are voting against both reports.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 9 June 2005.
Â Â  Before proceeding to the approval of the amendments to the order of business that have been presented, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the Conference of Presidents.
Ladies and gentlemen, 65 years ago today, in June 1940, three countries which are now members of the European Union â Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia â lost their independence as a result of the Soviet occupation.
As a result of this and for half a century, the citizens of those countries were deprived of their human rights and suffered terror and deportations.
Today our institution is remembering these events, which, together with others, are part of our history.
This is not the first time that the European Parliament has talked about this, it is not the first time that this Parliament has remembered the past of these countries, which today are members of the European Union.
In 1983, 22 years ago now, this Parliament expressed its condemnation of the occupation of States by other States.
And at these difficult times for the European Union, right now, we must remember that the accession of those Baltic states to the Union has contributed and will continue to contribute to promoting the objectives of freedom and prosperity for the citizens.
Today we must express our pride in the fact that we can work together on the construction of a united Europe that shares common values.
It is important to remember this, it is important to remember that the construction of a better future for all Europeans is based on respect for human rights and requires constant attention and vigilance, because people who forget their history run the risk of repeating it.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  With the agreement of the political groups, I propose the following amendments to the order of business for the present part-session which appear in the corrigendum that has been distributed.
The report by Mr Gargani on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament will be dealt with immediately after the joint debate on the European Council and the work of the Luxembourg Presidency, during which the President-in-Office of the Council and Mr Barroso will speak.
The report by Mr Cashman on the Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders is included following the report by Mr Gargani and will be put to the vote tomorrow without amendments.
The recommendation for second reading by Othmar Karas on the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies was approved on 20 June.
This item will be included at the end of todayâs agenda.
The time limit for the presentation of amendments or for rejection of the common position will end this afternoon at 4.00 p.m.
With regard to the votes, the report by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo on the protection of occupiers of vehicles in the event of collisions is withdrawn from the agenda, but we are adding two other items: the two reports by Mr Cavada on Sudan and the Congo, approved in accordance with Rule 131, and the report by Mr Garriga Polledo and MrsÂ Jensen on draft amending budget 2/2005.
Are there any comments?
Mr Hans-Peter Martin would like to make a comment.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise, as announced, pursuant to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure, in order to call upon you to remove from the agenda the debate on the Membersâ Statute, or to stop it going ahead.
The vote on it is not even announced in tomorrowâs agenda.
There has already been one irregular vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and, at a time when the EU is in the midst of its direst crisis, it would send completely the wrong message if we were to adopt a Membersâ Statute while accumulating privileges on the quiet.
That is no way to treat a democratic peopleâs Chamber.
I therefore call upon you to avail yourself of Rule 132(2) and take appropriate precautions, so that Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister, can talk about a programme of savings without being compromised by this House adopting a new package of privileges at the same time.
Â Â  Having studied paragraph 2 of Rule 132 with the assistance and advice of the services of the House, I can see no reason to grant your request.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement â European Council meeting (Brussels, 16-17 June 2005) and the Council statement â Work of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Both items will be debated jointly.
To this end, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, will take the floor first.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the Luxembourg Presidency is drawing to an end.
Some will say âthank goodnessâ, but personally I am sorry it is ending and I should have liked to continue.
The time has come to assess the results.
A number of observations can be made which I hope are undisputed.
Firstly, we succeeded in leading the European Council or Council of Ministers to take a number of decisions in sectors which, at the start of the year, were acutely controversial.
We reformed the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby ending a long period of uncertainty which had the potential to trigger a profound rift among the euro-zone Member States.
Far from eliminating stability, we have added stability to the preventive aspects of the Pact.
Nor have we introduced excessive flexibility as regards the Pactâs corrective role, but instead have made it read and feel more economic than automatic.
As President of the Eurogroup, I shall work to ensure proper application and judicious interpretation of the Pact which, in future, will pay greater heed to its two equally vital dimensions, namely stability, combined with growth, and growth allied to stability.
Secondly, Parliament, the Commission and Council have been successful in giving fresh impetus to the Lisbon strategy.
Reinforced competitiveness, increasing modernisation in both our attitudes and our economic policies, a renewed determination to innovate and do more in the field of research â these are the major planks of the new strategy, which neither created nor sought deadlock, as some people may initially have wished, either in the area of social cohesion â which has been restored as a major objective, one of the key aims of the European Union â or that of an appropriate environmental policy â which is emphatically not a threat to jobs and competitiveness.
Hello.
I know people often react to my speeches.
The reaction is not usually quite so immediate.
To come back to the Lisbon strategy: we are changing the way it is applied.
Member States, through national reform programmes, will take greater ownership of the strategy and thus become answerable to their national parliaments in the best national tradition of European texts and European commitment.
The June European Council, held last Thursday and Friday, for the first time in its history approved integrated guidelines, an important event which, alas, has passed virtually unnoticed in the last few days.
To those seeking to modernise the European Union, while giving the impression that others are opposed to modernisation, to those who want to respond to the new challenges facing the European Union while giving the impression that everyone else is unaware of those challenges, I would say: âRead your own decisions and apply them, instead of calling for new onesâ.
Thirdly, Mr President, we successfully set new targets for public development aid on a European Union level.
After confirming that the European cooperation effort has to be stepped up to 0.70% of our national wealth by 2015, we set an intermediate goal for the European Union of 0.56% of national wealth by 2010.
I take a degree of pride in that decision, because I knew at the beginning of the year that it was a vexed and controversial one.
That decision, that advance will increase the level of aid from EUR 46 billion in 2006 to EUR 66 billion by 2010; an increasing contribution, therefore, each year, and, from 2010, an extra EUR 20Â billion per annum.
It is not perfect, but it is a significant step.
Other parts of the world just as wealthy as the Union would do well to take their cue from us to help eradicate poverty, the true scourge of modern times.
Having successfully banished slavery in the 19th century, we must be able to eliminate poverty during the first half of the 21st century.
Fourthly and lastly, Mr President, as promised on 12Â January when I presented the programme for the Luxembourg Presidency, we have improved our relations with our US partner.
This was clear at the meeting on 22 February 2005 here in Brussels with President Bush, who had expressed a desire to come over to Europe.
It was also clear during Mondayâs summit between President Barroso and President Bush.
I would also mention that on Sunday we had another summit â this time with Canada.
We do not devote enough attention to Canada, an important ally for the European Union.
Canada is also part of North America.
To come back to Mondayâs summit: we confirmed the vital need for both Europe and the USA to stand shoulder to shoulder on the basis of shared convictions.
Today, a conference on Iraq is being held in Brussels, as we proposed to President Bush at our meeting on 22Â February.
The European Union and the United States jointly organising and co-chairing a conference on Iraq: who would have believed, one year or even six months ago, that, on a subject as contentious as Iraq, the European Union and United States of America would one day be able to work together to help establish lasting democracy and freedom in Iraq.
I take some pride in having managed to assist Americans and Europeans to develop a common focus and strategy for Iraq.
We should therefore congratulate ourselves on this outcome.
I see that your applause is particularly lukewarm on this issue.
If I had come back to Parliament to report that relations between Europe and the US had deteriorated further, at least half of you would have jumped to your feet claiming that the Presidency should acknowledge its grave failure on a key aspect of foreign relations.
Similarly, Mr President, we reached agreement with neighbouring Russia on what is commonly called the âfour spacesâ.
Our relations with Russia, which have been so important since the 10 May summit, have warmed considerably.
This is a source of satisfaction, although we have to acknowledge that differences of opinion still remain.
Mr President, in December 2004, under the Dutch Presidency â something we should perhaps not forget â the future Luxembourg Presidency was instructed to reach political agreement on the financial perspectives by the end of June 2005.
On 12 January 2005, only three weeks later, I was standing before you in Strasbourg assessing the chances of reaching an agreement.
At the time I said â and I hope you will allow me to quote; you know I love to quote myself:
âWe shall do all we can to reach an agreement, but I am not under any illusions.
The Member States are currently entrenched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in timeâ.
I was right, and I added â to quote myself again: âThe absence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidencyâs failureâŠ
... it will be Europeâs failureâ.
Here I was not right â or rather I was not entirely right.
There are those who accuse the Presidency of being responsible for the failure because it sought to achieve the mandate set, both by the previous Presidency and by all Member States, in its entirety.
Others claim that the disagreement is not a failure for Europe because agreements on the financial perspectives are always achieved at the eleventh hour.
My view is that it a failure for both Europe and for the Presidency, because the disagreement on the financial perspectives, which would have been a minor hiccup under normal circumstances, coming as it did amid the uncertainty stirred up by the French and Dutch referenda, plunged us into a profound crisis.
It is clear that those responsible for it will tell you there is no crisis.
However, my view is that the crisis is a profound one, because it is not purely financial or budgetary.
Let us get things in the right order.
Firstly, between the position of those Member States who wished to restrict the European budget to 1%, and the Commissionâs more generous initial position, the Presidency proposed, for the period 2007-2013, a budget for commitment appropriations totalling 1.056% of national wealth, and a budget for payment appropriations equal to 1% of national wealth.
I have the impression that this level is now generally accepted by all Member States.
That is now a given, and you will see that any future compromise will only differ fractionally from that level of expenditure.
If all that happens in the future is that we advance by that fraction, I would have preferred us to have reached a decision last week.
All my colleagues in the European Council came to Luxembourg between 30 May and 12 June, from 8.30Â a.m. until 10.30 p.m.
I spent 50 hours negotiating the financial perspectives with them. If you then add the 15 hours of debates, negotiation and consultation in the European Council itself, you will see that a total of 65Â hours was spent in consultation, debate and negotiations.
Quite honestly, we could not have done more, and, quite honestly, those coming after us will do less.
During those 50 hours of debate, which I must say were amicable and bilateral, I listened to my colleagues carefully.
No one, and I mean no one, demanded that the British rebate be kept as it is â no one.
In its last proposal for a final compromise, the Luxembourg Presidency upheld the principle of the British rebate: our last proposal was not that it should be frozen.
The overall economics of the compromise were as follows: the rebate would have continued as before with regard to the 15 previous Member States â exactly and precisely as before â but the United Kingdom would have cofinanced the cohesion policy, as normal, solely in the new Member States, while not contributing to the common agricultural policy for those same Member States.
This adjustment would have been the equivalent of an annual rebate of EURÂ 5.5 billion, a higher level than that for the whole of the period 1984-2005.
Initially, the Presidency had proposed freezing the British rebate at EURÂ 4.7 billion, which would have enabled us to adjust the net contribution of the Netherlands by around EUR 1 billion, and to lighten the burdens of Germany and Sweden, in particular, which were felt to be excessive.
Since you are always demanding transparency, I shall give you transparency.
The Netherlands â its Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Finance Minister â knew that the Presidency was intending to lighten their countryâs burden by EUR 1 billion per annum.
We were unable to do so because the United Kingdom was not prepared to adjust its rebate sufficiently to give us the budgetary headroom needed to cut the Netherlandsâ contribution by EUR 1 billion and alleviate the burden on Sweden and Germany.
If the Netherlands had been granted that EUR 1 billion, Germany would have been forced to pay it to the Dutch, because the United Kingdom had not cut its rebate sufficiently.
I wanted you to know this; I did not ask Germany to pay it because Germany, compared to its initial proposal, had already made a huge step towards the position of the other Member States.
So, if the Presidencyâs original proposal had been accepted, the problem of the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden would have been solved easily.
The Presidencyâs final proposal, for a level of EUR 5.5 billion, would not have enabled all of that to be achieved, but at least it would have enabled the UK to cofinance cohesion policies in the new Member States, as normal, with the exception of the common agricultural policy, on which, as we know, the UK has its own particular opinions.
It is both as simple and as complicated as that.
If only the Six who, in a moment of inspiration, wrote a joint letter, could have agreed on the details of their proposals!
Moreover, the Presidency proposed a declaration of the European Council in which it would have stated, and I quote, that: âmore appropriate consideration should be given to the way in which the European budget can meet the Union's future challenges and the priorities of our citizens.
This general reflection should lead to a reform of all aspects of the budgetâ.
âAll aspects of the budgetâ also include the common agricultural policy.
Trying to get us to say that this reflection should cover the common agricultural policy exclusively was a proposal we knew perfectly well would be unacceptable and thrown out by other Member States. However, if all sectors, categories and branches concerned had been brought within the scope of our critical budgetary review, this would have enabled the Commission to obtain a positive decision.
We asked the Commission to report on all these aspects, and the Commission agreed to do so, because its President accompanied me throughout every one of the bilateral discussions during the European Council meetings.
Incidentally, it is normal for the Commission President to attend this type of consultation.
We therefore proposed that, on the basis of the Commissionâs report, the European Council should take the appropriate decisions, also, to quote from the text I had proposed: âincluding possible adjustments to the financial perspectives for the period 2007â2013â.
That was the decision proposed by the Presidency: the British rebate to be maintained for the 15; the British contribution to help finance cohesion policies in the new Member States, but with the common agricultural policy in those States excluded; a Commission proposal by the end of 2008 on a restructuring of the budget; the proposal to be examined by the Council with possible changes to the financial perspectives for the later years, namely from 2009 onwards.
I wanted to tell you this because no one has yet provided this explanation and you are likely to be hearing a different one soon.
It is not true that the Presidency was seeking to kill off the British rebate.
We sought to maintain it for the 15-nation Europe, but to increase the impact in terms of solidarity for the new Member States.
That was the package that was rejected.
It was a mistake to reject it.
The package was rejected although we had introduced a further EUR 6 billion of extra CAP expenditure for Bulgaria and Romania within the envelope of the decision made in October 2002.
Although the letter from the Six could give the impression that they had all concurred that the October 2002 agreement should not be touched, I took this risk upon myself for the 15 â a risk moreover widely shared by the others who were happy to have found someone to take a soundly-based initiative on behalf of the 15.
Whereas, in 2006, EUR 42 billion will be spent on direct aid and market measures, the Presidencyâs proposal would have meant, for the 15-State Europe, a cut in that figure to EUR 35 billion in 2013.
The Presidency's proposal would have involved a cut from EUR 42 billion of direct aid and market measures to EUR 35 billion in 2013, which, for the 15-nation Europe, would have meant a reduction of close to 17% for the common agricultural policy alone.
And even in the Europe of 27 members, in other words including our Romanian and Bulgarian friends, the CAP would have been reduced by over 5% in the period in question.
To say that nothing was done to lighten the burden of the common agricultural policy is simply untrue.
We did everything possible to achieve it.
In October 1985, when I presented my first budget to Parliament here â the one for 1986 â agriculture accounted for 68% of the European budget.
I proposed that it should not exceed 37%, or EUR 35 billion, in 2013.
What a long way we have come!
What obstinacy in being unable to see it!
Under the Presidencyâs proposal, the CAP would have been the only sector where expenditure fell considerably, while, for instance, all forward-looking investment would have increased.
A rise of 7.5% in expenditure on the Lisbon goals: 7.5% per annum for the whole period 2007â2013, representing an increase of 65% in appropriations for the Lisbon goals as compared to 2006.
An increase of 15% for policies in the field of justice and home affairs, including, in particular, increasing the effectiveness of action to combat cross-border crime.
Finally, a 2% increase in cohesion policies for the 27 countries, with a greater concentration on the new Member States.
We had introduced some changes to the criteria for distribution between the old and new Member States in terms of the cohesion policies, increasing to 53% the total appropriation to the new Member States, compared to 47% in the Commissionâs proposal.
To argue that the bulk of the effort, in our proposal, would have fallen on the shoulders of the old Member States is simply not true.
Then we come, Mr President, to a comparison of the research budget with that of the common agricultural policy, and vice versa.
We cannot compare apples and pears.
Why try to compare when a comparison is impossible?
The common agricultural policy is the sole true Community policy financed exclusively from the European budget.
Research is, first and foremost, a national policy, supported by the Community budget.
The two cannot be compared.
Based on the Presidencyâs proposal, the CAP would have cost EUR 305 billion for the whole of the period in question.
The public research policies of the Member States and of the European Union, if the national policies had remained at todayâs levels, would have represented EUR 524.5 billion for the period 2007â2013, far more than the common agricultural policy.
If the European Union had proved able to make an effort as proposed by the Presidency, and the Member States had complied with their undertakings in relation to a reformulation of the Lisbon strategy, they would have increased the public share of research budgets from 1.9% to 3% of GDP.
National and EU research policies should have reached a total of EUR 785 billion by 2013.
If all decisions had been respected and if the Presidencyâs proposals had been accepted, research budgets would have been EUR 785 billion â I am referring to the public share of research budgets â compared to EUR 305 billion for the CAP.
So let us hear no more nonsense talked about this affair.
Spending on the common agricultural policy would have been adjusted downwards and, on a comparison with something genuinely comparable, would be well below half the figure for research spending.
So, let us stop comparing things which are not comparable.
That, Mr President, is a brief summary of the facts.
Today we have a disagreement.
We shall have to find an agreement enabling us to introduce the new policies on good terms in the new Member States from 2007 onwards.
We have no right to let down the new Member States which, in all my bilateral discussions with them and in the final and general discussion, behaved with remarkable dignity.
We now have to move ahead and find a better formula, if there is one, but this must be done without destroying the mechanisms for cohesion, without watering down common policies, and without damaging the cohesion policies.
This is essential â absolutely imperative.
Apart from that, Luxembourg, to which I look forward to returning in the near future to devote myself exclusively to its many and, in the short term, very weighty issues, is ready to contribute wholeheartedly to a search for that solution, without bitterness or a spirit of revenge.
Mr President, the last item on the agenda of the European Council was the process of ratifying the Constitution.
I shall deal with this aspect more succinctly because, here, the decisions of the European Council have been reported more objectively by the participants and observers.
It is a fact that ten countries have ratified the Constitutional Treaty, while two others, France and the Netherlands, have rejected it.
Our view â not because we are pig-headed, stubborn or short-sighted â was that the Constitutional Treaty was not the main issue, but rather that the Constitutional Treaty was the response to many of the problems of Europeâs citizens with the European Union.
Consequently, we opted to persevere with the ratification process.
Some Member States, no doubt feeling the need for a period of reflection, explanation and discussion, and therefore of democracy, before going to the people either in parliament or in a referendum, decided, in the wake of that decision, to defer their scheduled referenda or parliamentary ratification.
In those countries, the debate will take place.
For my part, I should like this appeal, which was the appeal of the European Council, to be heard and for there to be a longer period of reflection, explanation, debate and, if necessary, disagreement throughout Europe â in the Member States who have still to ratify, in those which have already ratified and in the two which rejected the Constitutional Treaty.
It is vital that the European debate, enriched and nourished by the ideas of everyone involved, should take place in all Member States of the European Union.
We need to debate Europe, and I want the institutions of the Union, the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Member States, civil society, unions, political parties and national parliaments all to join in that vast debate.
I also want the Commission to take its rightful place in the debate â a discussion which will be both 27-times national and European.
I want the Commission, the guardian not only of the Treaty but above all of the spirit of the Treaty, and of the European ambition, to be at the very centre of the discussions.
This is not to give the impression that everything is inspired, managed and predetermined in Brussels, but is aimed to ensure that this 27-times national, and therefore European, debate can be guided by wisdom and ambition.
Mr President, I invite, recommend and urge you to involve both yourself in person and the Commission in that debate; I know you are eager to do it; you must do it, it is urgent.
We are told, and I have said so myself, that during the budget debate we have seen a stand-off between two concepts of Europe: one based rather more on market forces, a market unable to produce solidarity, and another based, not rather more but completely, on a more highly-developed political integration.
The free trade area on one side and political union on the other.
This is the debate we are about to have, and we are already seeing Europe divided into two opposing camps.
There are those who believe that Europe as it stands has already gone too far, and those, like me, who think it has still not gone far enough.
This explanatory debate must be used to reconcile these two segments of public opinion which, today, do not talk to one another, staring at one another like statues, unable even to engage in dialogue.
We, the European institutions, must build a bridge between these two camps of our public opinion.
But I was considerably reassured to read that those who had thought, after the latest European Council, that there had been a clash, a conflict between two visions of Europe, were making a big mistake.
That no one really wanted Europe to become a free trade area; that reassured me considerably.
As you know, free trade areas cannot be established overnight.
The less we invest in political union, the more we â unknowingly, unconsciously and imperceptibly â pave the way, with an implacable logic, for the concept of a free trade area.
When this concept has been achieved, it will appear to have been an altogether natural development and one which rules out any possibility of going back â and supporters of the free trade area would view it as a backward step â to political union.
There are those who say they have no intention of leading Europe towards a free trade area, an excessively simplistic concept for an ultra-complicated continent.
It is quite simple: those who thought they were highlighting the dangers of a free trade area were wrong.
Those who say they were wrong will use the next few months and years to show that they, too, want nothing but political union as described in the Constitution.
It is as simple as that, a matter of saying yes or no to the question I have just asked.
At the end of this Presidency, Mr President, I wanted to remind you, this time without quoting myself, that at the outset I had insisted on the need to respect institutional rules, to respect what is often referred to as the institutional triangle, which I still consider to offer a number of benefits.
We have done so systematically during this Presidency.
Between the Presidency of the European Union and the Commission there has been an exchange of views, an ongoing and virtuous debate.
Nothing done by the Presidency has been done without the Commission's prior knowledge.
No initiative has been taken by the Commission without the Presidency being notified in advance.
The Presidency consulted the Commission on the initiatives it was taking, and vice versa.
It was a great pleasure to work with this Commission, and especially with its President, and I should like to thank the Commission and its President for the large amount of good advice it gave to the Luxembourg Presidency.
Thank you MrÂ Barroso.
As regards Parliament, we worked together like twins.
We often disagreed, either because your proposals were not sensible, or because the sensible proposals of the Presidency were not accepted by all Member States and therefore could not obtain your agreement, an agreement which, however, was spontaneously forthcoming whenever the Presidency referred its initiatives to you prior to submitting them to the other Member States.
Today, the European Parliament has reached maturity.
I am not saying this paternalistically or with condescension, but I can gauge it by the depth of explanations, the intensity and quality of todayâs debates compared to those I have heard since 1982.
It is a great Parliament, which has no reason to keep a low profile, which has its legitimacy and which carries the hopes of the people of Europe.
Very often in its plenary sessions not enough Members are present â not the case today, I am very pleased to say.
Perhaps this is an area where more work is needed.
I talk to Parliament and, when I leave Parliament, I talk to groups of visitors.
Those coming to Parliament do not come just to look at the debating Chamber; they want to see it full.
So, there is room for improvement here.
Apart from that, we know why it is that Members cannot always be present in the Chamber.
I must say that it is a great pleasure to work with Parliament, both in public sessions and, above all, in committees.
What depth of knowledge, what commitment to the European cause is displayed in meetings of the parliamentary groups and parliamentary committees, and in the numerous discussions with individual Members!
I shall be very sorry not to be able to come to the European Parliament so regularly in future to participate in this great European debate, both here in this Chamber and elsewhere.
Mr President, early on 18 June on the morning after the European Council, I bitterly regretted having failed to avoid Europe plunging, not irrevocably but undeniably, into a crisis.
I regretted it and it showed.
I have read that I was not very diplomatic, but I have no desire to be diplomatic when Europe is in crisis, none whatsoever.
Nor did I want to be an actor, merely playing a role.
I am not an actor, I want to work for the interests of Europe and its citizens.
I have no time for acting.
Because we never say what we think, because we always play a role, because we always try to be diplomatic so as not to give offence, people do not understand, people believe we are machines.
We are not machines; we are human beings experiencing disappointment and despondency.
I was disappointed because I had believed that Europe could be considered to have come of age, to have matured.
I had to admit that it is still in its adolescence.
Having believed it to be adult, I now see that we are still in the last stages of a long period of adolescence.
That is why I am disappointed. However, I also had reasons to be pleased.
Pleased, for instance, to have been able to do what we did â together for most of the time â and to have brought at least 20 countries to an agreement on the financial perspectives.
20 out of 25 countries is no mean achievement.
And I was happy and proud to hear, listen to and observe the new Member States giving us a lesson in European ambitions at the end of the European Council meeting.
What a disgrace for those who were not able to do as much!
I felt my convictions being shaken in the early hours of 18 June, and did not have the strength, or the greatness, to launch another appeal on the same day.
Not everyone can be De Gaulle.
I am surprised at my own modesty.
I had felt my convictions undermined for a moment, but after a few days had passed, after receiving thousands of letters from the length and breadth of Europe, after receiving encouragement from the Commission, Parliament and many observers who are also protagonists, I now feel, now that the first disappointment has passed, more determined than ever.
Our generation does not have the right to undo the achievements of prior generations.
We do not have the right to demolish the work of our predecessors, because future generations will need a political Europe.
If it is not political, it will lose its way.
They need and want a Europe of solidarity, a social Europe, a competitive Europe, a Europe which is strong at home and strong in the world.
So, members of old Europe, committed Europeans, back to work!
With enthusiasm!
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, once upon a time, one of my teachers advised me always to be pessimistic because, that way, all my life, I would either be right or pleasantly surprised.
To judge from the reactions and events of the past few days, pessimism would seem to be fully justified, but I must tell you that I do not believe in pessimism.
I think I can say that, now more than ever, we need to show our determination.
It is true that there are problems in Europe, and it is true that they are serious problems, but we must confront them and be able to find a solution.
During the Luxembourg Presidency, we have witnessed the implementation of grand initiatives and innovations which will guide the activities of the European Union over the years to come.
Let me start by going back, from the Commissionâs viewpoint, over these last six months, a period that has been marked by the experience and the European conviction of my friend MrÂ Juncker.
First of all, we succeeded in adopting our strategic objectives for the EU over the coming five years.
It was the first time that they were approved jointly with the Council and Parliament.
Today, those same broad guiding principles in terms of prosperity, solidarity and security provide us with a framework, a framework shared by all the institutions of the European Union.
We therefore have the opportunity for our actions to be much more effective and focused, and to be able to translate our actions into a true partnership for renewal.
It is also thanks to the Luxembourg Presidency that we have negotiated an agreement on how to base the Stability and Growth Pact on a more realistic and practical foundation.
This reform has neither weakened nor relaxed the pact.
It has even given governments greater flexibility, via the financial instruments, to optimise growth over the economic cycle.
However, the greatest success of the Luxembourg Presidency, from the point of view of the Commissionâs priorities, may have been the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy during the Spring European Council.
This was a step forward, not only for the institutions and governments, but also for all European citizens.
It is worth remembering that, however important the interinstitutional debate is, the majority of Europeans, when they get together as a family, at school, at work or at leisure, do not discuss the possible configurations of the blocking minority in the system of qualified majority voting.
What actually concerns our fellow citizens is the slowdown in the economy.
Above all, they are anxious about their jobs or the difficulty of finding work.
That is why we have relaunched the Lisbon Strategy: growth and employment.
That is why we think that we must, all of us, the European institutions, increase our efforts in areas that directly affect the lives of our citizens.
That is the route to take to reforge the links between Europe and its citizens and to respond to the concerns of Europeans.
That said, there have been other successes during the Luxembourg Presidency, particularly in our external relations.
PresidentÂ Juncker has already mentioned this: the summit with Russia, those with Canada and the United States, the better relationship we now have with our great partner on the other side of the Atlantic, all of that can be credited to the Luxembourg Presidency.
During the last European Council, we primarily discussed two questions: what should we do during this period following the referenda in the Netherlands and France and what should we do with regard to the financial perspectives?
First of all, the debate on the future of Europe.
The European Councilâs decision seems to me to be a wise one.
The European leaders decided to have a period of reflection and have opened the door to debate, dialogue and democracy.
You doubtless remember that the Commission said, just on the eve of the European Council, that it, for its part, wanted to launch this debate by going, if necessary, and this is what we are going to do, to all the Member States of the EU to debate and to listen, not only to the governments, which is certainly important, but also to the parliaments, the social partners and young people in these countries.
We are very proud that the European Council has given us a mandate to have a special role in this enterprise, in this debate that must be organised in each Member State, but that must also be held at European level.
We are going to do that, and we hope that, at the end of this exercise, we will be able to present to all Europeans our strategic vision for Europe.
What will Europe be like in the coming years, in the six or fifteen years to come?
We must launch this debate without being afraid of any of the subjects, even those that are more difficult and more complex for the institutions.
We must discuss not only expenditure but also our aims.
We must talk about the European social model.
How can we work on it in the 21st century?
How can we modernise this European social model?
How can we reach an equilibrium with regard to Community legislation?
How can we avoid bureaucracy at European level?
How can we deal with further enlargement, such that Europeans can support it and understand the importance of having a united Europe?
We are sure that the European Parliament will have a contribution, a very important contribution, to make to this debate and we, the European Commission, want to work with you because we think it is necessary to build a new consensus in Europe.
I shall now turn to the other main subject of last weekâs summit.
It was very disappointing that we were unable to reach a conclusion on the financial perspective.
The presidency worked tirelessly for a breakthrough and I have to say that we were near an agreement.
Unfortunately, discussions on the budget have seldom brought out the best in the Member States and, sadly, last week it was no different.
There are some fundamentally different views and some clear national interests, but this in itself is not so unusual.
What makes the situation especially delicate is that this âno solutionâ for the financial perspective comes after two ânoesâ in two national referenda.
I regret that, during the European Council, no leaders were able to show a true spirit of compromise and solidarity on that very important occasion.
But it would be wrong to give the impression that we have gone nowhere as a result of last week.
The committed work of the Luxembourg presidency over the last six months has brought us a long way.
This is important because there is a real urgency to get an agreement.
If we do not reach agreement, then there is a risk of paralysis which will have a very negative effect on our policies and on all the Member States, particularly the new Member States.
I want to underline the very constructive approach taken by the new Member States.
Sometimes people ask me whether it is not more difficult to be in the Commission now with 25 â and very soon to be 27 â Member States.
Is it not a much more complex and difficult European Union?
I say it is, but let us be frank. The problems we now have in Europe are not the result of the demands of the new Member States; they are not the cause of the problems we have in Europe today.
When we consider the work of the Luxembourg presidency we have to say that we cannot go backwards.
We must build on the outgoing presidencyâs achievements in order to get an agreement as soon as possible.
The incoming presidency has made it clear that it also intends to take these dossiers forward and we now wait with interest for the UK presidency to relaunch the process.
The Commission is ready to work with this presidency and all the Member States.
More work is needed.
I made it clear last week that I have real problems with the downgrading of some of the policies that the Commission and Parliament have emphasised.
This is particularly true of those policies aimed at renewed economic dynamism.
Genuine reform comes at a price. Reducing the Commissionâs proposed spending in areas such as research, innovation, education or transport and energy networks will have a real policy cost.
Our citizens are unlikely to be forgiving if we fail to deliver on our promise regarding growth and jobs.
But let us be frank.
The problem, when the Council reduced the ambition of proposal by the Commission and Parliament, and when the Council decided to follow the âoneÂ per cent clubâ, was that the areas that were particularly sacrificed were precisely those of competitiveness, growth, education, innovation and research.
Cohesion was more or less kept.
The common agricultural policy was, of course, maintained in accordance with the agreement made three years ago, but there were major cuts in the areas of competitiveness, growth, innovation and research.
This shows the price of that famous letter from six of the Member States asking for oneÂ per cent.
It is a pity that the Member States that agreed on oneÂ per cent expenditure â the ones agreeing on that â cannot now agree in the European Council.
In fact, they were divided on the issue.
It shows what happens all too often today in Europe.
It is easier to get a coalition for a ânoâ vote than to get a coalition for a âyesâ, when what we need in Europe now are coalitions for âyesâ and not more coalitions for ânoâ.
These important coalitions are needed for the project for Europe to go forward.
The Commission will go on with its work and will pursue the goal of reaching a balanced agreement with the Member States.
This must involve Parliament.
We want to be sure that when the European Council is ready to reach an agreement it can be swiftly followed by the signing of an interinstitutional agreement between all parties: Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
The negotiations will only be over at that moment.
I count on Parliamentâs support in this respect.
I do not want to underestimate the degree of difficulty nor the disagreements on priorities, but this necessary debate should not delay an agreement.
This is why, even before the European Council, the Commission proposed a review clause.
I was very happy to work with President-in-Office Juncker and, as he said earlier, we were discussing a review clause with the Member States.
This means that, as we do not know exactly what the world will be like in 2013, we should not have an overall debate before we approve the financial perspective.
On the contrary, we should approve the financial perspective as soon as possible and then arrange a meeting later in order to adapt our budget to changing priorities and the international environment.
This is wisdom itself.
What we cannot use now is an overall debate on priorities as a reason or pretext for not reaching an agreement on the financial perspective.
However, at the same time, it is true that we should engage in a serious debate about the reform of the Community budget.
We must look forward.
It is also true that we should have a meeting at a later stage in order to address all those important questions.
This is why we should keep to the deadline for the next phase of the negotiations.
If we do not do this, we could fail, and it is my duty to draw the attention of this Parliament to a risk of paralysis in the European Union.
We must avoid that risk.
Even during this very difficult situation, we are continuing to take decisions.
As President-in-Office Juncker said, after the European Council we were taking decisions with our partners in the United States and Canada.
Yesterday I was in Italy for the inauguration of the European Food Safety Authority.
Today the Commission took important decisions on a Green Paper on energy efficiency and a new regime for the sugar markets.
We are continuing to make decisions.
I promise you that the Commission does not feel any kind of inhibitions about taking the decisions or initiatives that Europe deserves.
However, it is important now to engage the Council, all partners and all institutions and to move in the same direction.
I ask you not to overlook the other achievements of the European Council.
We have seen the endorsement of the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment and an action plan to implement The Hague Programme for freedom, security and justice.
These two results address our key objectives of prosperity and security and the mainstream concerns of our citizens.
The European Council also approved guiding principles for sustainable development.
This should ensure continuing improvements to the quality of life, not only for current generations but also for future ones.
There was also the very important decision to confirm at the highest level â at a European Union summit â the decisions taken by the development ministers following a Commission proposal about our commitment to overseeing development aid and our commitment to Africa.
This was a very important step taken by the European Council.
What follows now?
Is the glass half empty or half full?
As I said before, the problem is serious but we can turn it into an opportunity.
Sooner or later this clarification had to come and, let us face it, we now have that opportunity.
We are closer to agreement on the financial perspective than many people realise.
We should also remember that never in the history of the European Union have financial packages been approved during the first round of negotiations.
Therefore, I call on all the parties concerned to reflect on the consequences of deadlock and to show some flexibility.
I call on all the parties to show less nationalistic rhetoric and to engage in a truly European solution.
The fact remains that both the Luxembourg presidency in general and the European Council in particular have achieved much of which we can be proud.
It is true that there is still much to do.
Together with the Members of this House, the Commission will work for a future that confirms Europeâs capacity to do business, even if the times do not call for business as usual.
We will then be able to prove that the pessimists and the cynics are not always right and that there are reasons to have confidence in the future.
I would like to finish with a few words for my friend MrÂ Juncker.
Not only for MrÂ Juncker, but also for the whole of the Luxembourg Presidency, for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the Minister for European Affairs, for the diplomats and for the experts.
I have been really moved to see the conviction, the determination and the enthusiasm of everybody in this extraordinary team.
On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to thank you, Jean-Claude, and all your colleagues, for what you have done for Europe.
I sincerely hope that I will be able to say the same thing to the next President of the European Council.
I will say the same thing if I think it, but I will not say it if I do not think it.
Presidencies come and go, but the Commission remains.
The Commission defends the general interests of Europe and I would say to you that the Commission, with the support of this Parliament, I hope, will continue to give its full sincere support to the various Presidencies.
For its part, the Commission expects the various Presidencies to have the same vocation, the same determination and the same enthusiasm for our European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, before all else, to express the heartfelt gratitude of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the President-in-Office of the European Council, for the great passion and conviction with which he has led us, in the European Union, through these months.
For this dedication, for this passion, for this conviction, Mr Juncker, you have the warm thanks of the PPE-DE Group.
On Saturday morning, the President-in-Office of the European Councilâs disappointment was plain for us all to see, and this disappointment we shared with him.
We hope the day will come when we will again be able to join together in rejoicing over successes, and that is now a task for all of us.
The fact that the President of this House referred a short time ago to the Soviet occupation, 65Â years ago, of the three Baltic states â Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania â is itself a sign of hope.
Who, 20 years ago, would have thought that there would be Members in this House hailing from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania?
It is because that is such a tremendous thing that we must, even now, believe in our continentâs future.
Any attempt at analysis must start from the situation as it now stands, and to those who say, âwe are in a state of political crisisâ, I say, âI agree with youâ.
We must, though, make it our concern that this political crisis should not disorient us and seduce us into activity for activityâs sake, and so we must respond with determination and deliberation.
We believe in this Europe of ours, and, for that reason, the political will must be there to lead this Europe of ours, this European Union, into a bright future.
We find ourselves, though, in a twofold crisis of confidence; one that involves various protagonists in the European Council and has been building up for several years, and a crisis as regards many peopleâs confidence in the European Unionâs policymakers.
Many people feel that a lot of things are going too fast, and we must regard the regaining of their trust as a common endeavour.
What is our goal?
We want a European Union that is strong, effective and democratic, and all those who want to make it no more than a free trade zone within Europe will have a fight on their hands.
Our Group wants no part of any such thing; we want a strong, effective and democratic European Union, one that enables us to defend our interests in the world.
We say the same thing to those who believe that what we need today is the rebuilding of axes; we have heard of one proposal for a Franco-German Union, while others are dreaming of a change of government ushering in an axis between the United Kingdom and Germany.
To those who think like this I have this to say: on the contrary, while we need good bilateral relationships, they must be offered to the European Union as a whole, and it is on this basis of goodwill that we, in the European Union, must then function as a community.
It is worth my adding that the Treaty of Nice makes provision for enhanced cooperation.
If some countries want to go further, we can do just that in many areas â foreign and security policy among them.
Where the Constitutional Treaty is concerned, we must be self-critical.
The referendum in Luxembourg is now, no doubt, going to go ahead on 10Â July, and I wish the President-in-Office every success in it.
We now have a pause for thought, and we must use it in order to think.
Rather than having a respite from thinking, we must use the time we now have in order to think and to ensure that, when this process of reflection is over, Parts 1 and 2 of the Constitutional Treaty can become legal and political realities.
If I may turn to the European Unionâs budget, we find the failure to achieve a result regrettable, but we â including Reimer BÃ¶ge, who is present in the Chamber â can take some pride in the fact that this House has succeeded in putting together a proposal, and we call on the Heads of State or Government to take it as their guide and to seek to make the reforms that are needed.
This House has already given its answer.
This Financial Perspective is needed â and I say this with the utmost seriousness â for those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that joined the European Union on 1Â May 2004, and that must be able to rely on our common solidarity in planning how they are to develop their weakest regions.
It is for that reason that I hope we will be able to complete this Financial Perspective, which we owe to the European Unionâs new Member States, under the incoming British presidency.
We in the PPE-DE Group will play our part in making this possible, and we will do so in a spirit of solidarity.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, totting up the debits and credits of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council has been an emotional business.
We have heard a speech that was extraordinary not only by reason of the character of the man delivering it, but also by reason of its extraordinary frankness.
I have been a Member of this House for 11 years. In all that time, I have never come across such frankness in a presentation on a European Council by its Presidency.
For this frankness I am grateful, for it gives this House greater knowledge and hence affords it the opportunity to better analyse what transpired last weekend.
A lot happened, and let me repeat at the very outset what you, Mr President-in-Office, said: it was a defeat for Europe.
You were right there.
You went on to say that it also represented a defeat for the Presidency, but that is where you are wrong.
Anyone who saw you over the weekend â and we all did â saw something that was not a defeat for the Council Presidency.
It may well, today, be too early to judge, but I am quite certain that those who come after us will rank Jean-Claude Juncker among the truly great Europeans.
For that we are grateful to you.
After 60 hours of negotiations, followed by a 15-minute visit from one who had participated in them, we can understand some of the bitterness that came out in your speech, for it is a fact that what emerges from this summit is that the time really has come for the European Union to spell out the facts. Europe is indeed in a crisis situation, but then so are its Heads of State or Government.
The fact is that, for years, the people who hold the reins of power in Europe â in other words, the European Council, the Heads of State or Government â have invariably taken the same approach.
Victory was theirs; it was the Brussels bureaucrats who lost.
It became clear from last weekendâs summit that we can now put a name to what has caused Europe to lose out: the particularism of those Heads of State or Government who believe that the interests of all are served when each thinks only of himself.
Parliaments exist to give expression to what the public feels, and you are right to say that high diplomacy belongs somewhere else; this is where the truth has to be told.
Today, Mr Juncker, I want to give you every credit for telling it like it is and for calling things by their proper names.
We have lessons to learn from that, and one important one is that we should start by noting that, of the three institutions, two have done their homework; the Commission produced its proposal for the Financial Perspective, and Parliament decided on its position, while the Council has shown itself incapable of coming to an agreement on it.
Let me point out that two of the institutions that participate in the trialogue have done what they had to do.
The Council has not, and we will wait.
It is not acceptable that everyone sitting around the table should be saying âIâm rightâ.
Then the next person to be called upon to speak says, âIâm right, tooâ.
The third person to speak also says, âThat may well be so, but Iâm rightâ.
How such people can reach a result that is of any use to Europe escapes me.
