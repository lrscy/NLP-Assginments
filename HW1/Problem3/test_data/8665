The Council is not the only institution with which you liaise.
It would, I might add, be pertinent to enhance the cooperation between the EU Presidency and our Assembly.
During the most recent summit, at Hampton Court, the Council called on you to give fresh impetus to issues relating to migration and internal security.
We are delighted by this initiative because, until now, the Council has to some extent put a brake on the judicial cooperation requested by our Parliament.
These issues relating to internal security and the fight against terrorism must not only be addressed at intergovernmental level.
That is why we are awaiting strong initiatives in this regard and are thus calling for the actions relating to Internet protection to be completely revised. These actions will enable us to establish cyber security, without for all that restricting the freedom of the Internet.
âBetter regulationâ does not mean âdo nothingâ, but âdo betterâ: target the EUâs intervention better.
Before making proposals, we need to give a great deal of thought to Europeâs plus points.
Doing so is important, among other things, for supporting research.
We therefore welcome the creation of the European Technology Institute.
This plus point also consists in making sure that the European texts are properly enforced.
Each Commissioner should issue on a quarterly basis a clear and precise account of the state of play.
We also need to review the comitology procedure, just as we also want to be more involved in the essential process of simplifying legislation.
The Commission not only wants to tackle the problems faced by Europeans today, but also the issues at stake tomorrow.
Two aspects seem to be particularly important.
The first relates to demography and the ageing population.
In this regard, a more family-oriented environment needs to be created.
Although it is one of the Member Statesâ powers to create this environment, the European Union can try to gather together the best initiatives within the 25 Member States and propose effective solutions with regard to health policy.
The other aspect relates to the sustainable management of natural resources and, in particular, the impetus given to energy policy.
The proposal for an action plan in respect of energy efficiency and the proposal concerning the draft Green Paper, aimed at guaranteeing safe, competitive and sustainable energy sources, are along the right lines.
We will see to it that these objectives are reflected on the ground, particularly in terms of the development of biofuels and of inland waterway transport.
Finally, Europe will become all the stronger for putting pressure on international negotiations.
We know that we cannot hope for much from the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting, but we call on you not to question the reform of the CAP, decided in 2003, and to continue to support multifunctional agriculture.
Our future prospects will, however, come to nothing if we do not have any financial perspective before the end of the year.
How could we possibly function with annual budgets?
MrÂ Barroso, you yourself said that 2006 would be a crucial year for turning words into concrete actions.
You know that a good number of projects are awaiting this budget.
Parliament has done its duty, by means of the BÃ¶ge report.
It is up to you to put pressure on the UK Presidency to break the deadlock in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, there is certainly much in the programme and in what President Barroso said today that we can endorse, particularly â and I am picking up on a point made by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo when I say this â Commissioner Mandelsonâs attempts at keeping the Hong Kong round of talks fair and balanced.
Despite his scepticism, I hope that will be achieved.
Your programme, Mr President, in which you express the desire to unlock Europeâs full potential, is a very ambitious one, but I have to say, on the basis of our groupâs consideration of it, that there are a few essentials missing from it.
Let me start with the riots in the French cities.
Those are certainly French events, but deeper causes underlie them.
Perhaps you now understand why our group has always highlighted the importance of social cohesion, for where people are unemployed, where they are not integrated, where they are isolated and discriminated against, upheavals of that kind are not far away.
This programme also, in this regard, lacks any clear statement about the importance of public services, which are especially important, particularly in cities, as a means of accommodating and helping people who have fewer chances in life.
Something else you referred to, Mr President of the Commission, was the energy issue.
Although I have a high regard for the Energy Commissioner and work well with him, I have to say that we have often pointed out how important it is, in view of current developments, that the Commission as a whole should give a clear commitment to a policy on alternative energy.
It is also vital that you should introduce to Europe what is an almost universal practice in America, of obliging the big corporations to plough back more of their disproportionate profits into research and development.
We are curious as to what the Green Paper â which should have been available some time ago â will contain, and it will certainly be the subject of vigorous and serious debate.
Thirdly, there is Europeâs research potential, and this we must awaken.
We are currently debating the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, but does the Commission have any overall scheme for implementing it?
To give one example, your programme makes only vague and cautious reference to the European Institute of Technology, yet this is where there is a need for more boldness and determination on your part, and for you to put forward an overall concept for European universities.
We must stop subsidising the Americans by exporting young researchers to them.
We educate them and then let them go to America, because they have too few opportunities in Europe.
There is also the need for a scheme whereby access to research resources may be improved for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.
That, too, is an absolute necessity.
I agree with what you had to say about âbetter lawmakingâ; it is in the interests of many large businesses, of small and medium-sized enterprises, and of the individual citizen, that we should accomplish this.
While we support the Vice-President in what she plans to do, better regulation is also a task for us in this House.
We must do far more than we have before to explain, defend and justify every single law-making initiative to the public, and we need to be sensitive in the way we do it.
We need to act with a greater sense of purpose.
This is not so much about the Commission examining individual measures in terms of their legality, but about whether the Member States are able to achieve the objectives associated with European legislation.
You were right to make reference to social issues, but it is far from clear enough from the programme that economic and social development must go hand in hand.
What I would like to see is for you, on behalf of the Commission, to produce a report next year on progress with enlargement â which is a topic to which I should like to return, although I would perhaps attach another meaning to it.
There is a great deal of scepticism on the part of the public; many people in the old Member States get the impression that enlargement is being used to lower social standards and cut taxes.
Thinking back to the debate that we had with you, Mr President of the Commission, and with Commissioner McCreevy, I do not think we were able to get across just how important this social issue is to us.
Now that I read in the â the Commissionâs principal mouthpiece â that Commissioner McCreevy is absolutely opposed to tax harmonisation, I find myself wondering whether it really is our aim to keep cutting direct taxes and make ourselves incapable of funding our social and other infrastructure services.
Do we want a single, shared Europe with far lower social standards?
We â and by that I mean the old and new Member States together â must aim to accomplish a social Europe.
I would like to see the Commission produce a report on that next year.
According to a recent report in the , many of the statesmen of major countries â SchrÃ¶der, Chirac, Blair â can be expected to stand down in the next few years.
Poland now has a completely new government.
At a time when new governments and new Heads of Government are coming to power, the Commission must take on a leadership role in this Europe of ours, with which these new people are perhaps less familiar, if the European ideal is not to fade still further.
If you assume such a leadership role, we will support you, but, if you do so, please make a social Europe one of your objectives!
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the work programme for 2006 is not just any old programme.
It must be a programme that makes the EU visible once more to every citizen, and, moreover, visible in a positive light.
The EUâs problems with credibility and acceptance may no longer be the stuff of newspaper headlines, but they have, of course, still not gone away, and they can be back on the front pages at any moment.
It is because they are far from having been overcome that the challenge for the EU is all the greater: its policies must show the public that it really is worth it.
That will be achieved through comprehensible policies that produce results, and the best possible results at that.
What that does not mean is producing as much legislation as possible with the maximum impact on the maximum number of people.
On the contrary, the big issue for the politics of united Europe must always be about how we can get Europe to the top.
That is where the title of the work programme, âunlocking Europeâs full potentialâ, gets it exactly right.
I might add that that was the keynote of the Liberalsâ election campaign in 2004, and I am glad to see you making use of it.
It is for that reason, too, that I am glad that the work programme was put together in cooperation with Parliamentâs committees.
Putting together a common programme for all the EU institutions is a step in the right direction.
The fact is that everything else is fragmentary, and the public no longer regard it as justifiable.
The four core areas â to which reference has already been made â are very definitely the right ones.
It follows that the claim that this policy is close to the publicâs concerns is still very far from being backed up.
Neither in structure nor in content, alas, does the work programme meet this requirement of being close to the public; at any rate, it cannot be called better regulation if the two parts presented have nothing whatever to do with one another, so that the programme does not hang together.

I would like to highlight a few areas that are of particular importance to us Liberals and Democrats.
It is a very good thing that the highest priority is given to the Lisbon agenda; a consistent policy aimed at education, research and growth will create more jobs and thereby make the EU competitive.
That does of course involve the realisation of the single market for services, including financial services.
It is also important that we should be ambitious in driving forward the reform of agricultural policy by, among other things, reallocating more funds to agricultural research and technology.
Where internal security is concerned, we believe that two aspects have to be accorded equal importance, one being the need for security and the other respect for freedom.
The fact is that we will be no more secure, nor will terrorism be vanquished, if the freedoms of the EU, against which terrorism is fighting, are themselves curtailed.
Europe is an example, unique in the world, of how lasting peace can be established between countries that were formerly enemies.
It is also unique in its peaceful export of the market economy, democracy and human rights.
Great though this is, if we are to remain successful, it must point us all in one single direction, and, as the question is what that will be, we, as Europeâs legislators, are under an obligation to come up with comprehensible, reliable and prompt answers.
That must be part of our workaday lives; it must become our daily labour.
Over the coming weeks, with this work programme for 2006, we must set an example of how to do that.
Over and above that, though, there must be a single dream to unite us as Europeans.
It was Victor Hugo who once said that nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.
Europe was such an idea, and it still is one.
The work programme can be a stone in the mosaic of this idea, but it must fit into the picture of a Europe that wants to move forwards, and, most of all, to become stronger.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, Commissioners, on listening to you, MrÂ Barroso, and on reading the Commissionâs text, the first feeling that comes to my mind is one of wishing you well in your work and of wishing us all well in our work because, for each of the projects, Parliament will, of course, have its say and because Parliament will have power of codecision.
When I listen to you say âprosperity, solidarity, securityâ, that has a nice ring to it.
There are other kinds of triptych: liberty, equality, fraternity.
Another term to be found, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is dignity, together with the term justice.
One concept is missing, however, and that is sustainability.
I, for my part, said to myself: the word âsustainableâ in English actually has a nice ring to it.
The French equivalent, , has much less of a nice ring to it.
While the strange term sounds even worse.
Perhaps another triptych could be: live, move and love.
Just a suggestion!
On a more serious note, where is the urgency?
On listening to you â and you are an eloquent speaker â one says to oneself: âHe is rightâ.
Something is missing, however, and my group permanently feels somewhat uneasy.
This uneasiness would, if I might picture it once again as something visible, truly disappear if the sustainable development strategy that you are announcing for December did not prove to be the poor child of Daddy Barroso because, you know, that notorious image of your three children remains engraved in our memories.
I should like to try to make myself understood: you constantly refer to the US economy, but are you aware that the ecological footprint of the US economy is six times greater than what the planet can bear, while for the European economies, this footprint varies between three and four times what the planet can bear?
That is what a study carried out by the World Wide Fund indicates, and it would be interesting if, as part of this sustainable development strategy, the Commission were to tell us whether it recognises this finding and if it draws any conclusions from it in terms of European public policies.
As regards the issue of businesses and competitiveness, ecologists are absolutely convinced that businesses are not the main, but the crucial, actors in terms of sustainable development.
That is why, in knowing that businesses are torn between the duty to be accountable to their shareholders each quarter and the need to draw up strategies on sustainable development and long-term investment, my group, together with the European Parliament, constantly emphasise the need to set objectives backed up by figures.
We therefore want 20% to 25% renewable energy by 2020 and we want cars that consume 2.5 litres of petrol per 100 km by 2020, because 70% of oil consumption is linked to transport in the European Union.
As far as the economic and social issue is concerned, MrÂ Barroso, it would be wise to convince the people that the single European market cannot be constructed on the basis of social dumping.
Let it be known from this moment on â by doing so, you will not exceed your prerogatives â that the compromise put forward by MrsÂ Gebhardt on the country of origin principle can be acceptable to the Commission.
Let the new Member States and, above all, the governments know too that the restriction clauses imposed on labour law for all EU citizens are useless and unacceptable and that, on 1 May 2006, they can be removed.
There you have a number of suggestions that I wanted to share with you.
I do not have time to continue but, if you like, I could speak to you about them in another context.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the parliamentary term I said in this House that this Parliament resulted from elections in which all the government parties were defeated â starting with your country, MrÂ Barroso, Portugal.
That was the sign of an economic and social crisis that was also related to European policies, that is to say free-trade policies.
We needed decisive action but did not get it â not even after the referendum results in France and theÂ Netherlands rejecting the Constitutional Treaty.
In fact there was a temptation to ignore the people, instead of changing the policy.
We then had the presidency of MrÂ Blair, who presents himself as the answer to Europeâs problems when it is clear that he is an integral part of these problems.
Indeed, his presidency is coming to an end and we have not even reached agreement on the budget.
This is a failure for which you, MrÂ Barroso, must carry equal responsibility with MrÂ Blair, in that you and your Commission have gone along with all the stages of the crisis as it unfolded and indeed have ended up by making things worse.
What can we say about your most recent proposals, when you spoke to us about a simplification that in fact would mean not doing the good things, such as the REACH directive, but instead doing the bad things, such as the Bolkestein directive?
The point is that the free-trade route is taking Europe down a blind alley.
The problem is exemplified not by Europe or by enlargement or by Turkey, but by free trade; and today you have once again suggested that we go down this blind alley.
Instead we need something quite different.
We need to draw up a plan to revive qualified development and a form of social cohesion that would be capable of reinstating the European social model as an alternative to the North American model, not as a poor copy of it.
To do this we need a sounder budget that is not pared down to the bone, and a package of regulations that would promote upward harmonisation and not the social âdumpingâ of the Bolkestein directive.
We need cooperation within Europe and with other countries to relaunch qualified development, not senseless competition or the ruinous dictatorship of the World Trade Organisation.
We must give priority to innovation and the environment, not to the absurd and disastrous revival of nuclear energy.
We need communication networks that promote respect for the environment and do not connive at its destruction.
We need to give citizenship to immigrants and ensure that there is no repetition of the episodes we have seen in Lampedusa and Melilla.
We must guarantee democracy and not the so-called security packages that adversely affect democratic rights and have furthermore been rejected by the UK Parliament.
We must choose peace, not war.
We should give preference to a democratic Parliament, not just one more bureaucratic authority.
Finally we need governments of the Left which look to change and not to large, unacceptable coalitions.
We propose an alternative European Left, more and more closely linked to a European society that wants change.
Â Â  . Mr President, I congratulate Mr Barroso for producing this remarkable document.
Mr Barroso, your determination to create a unitary state of Europe has not been diminished by anything as inconvenient as the referendum results in France and Holland.
I even wondered whether Mr Blairâs drive to have less regulation and to scrap unnecessary laws might slow you up a little bit; but no, undaunted you have produced the most ambitious work programme ever seen in the history of the European Union.
What a pity that the British Presidency could not be bothered to turn up this morning to listen to you!
On top of the extension of powers over justice and home affairs, the establishment of EU visas, everything down to regulations on childrenâs toys, I notice that on the budget you say that there must be adequate audit and control systems.
That is pretty rich in the very week that the Court of Auditors is refusing to sign off your accounts for the eleventh year in a row.
You lost the Constitution and you are now treating the voters of France and Holland with contempt.
Many French people will have felt that by voting ânoâ they would have stopped the flow of European bureaucracy.
However, just as their faith in the Maginot Line failed them in 1940, once again the enemies of free, independent states are coming in around the side and engulfing all.
You proved from this work programme that you have learned nothing and that you simply do not get it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank President Barroso and the entire Commission for being here this morning.
It is a pity that Parliament could not reciprocate with an equivalent level of attendance.
One of the key factors in assessing the work programme is to verify that the ideas and proposals put forward in it respond to the current needs of the citizens of the European Union.
I should like to refer briefly to one or two points President Barroso made in his presentation.
He rightly spoke about the importance of the Doha Round and the impact that will have, not just within Europe but around the globe, on increasing trade and also on delivering on aspects of social justice, though not a comprehensive package of social justice.
However, despite President Barrosoâs reassurances, I am somewhat concerned at the attempts being made by people within the Commission and within this Parliament, in preparation for the Hong Kong round of talks, to demand more of European farmers.
Farmers are being asked to make further reductions and sacrifices, despite being told that the 1999 reform constituted a final settlement on the CAP.
They were then told, in 2003 and 2004, that further adjustments had to be made to take account of the approaching World Trade Organization talks.
Suddenly we discover that even more demands are being made on the European agricultural sector.
These are demands that cannot be met if we want to maintain a viable, sustainable agricultural sector within the European Union for the future.
This is not just about protecting farmersâ interests; it is also a very clear and important issue regarding food security, security of food supply and of the standard and quality of food, and security as regards ensuring that biodiversity and the available alternatives are maintained in the rural areas of Europe.
Moving on to the various proposals within the work programme, I welcome the initiatives now being taken on a communication on childrenâs rights.
It is high time that the European Union took the rights of children seriously, as they constitute over 40% of our population but have no standing or status in European policies or ideas, except in the words we use to express our will to protect them.
Owing to technological progress, those ideas on childrenâs rights must now also be linked into cyber security, as we have seen the Internet â despite its wonderful intent, brilliant innovation and the opportunities it presents to us all â being used by people who wish to corrupt innocent minds and pervert the use of the Internet through trafficking in paedophilia and child pornography.
With regard to sustainability, the rising price of oil and fuel in recent months has sent shockwaves through each and every economy, as well as shocking private consumers.
Let us not forget that the price of oil has an impact not just on the economy as a whole, but also on you and me and all individual consumers, not only in the fuel we put into our cars, but also in the price of goods in our shops, our journeys to and from work and so on. The time is ripe to move towards a common European market in energy in which we can utilise the collective strength of the 25 Member States to lever a better price, and to bring together the minds, intelligence and innovation available in those 25 countries to look into alternative fuel supplies, and in particular to look into new ways and new mechanisms for conserving energy.
That is why the proposal for a biofuels directive is also to be welcomed.
However, greater focus should be placed on solar, wind and water energy, as this can also contribute a great deal towards a final energy plan.
Lastly, no matter what anybody says, the financial perspective is the only game in town.
If we do not have the money, we cannot undertake the actions and policies we want.
However, in determining what the financial perspective should be, the onus must be on the Member States to come up with a package, because once again they are the paymasters of future European Union action.
The decision as to whether to contribute monies to the funds we need to implement these important measures rests with them.
The fact that the governments have so far failed to reach agreement on this is unacceptable to everyone.
In fact, it is ironic that the governments of the new Member States are the ones giving the lead on how to resolve the financial perspectives issue.
However, we must not use this failure to secure an agreement as an excuse to block, hinder or stymie the efforts that can currently be made.
I welcome the opportunity to work with you, President Barroso, and with your Commission to deliver on this programme.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, the Ceuta affair has come and gone, the Melilla affair has come and gone and now it is the suburbs that are on fire.
The worldwide media is asking questions and, as for us, what are we doing?
Drafting a legislative programme.
To deal with what?
Global warming, for example, which seems logical; when cars and schools are on fire, there is indeed a problem in terms of global warming and, therefore, in terms of respecting the Kyoto protocol.
Alongside MrsÂ Fischer-Boel, we could, moreover, do slightly more to destroy our agriculture, such as it is; MrÂ Mandelson would obtain an agreement in Hong Kong and, for our part, we would have slightly higher levels of unemployment.
Let us adopt a few more directives, and the mountain of legislation will end up rendering us quite powerless.
I would even go so far as to propose a title for MrÂ Barrosoâs legislative programme: âOperation smoke and mirrorsâ, for the programme is a smoke screen, concealing nice ideas, but ones that only mask tragedies.
One final word, MrÂ Barroso: one Christmas day in the fifth century A.D., the Rhine froze over following a climate change.
Thousands of chariots of fire crossed the Rhine, and Rome was plundered.
Do you know what the Roman Senate was doing during that winter of 483?
It was drafting a legislative programme.
â MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, please refrain from commenting.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, with 96 priority projects, 32 of which are legislative in character, this Europe of ours cannot be accused of not making plans, so respect to it, especially when one bears in mind the fact that the list does not even include the legislative programming that actually should be a priority for 2006, in the shape of some 50 legal bases for the multiannual programmes for the 2007-2013 period.
Basically, then, the package we are discussing today gives little outward indication of its true contents, and what has become of subsidiarity or of the test for it?
The Council, which today is conspicuous by its absence, has, once again, embarrassingly failed to take part in this planning work, let alone set priorities for it.
The two presidencies for next year, Austria and Finland, have even, in a letter dated 19 October, gone so far as to announce their own work programme for 2006, so that is something for us to look forward to, as also to seeing how all these things can be brought together.
It was the Council that could, by means of and in the course of this consultation procedure, have given a fine indication of its commitment to subsidiarity by involving the national parliaments in the manner provided for by the Constitution.
It could have left its mark on this procedure, by approaching Parliament and the Commission, instead of leaving us all in the dark about what is meant to happen next and what proposals the Council itself is going to make.
Parliament has set up a reserve for posts in the Commission, which will be paid out only if the work programme is agreed to.
It would be a good thing if this work programme really were to include all the projects that we know even now to be on the agenda for 2006, and if it paid greater heed to the idea of subsidiarity as regards procedures and substance.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commission said that the Lisbon Strategy was reflected in this work programme.
It is indeed partly reflected in it, but not fully.
You perhaps remember that we had a debate about the balance in the Lisbon Strategy.
We in Parliament expressed the view that social policy, social justice and social cohesion should not be seen as add-ons after growth and employment.
I believed we had agreed that we should see social policy as an integrated part of the Lisbon Process.
This is not reflected in this work programme.
The social dimension is very small.
We have talked about the fact that better legislation does not by definition mean less legislation.
I note that, in the social area, there is no legislation at all.
There are three communications and a Green Paper, and these are things I welcome; but there is no legislation at all.
It is not the case that Parliament has not come up with proposals.
Allow me to discuss a couple of these.
The first concerns the new forms of employment: what are known as the atypical forms of employment, of which there is now an avalanche and which involve less security, reduced influence and probably more stress in workplaces.
We have demanded a directive that addresses these new forms of employment.
Secondly, you, MrÂ Barroso, and I have been at a conference on restructuring.
I understood that we were agreed that, if we were to be able to carry out the restructuring, we had to do it in a way that involved employees in the process.
We have instruments at European level.
We have the European Works Councils, and we in Parliament have demanded an overhaul of the European Works Councils.
We have seen nothing of all this.
Finally, I just want to address the issue of a programme for integrating people with disabilities.
This would be a non-discrimination programme, applicable not just in the labour market sphere, but everywhere.
That too is conspicuous by its absence.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for delivering the Commissionâs programme very much in a political context.
I want to take up one small point: when I arrived in this House six years ago, unlocking the potential of Europeâs internal market was seen in the context of taking full advantage of e-commerce and the arrival of the euro.
To that end, there were many initiatives in the field of civil justice, ensuring that where we give the possibility to move, to do business, to work, to innovate, to trade and to buy, we deliver the balancing legal framework that would give security and access to justice.
The war on terrorism has intervened and the whole criminal justice area has become paramount, but should it be to the exclusion of civil justice, which merits just one paragraph and no new initiatives or even consultations in this programme?
You only have to look at our postbags to see that we are not delivering in the area of civil justice.
You need only look at the agenda of the Committee on Petitions.
The lives of more of our citizens are blighted by the lack of access to civil justice or cross-border redress mechanisms than, fortunately, are directly touched by terrorism.
Please concentrate on civil justice.
Â Â  I have familiarised myself with the document from the Commission.
My conclusion is unambiguous: a lot of talk and not much action.
Globalisation, which is in reality an updated version of capitalism, is taken as a given, as if it were a law of nature.
EU legislation promotes the notion that European work should become cheap labour, the export of jobs abroad and flying the flag of convenience in the Member Statesâ job markets.
I searched the work programme with interest for a legal basis for the President of the Commissionâs announcement that France is to be given an additional subsidy of EUR 50 million on account of the vehicles that have been burnt in the streets in recent weeks.
I do not believe that the current legislation is a legal basis for this form of financial assistance and nothing like it is being proposed in the Commissionâs work programme either.
Is the intention to bribe France to adopt the EUâs financial plans using illegal subsidies?
The Commission proposes to manipulate public opinion in such a way that it takes a more favourable view of it.
This is propaganda and indoctrination, although the Commission speaks of a communications deficit.
In the way it disseminates information, the Commission represents dictatorship by the majority, or democracy is measured by the attitude the majority adopt when lending an ear to the minorities.
In any case, the majority in the referenda in France and the Netherlands voted against the Commissionâs communication and propaganda dictatorship.
Rejecting the Constitution was democracy and did not drive the EU into a crisis.
The failure to adopt the financial framework for 2007-2013, however, is holding up the work of the EU.
As this is possibly a state of emergency, the Commission should start drafting one-year Structural Fund programmes and other programmes in other words plan B.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the national and regional parliaments should now go through the whole of the annual programme and, under the heading âLess and betterâ, monitor it on the basis of the principles of proximity and proportionality.
We want to tackle fewer subjects and, in return, do better-quality work.
The EU should only adopt binding legislation in cross-border areas in which the national parliaments themselves cannot legislate effectively.
In that way, voters would have nothing to lose but everything to gain, and we should have the right of codecision instead of being powerless.
If, however, the EU arrogates power to itself in areas in which the national parliaments themselves can legislate, we lose in terms of both influence and democracy.
Monitoring on the basis of the principle of proximity should begin in Parliamentâs specialist committees, so that the social committees deal with proposals in the social sphere and the transport committees with transport proposals etc. â a procedure adopted in Denmarkâs European Affairs Committee last Friday.
Subsequently, the European Affairs Committees should issue opinions and meet at the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC) in order to adopt the annual programme and to do so, preferably, in such a way that we can see who has voted for what.
The annual programme should then be respected by, and debated in, the European Parliament and the Council.
Only then shall the Commission be invited to prepare legislation, which would then have support from the bottom up.
This would contrast with the present situation in which the Commission itself assumes the power and uses its monopoly on initiatives, its 3Â 000 secret working parties and its access to the Court of Justice to centralise ever more power in Brussels.
There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something.
Centralisation has fortunately led the voters to withhold their assent, as we saw in the Netherlands and France.
The annual programme nonetheless contains a lot from the rejected Constitution.
The ânoâ votes should be respected.
Everything from the Constitution should be excluded.
Thank you, MrÂ President â if there is, in fact, anything to say thank you for.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Europe is faced with demanding, clear and urgent challenges.
There is no doubt that the 20thÂ century has seen the old continent achieve levels of freedom, progress and prosperity that had never been previously reached.
Nevertheless, this remarkable growth has also created new problems that give rise to inequalities, dangers and tensions.
The recent events affecting the French suburbs are a clear signal that security problems no longer relate solely to dangers originating outside our frontiers.
Once again, in fact, current events force us to look at what is happening on our own doorstep and invite us to seek solutions to everyday problems that are so frequent and familiar that all too often they escape our notice.
Our present age is one of remarkable development coupled with infuriating stagnation; of possibilities that open up a better future but also of threatening germs; of an increase in wellbeing that nevertheless has led to the emergence of new diseases.
It therefore seems clear that we still have a long way to go.
We agree with the salient points of the proposal that we are considering.
The Commissionâs work programme, presented accurately and with conviction by MrÂ Barroso, is rightly centred on certain key objectives: prosperity, solidarity and security as well as the role of the Union as a global partner.
These are issues that require unremitting commitment, an effective strategy and by extension adequate resources for measures that will have a genuine impact on the European socio-economic situation.
Â Â  Mr President, as my groupâs coordinator in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to welcome the attention given by the Commission to completing the internal market in a number of important areas and to thank the Commissioner and his team for that.
We will follow it up very closely.
Having said that, I am very critical of this document overall.
It is a strange document.
Colleagues were talking about priorities.
I just want to quote from it: âThe top priority today is to restore sustainable dynamic growth and jobs in Europeâ.
That is on pageÂ 27 of the document.
In what sense do we have any priorities when we have a disconnected list of 96Â items assembled together in arbitrary order, not making it clear which is legislative and which is non-legislative?
In any case I say this to you, Mr Barroso, that in any sense of work planning I want to know what is already in progress.
I do not just want to know about 96Â things that you are starting, I want to know how you are getting on with the existing work we have asked you to do and what priorities you are allocating to that.
There is another thing I want to know, because I have no sense of this whatsoever.
It is great to see all the members of your Commission here, but we want to see you working much better together, in more integrated policy-making, in order to tackle that crucial issue that you yourself put at the top of your agenda, which is that of competitiveness, jobs and growth in Europe.
That is not going to be delivered by 96Â separate proposals, but by your Commission working together to tackle that.
Why can we not see that in your programme?
I say that also to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m who is sitting here and who is supposed to be helping us communicate these things â to be helping us.
How can I go to my constituents and businesses in my constituency to say that the Commission is going to work on competitiveness and jobs with this set of 96Â disconnected proposals?
I would say, however, that it is worth looking at what is going on in Commissioner Verheugenâs work on cars in the context of an integrated competitiveness initiative.
I want to commend him for this initiative and for many others.
Let us see more of that type of work and not this shopping list of disconnected proposals.
Â Â  Mr President, various previous speakers have already drawn the comparison with the United States.
I am involved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which also has many transatlantic contacts.
What I have noticed is that there is a kind of reversal in the assessment of developments, particularly on the financial market.
I do not know whether you saw the headline of this morningâs , which once again read that the United States envies us for what this House achieved in the last part-session.
In October, we tackled an 800-page tome of regulations on the banksâ capital requirements, which is placing us well ahead of the United States.
People are not sufficiently aware of this.
I do not know whether you are familiar with the book by Jeremy Rifkin about but that book too indicates that our perception in this respect is sometimes incorrect.
What strikes me is that the Commission lacks the awareness that we could do much more with the Lisbon Strategy and with macro-economic policy.
In Europe, we talk each other into the doldrums when a number of things go wrong, but we forget that they also present us with opportunities.
We could, for example, capitalise on the surrounding the Stability and Growth Pact in order to achieve better macro-economic policy now and we could use our advantage in the area of financial markets regulations to effectively deploy the investments that this could produce and get the Commission to steer this macro-economic policy.
I am afraid that the attitude that the market will manage on its own is also attributable to your liberal view.
I think that the Americans could help you dispel this notion.
The market cannot manage on its own.
We will need to show the way, and in this we expect leadership from the Commission.
Â Â  European integration will not succeed unless it is founded on joint responsibility.
It is not enough merely to establish a single market and single currency, even if they do further integration.
The Commissionâs priorities of prosperity, solidarity and security are important and right.
There are 18.8 million unemployed in Europe âÂ almost 20 million.
What does the EU mean to them and what does it offer?
Not solidarity, prosperity or security at any rate.
Mere words are not enough: we need concrete action.
Mr President, the EU has to focus on the essential.
The Commissionâs decision to do away with unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy and simplify EU law should be supported.
In addition, I hope that the principle of subsidiarity will at last be implemented.
That would also bring our citizens closer to the EU and would provide the EU with a mandate to carry out its work.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commission work programme reflects its honourable efforts to serve, in the best possible way, the imperialist interests of the European Union and the choices of big business.
Despite the objections voiced in the Council, an agreement is being promoted with sweeping changes for the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 at the expense of farmers and workers in general.
The Commission is trying to adjust its legislative programme for 2006 to new circumstances not with changes of political direction, but on the basis of its commitments for its 5-year term of office and the choices of the monopolies.
The main axis of its policy is communications policy.
Corruption, bribery and class cooperation are becoming the means to encage the grass-roots masses and accept the most reactionary, anti-grass roots measures.
More liberalisation of the markets, with electricity and natural gas in their sights.
Integration of the internal market in services, post offices and so forth, privatisation of public utilities, new shipping policy measures and the promotion of new tax measures to the detriment of the workers.
A uniform strategy to promote the anti-grass roots Lisbon objectives on the basis of the national action programmes and the promotion of anti-labour plans for young people women and the workers in general.
This Commission programme is completely opposed to the ambitions and aims of the workers, which is why their struggles over coming months will escalate for the right to work, for a better standard of living, to defend grass-roots freedoms, for peace and for equality.
Â Â  Mr President, even though I am somewhat taken aback by the Commissionâs indulgence in this kind of denial, and the fact that it is â to all intents and purposes â completely ignoring the blatant warning emanating from the French and Dutch ânoâ at the European referendums, 2006 will, above all, be the year of the definitive start of the accession negotiations between the Commission and Turkey, which is further proof not only of the Commissionâs complete insensitivity to the democratic will of the majority of the Europeans, but also of its willingness to disregard own legal rules, the otherwise so sacred .
I am in any event curious to find out what tricks, lies and falsehoods will be peddled by the Commission, despite the prediction by the former Commissioner for Agriculture, Franz Fischler, that Turkey would, ultimately, be capable of being integrated into European agricultural policy after all, and that the costs would not be intolerable.
It will not stop us from reiterating that Turkeyâs accession to the European Union is both untenable and undemocratic.
Â Â  Mr President, one of President Barrosoâs themes this morning was the need for us to inspire the people of Europe, too many of whom have become disillusioned with the whole concept of our European Union.
To do that, we need to give voice to the reasons for Europe in terms of how Europe is relevant to peopleâs lives and their worries, their hopes and their ambitions.
We must help Europe rediscover its drive towards economic growth and competitiveness, ruthlessly cutting out waste and bureaucracy and concentrating on the prerequisites for that agenda.
Those prerequisites are, admittedly, deregulation and lower taxes, but they are also healthier people living in a healthier environment.
Above all, we must afford efforts to sustain those less able to cope with challenges and opportunities of life, those who live with disabilities or life-threatening diseases and poverty.
Therefore, we look to the Commission to step up its responsibilities for health, health promotion, public health, health emergencies, mental health, disability, patient mobility and information for patients.
We also need to press on with our agenda for the environment, with climate change, emissions trading, air quality, waste reduction, reuse and recycling, noise and the urban environment, the protection of wildlife and habitats, and a reduction in animal testing.
What we have to say with regard to Europe is equally relevant to our policies for the developing world, but none of this is possible without adequate monitoring and enforcement or proper budgetary control.
Those aspects so often let down our good intentions in Europe and contribute to the public doubts about Europeâs ability to be good news for them.
Â Â  Mr President, I would ask you to raise the question of the poor attendance today at the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
I think we owe respect to the Commission: all the Commissioners who could be here are here.
The poor attendance in this House is simply unacceptable and shows a lack of respect for the Commission.
I will certainly bring that up in my own group tonight.
MrÂ Barroso, the problem is not what is in your programme.
In the little time available to me, I should like to outline the problem in a number of major points.
In your oral presentation today, you said:
âWe need to link these programmes to our political priorities, to improve the Unionâs economic governance and to strengthen national and European efforts in relation to reform and investmentâ and you continued: âan investment at national level, but also at European level with a view to tomorrowâs economy, to innovation, to knowledge and to new infrastructures.
These two types of investment must go hand in handâ.
Good.
Agreed.
President of the Commission, let us make a deal today in which you tell this Parliament that, in the next weeks and months, you and your Commission will formulate a strategy to ensure that, when we meet at the European Employment Council in spring, we have this message as a common approach from the European Council.
You, together with the Economic Affairs Commissioner and the Commission as a whole, will inspire the governments to make a deal, promising in the next two, three or four years to invest simultaneously and to be coordinated.
I am not taking powers away from you.
I merely want us to coordinate our investments so that we can use our economic interdependence proactively.
In essence, my dream is the same as the Commissionâs: this wonderful Europe could achieve further growth.
Yes, we should reform, but we need more investment, growth and jobs, and that demands coordination, so let us make a strategy together.
I await your response.
Â Â  As you requested, MrÂ Rasmussen, I will pass on your comments on the poor attendance here to the competent bodies of Parliament.
Of course, the session Presidency appreciates the fact that the Commission is here in force for this important debate, even though the Council benches are rather empty.
Â Â  Mr President, a year ago, President Barroso promised us during the Buttiglione case that he would make European fundamental rights a key priority.
That is just as well, for that is also what the public expects.
Unfortunately, there is no trace of this promise in the work programme.
There may be a communication in 2006 about gender equality, which we welcome, but what about the other categories of discrimination?
What has become of horizontal anti-discrimination legislation?
All citizens must be able to have their rights upheld before the court; if not, the EU anti-discrimination policy is not worth the paper it was written on.
Why, in fact, has the promised feasibility study into new Article 13 legislation not been included and what is the latest on the proposals requested by Parliament with regard to the free movement of married same-sex couples?
Will President Barrosoâs Commission really promote fundamental rights?
Will we get a real Union of values or will we not move beyond empty promises?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, I am here representing the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I have to say that, even in terms of our Committeeâs very modest expectations, the Commissionâs legislative and work programme is undemanding and highly disappointing.
In all the areas in which we have made our interest known, and which you, verbally at any rate, have declared to be priorities â among them civil law, copyright, human rights, childrenâs rights, consumersâ rights â none of the proposals are legislative in character.
In some areas on the importance of which we always agree â patent law being one of them â we can see no initiatives that are likely to get Europe any further forward â even though we have always agreed that patent law is crucial to innovation.
Nor can I see any initiative being taken on services of general economic interest.
At the same time, though, we cannot fail to note that you are withdrawing proposals for legislation that matter a great deal to us, although we have to admit that there are problems with them, for example the statute on companies established on a mutual basis, and European law on voluntary associations.
We have, for years now, been endeavouring to endow the commercial sector with European statutes of its own, yet we are evidently denying the cooperative sector, the social economy and civil society the reliefs that European law could provide.
We have ourselves proposed areas in which we can withdraw legislation and in which we do not regard European regulation as necessary, yet the Commission has not responded to our proposals.
One example that springs to my mind is mediation, where we were given a draft directive to examine even though we had said, when the Green Paper came out, that this was an area to which subsidiarity applied and there was no need for legislation on it at European level.
My overall view is that you have listened too little to what this House has been telling you in the preparatory phase.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome many aspects of the Commission programme but I am disappointed that there is not more reference to disabled people or elderly people.
I would have like to have seen a specific disability directive that outlawed discrimination in access to goods and services and similarly one on age.
With regard to health and safety at work, I would also like to see an amendment to the 2000 biological agents directive, to protect health workers from contracting HIV and Hepatitis C from needle-stick injuries.
There are over one million such injuries across the EU every year.
However, I welcome the Commission Presidentâs commitment to cutting down on unnecessary legislation, which of course is a burden on business.
In that spirit, could he look again at the 2004 electromagnetic fields directive and the serious impact it could have on the use of state-of-the-art MRI scanners and see his way to bringing forward an amendment to this directive to make sure that MRI scanners will be protected in the future?
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate MrÂ Barroso on the report he has given us this morning.
However, like many of my colleagues I too ask him to bring together its priorities, so as to define clearly the package of proposals and the objectives that we wish to achieve during the next five years.
We all remember that the previous Commission under MrÂ Prodi managed in the event to achieve only 50% of what was initially envisaged in its programme.
I do not think that initiatives of that type are useful, especially for a Europe that needs to believe in itself.
The first thing that I should like to suggest is that you should collate and prioritise the objectives that we wish to achieve as soon as possible.
Next we must certainly dedicate ourselves to other important issues.
A great many points are addressed in the report that you presented this morning.
Speaking as the internal coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to emphasise one point in particular on which you are no doubt committed to doing something important: namely the creation of a âroad mapâ on gender equality.
As well as this point, I should also like us to consider the theme of work.
As you know, there is a conflict in Europe today between those who have more rights and those who have fewer, those who have jobs and those who do not, those who have access to good schools and teachers and those who have no such access, as is the case in the suburbs of Paris.
This is a problem that affects one country today, but could affect others tomorrow.
In this connection the role of women in the Community and above all the role of women in the workplace is of fundamental importance.
It is therefore necessary, in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, to address the issue of the under-representation of women in the workplace and the fact that they are often forced into badly paid jobs that require no qualifications.
Â Â  Mr President, I also wish to welcome the presence of the whole Commission and deplore the absence of many colleagues, which is in part because we all have TV monitors in our offices and it is so easy to watch the debates whilst working in your office.
However, it would be far better if Members were here.
Nevertheless, what is being said is not being lost, of course: it is being heard outside.
I welcome the reference in the Commissionâs work programme to Plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate.
That is not the focus of our discussion now.
We must remember that this work programme is very important but that it is taking place in a wider context, which is a profound debate about where our European Union is going, what its future is.
We are in a period of reflection â and in a period of reflection about the Constitution â which has begun not on the text but on the context.
This work programme is part of that wider context.
The future of our social economic model with the special summit at Hampton Court is part of that context.
The need to find in December that crucial deal that we were close to in Luxembourg on the medium-term budget is part of that context. If we can get the context right, including the work programme, then we will be able to come back and look at the text of the Constitution in one or two yearsâ time and see how we can best move forward on that.
Let me quickly take up one other point: better regulation.
We are all behind you on that, Mr Barroso.
However, in the context where those anti-Europeans in my country and others portray the European Union as one massive bureaucracy-producing machine spewing out regulations, it is incumbent upon all of us to point out that, when we get it right, European legislation is an exercise in cutting red tape, relieving burdens on business, providing one set of rules for the common market, one patent, one registration for a trademark, one form to fill in, one fee to pay instead of 25.
Good European regulation cuts bureaucracy and red tape.
That point must also be made in this debate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, Commissioners, todayâs debate proves that a real culture of dialogue has been established between the Commission and Parliament.
With regard to the programme, which, far from being a bureaucratic or statistical exercise, is a vital political elementÂ â and I, as the Chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, am delighted by thatÂ â I would like to thank MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m for her many appearances before our Conference, and I also thank the Commissioners who conducted bilateral discussions with the relevant parliamentary committees throughout the procedure.
Of course, some improvements are still needed, including in Parliament, as regards our attendance in this Chamber.
Subject to the analysis of the work programme that the political groups proposed and will conduct, with a view to adopting a proposal for a resolution, during the part-session in December, I think I can say that this programme contains the principal priorities set out by the parliamentary committees in its main chapters, namely priority, solidarity, security and external responsibility.
On the other hand, two points of fundamental disagreement have come to light concerning the area of freedom, security and justice with regard to human rights.
Certain proposals have not been retained by the Commission.
However, the important thing is that Parliament, as co-legislator, must be kept fully informed of the reasons why the Commission, in exercising its right of initiative, has not followed up on Parliamentâs wishes.
I would also like to mention the objective of the Lisbon Agenda: with regard to employment and competition, cohesion and research, we need a budget and a financial perspective.
Finally, the programme represents only one aspect of a broader agenda under the rubric âbetter regulationâ and, in this regard, we attach considerable importance to the transposition and simplification of European legislation.
A decent solution is required in terms of comitology and I would like to stress the need, next year, to include simplification measures and withdrawal proposals in the legislative and work programme, in order to give this exercise greater visibility and transparency.
I am delighted with the commitment that MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m made in this regard during our last meeting on 13Â October and I am convinced that all of the parliamentary committees will be active in ensuring that this programme is implemented.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the Commission programme represents an attempt to assess the situation of Europe and the European Union, and to identify the threats we are facing.
I suggest that we should therefore take a look at what is new and original about the Commissionâs proposals.
They relate to the achievement of prosperity through knowledge, of solidarity through work, and of security through the restriction of civil liberties and law enforcement.
I would ask whether this is an appropriate plan of action for an institution that acts as the guardian of the Treaties, and whether these are in fact your priorities, or rather a series of promises and pipe dreams that you hope will be self-fulfilling.
I should now like to get down to business, and to begin by examining the Commissionâs proposals concerning the Constitutional Treaty.
In the programme description, the Commission regrets that the Constitution will not be ratified in the foreseeable future.
It goes on to say that it intends to play an active part in national debates, and to support these debates.
MrÂ Barroso, this approach leaves much to be desired.
It is not enough to express oneâs regret and to wait for national debates to provide a solution.
The Commission needs to provide an impetus.
The second issue I should like to focus on is better lawmaking.
We all want better legislation that is more effective and also easier for citizens to understand, but I have my doubts as to whether this is in fact what the Commission is likely to achieve.
For example, it is patently obvious that withdrawing 68Â legislative proposals will not make the remaining legislation initiated by the Commission better or more comprehensible.
It will not bring it closer to the citizens either.
This is not what is meant by simpler legislation.
My final point is that in my opinion the Commissionâs stated intention to set up a ânew structureâ responsible for implementing better legislation has an ominous ring to it, since it would mean replacing the current system, where proposals are judged on their content, by a formal procedure.
My impression is that the Commission is acting in accordance with Parkinsonâs Law, and following the principle whereby a new institution is set up every time the course of action becomes unclear.
MrÂ Barroso, we expect fewer lofty words, fewer promises, and a greater number of courageous and effective actions.
It is not just the Members of this House who expect such things, but also the citizens of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Commissionâs work programme for 2006 is going in the right direction as regards social responsibilities, labour law and jobs.
This can certainly be said of the initiatives relating to working hours, delocalisation and people who are disadvantaged for a variety of reasons, and the initiatives in the area of health and safety at work.
At the same time, however, we must see that citizens, the players in economic life, object to the excessively bureaucratic procedures.
We must therefore make sure that we give small and medium-sized enterprises the most effective help possible, namely by simplifying the legislative environment for SMEs in the European Union and making it more transparent.
I was very pleased to hear Commission President Barrosoâs clear commitment to creating a unified market for services.
I believe this is necessary in equal measure for competitiveness and success, and for creating new jobs.
At the same time, I would also like to add that the Commission will have a special role to play when, in the course of the year, it assesses experiences relating to the free movement of labour.
We are confident that it will not simply produce an objective analysis, but it will act as a genuine engine and catalyst in ensuring that transitional restrictions are lifted as soon as possible.
This step is an important one in terms of completing the single market and will lead to the creation of many new jobs.
We are therefore confident that the Commission will make progress simultaneously in the areas of competitiveness and of creating an internal market that will guarantee growth, and also in terms of developing a legislative environment in the social sphere based on European values.
These are the most important challenges.
We need balanced policy in these areas to ensure that we do not miss the 2012 express connecting service for Lisbon.
Â Â  Mr President, the work programme for 2006 gives the European institutions a great opportunity.
It gives us the chance to show the people that we have understood them; that we have understood that the negative outcomes to the referendums in France and the Netherlands had something to do with Europeâs habit of over-regulating and denying people their right to take decisions as adults; that we have understood that all that Europe is meant to do is to set the framework conditions and that it must not get obsessed with detail and interfere in the nation statesâ powers and responsibilities.
I welcome the Commissionâs promise of better regulation in 2006.
I welcome the references in the introduction to the work programme to better regulation, subsidiarity, cost-efficiency and impact assessments.
I do see the beginnings of good things in the work programme, notably in the fields of growth and security policy, but the overall impression that I get from it is, unfortunately, more of âbusiness as usualâ than of âbetter regulationâ.
There are three things I would like to mention.
The first is the Financial Perspective.
I find it regrettable that the Commission is taking no active part in resolving this conflict.
I regret the absence of proposals as to how we might, even with less money, pursue an effective structural policy, perhaps with joint funding by the private sector or by means of interest rate subsidies.
Secondly, there are the new directives on the protection of the environment and on the saving of energy.
There are over a dozen items of European legislation on energy efficiency alone.
We ought really to delete three old directives for every new one planned, but nothing is being done along these lines.
Why, thirdly, is Europe laying claim to more and more powers in social matters?
Do we really need a European Green Paper on the rights of married and unmarried couples, such as the one that is planned?
That will make us look ridiculous in the eyes of everyone from Lithuania to Greece.
Despite the many positive approaches that it contains, I have to say, with regret, that work programme does not give the overall impression that we have understood the signals that the people of Europe have been sending.
I call for a more in-depth debate on the legitimacy of European legislation, and for a real start to be made on making over-regulation a thing of the past.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we are here to discuss the work programme on which we want to embark in 2006.
The first thing I want to say â and I say it not only to the Commission, but also to my fellow-Members of the European Parliament, is that less and better regulation, which we put on our own agenda and demand of ourselves, is also something that we should take seriously in our demands on the Commission as regards what it is due to present on the subject of the internal market and efficiency.
We must not regularly frustrate our own demands by calling for the European legislator as soon as we decide something is needed, so a bit more self-discipline is called for.
As far as better regulation is concerned, although the Commissionâs first actions are very positive and constitute a first step in the right direction, we would ask it to be more consistent in its future actions and to set a benchmark for comparison of transposition in the countries that are notorious for âgold platingâ, so that it may be made perfectly clear which are transposing European legislation effectively and well and which are imposing additional burdens.
I have another request to make of the Commission: our response to the Basel II report was to set up the âFriends of the Presidencyâ to work on comitology and bring about agreements on Parliamentâs rights between the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself.
This work is now beginning.
The forthcoming legislation will, as regards the comitology especially of financial services have essential clauses permitting it to lapse.
It is at this point that I will ask the Commission â for Commissioner McCreevy has done some preparatory work on this â to help us reach an agreement to make the comitology between Parliament and the Council more manageable.
The Council is in the sort of position in which it does not always show itself to be particularly cooperative.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I will start by making a few general comments, and I will then try to answer the specific questions that I have been asked.
First of all, I am delighted, as MrÂ Daul said in his capacity as Chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairman, at the cooperation that has been established between the Commission, on the one hand, and Parliament and its various committees, on the other, during the preparation of this work programme.
This is important, because we have endeavoured to respond to many of your expectations.
We must recognise, as one Member of this Parliament said, that this has resulted in 96 specific measures.
You thought that this was too many, but, listening to you all this morning, it seems that some of you would have liked even more.
On this subject, we must be honest.
We must reach a balance, and this balance means that, whilst setting ourselves clear prioritiesÂ âÂ and we have clear priorities for the renewed Lisbon StrategyÂ âÂ we must respond to the very varied nature of the expectations expressed here in our discussions with you.
I have called on the Commission as a whole and all of the commissioners to be serious, realistic and objective in preparing this programme.
I want a much higher implementation rate than in the past, and I am proud to be able to tell you that, this year, we are already going to achieve a much higher implementation rate than in the past with regard to the Commissionâs work.
We have concentrated on certain objectives that we really want to achieve.
Of course, our general programme extends over five years.
We are now going to present the programme for 2006.
Not everything will be achieved in 2006, but what I would ask is that you analyse our work in terms of realistic, concrete objectives.
I would also like to thank you for the generally favourable reception that our initiative on âbetter regulationâ has received.
This is a concern, as has just been said, that is not restricted to the Commission, but must be shared by all the institutions, including Parliament.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I will turn to your specific questions.
With regard to the sustainable development strategy, MrÂ Jonckheer, I must tell you that it is not my poor child, quite the opposite.
When, at Gleneagles, I, on behalf of the European Commission, submitted to our US partners and to others the importance of climate change as a major priority, it was certainly not a poor child to which I was referring.
When we announce a new strategy for sustainable development, which we are going to present in December, that also shows our commitment to this problem.
When we adopt, as we have just done, a set of thematic strategies for the environment, that once again shows our commitment to environmental protection.
That, therefore, is what we are going to do.
We will do so whilst of course attempting, as I have already said, to make our various objectives compatible with each other and to ensure that they reinforce each other.
MrÂ Swoboda, you raised, amongst other things, two questions: one on tax harmonisation and one on the European Institute of Technology.
On tax harmonisation, we must of course respect the consensus reached between our Member States: namely that we must work to draw up a common tax base.
That is why we are endeavouring to reach an agreement on a common base for taxation in Europe.
We are convinced that this will enable us to make significant reductions in the costs of business and investment in our countries, whilst still giving each Member State the freedom to set levels of company taxation.
That is the European Commissionâs position.
With regard to research, we believe that centres of excellence in research must be strengthened throughout the EU.
We believe that European universities should be at the top of the global rankings in terms of research, education and innovation.
We must work to make our universities more attractive so that the best minds in the world turn to Europe, instead of going to the United States, as is the case today.
We can have centres of academic excellence in Europe.
That is why we must establish a stronger mechanism for cooperation between European universities, so that we can make the most of the potential of knowledge in Europe.
That is why the efforts invested in creating a European Institute of Technology constitute an important aspect of our strategy for growth and jobs.
With regard to the questions you raised on enlargement, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, we respect the commitments made unanimously by the Member States, by the European Council.
That said, I want Parliament to know that the Commission will be rigorous and systematic in its evaluation of the progress made by all the candidate countries.
With regard to the policy on demographics and the family, we are the ones who put this subject on the agenda of the HamptonÂ Court summit and we now have a clear mandate from the European Council to contribute to these considerations, or, even better, to the specific measures that we are planning to announce.
Thus, we will be taking action in this field, too.
Coming to the concerns expressed by many of you, especially MrÂ Crowley, regarding agriculture and the multilateral negotiations, I can assure you that Europe will not allow itself to be forced into a defensive position in this context.
We do not think that we need to take any more lessons on the opening up of markets from those whose markets are much more closed than ours, which is one of the most open markets in the world, if not the most open.
We will be there to defend the interests of Europe.
Childrenâs rights were also a problematic matter brought to our attention by MrÂ Crowley.
We are fully committed to this agenda.
Vice-PresidentÂ Frattini is now preparing proposals â to be discussed in the Commission very soon â for a communication that we hope to present in March 2006.
Admittedly, the legal basis for legislation in this matter is not very clear, but we believe that we should not refrain from looking forward to better coordination between the European Union and Member States on childrenâs rights.
You can count on our commitment to childrenâs rights and on all issues relating to civic rights, including the non-discrimination concerns that you have expressed.
I should like to comment on MrÂ Rasmussenâs remarks.
We agree that we need both elements: economic reform and investment.
Indeed, we are starting to do that, and HamptonÂ Court was a first important step in that direction.
Member States, at the highest level, agreed there that we should now choose some specific areas for investment and a coordinated approach at European Union level, trying to combine the European Union level with the Member State level, for instance on energy and research.
We now have some areas in which we can give a strong signal of commitment and a coordinated approach towards economic governance in Europe.
We agree on that.
The difficulty, Mr Rasmussen and colleagues, is largely that we are now working in the last year of the financial perspectives for this period.
Now it is impossible to rearrange all the priorities for this year.
As regards our analysis of the national reform programmes of the Member States, what we are doing now and â I promise this to you â what we will be doing is within the framework of the new Lisbon Strategy; we are trying to forge ahead not only based on an approach that reinforces our efforts in terms of economic and structural reform, but also based on a more common and integrated approach for investment so that we can boost growth and employment in Europe.
I want to underline it because it is a good example of an approach at European Union level bringing added value to the efforts of the Member States.
This idea of partnership between the Member States, the Commission and Parliament is the very basis on which we want to continue working with you for a renewed, stronger, more committed European Union project.
Â Â  Parliament would like to thank the President of the Commission and all of the Commissioners, who, as I said, are here in force.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 14Â DecemberÂ 2005.
Â Â  Mr President, having just come through, I find myself momentarily rather beside myself because there is, in the passageway from the Winston Churchill building â through which I have just come â an exhibition that lumps together the termination of pregnancy and concentration camps.
I am outraged that such a thing is again being allowed in the European Parliament.
Even if this exhibition has been authorised, I ask that a stop be put to it at once.
There are pictures there that dishonour all women, and I ask that they be removed right now.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner.
I promise that, to the extent that it lies within the competence of the Bureau, we shall pass on this request immediately to the office of the Quaestors, in order to establish first of all whether this exhibition was officially authorised and to ascertain whether, given its contents, there are grounds for requesting its immediate removal.
Â Â  Mr President, I beg the indulgence of the House in bringing to its attention the latest appalling developments in the case of the Bulgarian nurses imprisoned in Libya.
This morning, the Libyan Supreme Court delayed a decision on their case until January 2006.
Colleagues will know that this is a most appalling case.
The nurses have been in custody for more than six years now, and have been under sentence of death for over a year.
It is disgraceful that this case is dragging on in the way that it is.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to do everything within their powers to exert pressure and influence on the Libyan authorities in order to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion and secure the release of the Bulgarian nurses, and indeed of the Palestinian doctor.
Â Â  We accept the motion pursuant to the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall keep this very brief.
As what Mr Van Orden has described to the House is something that affects all the groups equally, I would like to give him my wholehearted backing and ask not only the Commission, but also the President of this House, to act at once to help secure these nurses and the Palestinian doctor their freedom at long last.
Â Â  Mr President, further to what Mrs GrÃ¶ner has said, I would like to ask the Bureau not to exercise any kind of censorship, but rather to give us the opportunity to have a look at this exhibition â with which I am not familiar â and then take a majority decision tomorrow, as is customary in a democracy.
Â Â  As far as the last speech is concerned, I assure MrÂ Posselt that the Bureau has no intention whatever of exercising any form of censorship.
We merely have the duty of verifying, through the Quaestors, whether the practices and procedure for authorisations have been effectively complied with and if so, whether the initiative and the exhibition conform, in content, form and pictures, with the rules of Parliament and with the practices that we follow on every such occasion.
I imagine that the Quaestors will carry out this verification meticulously without transforming themselves into censors.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my duty to inform the House that agreement on this text has been reached with the Council, if it is to be adopted in its present version.
It could therefore be adopted at first reading.
I nevertheless call upon the Commission to take account, in its work on other regulations, of some amendments tabled by members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats which, for legal reasons, we have not been able to include in this phase. They are amendments that relate to birth and adoption allowances and thus to the possibility of introducing these forms of social support within the Union and promoting mobility of labour.
I therefore request that these topics, on which a common position has already been reached, should be included in the next regulations.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a special honour to present this report to you.
It is an own-initiative report, and, moreover, a very justified one in view of the fact that eel stocks in Europe have dwindled by 95%.
Even without a European constitution, we in the Committee on Fisheries can ensure that an own-initiative proposal such as the one before us now is translated into a directive.
I thank the Commission for having given this its prompt attention.
At the moment, a new directive has been tabled on the basis of this report and it shows that we in the Committee on Fisheries are given the opportunity to achieve decisive policy for European fisheries and to ensure that eel stocks remain steady, that the exports of glass eel to Central Asia are restricted and that control measures are put in place so that Member States can finally address this problem.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a one-word oral amendment, which has the support of the rapporteur and hopefully other parties and which I hope is not controversial.
It concerns corporate social responsibility.
The current amendment reads: âSupports the Commissionâs efforts to raise awareness among multinational companies of their social responsibilities, which have as yet had little effectâ.
The oral amendment is to change the word âlittleâ to âlimitedâ, so it would read: â... which have as yet had limited effectâ.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . Given the enormous importance of the wine market to Portugal, both politicians and those more directly involved should give this issue the prominence that it deserves.
I voted in favour of this proposal, as Portuguese farmers have not raised any underlying objections to it and there is broad support for it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the technical amendments that the Daul report proposes to introduce in the regulation concerning the common organisation of the market in wine is to develop further the practices relating to the treatment of wine.
In my opinion, therefore, the amendments seem to lead, as I would wish, to a major increase in the European supply of products in this sector.
We have furthermore a mandatory obligation to protect the consumer, now that fraud and imitations of foodstuffs are on the increase despite the efforts of the institutions and relevant control bodies.
We must also safeguard the competitiveness of European products, which can hold their own in the international market only by rising to the challenge of quality.
That being so, it is vital to guarantee better control of the production process and the subsequent stages of product storage.
I also approve of the proposed derogations concerning sparkling wine production since they favour not only the Italian wine market but also culture and rural tradition, both of which I shall continue to defend vigorously.
Finally, I consider that the proposal to add to the information on product labelling is very useful.
I have therefore supported it and have also requested the Non-attached Group to support MrÂ Daulâs excellent report.
Â Â  We have voted against the three Daul reports.
True, they involve fewer alterations to existing regulations. We wish, however, to emphasise our opposition on principle to common organisations of the markets in seeds, hops and wine.
The whole of the common agricultural policy is an absurd creation and must be abolished.
Â Â  . I support my colleague Mrs BerÃšs' report amending the Agreement establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) enabling the bank to finance operations in Mongolia.
I had the opportunity in May this year to visit Mongolia for the first time as a participant in the Socialist International's Asia-Pacific Committee in Ulan Bator.
In Mongolia since the fall of Communism, unlike in many of the other countries of Central Asia, we have seen the establishment of a vigorous democracy where political power was transferred from one party to another on several occasions in a peaceful manner.
It is a poor country where recent droughts have posed enormous problems.
It urgently needs help with the current government's ambitious development programme.
Today's vote will help this process and I strongly support it and hope it will mean funds will flow.
Â Â  . The Athens Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2004 were the first to take place in an EU Member State, part of the Schengen area, without internal border controls.
Regulation 1295/2003 was therefore adopted aimed at simplifying both the procedures for applying for and issuing Schengen visas for members of the Olympic family participating in the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens.
In practical terms, it was designed to enable them to enter the territory of the State where the Games were held without being subject to other procedures or formalities, and to hold an Identity and Accreditation Card, alongside passports or other official travel documents.
The report on its implementation in Greece concluded that the derogation system was successful and constituted a flexible and efficient process, which would not compromise the level of security required in the Schengen area.
I therefore lend my backing to this proposal, which adopts an almost identical system, albeit this time by the codecision procedure, with some changes designed to adapt it to the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Turin.
Â Â  . The adjustment of visa requirements for athletes taking part in the 2004 Athens Olympics to allow Greece to meet both its Schengen requirements and its obligations to respect the Olympic Charter proved a great success.
I am delighted to see this proposal to grant the same conditions to the athletes taking part in the 2006 winter olympics and the paralympics.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this report, which improves upon the Commissionâs proposal to update Regulations Nos 1408/71 and 574/72 to take account of changes made in national social security legislation, particularly those introduced in the new Member States after the accession negotiations had been concluded.
It also seeks to update the list of provisions of social security agreements which continue to apply and have not been replaced by Regulation 1408/71, and proposes technical modifications.
Broadly speaking, the proposals that have just been adopted improve upon the existing legislation, guarantee legal certainty until the new regulation enters into force, and help to enhance the protection extended to workers who opt for mobility within the EU.
Â Â  . I supported this report which, although of a technical nature, draws attention to circumstances which can inhibit the fundamental right of free movement which EU citizens supposedly enjoy.
While I am not in favour of the EU having competence over Social Security provisions, I do believe that more could be done to facilitate the portability of certain entitlements.
For example, disabled people are effectively denied their right to free movement - to seek employment for example - because the level of support currently provided may not be available in a new location.
This is one of many issues which require to be addressed.
Â Â  . The object of the amendment of Regulation 1408/71/EEC is to carry out an annual update in order to improve EU citizensâ standard of living and the conditions under which they work.
I voted in favour of it.
We must not, however, forget to consider the substantive amendments that are so urgently needed.
It is, then, to give one example, contrary to the spirit of the Regulation for German employers to be required to grapple with an intolerable amount of red tape in order to remit to Poland social security contributions totalling 47.85% (20.64% from the employer, 27.27% from the employee) of the earnings of Polish seasonal workers, particularly when, under German law, no such contributions were payable in respect of their work prior to the accession of Poland to the EU.
For the businesses that employed them, the outcome has been dramatic increases in costs, liable to put the businessesâ continued existence at risk, and which they cannot offset by increasing prices.
For their part, the seasonal workers will be unwilling to work for net wages reduced by 27%.
The consequence is that few of them are recruited, and that has a negative financial impact on the development of the new Member States.
Experience has shown that the demand for seasonal labour cannot be met on the German labour market, and so people are losing out on every side.
The simplification that is so urgently needed could, with the Commissionâs help, be accomplished either directly, by means of bilateral agreements, or by a derogation completely removing such traditional seasonal work as helping with the harvest from the scope of Regulation 1408/71 or its successor, Regulation 883/2004/EC, and that of the implementing regulation that is yet to be adopted.
Â Â  . While this report is largely a technical adjustment it should not be underestimated in terms of its importance to obtaining genuine free movement of individuals in the internal market.
The report will assist with the simplification of regulations concerning social security schemes across the EU.
Its purpose is also to complete the simplification of procedures on receiving medical care abroad by extending some of those modifications to the identical procedures regarding benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases.
Â Â  . As the explanatory statement to this report rightly points out, âthe regulation plays the important role of establishing one of the four fundamental freedoms of the EU, namely the free movement of European citizens.
The possibility of living, working and moving freely within the EU, and the removal of as many financial and administrative obstacles to doing so as possible, is indeed a tangible benefit conferred on the citizens of Europe by EU membershipâ.
This is indeed the case.
The inherent possibilities in the social protection afforded to citizens of EU Member States has been a key factor in the promotion of genuine freedom of movement.
The issue here is not one of social security models or the rules governing different systems, but is, rather, one of adapting and updating what needs to be adapted and updated in the current regulation.
I voted in favour, given that this adaptation is consistent with the objectives and principles of the regulation in question.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Maat report with a degree of disappointment as it really fails to go far enough.
In the Forest of Dean, which I represent, 40 years ago elvers (glass eels) were fished in abundance by the local population and sold on the streets for consumption as part of a traditional breakfast with bacon and eggs.
More recently, while stocks have declined, demand from primarily the Far East, the Baltic states and the rest of Europe have removed elvers from the local menu as they have been exported to eel farms.
This is unlikely to change, but a small but important industry can be helped and aided.
The major problems seem to be: first, a lack of scientific information on the life cycle of elvers - we are not even sure where their breeding grounds are, although the Sargasso Sea is the prime suspect; second, increased levels of pollution and barriers to the eels accessing the streams, rivers and ditches where they flourish and grow.
Stocks of elvers wax and wane even if there is a downward overall decline.
What works best is not clear.
What is wanted is more research.
I hope this report will ensure that the European Commission finally starts to do what it can to help.
Â Â  . In recent years, eel stocks in Europe have declined dramatically.
Given the European eelâs complex reproduction process, it is crucial that steps be taken to reverse the increasingly apparent trend towards the extinction of this species.
Alongside a number of emergency measures that need to be taken immediately, there is also a range of medium- to long-term measures that should also be adopted, in order to ensure that eel stocks are first recovered and then properly managed.
To this end, this report puts forward a range of proposals, which have my wholehearted support.
Â Â  . We welcome the Community action plan to support the recovery of eel in the form in which it is proposed.
The plan takes account of the need for socio-economic measures to help fishermen, the Community financing of measures â note, with their own budgetary heading â reliable data on the state of fish stocks, and research into other reasons behind the decline in stocks, such as pollution.
These are measures which, as we have been proposing, should be transposed to form part of the wider body of recovery programmes, a move that was incomprehensibly rejected by the majority in Parliament.
With regard to the national plans in individual Member States, however, we should like to emphasise three aspects:
- the precautionary nature of the plans, given the lack of scientific knowledge regarding eel stock numbers and the spatial distribution of successive generations of eel;
- the need to integrate practical measures to combat the development of physical obstacles that may hinder or limit the migration of eel in waterways;
- the need for increased scientific research and gathering of data on fish, aquaculture and exports.
Â Â  . This report outlines the dramatic decline in European eel stocks.
This does not appear to be the result of over fishing but linked to environmental factors.
It is clearly important to know the precise cause be it pcbs, global warming or fish diseases.
We need this information not just so that action can be taken to protect eel stocks but because of the wider environmental concerns and problems this might highlight.
Â Â  . Under the pretext of protecting European eels and legitimately ensuring that they can migrate to the sea, following a reduction in stocks, the European Commission presented, on 1Â OctoberÂ 2003, a management plan for yellow eels and silver eels.
In France, for example, 399 tonnes of eels were caught, compared with 2Â 064 tonnes in Egypt.
On top of that, though, came eel farming in the Netherlands, with production of 3Â 800 tonnes.
It is quite understandable for MrÂ Maat, as a Dutchman, to take an interest in this and to produce a report.
However, given that Dutch eel farms live off alevins and glass eels caught in the coastal lakes of the Mediterranean, we have cause for concern.
The fishermen of Languedoc-Roussillon, for example in Palavas or PÃ©rols, are worried that they will see their traditional practices, which conserve future stocks, brought into question.
They want to fish for adult eels, not glass eels, the ban on the fishing of which 10 years ago enabled stocks to recover.
The bureaucratic proposals on controls, restrictions, supervision, declarations and fishing bans are threatening the survival of traditional fishermen.
I therefore oppose this report to save this free menâs trade.
Â Â  . The issue before us is of major importance to Portugal and to Portuguese fishing communities, and I share the concerns voiced by the rapporteur.
Among other equally important points, I feel that there are valid reasons to support the presentation of proposals on forms of socio-economic compensation for those affected by fishing restrictions and limits on exports of European eel.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have a request to give an oral explanation of vote on the Gargani report.
The criminal division of the French Court of Cassation, which more than ever is living up to its name, has committed what can only be described as an absolute abuse of authority.
The judgment delivered by the president, MrÂ Cotte, by the court reporter MrsÂ Caron, and by council members MrÂ LeÂ Gall, MrÂ Pelletier, MrÂ Corneloup, MrsÂ Ponroy and MrsÂ Koering-Joulin, seriously and deliberately ignores ArticleÂ 26 of the French constitution on parliamentary immunity by refusing to grant this immunity with regard to the illegal phone tapping committed against our former fellow Member MrÂ Marchiani.
It goes without saying that I make no comment on the background to the case.
By acting in this way, these judges have seriously and deliberately violated the Protocol of 8Â AprilÂ 1965 and the Act of 20Â SeptemberÂ 1976, both of which are international treaties that, in accordance with ArticleÂ 55 of the French constitution, take precedence over Acts, even internal ones.
The judgeâs shameless disregard for the law must be condemned as such and we hope that the unanimous resolution by MrÂ Gargani and the Committee on Legal Affairs will play a part in this.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like â if at all possible â to make an oral statement on the way I voted on the Brejc report.
It was we who created the political conditions that made globalisation possible in the first place; we did so by our constant dismantling of trade barriers, combined with the advance of communications technology and reduced transport costs.
Of all the goods transported around the world, one-third is accounted for by traffic between different workshops belonging to the same companies.
We have been zealous in using EU funds to support their transportation across Europe, which has had such adverse effects as damage to the environment and danger to people along the transit routes, and, while so doing, have culpably neglected small and medium-sized businesses, which are Europeâs real providers of work.
What I also regard as objectionable is that the Commission should set up a globalisation fund while seeking to curtail support for farmers, who are also affected by globalisationâs negative impact.
Globalisation will continue to have us by the throat for as long as we, by means of our support programmes, send far too much money up in smoke, make it inevitable that jobs will go elsewhere, fail to apply proper sanctions to those who refuse to play by the rules and turn a blind eye to its real causes.
It is for that reason that I voted against the Brejc report.
Â Â  Mr President, the Brejc report is yet another somewhat Utopian document and yet another typical example of the documents emerging from this institution and seeking all the answers in new international standards within new international institutions.
In this respect, we cannot help but wonder if we have not got enough of these as it is and who will continue to pay for them all.
Moreover, on a practical note, I note that this year, we will be conducting accession negotiations with an Islamic country where child labour and discrimination against women is the norm.
I think it would be better if we were to continue to focus on this instead of expressing noncommittal views about the social dimension of globalisation.
If we have to talk about this, we should actually mention China, that country we are so chummy with, that country from which parliamentary institutions of all European countries merrily travel back and forth.
Well, that country belongs to the World Trade Organisation but rides roughshod over all fundamental social standards and rules whilst not being hindered in this in any way.
It is a falsehood that we would be able to transform the social dimension of globalisation while we choose to do nothing about China.
That will be the day.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be brief.
I voted against the Brejc report for the very reasons that some of my colleagues have outlined.
This House does not appear to read its own documents.
The common agricultural policy has been radically reformed, and this morningâs vote basically gives truth to the lie that if we reduced all EU agriculture subsidies the poor in Africa would be better off.
Nothing could be further from the truth, and I have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  The Swedish Conservatives have today voted against the report on the social dimension of globalisation because its basic approach to globalisation is wrong.
Globalisation is an ongoing process of change that helps bring about freedom and prosperity for ever more people.
Globalisation provides better preconditions for economic growth through free trade, increased international investment and the transfer of knowledge.
Together with democratic development, opportunities are created for the developing countries to emerge from poverty.
The EU is a positive example of globalisation, involving the free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
Dictatorships perceive the transformative power of globalisation as a threat to their own closed societies.
We Conservatives welcome globalisation and its role as a catalyst for democracy.
Â Â  . Unfortunately, the majority in Parliament rejected our most important proposals, which would have improved upon a report that was riddled with inconsistencies and deeply unsatisfactory, on an issue as important as the social dimension of globalisation.
Our proposals aimed at changing the current neoliberal economic and monetary policies in the field of international trade, and the proposal to combat financial speculation in the worldâs capital markets, whilst promoting investment and wealth creation in the real economy were thus rejected.
Our proposal to condemn the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact, which have been instruments within the EU to foster liberalisation and privatisation of public utility services, to make labour markets more flexible and more adaptable, wage moderation and to open up most areas of social security, such as pensions and health, to private firms, was also rejected.
Nevertheless, the proposal emphasising the need for a social policy agenda geared towards development of cities focused on inclusion and cohesion, implying measures to foster sustainable development and respect for workers rights was adopted in part.
Hence our abstention from the final vote.
Â Â  The resolution on âthe social dimension of globalisationâ contains proposals that, in most cases, would lead to the EU being given more power.
We object to this routine EU centralisation, carried out without proper analysis or justification.
A common EU policy on âthe social dimension of globalisationâ cannot be drawn up because the EU Member States are so different from one another.
This is true where, for example, tax levels and social protection are concerned.
Instead of being forced to carry out a policy imposed from above, the EU countries should instead learn from each other through institutional competition.
We believe that reforms need to have grass-roots support in each country.
We also believe that the less developed countries can be given the right to regulate their imports of agricultural products for the time being.
In view of the above, we choose to vote against the resolution in the final vote.
However, we support the amendments to the effect that the common agricultural policy must be radically reformed and that export subsidies must be abolished.
We also support the proposal that the EU must open up its market to goods from less developed countries.
Â Â  . I voted for the position of the Employment [amp] Social Affairs Committee, which had been improved by amendments at Committee stage.
Today I also supported amendments which sought to make social and environmental reporting obligatory and supported the kind of reform of the CAP which would "make poverty history".
Â Â  . The Peopleâs Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) delegation felt that it had to vote against the amended Brejc report concerning the social dimension of globalisation.
One amendment adopted, tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left, urges the Commission and the Council to promote a social policy agenda at European level.
The VVD takes the view that social policy is something that falls within the remit of Member States.
The Dutch referendum on the Constitutional Treaty was further proof that interference from Brussels is not wanted.
Furthermore, an amendment by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been adopted in which a case is made in favour of the EU promoting socially responsible entrepreneurship.
The VVD is convinced that this can be done far more effectively through the market, and EU action in this respect is totally unnecessary and, indeed, unwanted.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mr Brejc on his timely report on the Commission communication entitled âThe Social Dimension of Globalisation â the EUâs policy contribution on extending benefits to allâ.
In the report, he advocates the idea that the EU model has always emphasised the strong social dimension in economic integration, as reflected in the Lisbon Agenda, and that, accordingly, certain aspects of good practice within the European social model should be transposed to other parts of the world.
It agrees that the EU can make a valid contribution, through both its external and internal policies, by shaping the process of globalisation and making it fairer for all.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the social dimension of globalisation which is Parliament's initial response to the report by the World Commission on the social dimension of globalisation.
It is important that those who are disadvantaged by globalisation are assisted to adapt to new circumstances.
This applies to citizens of the EU as well as countries and citizens throughout the world.
It is therefore pleasing to see this report recommend a number of internal and external policy actions.
Â Â  . There are two possible approaches to the issue of globalisation.
One is that it is an avoidable (and unwanted) reality, that if the workers of the 19th century had been more successful in their protests there would not have been industrialisation (which would have been a good thing), and that technological innovation is inherently a bad thing.
The other, more realistic, approach is based on knowledge of history and an awareness of the responsibilities of each generation, and consists of making the most of the opportunities that globalisation brings.
Globalisation is neither a good nor a bad thing in itself; it is a reality that can be used to positive or detrimental effect.
In free and democratic societies such as ours, in which economic freedom prevails, the conditions are in place for globalisation to become an opportunity for worldwide growth and development; and not just an opportunity but a duty.
This is the spirit in which globalisation should be approached.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this report is yet further crazy proof of this Parliamentâs conceited, damaging and vacuous claim to be unaware of and far removed from the feelings of the ordinary people of Europe whom they claim to represent.
Instead of âsocial dimension of globalisationâ it should read âdefence of the criminal dimension of globalisationâ.
Rather than voting âNoâ, I should perhaps have simply left the room.
Â Â  . I support the principle that the Common Agricultural Policy must be reformed, and that in line with the aims of the Make Poverty History campaign, which I strongly support, we must not export our own poor policies into the wider world.
Of course, we must also safeguard the welfare of European farmers and the security of Europe's food supply, though this is compatible with a more sensible Common Agricultural Policy, the status quo is untenable.
Â Â  . I fully support this report.
The impact of globalisation has positive and negative consequences.
We cannot forget the 20Â million people unemployed in the EU at the moment, nor the fact that one in five children in the EU lives on the brink of poverty.
We have a responsibility in this House to deal with these issues.
Â Â  I believe that Mr Wojciechowski wishes to speak in response to personal comments.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I am absolutely outraged at an incident that occurred in connection with the exhibition.
I am deeply offended by the comments of both Members, and in particular by those of MrsÂ Gomes, who called myself and MrÂ Chruszcz âNazisâ and âfascistsâ.
Such a thing should not be tolerated or permitted in this House.
My family was murdered by the Nazis in my home country, and I object to such comments being made in my direction.
I understand MrsÂ Gomesâ point of view, but I must insist that comments of this kind should not be made in Parliament, whether they are directed at myself or at any other Member.
This holds particularly true in situations like the exhibition.
There really should be no question of such a thing happening.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Wojciechowski, you have spoken in accordance with Rule 122 and your comments will be recorded in the Minutes.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the report by Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) No .../... [on Persistent Organic Pollutants] (COM(2003)0644 C5-0530/2003 2003/0256(COD)) (A6-0315/2005), and
- the report by Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 67/548/EEC in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) No .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (COM(2003)0644 C5-0531/2003 2003/0257(COD)) (A 6-0285/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, let me begin this debate by congratulating all those committees, and their many individual members, who have participated in the discussions on REACH, which is one of the most far-reaching proposals that the Commission has ever adopted.
The committees and their members have had an enormous amount of work to do in analysing its details and in drafting amendments to improve it.
I am particularly obliged to Mr Sacconi, who, as rapporteur for the lead committee and as a stalwart defender of improvements to the protection of health and the environment, was open to the possibility of compromise.
I also wish to thank Mr Nassauer, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and an advocate of competitiveness and innovation as goals for policy, who was equally open to reasonable compromise, and Mrs Ek, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and was equally active in putting forward the objections of industry, albeit without losing sight of the vital importance of protecting health and the environment.
Not least in your House, this legislative project has made enormous demands in terms of organisation, and the Commission itself found it difficult to respond to over 1Â 000 amendments and come to an agreement.
We will be able to explain in detail our position on the compromise package put forward by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer, and also to respond in detail to the amendments that were handed well in advance of the deadline, but I do ask you to understand that the Commission will not be able to consider in full the amendments tabled immediately prior to the deadline for submission, and that, for this reason, I cannot yet give you the Commissionâs position on them.
We will, however, delay as little as possible in stating our position on those amendments that gain a majority at the vote.
I will now turn to the fundamental questions to which the amendments refer.
The Commission supports Mr Sacconiâs and Mr Nassauerâs proposed compromises on registration and on the exchange of information.
We take the view that they strike a very good balance between the demands of our industryâs competitiveness on the one hand and advances in the protection of health and the environment on the other.
On the subject of the exchange of information, I would like to stress that any such system must offer the maximum possible incentives, although there will be situations in which â for reasons, among others, of cost â it will not be in businessesâ interests to cooperate and in which the exchange of information could be detrimental to their essential interests.
It is for that reason that I am grateful that a system has been devised for the conditions applicable to data exchange to minimise inconvenience for businesses and the Agency.
There is, I would say, a threefold motivation behind the amendments relating to the regulationâs scope.
One has to do with substantive clarification of it.
A second has to do with creating a derogation from it for a number of other substances that are not regarded as presenting any risk, and a third has to do with the avoidance of duplication of rules.
The Commission accepts the clarifications relating to derogations from the scope of the regulation, notably for waste, food, biocides and pesticides.
We also accept the clarification to the effect that REACH cannot alter or circumvent the rules in the cosmetics directive for the avoidance of animal experiments.
We accept the need for the requirements relating to specific substances â that is, minerals, ores, ore concentrates and chemicals occurring in nature â to be expressed with greater clarity.
Turning to the requirements to be imposed on what are termed downstream users, the Commission is in favour of introducing a threshold of one tonne per annum where such users are required to submit a chemical safety report on their own account.
This is necessary if they are not to be put at a disadvantage over against their own suppliers and also in order for the system to be made more compatible with their needs.
It is evident that various committees are making strenuous efforts to enhance the Agencyâs role in assessing risk.
The Commission accepts that such an approach has its merits in terms of more even and more consistent application of the Regulationâs rules, although we must be very cautious as regards the tangible form that this will take.
The fact of the matter is that there is only a limited reserve of expertise, much of which is to be found in the Member States â whether in their competent authorities or in their scientific institutions.
It is vital that the best possible use be made of these resources for the common good.
The authorisation procedure is one of the most important aspects of the whole REACH Regulation, if not, indeed, its cornerstone.
On the one hand, we want to find an efficient way of giving businesses an incentive to substitute viable alternatives for substances of very high concern, but, on the other, we do not want to set up a system that puts chemicals producers within the EU at a competitive disadvantage.
This affects a large number of high-tech companies, and the innovative benefit of chemical substances is crucial if they are to remain able to compete with those in the USA, China and other Asian countries.
We must also be careful not to overstrain the Agency or the Commission to too little real effect.
The risk element must remain crucial in the authorisation procedure if we are to continue to endeavour to monitor it in an appropriate way.
Firms must also be able to demonstrate that they are succeeding in doing that.
We can agree to a procedural step in which the Agency publishes information on its work programme for authorisation, that is to say, relating to its choice of chemicals to be proposed to the Commission as candidates for authorisation within a foreseeable timeframe.
That is good for the industry, in that it will give businesses greater confidence in planning ahead.
We can also accept the idea of attaching a review clause to the Agencyâs authorisation of substances in individual cases.
Discussion of substances in products, to which Article 6 relates, has been made difficult, not through its being in any way politically controversial, but because of the objective facts, in that it involves, on the one hand, creating equal competitive conditions for manufacturers and importers of products, and, on the other, countering the problems arising through the import of products the chemical constituents of which do not have to comply with the same conditions as products manufactured from registered chemicals.
These include many components that European industry processes into end products.
In the final analysis, compliance with the WTO rules requiring risk-based regulations is unavoidable.
It is for this reason that the Commission is in favour of those proposals that are practicable and conform to WTO requirements.
The intended rules for substances intended to be released from products appear to the Commission to be reliable.
Other substances in products will require the creation of a system that companies will find easy to use and the primary purpose of which is the identification of risks.
Moving on to the confidentiality of data, a number of amendments have as their objection the enlargement of the list of items of information that should always and in principle be regarded as confidential.
Others seek to shorten this list and facilitate the publication of more information on the Internet.
The Commission takes the view that, at the end of the day, its compromise proposal strikes the right balance.
Our aim should be to ensure access to information that is really needed to protect public health and the environment.
In the course of time, the Agency will have an important part to play in terms of communication and also in informing consumers, even though that is not the express objective of the REACH Regulation.
On the other hand, we must not be naive.
Both Europe and the companies have great knowledge and experience in the use of chemical substances, knowledge that would certainly be of great value to competitors outside Europe.
Within Europe, too, we must ensure that the competitive position of individual enterprises is not undermined.
We cannot therefore rule out the possibility of having to make a number of amendments to the text in order to bring REACHâs practical implementation into line with the provisions of the Aarhus Convention.
I am thinking here, in particular, of the tight deadlines required for appeals decisions.
The amendments also address many other individual issues.
Although time does not permit me to mention them all, I would like to draw your attention to the amendments relating to the Agency, which cover a multitude of issues relating to its mandate, the way its committees work together within it, the composition of the Management Committee and the appointment of its Executive Director.
The Commissionâs view of these amendments is founded on a pragmatic approach.
We have an open mind about, and will deal constructively with, proposals aimed at making the Agency more efficient, but we must avoid heaping additional burdens upon it.
The more tasks we expect it to perform, the greater the risk that it will not enjoy initial success.
Let me also emphasise to the budgetary authority that giving the Agency additional tasks must, self-evidently, be accompanied by a corresponding increase in its financial resources.
The Commission hopes, then, that the compromise package presented by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer is one to which Parliament will feel able to give its approval.
We believe that this package can help to foster widespread support for a piece of legislation that is among the most problematic, complex and, certainly, most controversial in the history of the European Union.
From the very beginning of the discussion of REACH, the Commission has always seen itself as having the role of helping to find a rational and pragmatic solution that struck the right balance between the demands of the economy and the objectives associated with health and the environment, and we do believe that these compromise proposals achieve it rather â and let me make this perfectly clear â than weakening the Commissionâs original proposal.
We believe that this compromise package makes the proposal more workable, more efficient and also more cost-effective; a better way, indeed, of achieving the environmental and health objectives.
It is for this reason that the response from the Commissionâs meeting today was so positive, and I hope that will also encourage the Council to adopt the whole package before the year is out.
The proposals to which the Commission has given such a favourable response are watertight by comparison with those submitted earlier by the UK Council Presidency, so I do now believe that we have an extraordinarily good chance of successfully wrapping up this very difficult legislative package by the end of the year.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament, which has worked very intensively on this proposal at first reading.
I should like to congratulate in particular the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the committee itself and, of course, the rapporteur Mr Sacconi, whose untiring and consistently constructive efforts have made a decisive contribution towards promoting this proposal.
I also thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and their rapporteurs, Mr Nassauer and Mrs Ek, for their constructive proposals.
They have all worked together, submitted proposals and reached this compromise which they propose on one of the main elements of the REACH system: registration.
REACH is a very important legislative initiative to improve environmental protection and human health and, when it is applied, it will significantly increase the knowledge which we have about chemicals, improve their safety and strengthen consumer confidence in the chemicals with which they come into contact.
In addition, it will give impetus to innovation and will encourage the substitution of products by safer products.
I am particularly satisfied by the fact that the European Parliament and the Council have finalised their positions on the proposal.
In this way, the two Community institutions converged in their opinions and now have similar approaches to numerous questions relating to REACH issues.
The compromise package on the question of registration proposed by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer and countersigned by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe constitutes positive progress on one of the most complex chapters of the REACH dossier.
The compromise package constitutes a balanced proposal.
By focusing the proposal on the substances which have the highest risk level, this compromise improves the functionality of the REACH proposal, especially as regards substances produced or used in small quantities.
At the same time, it safeguards a high level of environmental protection, by demanding more information where the risk is greatest.
Despite the fact that the approach for substances produced or used in small quantities differs from the Commission proposal, it is nonetheless a significant improvement for the protection of health and the environment compared with the current situation.
The Commission supports this package within the framework of efforts to find a compromise.
The compromise package aims in the same direction as the discussions being held in the Council.
Similarly, it has many points in common with the compromise proposal tabled by the British Presidency on 28 October, which was broadly accepted in the Permanent Representatives Committee last Friday.
The Commission fully supports the objective of the British Presidency to achieve political agreement before the end of the year and to make every possible effort in this direction and to make a positive contribution to this objective.
There are numerous important aspects in the REACH initiative but, due to lack of time, I should like to refer to two of them: the scope of the proposal and the provisions on authorisation.
The scope of the proposal is fairly complicated, mainly due to the large number of Community legislative texts on specific products which contain chemicals.
The Commission is in a position to accept several of the amendments proposed by Parliament, such as the exemption from registration of waste, food and ores.
However, we cannot accept a number of other amendments which would create a vacuum in the application of the legislation.
As far as authorisation and substitution are concerned, I see with satisfaction that the Members of Parliament have proposed a large number of valuable amendments which set time limits on authorisation and increase the pressure for substitution, thus strengthening protection of human health and the environment.
The Commission agrees with the need to authorise substances which cause a similar level of concern about risk as the most dangerous substances referred to in the Commission proposal: carcinogenic, mutagenic, persistent bioaccumulative and very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances.
We also agree with the setting of a time limit for authorisations, but this limit will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the European Chemicals Agency.
At the same time, we believe that this arrangement, in conjunction with Article 52, as amended by the British Presidency, will have a positive effect on substitution, as there will be pressure on companies to step up their efforts to find substitutes and safer substances.
To close, I should like once again to thank all the members of the European Parliament who have worked so intensively over the past nine months in order to make progress on the REACH proposal.
In this way, the European Parliament is making a decisive contribution to improving the level of protection of health and the environment in Europe, while at the same time maintaining the competitiveness of European industry.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Members of this Parliament for their hard work on REACH, and in particular the key committees and their members.
It is an honour to be invited here to speak on behalf of the UK Presidency.
Firstly, I would like to emphasise that REACH is a very important dossier for the UK Presidency.
This legislation offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection for humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of European industry.
We all want to find a good solution on REACH, one that both enhances protection of public health and the environment and maintains industrial competitiveness.
This objective can only be attained with the cooperation of all Member States, the European Parliament and stakeholders.
REACH will feature strongly at the Competitiveness Council on 29 November, where we plan to hold a serious and substantive policy debate, so your views will be important in feeding into that.
We recognise that we are very close to a deal, and we still intend to achieve political agreement before the end of the UK Presidency.
I am heartened by the commitment shown by the European Parliament in having its first reading this week.
We welcome the work done by the rapporteurs to achieve a balanced and workable compromise on the key aspect of REACH, namely registration.
The main elements of this compromise, co-signed by the three main political groups, are very close to the ideas that the Council is working on.
Therefore, adoption of a European Parliament opinion along these lines should pave the way for an early adoption of REACH.
This would be good news for the environment and for industry, bringing an end to uncertainty, and indeed good news for everyone.
It would finally provide a more effective system for managing the risks presented by chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment.
The Presidencyâs compromise text aims to represent a balanced consideration of the views expressed by Member States in the discussions to date.
It acknowledges the concerns of industry and meets them.
It maintains the objectives of REACH in the field of protecting human health and the environment.
We look forward to taking on board contributions from the European Parliament once you have completed your considerations.
In explaining the direction the Presidency is taking I hope to further inform this debate.
Let me start at the beginning, with registration.
The challenge for us all is to agree a registration package that collects the information necessary to assess the risks.
At the same time it must be proportionate.
We must avoid forcing companies to provide data just for the sake of it.
We all share the same concerns and want to ensure REACH does not adversely impact on small firms.
The following number among our shared proposals on registration: firstly, having a single pre-registration phase to simplify the procedure; secondly, requiring data sharing through âone substance, one registrationâ.
This could deliver savings of up to EURÂ 600Â million.
We have also introduced flexibility by proposing clear criteria for companies to opt out of submitting a joint information package.
It is generally accepted that the sharing of animal test data should be mandatory.
However, to simplify the system, the sharing of non-animal data has been made mandatory only if requested by a potential registrant.
Like Parliament, the Council is concerned about the impacts on small firms.
To reduce these impacts, a proposal for targeted information requirements for low volume substances has been put forward.
Below ten tonnes, a full data set only needs to be provided on a substance if it meets simple criteria identifying it as high risk.
Under this approach, not as much information will be provided about the substances as in the original Commission proposal, but it does mean that we can apply a simplified risk-based approach for the 20Â 000 low volume substances, and focus on those of concern in the first instance.
In order to reduce the burden on industry, and particularly on small firms, the Chemicals Agency will provide tools to facilitate the submission of data.
We have reduced the cost of registration in the higher 10-100-tonnage band by removing an expensive test from the data requirements.
This led to a saving of around EURÂ 80Â million.
In addition, the ability to waive certain tests under Annex VI has been strengthened to minimise the burden for testing at the higher tonnage bands.
I want to emphasise that this can be done in a way that still delivers the necessary information about the hazards and risks of substances.
I now turn to evaluation. Here the registration is checked for compliance or referred for further scrutiny.
The compromise text gives the Chemicals Agency, based in Finland, a more central role in this phase of REACH.
We want to ensure that evaluation is carried out more efficiently and consistently across the EU and that the Agency has the tools and resources to ensure this happens.
Again, I do not think that the Councilâs position is too far from that of Parliament on this.
A similar approach has been taken in the reports from the parliamentary committees which have given their opinion.
A key part of this proposal, of course, is the authorisation stage.
REACH requires any substance of very high concern to be banned unless a strong case for authorisation is made justifying its continued use.
In the Council, we have clarified the scope and have strengthened the authorisation provisions to provide a greater drive towards substitution.
The compromise proposal retains the possibility of a first authorisation based solely on adequate control â that is, you can continue to use a hazardous substance if you can demonstrate that the risks are contained.
But â and it is a big âbutâ â adequate control must be tightly defined.
It is now tighter in our proposal. It is clearer.
It is right that all decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.
Therefore, an amendment has been introduced in our proposal to require all authorisations to be subject to a review.
This would enable further consideration of the availability of alternatives in the future.
In addition, substitution has been further encouraged in our proposal by the requirement to provide an analysis of possible alternatives.
I look forward to the opinion from Parliament.
If I have not managed to persuade you of the vital importance to all the citizens of Europe of securing an early agreement on REACH, then I have failed.
I hope I have been able to give you an insight into the discussions taking place in Council.
For our part, we will continue working in our role as the Presidency to do all we possibly can to get agreement this year.
We believe we can.
We look forward to receiving the contribution of the European Parliament.
Let me repeat, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Let us not throw it away.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, while listening to the speeches of the two Commissioners and LordÂ Bach, who represented the UK Presidency, I was reflecting on the distance we have had to travel in order to arrive at this point.
You yourself have heard how close together the respective positions of the three institutions now are.
I believe I can say that concerning the themes of registration, authorisation and other aspects that have been mentioned, there are no significant differences of opinion on points of principle.
It is difficult to summarise this lengthy process in a few minutes, even though this is the longest time limit that I have been given since I became a Member of this Parliament.
I shall therefore devote only a few words to two key concepts: balance and responsibility.
These are words that came to my mind this weekend, which I spent almost entirely doing some soul-searching.
Particularly in the light of the attacks last week on the compromise that I initialled, I wondered in truth whether I had taken the right decision and whether a balance really had been achieved; in all conscience I had to reply in the affirmative.
We have not only safeguarded but also reinforced the balance between those two essential factors that are close to all our hearts: namely protection of human health and the environment on the one hand and the maintenance of industrial competitiveness in Europe on the other.
It is easier to arrive at such a balance when one is approving a political resolution, since in that instance one is working solely with words.
To reach a balance in a regulation of such importance, when so many often-conflicting interests are affected, is, in contrast, rather more difficult.
In such circumstances, it is in fact also necessary to take account of technical data of considerable weight and importance.
From this perspective I feel that my conscience is clear.
As far as human health and the environment are concerned â and I will confine myself to quoting only a few improvements to the Commissionâs proposal to which I attach particular importance â we can bring forward the registration of persistent bioaccumulative substances.
Subject to Parliamentâs approval, of course, we shall also introduce the chemical safety report for the lower tonnage band, if only for the most hazardous substances.
If Parliament endorses on Thursday the positions adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall define an authorisation mechanism for the substitution of the most hazardous substances, very similar to the mechanism that the UK Presidency referred to a short while ago.
I am particularly proud of this.
As for enterprises, I shall mention only the most important things that have been done.
While maintaining the burden of proof, we have made the registration mechanisms more flexible for the low tonnage bands and have introduced a very important feature for small enterprises: namely data sharing, which has become obligatory apart from certain mechanisms for opting out.
I should also like to recall that, together with MrÂ Nassauer, we have at the eleventh hour extended the period envisaged for data protection and for research and development.
I believe that these are all concrete actions that are moving in the right direction.
In this connection, MrÂ Nassauer, may I say that during my weekend of reflection and soul-searching I was somewhat struck by the fact that, after the compromise we initialled together, you saw fit to table your earlier block of amendments as well.
In this connection I must declare that should our compromise unhappily not be approved, I will naturally support the other block (numberÂ 2).
I am optimistic about this.
I now turn to my second key concept: responsibility, to which I would add the word autonomy.
We have been subjected to much pressure, albeit legitimate pressure, concerning the interests that we all have to represent in some way while seeking the best possible compromise that is acceptable to a majority in Parliament.
We have come close to this objective; and meanwhile the positions of various institutions, in particular the two legislative ones, namely the Council and Parliament, have moved very close together.
I believe that the ball is now in Parliamentâs court, so to speak.
We are aware that many aspects of European integration are in difficulty at present.
Nevertheless Parliament could today send out a strong, clear message on such an important subject to its citizens, enterprises and trade unions concerning its ability to decide and to reach a compromise that would by definition be as representative as possible of the wishes of all interested parties.
MrÂ President, my work comes to an end at this point.
I will naturally pay attention to the voting list in the next few hours, but let us say that the greater part of my job is done.
As LordÂ Bach and CommissionerÂ Verheugen said earlier, we now have to seize the opportunity to speed up the decision-making and legislative process on this matter that has engaged so much of our attention.
I said recently that an agreement is like a fruit: if it is not picked at the right time, when it is ripe, it rots and goes bad.
Since this morning I have been carrying an apple in my pocket.
It is not beautiful; it is small and covered with blemishes, because it was organically grown and contains no fungicides; but I think that it will taste very good and for this reason I shall eat it later.
I accordingly call upon Parliament to pick this fruit; in so doing we shall also help the other institutions, especially the Council, finally to close this file and to send out the message that I spoke of earlier.
Â Â  Mr President, I have just a small point of order to raise.
It has previously been the custom of this House that rapporteurs present the positions of their committees.
As Mr Sacconi is in fact the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would have been glad if what he said had reflected that committeeâs attitude.
I would ask you in future to indicate from the Chair whether speeches are made in a personal capacity or in the capacity of rapporteur.
Â Â  You have expressed your concern, but the Presidency cannot treat it as a point of order.
The order is established, the rapporteur has the right to the floor and he has spoken as he saw fit, and now the representatives of the committees concerned will speak.
The order of the debate will not be altered as a result of your comment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, chemicals are important, indeed vitally so.
They are part of our everyday life and basic to much of our modern human activity.
At the same time, there is a general unease about chemicals.
What are they doing to us and to our environment?
A certain concern is justified, and I am therefore pleased that we in Parliament are to vote through new European chemicals legislation whereby we shall get to know which chemicals expose us to high risks and which do not do so.
I am also pleased that we shall be able to ban chemicals that we need to get rid of and that we shall be able to keep those that we need.
We have helped make REACH give priority to having more attention given to those substances that constitute a serious threat, and we have obtained exemptions for substances we know are not hazardous, such as wood pulp and iron ore.
This means that we shall avoid bureaucracy and unnecessary costs but, above all, it means that we shall use our limited resources to bring about the highest possible level of safety.
In Europe, many goals are set which we do not in actual fact achieve.
Decisions in this Chamber often promise more than they can deliver.
The old chemicals legislation was an excellent example of this.
It was supposed to make us safe but has achieved almost nothing.
Sometimes, the failures are merely embarrassing but, in the case of chemicals policy, they may be highly dangerous.
That is why we need REACH, but a REACH that manages to deliver what it promises.
The great challenge for REACH is to design a policy that does not create barriers to trade and that does not limit other countriesâ ability to sell their products on the European market.
For it to do otherwise would be a disservice not only to the world around us but also to European consumers.
It would be absurd if we in Parliament were to design legislation that was later declared unlawful by the WTO.
I therefore hope that the Chamber will take on board the proposals put forward by the Committee on International Trade for reducing trade barriers.
Quite a few members, including the Swedish Social Democrats, appear inclined to stand aloof from the proposal and to vote against it in its entirety while, in the next breath, they accuse the whole Parliament of not bothering about the environment.
The Swedish Social Democratsâ most important newspaper even describes MrÂ Schulz, the chairman of the political group here in Parliament that it supports, as a defector.
I find that accusation cowardly, and it does not help improve the environment.
Instead, the Social Democrats should ask themselves why they are standing aloof from the proposal.
The overwhelming majority, from the right of centre political groups â the Group of the European Peopleâs Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe â to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and now the Commission as well are in agreement, and it is we who shall keep the proposal afloat.
I am very pleased to have been involved and to assume responsibility for voting new, firm European chemicals legislation into existence.
Â Â  . â The objectives of reducing chemical damage to the environment and to health, raising awareness of the consequences of the use of chemicals, improving consumer access, gradually eliminating and replacing the least safe chemicals and banning tests on vertebrate animals all touch the lives of the citizens whom we represent in this Chamber.
Parliament must therefore welcome the Commissionâs initiative and play a proactive and constructive part in improving on what it is proposing.
This is what we have done.
That a broader undertaking in this regard has been achieved is down to collective responsibility and, more importantly, to Mr Sacconiâs outstanding report.
Supporting these proposals will lead to a marked improvement in the Commissionâs text and will facilitate its implementation.
The core of the text remains intact, namely adopting the principle of responsibility, reducing costs for SMEs, focusing on the most problematic chemicals and the uses thereof, clarifying the Agencyâs role, and giving greater precedence to assessing and monitoring the system.
As shadow rapporteur for the Committees on International Trade and Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am delighted that many examples of consensus reached on the text to be submitted for the vote have been included.
In this connection, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw your attention, and that of the Commission and the Council, to the fact that the EU needs to use its status as the largest trading bloc in the world, and the largest producer of chemicals in the world, to ensure that the rules it adopts internally on environmental and health protection are applied internationally and are seen as prerequisites for free trade.
With regard to REACH, just as many other laws, it should be emphasised that Europe cannot continue to make laws on its internal market as though there were no such thing as globalisation.
Unless we keep this in mind, we will destroy Europe as a productive base, destroy its jobs and, hypocritically, export environmental damage outside its territory to other more vulnerable parts of the world.
This will be tantamount to shooting ourselves in the foot and Article 6 does not go far enough in addressing this problem.
In this area, as in others, the agreement will fall short of being perfect; it will need to be improved gradually on the basis of practical assessment.
This, however, is the agreement that we have managed to reach, and is sufficiently good to warrant Parliamentâs clear support.
This is the only way in which a balanced institutional solution in the short term can be guaranteed.
I therefore lend my backing to it.
Â Â  .
Mr President, REACH, one of the most complex legislative procedures â and not just because it runs to 1Â 200 pages â kept ten of this Houseâs committees occupied, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, whose opinion I have drafted, was one of them.
The chemical industry in the EU employs 1.7 million people, while some 3 million more are associated with it as suppliers.
In order to get some idea of REACHâs effects on day-to-day working life, I visited 50 companies â not just in Germany â working in the fields of paints and coatings, ceramics, textiles, electrical goods, automobiles and chemicals.
The unanimous view expressed by both managers and shopfloor workers was that there was no alternative to protecting health and the environment, and that a clear distinction had to be drawn between hazardous and non-hazardous substances, not least for the employeesâ sake.
It has to be said, though, that the costs stated in the Commission proposal are so high, and bureaucracy involved so extensive, that there is the threat of competition with non-EU businesses being distorted, and the possibility of businesses relocating is not to be excluded.
It was our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that conducted the first of this Houseâs Hearingâs on REACH; this it did in October 2004, with 200 experts on labour law and health protection, not to mention representatives of the social partners, present.
We were also â on 12 July 2005 â the first committee to vote on it, thereby, no doubt, giving important indications as to the future progress of deliberations in the European Parliament.
We are in favour of pre-registration and prioritisation as standard.
If there is a batch of core data relating to the actual risk rather than to the quantity of the substance in question, as well as categories for exposure and use, registration with the Chemicals Agency can be accomplished professionally and at no less speed, avoiding not only vast amounts of dead data but also needless red tape, to the benefit of small and medium-sized businesses in particular.
Most of us voted in favour of derogations for substances used in research and development and for the new Agencyâs powers to be extended.
A modified REACH will make superfluous two dozen European labour law regulations in the field of health and safety at work alone.
Priority has to be given to the drafting of safety data sheets and their precise use in places of work, thereby obviating accidents resulting from the improper handling of substances.
Â Â  MrÂ President, chemicals in Europe are regulated by very poor legislation in the case of the 30Â 000 or so older chemicals and relatively good legislation in the case of the approximately 3Â 000 new chemicals.
The new proposal replaces 43 directives, as well as national legislation in 25 countries â legislation that varies a very great deal, from quite poor to quite good, in terms of quality and of the way in which its application is monitored.
At the same time, it is 100 years since we had national markets that were closed.
Swedes wishing, for example, to buy toys for their children will find that, although a few are produced in their own country, most are imported.
For all these reasons, new chemicals legislation means a great opportunity for the environment, people and companies.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was the first committee to take a decision.
We were able to transform the draft Chemicals Directive â lifeless as it was, and very much called into question - into an opportunity actually to reach a decision.
I wish to thank the members of the committee for their very constructive and helpful cooperation.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has responsibility for industry, small enterprises and research and has therefore, in accordance with its remit, concentrated on changes that pave the way for new, modern technologies, innovations and modern environmental technology.
In Europe, environmentally driven industry is growing twice as fast as industry as a whole and is an incredibly important tool for creating jobs and sustainable growth in a knowledge-based economy.
If REACH is to be this engine of sustainable growth, the proposal needs, however, to be simplified, strengthened and made clearer.
It needs to be simplified in order that small enterprises might survive; strengthened in order to bring about a better environment; and made clearer because, in certain respects, it is very unclear indeed.
