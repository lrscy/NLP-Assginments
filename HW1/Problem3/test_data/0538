I will not rehearse all the many good things that other speakers have referred to that rightly find their place in the Regulations.
But I would like to say something about the pension question.
I am grateful to the Commissioner for his very long and worthy answer to the oral question, and I would like to underline what he said.
Acquired rights and legitimate expectations of existing staff must be paramount and that must be honoured.
The other matter to which I would like to draw attention - and I am sorry that it seems that, whilst there is sympathy, it will not find full recognition - is that of the position of our parliamentary assistants.
Amendments Nos 58 and 59 are there to try to regularise and give status to those who serve us as individual MEPs.
This is something that is long overdue and has to find its place, eventually, in the mechanisms and workings of this House.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, obviously I join with other Members in thanking our two rapporteurs, but I should also like to pay tribute to the European civil servants.
Just imagine: 25 000 people manage this unlikely continent which invents a new future for itself every day.
It is a tremendous task and at the moment it is being performed to perfection.
Thank you, therefore, to the civil servants who support us.
This report, Commissioner, contains interesting and balanced elements, particularly after the amendments proposed by Parliament.
They are appropriate in order to make the European Civil Service more dynamic.
I shall not repeat what some other Members have said, better than I could.
I shall concentrate on Amendments Nos 58 and 59 which would enable us to treat parliamentary assistants as contract staff of the Communities.
These amendments are very positive.
They were tabled - and at this point I shall address the Council bench so that it can take note - by the five major groups in the House.
Consequently, before the Council waves them away with a flick of its somewhat disdainful hand, I invite it to take a closer look at them.
If the Council needs a moment to reflect, that will in no way detract from its responsibilities towards the European Parliament with regard to the Gillig report, a report on the same subject which has been awaiting attention for too long.
That report made it possible to amend a rule so as to give our assistants the option of choosing their national social insurance cover.
The fact that the Council has not yet reacted shows a lack of respect for the agreement which it concluded with Parliament, and in legal terms it places it in an utterly impossible position.
As the Vice-President responsible for this matter, whose patience, I can assure you, is pretty well exhausted, if this blocking tactic persists, I shall be obliged to condemn publicly and vigorously the nature of the blocking and those who are responsible for it.
If that were to happen, it is by no means certain that certain Member States who pretend to be ardent supporters of social policy and transparency will emerge with their pretensions increased or even intact.
Mr President, I also congratulate the two rapporteurs.
They have achieved a large degree of consensus which seemed impossible just a few months ago.
It is also important to mark the importance of this item of legislation.
It is in legislative terms the second and final major tranche of the Commission reform programme, so when the Council adopts this proposal all the essential building blocks will be in place for making sure the Commission becomes more efficient and more effective than it has ever been.
As the Commissioner knows, I would have liked this proposal to go further in some respects.
For instance the expatriation allowance he referred to.
This is an anachronism in a Europe in which we have a labour market where people can move freely from one country to another.
So we will support the amendments tabled by the Verts/ALE Group on this.
Equally, the pensions issue where, frankly, the hysterical reaction from some of the trade unions masks the fact that something does need to be done to bring the pension system into line with the outside world.
I support the package as a whole because it will mean major improvements to the way the Commission works.
I would also like to focus on the one specific issue previous speakers have already addressed, which is the question of parliamentary assistants.
The Commissioner also referred to it.
It is very sad that, so far, this House has been unable to ensure that all parliamentary assistants are properly paid and have adequate social security cover.
A survey by the Assistants' Association concluded that a number of years ago 53% of assistants had no medical cover, 46% were not insured against accidents in the workplace and 53% had no travel insurance while on mission.
The political groups have now tabled a joint amendment which could help us break the deadlock.
We are proposing that parliamentary assistants should become contract staff in the sense of the Staff Regulations, while leaving the detailed rules to the European Parliament.
This would provide a solid basis for a solution that would be acceptable to all and finally end the uncertainty the assistants currently face.
I sincerely hope the Commission will back our amendment, despite what the Commissioner just said, and help us convince the Council that something must be done.
Parliamentary assistants must no longer be treated as second-rate citizens in the institutions, when the smooth functioning of these institutions largely depends on them.
Mr President, I asked for the opportunity to speak in order to draw attention to an aspect of the coming reforms of the Public Service Statute that has been neglected in the discussions to date.
I am talking about the condition under which the unmarried partner of a European official may claim equal treatment.
In other words, to be treated the same as if he or she were the married partner of the official.
I believe the Commissioner when he says that he has often done that, that the purpose of the whole reform operation is to change an obsolete regime to reflect modern times.
I believe, however, that his proposals do not meet this criterion, because he only wants to treat so-called non-traditional forms of cohabitation as equal if the people concerned can provide formal recognition by a Member State and only in cases in which they do not have access to legal marriage.
This approach introduces discrimination by nationality, continues to give priority to marriage and does not solve the problem.
Many unmarried couples will be unable to meet these conditions.
The Commissioner is obviously overlooking the fact that there are not only couples who cannot marry, but also those who do not wish to.
His proposal furthermore does not do justice to the special position of European officials.
I am therefore pleased that in the report by Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Harbour, which we have before us, a better solution is being put forward in Amendment No 39.
This is a solution which, incidentally, has been practised for many years by the European Central Bank.
This rule is characterised by the beauty of its simplicity and also offers equal treatment to those who form a de facto household.
Up to now I have not heard the Commissioner say that he would not follow Parliament's wish on this point.
May I then conclude - and I remain optimistic - that he will in fact do so and that he will use all his verve and eloquence to plead for Amendment No 39 in the Council too?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0061/2003) by Mrs Van Brempt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides (2002/2277(INI)).
. (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for ten years now there has been a broad consensus in Europe about tackling the pesticide problem.
There is also a broad consensus that the present legislative framework is inadequate and must be supplemented by a Community strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides.
That is why in my report I also welcome in detail all the Commission's proposals.
I believe that the Commission's proposals are good but not ambitious enough, and the Commission is also not ambitious enough in its timetable.
Given the resistance to the report and the vote on it in the Commission that we Members of the European Parliament have all experienced over the last few days, I would nevertheless like to linger for a moment on a number of challenges regarding this problem which concerns us all.
Pesticides are increasingly becoming an environmental and health problem.
We are not only talking about obsolete stocks of pesticides here, however, although it is important to tackle that problem very meticulously.
We are talking about much more than that, however; our drinking water, our surface water and our groundwater contain more and more residues, and these days even rainwater no longer complies with drinking water standards.
Drinking water companies must invest capital to remove these residues.
Furthermore, about half of our fresh food contains residues.
The medical evidence that pesticides cause a number of Western diseases should be causing us great concern.
Pesticides cause cancer, mental illnesses and fertility problems.
If farmers are having to produce our food in a sort of spacesuit, should we not be asking ourselves whether we should not be organising our food production differently?
For all these reasons, and for so many other reasons too numerous to mention here due to a lack of time, I want to emphasise in my report that we need a strategy to reduce use as well as a strategy to reduce risks.
A sustainable solution for the future also lies in a systematic reduction in the use of chemicals in favour of preventative and other alternative measures.
We will not solve resistance problems by using more but by using less.
I challenge all of you to find a doctor who says that the problem of resistance to antibiotics can be solved by using more antibiotics.
We know that this is impossible, so as far as that is concerned let us recognise the reality of the situation.
The second point for attention for which there is a consensus in this Parliament is the need for greater scope for the strategy.
Yes, the agricultural sector is extremely important, but governments - particularly local authorities - amateur gardeners, industry and the railways are also major users and it really would be foolish not to include these in our strategy.
We must therefore not ignore these, just as we should not ignore the use of biocides.
Another difficult problem that is particularly controversial is the use of GMOs.
Do we want to go from bad to worse or do we want to aim for sustainability?
After all, the vast majority of genetically modified crops are resistant to herbicides.
The agrochemical industry has promised that genetically modified crops will contribute greatly to reducing the use of pesticides and their risks.
I would like to believe this, I would like to be open to it, but reality is proving them wrong.
These promises are not currently coming true; after a few years, genetically-modified soya, genetically-modified maize and genetically-modified beet all require more herbicides than conventionally farmed crops.
In our report we are asking for the precautionary principle to be applied and for GMOs not to simply be used as a safe and sustainable alternative.
I am asking for no more than this, but I am also asking for no less.
Then there is the cost.
In Europe we have still not properly added up what the use of pesticides actually costs society.
As long as ten years ago the United States calculated that the social costs amount to approximately USD 2.5 to 4 billion per year.
The question is: do we want to internalise that in the cost price, do we want the polluter to pay?
That brings us to the use of taxes and levies.
Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the present regulatory framework is inadequate.
We are all in favour of setting out a number of steps.
I am therefore asking my fellow MEPs to support the report, which I know is especially ambitious.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur Mrs Van Brempt, for the work that has gone into this report in reaction to the Commission's Communication 'Towards a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides'.
The sixth Environment Action Programme introduced the new concept of thematic strategies and requires the Commission to develop them in close consultation with all relevant parties.
The Commission launched this broad consultation with the Communication.
More than 150 comments were received via Internet and following a stakeholder conference with almost 200 participants, the Council adopted conclusions in December 2002 and the European Economic and Social Committee did so in January 2003.
With this report of the European Parliament, the consultation process will be concluded.
The Commission welcomes the Parliament's broad support towards the general approach and the main objectives presented in the Communication.
The numerous detailed comments and requests contained in the resolution will be fully taken into account in the development of the future thematic strategy.
However, I would like to draw the attention of the Parliament to three particular issues raised in the resolution, where the Commission could face some difficulties with implementation.
These issues are also addressed in the amendments tabled for the plenary.
The first one relates to the scope and goal of the future thematic strategy.
The Parliament calls on the Commission to extend the scope to include all uses of plant protection products, agricultural and others, and also biocides.
I can assure you that it has always been the Commission's intention to cover all uses of plant protection products.
But for the reasons already explained in the Communication, the Commission thinks that for the time being actions should be focused on plant protection products.
Only these are also specifically referred to in the sixth Environment Action Programme.
Secondly, the Commission takes note of the emphasis that Parliament's report puts on an overall quantitative reduction of the use of pesticides, whilst the Communication puts more emphasis on reducing the risks.
I would like to underline once more that there is no direct link between the quantities of pesticides used and the risks they can pose to health and environment.
In fact, there are cases where substances are much more active and can be used at lower volumes, but because of their higher activity they pose higher risks to the environment.
Nevertheless, the Commission recognises the interest of seeking a reduction in use as one possible tool to achieve reduction of risks.
Given that the Member States are setting out from very diverse starting points due to efforts made in the past, it is extremely difficult to establish overall quantitative use reduction targets.
Such targets should, however, be considered by the Member States when they establish their national action plans.
Lastly, Parliament's report urges the Commission to develop a regulatory framework for taxes and levies on pesticides.
As outlined in the Communication, this is a very complicated area - in particular the calculation of the real externalities of pesticides - and the effects of introducing such levies in some Member States have been more limited than originally expected.
The Commission will, therefore, have to examine the problem further before making any proposals.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again that I consider the Parliament's resolution to be a very important contribution in the consultation process.
We can now get to work and start the development of the details of the strategy.
I am confident that I can count on the Parliament's continued support in our efforts to further improve the sustainable use of pesticides in the EU.
- (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the Commissioner has just explained the details of the Commission's thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides. Clearly, the proposals amount to a statement of the actions the Commission intends to take in the near future.
To this end, it will either introduce measures of its own or submit legislative proposals to Parliament and to the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
Essentially, this report seeks to respond to people's concern about the possible negative effects of pesticides. They can affect human health, animal health and also the environment.
I would stress that this is mainly the case when they are not used in a rational or legal manner
Nonetheless, the Commission's proposal contains significant gaps.
A great number of comments have therefore been made. The executive arm of the Community should take these into account when it comes to spelling out specific measures.
I would like to highlight what I believe to be the most relevant of the comments received.
Firstly, the Commission's proposal does not take account of the different problems encountered in using pesticides in different regions in Europe.
The fact that the report does not differentiate between the regions of Europe will lead to false conclusions when the approach is applied in different areas.
Secondly, it is not clear whether the Commission considers that organic farming should be the future model for agriculture to be applied throughout the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, we should de-mystify organic farming.
I do not wish to remind anyone of the case of nitrophenol.
Natural products and natural processes tend to be mistakenly equated to environmental protection.
Petroleum, strychnine, hemlock and even anthrax are natural substances, but it is unacceptable to introduce these into the environment.
Organic farming uses natural products but this does not mean it is the most desirable form of farming or the most desirable in every case.
There is no mention of Community policy on integrated production in the Commission's proposal either. This is an important type of production that cannot be overlooked, especially as regards the use of plant protection products.
The proposal does not take account of our ability to significantly reduce the use of pesticides through the use of genetically modified organisms. This would of course require fully transparent regulations to ensure there would be no negative repercussions.
Lastly, I would like to highlight another issue the Commission has failed to deal with.
There is no reference to the approach to be followed in establishing appropriate indicators to measure the effectiveness of the different courses of action to ensure the objectives set out in the Commission's document are met.
Ladies and gentlemen, all these provisions should also apply to the candidate countries and to all countries trading with the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to argue realistically - not emotionally, and certainly not ideologically.
Plant protection agents contain substances that protect cultivated plants and keep them free of pests and diseases, and they can be applied and used in many ways.
They are often indispensable in vegetable and fruit growing and in viticulture, for a producer's economic yield is essentially dependent on a good harvest, on which a business relies for its income and its survival.
We cannot therefore take away from users the option of using plant protection agents where necessary.
It is clear to all of us that the effects of plant protection agents are not only beneficial.
They can also involve hazards to human health and to the environment.
Ten years ago, we enacted at EU level our own directive on plant protection agents, which stipulates in the most precise terms which active agent may be used on which plant and for what purpose.
The Commission communication is supplementary to it, aims to manage risks better, and is therefore a step in absolutely the right direction.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses measures to further train farmers in state-of-the-art and targeted applications of plant protection agents, promotion of alternative concepts such as what is termed integrated crop management, harmonisation of VAT rates on plant protection agents in order to remove existing distortions of competition in the internal market, careful disposal of packaging and expert testing of agricultural machinery, for we see it as particularly important to maintain the purity of our drinking water.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is, in principle, in favour of the proper and up-to-date use of plant protection agents.
Risks can be reduced only if cooperation between producers, users and the authorities is maximised.
Mrs Van Brempt's report goes beyond the Commission communication.
Above all else, a legally-binding 50% reduction in the use of plant protection agents would involve additional risks.
Experts have warned that such a reduction encourages the development of resistance.
The resultant higher incidence of weeds then makes it necessary to use plant protection agents in larger quantities.
As Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez pointed out earlier, the use of an active agent is, however, far more a matter of location, local weather conditions and a plant's general condition in terms of development and health.
An obligatory levy on plant protection agents certainly does not minimise risks in real terms, any more than would the introduction of a pesticides passport and a total ban on spraying from the air.
Any such ban would impose severe limitations, especially in viticulture.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot support the points I have just mentioned in Mrs Van Brempt's report.
I therefore ask the Members of this House to support a realisable and practicable approach, one that will reduce risk without hindering users in their work, for Europe's fruit, vegetable and cereal farmers produce food for us all.
Mr President, this report from the Commission backs sustainability throughout the economy, which primarily means reducing the consumption of resources and using progressive standards to put a stop as soon as possible to economic activities that harm the environment.
If we are to do this, we must remove the barriers we ourselves have erected, which, in environmental policy, are mainly to be found at the level of the nation state.
That agriculture's core activity is the production of healthy, safe and high-quality food is not a matter of dispute, but despite that - or indeed because of it - we have to be able to say that there is little disagreement among farmers that, in the interests of viable food production, plant protection agents should be applied to cultivated plants in order to avoid the reduction of yield or quality as a result of disease, pests and weeds.
The public associate the word 'pesticide' with poisons in the soil, plants and food; for many of them, who are at odds with farmers, it has become a rallying cry, but the reality is quite different.

Without plant protection agents, the cultivation of fruit and vegetables and the production of wine are not manageable, so the only thing to do is to use the minimum of chemical agents to protect the plants from pathogens, pests and weed invasion while at the same time applying more powerful biological and mechanical alternatives.
I see it as a key component of a sustainable plant protection strategy that integrated cultivation should become the normal mode of production in society.
This will minimise the adverse effects of plant protection agents right across the countryside.
However, an ecological rural economy will not enable this objective to be as generally achieved as it has to be.
To say that is to state a sober fact and is no denial of the need to support the ecological rural economy.
There are certain specific things that I regard as necessary and deserving of support.
Harmonisation of maximum residue levels in food derived from plants across the EU is indispensable in order to protect consumers in the EU's internal market.
What is no less necessary is harmonised licensing of plant protection agents.
The mutual recognition principle must be allowed in each Member State until such time as that is accomplished.
That is what the promotion of equal opportunities in competition requires.
With the present problems in fruit-growing and horticulture in mind, I urge that, before the substitution principle is introduced, the effects of the reduction in the agents permitted in the EU - from over 800 to some 300 by the end of 2000 - should be analysed.
Existing notification procedures have not been laid down for anything like a sufficient period of time.
As a result, we end up with restrictions, application provisions with time limits, or debt, the worst alternative solution, which is no sort of solution at all.
Under the current scheme of things, manufacturers of plant protection agents are required to guarantee that their products meet the prescribed safety standards.
Public scandals demonstrate the failure to consistently regulate these procedures.
I am convinced that serious and genuine solutions will be achieved only when an obligation to label requires that the manufacturers of precursors give end users all the information that they need.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although food scandals are frequent topics of discussion in this House, we are not talking about the everyday scandal that our food contains, unfortunately, far too much in the way of pesticides.
A number of speakers have already pointed out how it is a proven fact that pesticides can cause cancer.
Studies have shown how, for example, in Norway, the children of agricultural workers are at significantly greater risk of cancer.
Other studies of a similar kind demonstrate that there is a clear causative link involved, and so we must make every effort, and the Commission too must send out a clear message by making pesticide reduction programmes mandatory.
Countries such as Denmark and Sweden have shown us that pesticide reduction programmes can achieve a reduction in pesticide use of up to 70% within only a few years, without agricultural yields suffering as a result.
A study by the American Environmental Agency made clear years ago that 90% of all pesticides are superfluous.
Just imagine it - 90% of all pesticides are not needed!
At the end of the day, the farmers who think that more is best, even though the very opposite is the case, also come off badly.
So I would like, once again, to make it very clear that our group - as we have already shown in relation to Mr Lannoye's report - is committed to reducing the use of pesticides and wants to use a levy to ensure that their prices reflect the ecological facts, for, at the end of the day, it is the consumers who must pay higher prices for groundwater because pesticides continue to be so cheap and are used in such large quantities.
What is of the essence is that we want labelling to bring about greater transparency.
Our problem is that, where the control of pesticides is concerned, the control authorities in the Member States are groping in the dark, because, to take one example, the German authorities do not know what pesticides are used in Spain or in Greece.
The consequence of this is that we need some sort of labelling, a sort of passport, if effective controls are to be possible at all.
I do think that this is where we have to make a really big effort, as excessive use of pesticides eventually means that we also have to consider the health costs involved.
My great plea to you, Commissioner, is that your strategy should bring about a real reduction in pesticide use and make possible more labelling for the benefit of consumers.
Mr President, the use of pesticides will remain a necessary evil for the time being.
Large-scale agriculture depends on these substances for the production of crops.
It is not for nothing that these substances are known as plant protection products in the agricultural sector.
We have known for decades that these substances cause problems for human and animal health.
Today I read yet another report about grapes on the shelves of cut-price shops containing vastly excessive levels of plant protection product residues.
It is well known that water companies have fewer and fewer opportunities to obtain clean drinking water.
It is therefore important to reduce the use of pesticides and encourage the use of organic alternatives.
I am in principle in favour of clear objectives and timetables for every Member State.
These binding national programmes must, however, take the current situation and the national and regional action programmes into account.
As some Member States have already taken far-reaching measures to reduce the use of, the risks from and dependency on pesticides, it is reasonable to anticipate this.
It is over-simplistic to attempt to reduce the use of pesticides by 50% within a period of 10 years.
It is better to try to achieve an equal level of use throughout the different Member States.
In other words, it does not mean that every Member State will have to reduce its usage by 50% but it will depend on what a Member State has already achieved.
We should be aiming for harmonisation in the licensing of pesticides in order to prevent unfair competition, so the various pesticides should be evaluated more quickly.
If we can achieve this harmonisation, a European tax on pesticides will no longer be necessary.
The discussion on taxes will only result in delays in the Council, amongst other places.
It is therefore better to leave the introduction of any taxes to the individual Member States.
Finally I would like to argue in favour of accepting some of the Amendments put forward by the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, particularly Nos 1, 3, 6, 8 and 9.
In exchange for this, we can also expect wider support for the Van Brempt report, which that report deserves.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the use of agricultural and non-agricultural pesticides has returned today, entering by way of sustainable development.
I agree with some of the rapporteur's observations.
The contamination of surface water is a cause of concern from the point of view of human and animal health.
It is necessary to check pesticide levels in fruit and vegetables, as well as in foodstuffs of animal origin.
Consumers have the right to be informed.
I also agree with her analysis of GMOs.
There is nothing to indicate that widespread use of GMOs will result in a reduction in the use of pesticides.
Apart from these points of agreement, I should like to refer to several points on which our views differ.
First of all, as regards taxation, doing away with the Member States' option to apply reduced rates of VAT is not acceptable to us.
Member States will in practice be deprived of one of their sovereign powers.
Moreover, as two speakers have pointed out, reducing the use of pesticides by half over the next ten years will only be feasible if there are reliable and less harmful substitute products available which do not, in particular, give rise to additional production costs which are incompatible with a market which has already been rendered vulnerable.
I am also opposed to a general ban on aerial spraying in certain remote and inaccessible areas, such as mountain regions, and in extreme climatic conditions which make the usual forms of protection ineffective.
This form of spraying is often the only choice.
Finally, the point which raised more questions for our delegation than any other concerns Natura 2000.
Classified plots of land are likely to see farming activity reduced. Unfortunately that is the idea.
We should like to see this economic activity, and leisure activities too, such as food gathering, hunting, rambling, fishing and mountaineering, which existed before site classification, being allowed to continue, and we want to avoid a situation in which over-protective measures might cause them to disappear in the long term.
By refusing this possibility, Parliament would doom to failure the effective application of the protective measures.
Today farming is the target, but tomorrow which other activities will be prohibited because they are held to be disruptive?
Finally, on behalf of the farming world which I am seeking to defend here, allow me to express my concern about the direction that the rapporteur has chosen to take.
Mr President, naturally I extend my compliments for the work on the motion for a resolution but, considering it very carefully, I also have significant doubts, which I hope are not caused by some sort of accumulation in my subconscious.
In fact, each time that we talk about these issues, it seems to be almost a form of hatred for the farmers who buy and use phytosanitary products to guarantee their crop yields and exclude qualitative problems caused by pests and diseases.
I have a fundamental question: whether quality can be separated from the concept of profitability of farms.
It is clear that when I talk of quality - with the breadth of meaning of this concept - I am referring to the various stages of the production chain.
Studying the Commission's proposal, I cannot see a fitting analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the initiatives proposed in the thematic strategies which have been put forward for our consideration.
This is a point which we have included in our Parliamentary position, but, following a logical thread, I get lost, because immediately afterwards I would like to understand the reasoning behind item 2 of the motion for a resolution - I am referring to Amendment No 10 - which proposes a minimum objective of a 50% reduction of the use of pesticides.
I consider this to be a completely arbitrary figure, which does not take into account the qualitative aspects of phytosanitary products and, above all, overlooks the economic aspects of crop protection.
A final point concerns GMOs: this is a sensitive, problematic issue, too often dealt with in demagogic rather than scientific terms.
In my opinion, use of the precautionary principle for GMOs calls for an appropriate level of consistency with the Union's studies which are already underway and have not yet been completed.
In this respect, the Commission has taken a very serious and wise position, indicating in the field trials when to evaluate the use of GMOs with the related risk of pesticide use.
This is the right way to get tangible answers.
Mr President, the European Parliament has produced a comic strip book, entitled Troubled Waters, to inform young people about the workings of the European Parliament.
The heroine of this book is a raven-haired, stunningly good-looking Member of the European Parliament of indeterminate nationality who single-handedly takes on the evil chemical industry.
Now, there has been much speculation in the European Parliament as to who might be the model for Irina Vega, with our rapporteur being the most widely mentioned.
Now, of course, Troubled Waters is not set in the real world.
I am afraid that having read Kathleen Van Brempt's report, I think she has lost touch with the realities of modern agriculture.
No farmer uses pesticides for fun - after all, they are expensive.
Setting a reduction target at 50% is too simplistic, as we should be targeting the most toxic products, not those with a higher dose rate, as the Commissioner rightly said at the beginning.
Of course, the European Union has turned its back on the new GM technology which has dramatically reduced the reliance on pesticides by our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic.
Levies on pesticides will fall heavily on the new expensive products, which by and large cause less ecological concern than some of the older, cheaper, off-patent products.
We all want to reduce our reliance on chemicals in agriculture but I regret that this report does not give us the solutions we want.
Incidentally, if Parliament is to do a sequel to Troubled Waters, maybe next time it should also feature our Commissioner.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell the Commissioner that the communication has already achieved one thing, and that is a broad-based process of discussion and consultation with all the groups affected.
That is to be welcomed.
Over the years, the European Union has brought into being and implemented many directives and regulations relating to pesticides, some about the marketing of them, others about banning them from being marketed, but also about their use.
So I see it as high time that the existing rules were implemented in full and their effectiveness assessed.
The approval system needs to be improved.
I see Community-wide licensing procedures for marketing as one of the indispensable principles of the common internal market.
Substances permitted in such places as Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium cannot be banned in Austria or Germany.
As far as I am concerned, a mere strategy of reduction - Mrs Van Brempt, in her report, proposes a reduction of 50% - is not efficient.
Any reduction in the quantities used will always be dependent on the effectiveness of the means used.
It is self-evident that integrated husbandry has become part of everyday agricultural life.
Methods of cultivation using low levels of pesticide use must be promoted and developed more vigorously, with risks being minimised and the protection of rural cultures - which is so necessary - being ensured.
This is what makes counterproductive the prevention of professional and targeted application of pesticides using helicopters.
Airborne plant protection means that a committee of experts takes integrated plant protection as its basis when deciding whether this treatment should be applied, and, if so, when and with how much.
I see that as safer than if every small-time vinedresser or winegrower decides for himself and ends up on a steep slope right in a cloud of the plant protection agent he is spraying.
I am firmly opposed to the introduction of levies and taxes on plant protection agents.
Increased cost means weaker competitiveness rather than leading to any real reduction in the use of pesticides.
Let me say in conclusion that it is not acceptable that the European agricultural sector should be able to import from third countries foodstuffs and feedingstuffs treated with active agents prohibited in the EU.
Mr President, we are all in favour of a reduction in the use of pesticides, but to suddenly decide upon a 50% reduction is neither realistic nor practical.
Consumers want a very good quality product.
In fact, they have become accustomed to this.
Very often the quality of the product is due to the amount of pesticide with which it has been sprayed.
I am almost committing a sin by actually mentioning it, but many crops are sprayed and, because of this, they are of a very good quality.
Consumers demand high quality, and that is what they will buy.
If they do not buy a product that is produced in the European Union because we have banned various chemicals, they will buy it from outside and this will put our farmers at a disadvantage.
Farmers in the European Union also want to grow many varied types of crops.
If we are not careful, we will take many chemicals off the market and this will reduce the amount of crops we can grow.
This is certainly not the intention of the Commission nor of Parliament.
There is a place for organic farming, but we must accept that if the whole world was to embrace organic farming, we would starve.
It is as simple as that.
We would be unable to produce anywhere near enough food for the world if we were entirely on an organic system.
As one of my colleagues has mentioned, GMO agriculture would enable us to actually produce a plant which is resistant to many diseases and could be sprayed a great deal less.
We could probably reduce the chemical use on these crops by even more than 50%, but, of course, we have closed our minds and our ears to the whole debate and, again, we are going to reduce the competitivity of European agriculture.
We have to face up to the realities of the global market.
Mr President, I will not repeat those things, which I support, already mentioned by my many colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - Mrs Redondo, Mr Perez, Mrs Klass and Mrs MÃŒller - but I would just like to mention a couple of elements.
Mrs Van Brempt wants a general 50% reduction.
That means that those who have already done well and have therefore cut their usage by a great deal more must reduce it again by another 50%.
That means that the good are penalised, and that cannot be right.
So a general 50% reduction is not right.
Secondly, she talks about a distance of three metres from waterways.
You must realise what that means, but in general, wherever there are a lot of things growing, you tend to find water.
That means that particularly in areas where the natural conditions are good, efficient producers will ultimately be penalised.
That cannot be right; it does not work that way.
The third point is that I am amazed that discussions about GMOs and crop protection are being mixed up here.
I think that these discussions should be kept separate.
I myself am very wary when it comes to GMOs, I acknowledge that, but I think that they have no place in this discussion.
My fourth point is that the entire crop protection policy should be aimed at encouraging proper targets and not purely at punishment.
I cannot see any sign of that in the report, and I would like to wholeheartedly advise everyone in Parliament to vote in favour of the PPE-DE amendments, as that means that we will get our feet back on the ground a little and at the same time work together to try and do things even better in the future.
Mr President, I will keep it short, but I would like to say something to the people who might be listening to this debate there - who knows.
It is very striking; this is the first time I have ever heard such a battery of members of the European People's Party/European Democrat Group all saying the same thing one after the other.
For the benefit of those listening, this Parliament does actually have other groups with different opinions .
Having said that, I would like very briefly to eliminate a few prejudices.
For there are people here who would dearly like to class me as 'a bit other-worldly, a bit naÃ¯ve', 'someone who sits in their office working out rather peculiar proposals'.
I really have not done that; I have, however, had a look, I have taken advice and I have, for example, seen that there has effectively been quite significant reduction in other Member States of the European Union, like in our esteemed Commissioner's country.
What can be done in Sweden can also be done in the Netherlands, in Belgium and in the United Kingdom.
We can do that if we want to.
I challenge everyone to scrutinise my report.
Nowhere do I say that I am opposed to pesticides.
I know they are necessary, even advisable.
We can, however, cut down on their use.
A reduction in use naturally goes hand in hand with a reduction in risk, which I believe to be more important, but because there is a consensus on this, I have not focused on it.
I have also always maintained in the committee that this 50% is not a fetish of mine.
Perhaps we should put 30%, perhaps 40%, perhaps 60%, but I would definitely like to see a target.
After all, we all know that if this Parliament does not set a target , we will not actually make any progress.
We must make sure - and this is one of the amendments I have submitted in the plenary session - that the efforts that have already been made by the other Member States and the efforts we still need to make, which differ from Member State to Member State, are also taken into consideration.
Let me once again ask the members of the European People's Party/European Democrat Group not to look at my report dogmatically.
I also try not to do that myself.
I would like to say one more thing briefly.
Everyone has run over their time, and they have all said the same thing, so I just want to say something about taxes.
Someone said: 'Naturally the taxes will not make the risks decrease.'
I am not stupid, I know that too.
Why do we need these taxes?
In order to ensure that the polluter-pays principle is implemented effectively.
There are very many social costs, and I ask you: do you think that it is normal for everyone to bear the social costs or should they be borne in an honest way by the products that pollute?
That is one of the many challenges.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0044/2003) by Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM (2002) 459 - C5-0382/2002 - 2002/0206(COD)) relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of nonylphenol, nonylphenol ethoxylate and cement (twenty-sixth amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC).
Firstly, I would like to express my thanks to Members for their interest in this proposal and especially to Mr Lannoye, the rapporteur, for his constructive work.
This is an important directive, as it would introduce a ban on the cleaning agent 'nonylphenol' that has been identified as posing unacceptable risks to the aquatic environment.
It is a very far-reaching proposal, as it bans the marketing and use of nine different applications where the substance could be released into the aquatic environment.
The proposed directive will therefore encourages the marketing and use of safer alternatives.
Furthermore, the proposal sets a strict limit for chromium -6 in cement, as chromium -6 has been shown to induce disabling and allergic eczema, especially among cement workers.
In the EU each year, hundreds of new invalidity cases occur which cause high costs for the occupational insurance systems.
The proposed directive provides not only for the protection of human health and the environment, but also preserves the Internal Market, as it would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.
The negotiation procedure that is about to be concluded has benefited from the close cooperation between Parliament, Council and the Commission.
I am very glad about this successful work together, and I hope that this important directive can now be finalised.
I therefore agree to all the amendments proposed by Mr Lannoye for this compromise, so that this important directive can be finalised in first reading.
Mr President, we shall not be short of compliments today. I should like, on behalf of all my colleagues, to thank the Commission for its proposal.
It is an excellent proposal, and the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was made easier by the fact that the basis for discussion was very good right from the start.
Like the Commissioner, I would remind the House that nonylphenols and nonylphenol ethoxylates - I shall refer to them as NPEs to facilitate the discussion - are classified as substances which are highly toxic to aquatic organisms. These substances accumulate biologically in aquatic species, and they have also been shown to have an endocrine-disrupting effect.
The 2000 water framework directive classifies them as hazardous substances.
The Commission proposes to put an end to the use of these substances in eight specific fields, and the Committee on the Environment, on that basis, proposes that the area of application be extended to include co-formulants in pesticides as well as active substances and co-formulants in biocides.
The Commission also proposes that the concentration threshold for NPEs should be brought into line with the one proposed for nonylphenols, or NPs, in other words it should be based on a limit value of 0.1%.
It is also asking for an amendment to the directive on sewage sludge, so as to introduce a concentration limit value for these same substances contained in sewage sludge.
As far as cement is concerned, when it contains chromium VI in non-negligible quantities it can cause allergic reactions if it comes into contact with the hands.
Personal protective measures, such as the wearing of gloves, are certainly necessary, but it has been found that they are not sufficient to prevent reactions of this type.
The addition of a reducing agent, usually ferrous sulphate, reduces chromium VI to a harmless chemical form.
The Committee on the Environment proposes that the addition of a reducing agent be extended to cover all cements containing more than two parts per million (ppm) of chromium VI, with an exemption restricted to cases where the cement is used in closed-circuit fully automated systems.
This is an essential measure, both for the workers concerned, and I am thinking in particular of construction workers, and for the public purse, which has to pay out sizeable amounts of compensation to the victims of allergic dermatitis.
I would point out that we have a figure for Germany of EUR 36 million per year in compensation, which enables us to measure the economic impact of this problem.
I would also point out that chromium VI is a carcinogenic and mutagenic substance which is suspected of causing lung cancer and cancer of the respiratory tract as a result of its presence in dust.
The Committee on the Environment is therefore asking for two things.
Firstly, with regard to the directive on the protection of workers against risks from chemical agents, it is asking for an amendment introducing a limit value for the concentration of dust in the atmosphere.
Secondly, it is asking for provision to be made, in other sectors which use chromium VI in various products, for legislative initiatives of the same kind as those that have been adopted for end-of-life vehicles and for electrical and electronic equipment.
The Commission's proposal, as I have already said, was very good right from the start, which made our task easier and enabled us to envisage, after discussion with the Council's representatives, consultations before the plenary vote, so as to obtain agreement at first reading.
The vote in the Committee on the Environment enabled us to take this step, and it was accepted by the representatives of the various political groups within the Committee on the Environment, for which I thank them.
We have thus obtained agreement between the three institutions, though not on every point, because it is clear that differences of opinion still exist on a certain number of points, but we have at least reached agreement on the essential points before the plenary vote.
Where I come from there is a proverb which says that the best is the enemy of the good.
For my part, I have always thought that the good, in this case, consisted of obtaining a result, since the objective was essentially to speed up the implementation of the adopted texts.
I should therefore like to thank, officially and most sincerely, the Commissioner and the Commission officials, as well as the Greek Presidency of the Council, for allowing us to reach an overall agreement which will be put to the vote tomorrow.
It will thus be possible to implement very rapidly what I personally regard as the most important proposal, namely the proposal to eradicate an industrial disease, the allergic dermatitis caused by the presence of chromium VI in cement, which is one of the most damaging diseases and one of the most costly to society.
Mr President, I am very pleased that the political groups have reached a compromise position on this report, which actually consists of two reports rolled into one.
I am sorry that at the beginning of the negotiations I had to be so inflexible and stubborn, but I am pleased to say that once the Greens, for once, started to talk sense, we could also show some flexibility.
With the Council's acceptance of this compromise, the measures contained in this report can be brought into force without delay.
We have come together on three important issues: firstly, on the issue of cement.
Nobody argues with the fact that hexavalent chromium causes dermatitis but, of course, we must not forget that only 50% of dermatitis cases are linked to this particular cause.
As the rapporteur has said, dosing cement with ferrous sulphate counteracts this problem.
The initial suggestion from the Commission was that we should limit this dosing to cement used for manual use.
But the whole of Parliament agreed this was very hard to define as even, for example, when one is pouring a large motorway bridge or laying a large floor, there is a certain amount of manual work involved in grouting or finishing.
The compromise we came to was only to exempt uses in closed industrial applications, for example, the manufacture of concrete blocks, concrete lintels or other products of that type.
The second issue regarding cement was the risks of long-term exposure.
The rapporteur has talked about the carcinogenic and mutagenic problems of chromium-6 but, of course, nobody is realistically suggesting that the levels of chromium-6 in cement pose a risk.
However, we need to look at the problem without raising undue concerns which would worry the workers in this industry and make the insurance industry very cagey indeed.
It is important that we set limit values and that we do so in a sensible way, although we already have limit values set in the United Kingdom.
On the issue of nonylphenol, this is an aquatic pollutant, and although many in the committee tried to talk about health risks and bring in other factors, we must concentrate on the case at hand, which is making sure that nonylphenol does not reach water courses and is banned in applications where there is no alternative.
We need exceptions and the problem of using nonylphenol ethoxylate as a co-formulant in pesticides is one that we addressed.
The compromise is to allow existing pesticides to continue until the end of their licensing period, but it will be banned in new pesticides.
Incidentally, we still allow them to be used in spermicides in condom production where there is no alternative.
I am pleased that we reached an agreement and avoided a second reading and possible conciliation.
Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would welcome this report and the work done in particular by the rapporteur and all the others concerned to reach a first reading agreement and therefore hasten the implementation of this proposal.
Firstly with regard to cement, we have made substantial progress.
The problem has been recognised and identified across the whole of Europe.
Cement is a major cause of eczema for all workers in occupations involving the regular use of cement.
Various experiences and various construction projects utilising cement that has been ameliorated with ferrous sulphate have demonstrated that the sensible use of this cement makes a very substantial reduction in the number of incidents of eczema within the industry.
It is clear that making this mandatory could bring considerable improvements for many workers across the whole of Europe.
Whilst we have had to accept some compromises to reach a first reading agreement, we have reached a reasonable compromise, although we must continue to examine the problems associated with the use of cement in closed systems.
In reality, I do not think I have ever seen a closed system myself in any factory anywhere where cement does not leak, squeeze or squirt out somewhere in the system and come into contact with workers on a fairly regular basis.
We must continue to look at this issue.
As regards nonylphenol ethoxylate, again we have made substantial progress - progress that I regret cannot result in an immediate implementation of complete controls on it.
But the compromises we have reached are reasonable.
Firstly, only where those uses are really inevitable, for example in the use of spermicides, have we allowed the continued use and we are still concerned to find appropriate and suitable alternatives; and secondly, where we have decided to end the use of these things, for example as a co-formulant in pesticides, we have given a reasonable phase-out time and reasonable opportunity for the industry to bring forward new formulations that are appropriate and efficacious for use without the use of nonylphenol ethoxylate, which is again a reasonable compromise.
Altogether, we can all commend this report to the House tomorrow morning and consider it a job well done, congratulate the rapporteur and look forward to early implementation of this proposal and a substantial saving in costs and compensation towards industrial injuries caused by cement and probably towards human health caused by nonylphenol ethoxylate.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a directive has set ambitious aims for itself: to protect health and the environment.
We can readily agree with the proposal and the rapporteur with regard to the care that needs to be taken with nonylphenol and with nonylphenol ethoxylate, the dangers of which are well known and which cannot be addressed by any means other than a proposal for a directive.
We have serious reservations, however, about the need and the appropriateness of the directive on cement, on various grounds.
Firstly, we believe it to be technically wrong and politically surprising that the same legislative text covers both unquestionably dangerous products and cement.
Secondly, we believe that clearly insufficient time has elapsed since the implementation of directive 2001/60/EEC on labelling to be able to draw safe conclusions about its adequacy or otherwise in reducing or eliminating the most worrying cases in this field.
Thirdly, the information available does not enable us to corroborate, with the apparent certainty that some Members have, a genuine and rigorous risk assessment of chromium VI, which, as we know, is still a cause for controversy amongst specialists.
Lastly, if these limitations are adopted, we feel that to some extent we will have accepted a form of discrimination which, by means of derogations, favours producers and the bulk cement trade over bagged cement.
We are therefore opposed in particular to Amendments Nos 31, 32, 33, 34 and 43, and if these are adopted we shall, unfortunately, feel obliged to vote against the report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0064/2003) by Mr NisticÃ², on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive (PE-CONS 3606/2003 - C5-0016/2003 - 2001/0110(COD)) amending for the twenty-third time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction).
Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Members for their interest in this proposal and especially to Mr NisticÃ², the rapporteur, for his constructive work.
This is an important directive as it would introduce a ban on substances that have been identified and classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction, the so-called CMR-substances.
It is a far-reaching proposal, as it bans their sale and all their possible mixtures to the general public.
The proposed directive will therefore encourage the marketing and use of safer alternatives.
Furthermore, the proposed directive provides not only for the protection of consumers' health but would also preserve the Internal Market. It would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.
The reasons for favouring an extension of the ban to products placed on the market for consumer use are understandable.
Nevertheless, this requires an examination of the scientific evidence, the release factors and the exposure situations.
The Commission will address Parliament's concerns by seriously looking at potentially problematic products which could pose unacceptable risks to health and the environment.
I am pleased that this procedure of risk assessment is clarified precisely in the new recital 3.
In conclusion, the Commission accepts the new recital 3, and I hope that this directive can now be finalised.
Mr President, I am undeservedly deputising for Mr NisticÃ², the rapporteur, who is unable to be here, and I assure Commissioner Liikanen that I will pass on his thanks and compliments.
For my fellow Members' information, I will therefore very briefly describe the measure which we will be voting on tomorrow and, as Commissioner Liikanen already said, represents common ground which the Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee has supported, endorsed and which it commends to the House for a positive vote tomorrow.
As Commissioner Liikanen has already said, this is an amendment to the twenty-third amendment of Directive 76/769 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction).
The proposal, based on Article 95 of the Treaty, has two main objectives: to safeguard the internal market by introducing harmonised provisions on the marketing and use of the above-mentioned substances and to achieve a high level of protection for human health and the environment.
It is appropriate to point out that we are talking about 25 substances in particular, 14 of which are classified as category 2 carcinogens, such as some cobalt salts, cadmium, benzopyrene, azoic colouring agents and so on; three of these are classified as mutagens and eight as toxic to reproduction.
For example, it has been established that cobalt causes carcinogenic effects in laboratory animals and in human beings, particularly lung cancer and myocardial tissue tumours; cadmium powders, for their part, can cause testicular cancer in addition to lung cancer.
As can therefore be inferred from these brief examples, we are dealing with highly dangerous substances.
During the last year and a half to two years of work, Parliament adopted at first reading, in February 2002, two amendments which the Council, in June 2003, partly accepted by adopting its common position.
At its second reading in 2002, Parliament adopted an amendment to the recitals.
We have therefore reached the final part of this conciliation, of these three stages and, as has already been pointed out, the problem that still needed to be settled did not concern the substances, but the products which may contain these substances.
Well, the agreement on the sole point at issue during conciliation stipulates that the Commission must submit as soon as possible a legislative proposal aimed at banning the use of products - products this time - containing substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction where, however - and emphasising this is very important to the rapporteur - there is scientific evidence that these substances are released by such products, thereby exposing the general public to the risks described above.
This is why the delegation considers the obtained results to be satisfactory for Parliament and commends it to the House for adoption.
Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we now have to decide on the report by Mr NisticÃ², an important report because, as has just been mentioned, it aims to prohibit the marketing of substances newly classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction. It also constitutes - and I would emphasise this - the twenty-third amendment to the directive.
We must of course welcome the European Union's decision on this question, and also welcome the fact that it regularly comes up for discussion, as our knowledge of the subject grows.
The examples quoted by Mr Lisi are a good illustration of the need to prohibit these hazardous substances.
During the conciliation procedure, however, the Council was unwilling to approve the proposal to extend the subject matter of the text to include products, so as to avoid legislation which in its view would be too complex and which would run the risk of being impossible to apply.
Admittedly the argument that these substances are present in 30 000 products and it would be difficult to carry out assessments of such a large number of products makes good sense.
However, surely we could ask, here and now, that such assessments should be carried out on new products placed on the market which contain the substances in question?
Moreover, the Commission has undertaken, following agreement between Parliament and the Council, to submit a legislative proposal aimed at prohibiting the use of products containing CMR substances when it is scientifically proven that exposing the public at large to such substances involves risks.
It is desirable that this proposal, which is in line with what we want to happen, is put into practical terms as soon as possible.
As for the method of working, I would remind the House that, whereas this report concerns the twenty-third amendment to the directive seeking to prohibit the marketing of CMR substances, the Committee on the Environment is already looking at the twenty-fifth amendment to that directive.
Of course the twenty-fifth amendment is concerned with other substances and preparations, but would it not be better to coordinate the adoption of the various texts, particularly when they are concerned with products that are hazardous to human beings and to the environment?
CMR substances, chemical products and pesticides should be examined from the same angle, namely that of safety and the risks that they represent to human beings and to the environment.
There is also another question which we shall have to take increasingly into account from now on, and that is the question of risk and the burden of proof.
A company which places a product on the market has to assure consumers that the product is not harmful.
It is not the task of the consumers to demonstrate that the product is hazardous.
A product should not have to be banned after it has been placed on the market because the product has actually shown itself to be harmful: it should be banned before it is even placed on the market.
Mr President, Mr NisticÃ² is not here, but we have to debate the twenty-third amendment to this directive, which restricts the use and release onto the market of dangerous substances and preparations classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction.
Naturally, my group and I are in favour of adding a further 25 dangerous substances to the banned list.
I, personally, am also the rapporteur for the twenty-fifth amendment to this directive, through which a further batch of substances is being added.
That is not at all what is controversial about this recommendation.
Instead, my criticism applies more to what is not included and to the defects in the current legislation.
The designation 'substances and preparations' by no means covers the use of CMR substances in consumer products, that is to say in those products with which we, as consumers, in the first place come into contact and through which we are exposed to these dangerous substances, for example when we buy toys, textiles, new flooring etc. The directive does not, then, cover the main source of what we are exposed to, that is to say carcinogens and other dangerous substances.
At first reading, the European Parliament asked the Commission to extend the directive to include the sale of consumer products, and we requested a proposal by 2002.
In the common position, the Council states that a full risk assessment is required if it is to be possible to introduce restrictions on products.
What is more, the Council comes up with the amazing argument that this really will be difficult because there are so many products.
That is, of course, precisely why, in fact, a directive is required, namely so that people do not continue to be exposed to carcinogens through consumer products.
The conciliation on which we are now to adopt a position, together with Mr NisticÃ²'s recommendation, constitute a compromise I believe to be quite contrary to the new chemicals policy we have adopted, proposing that CMR substances not be permitted to be used in products if, through what is termed a reverse burden of proof, they have not proved to be safe.
A reverse burden of proof is not what we now have in the outcome achieved but, instead, restrictions that apply only if, by means of a risk assessment, it can be demonstrated that a risk exists. In other words, we have precisely the policy that all the institutions have recognised as being ineffective in protecting people's health.
Unfortunately, it will be a good many years before the chemicals policy comes into force.
In order to protect people's health, we really needed measures covering CMR substances in consumer products immediately.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will not therefore be voting in favour of the recommendation.
Mr President, I welcome this report and some of those we have seen going through Parliament in the last few months.
Indeed, I welcome Mrs SchÃ¶rling's report that we will be voting on in the plenary session in Strasbourg in a couple of weeks' time.
We are laying down a solid body of work, a solid body of information and some very important precedents as we move towards the setting up and launching of the new chemicals policy that we expect to come from the Commission very soon.
What is becoming clear to us all is quite simply that present analysis of chemicals and the present chemicals on the market are not satisfactory.
In the case of many chemicals on the market at the moment, we quite simply do not know how dangerous or how safe they are.
We need a new system.
We welcome the new system that is coming and, if you like, in the very dying moments of the old system, I have to say I can remember more of these amendments to the original directive than I care to remember, although I have not been here quite long enough to remember the original directive, and I have always found that we have not been sufficiently consistent in what we have done.
I would agree with some of the remarks made by Mrs SchÃ¶rling.
We need a new chemicals policy.
We are waiting for the new chemicals policy, Commission - where is it?
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the oral question (B5-0086/2003) by Mr Struan Stevenson on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries concerning problems with the implementation of Regulation No 2561/2001 (EC) aiming to promote the conversion of the fishing fleet operating under the fishing agreement with Morocco.
Mr President, following the failure of the EU to renew a fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco, it became clear that there would be massive socio-economic impacts within the Community.
The previous agreement with Morocco expired in November 1999.
At that time, this had been the biggest international agreement between the Community and any third country.
A great many EU vessels and jobs relied upon it, primarily in Spain but also in Portugal.
In the absence of a new agreement, a significant number of Community vessels from Galicia, Andalucia and Portugal that operated within this framework were forced to stop their fishing activities.
Recognising the difficulties caused by the lack of any new fisheries agreement, the Community agreed to set aside over EUR 190 million to promote the conversion of fishing vessels that had operated in Moroccan waters.
94.6% of this money was set aside for Spain, and the rest for Portugal.
However, when the Prestige disaster occurred last November and the shores of Galicia were covered in layers of black oil, we began to search for emergency aid to alleviate the catastrophic suffering of the fishing communities in this region.
We discovered that EUR 30 million of the money set aside to deal with the Moroccan problem was, at that point, still unspent.
The European Parliament therefore agreed at its plenary session in December 2002 that we should immediately re-programme this money to help with the Prestige disaster in Galicia.
Nevertheless, the fact that the Moroccan fund had been underspent raised some important questions.
At a meeting of the Committee on Fisheries in February 2003, representatives of the industry and of the Andalucian regional government described the problems they encountered in the implementation of this Regulation.
It quickly became clear that the criteria according to which fishermen could claim this aid was far too complex and had proven to be so rigid that very few fisherman had in fact managed to benefit from any of this money.
Industry representatives told our Committee that potential beneficiaries are losing out on compensation measures due to overly stringent Commission deadlines and rules.
For example, public aid is granted only to fishermen who have undertaken to scrap vessels, change the purpose of their vessels, or agreed to the permanent transfer of a vessel to a third country through joint venture agreements.
In particular, crew members who have lost their jobs cannot apply for the individual premium of EUR 12 000 unless the owner decides to transfer or scrap the vessel.
This means that many fishermen living in the regions which were affected by the failure of the Morocco agreement have still not received any financial help.
I need hardly remind the House that in our March 2003 plenary session in Strasbourg two weeks ago, by an overwhelming majority of 507 votes in favour to 6 votes against, the European Parliament supported a resolution proposing EUR 150 million to be paid as compensation to fisherman affected by the draconian cod recovery measures now in place in the Irish Sea and the North Sea.
I know that we are still negotiating with the Commission and the Council as to where this emergency aid might come from, but I trust that we are simply not going to repeat the mistakes that were made with the Moroccan fund.
We must ensure that in future when we identify the need for urgent aid to the fisheries sector, it is delivered in a way that is both fairly targeted and quickly completed.
Let us make sure that there is a minimum of red tape and a minimum of bureaucracy.
I just returned this afternoon from Galicia where I attended meetings and site visits with members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to see for ourselves the clean-up operation in the wake of the Prestige disaster.
We heard all too vividly the desperate plight of the fishing communities who had been forced to tie up their boats, through no fault of their own, since last November.
Despite the fact that this House agreed to re-programme EUR 30 million last December, none of that money has so far been released.
Why not?
Who is working on the details of this aid package?
Where are the log jams?
Let us cut the red tape and get the aid moving!
Let us learn from these lessons that have been identified under the Morocco agreement and get things right in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in January of this year, my staff, together with the Spanish authorities, visited the affected areas in Spain that are under discussion today and agreed that the funds provided for the final decommissioning of ships, for the modernisation of the vessels and for the setting-up of joint ventures, are being used in a satisfactory way.
The same cannot be said, however, for the way funds are being used on social measures, and this is where there are problems.
The reason why the fishermen are not making full use of the funds provided for social measures is that they are unable to fulfil certain of the conditions in our regulation.
The fact is that fishermen who have lost their jobs because of the failure to extend the Agreement with Morocco, receive a compensation payment only if their employer allows his ship to be broken up or if he sets up a joint enterprise.
If, though the ship continues to fish in other third-country waters - or indeed in Community waters - for example, under a private licence, they are not entitled to any payment in compensation.
That is also essentially logical, as such ships are still active in the fisheries sector and it can therefore be assumed that their crews continue to be employed.
We have now agreed with the Spanish authorities that they will inform the Commission as to where and for what reasons social problems arise as a result of ships not being broken up, and no entitlement to structural funds exists.
On the subject of items 1 and 2 in your motion for a resolution, I can, then, tell honourable Members that we will come to a decision without delay as soon as we have all the data we have requested from the Spanish Government and have the opportunity to examine it.
Item 3 of your resolution does, of course, have something to do with this.
If the Commission comes to the conclusion that we should decide in favour, we will of course also modify the repayment of some of these sums in such a way as to ensure that the fishermen receive equal treatment.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and also Mr Stevenson for the solidarity he has shown for Galicia as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
Ladies and gentlemen, though there are not many Members present in the Chamber at this time of night, I would like to point out that the renewal of the agreement with Morocco was one of the most important objectives of the Committee on Fisheries.
When this agreement was not achieved, we went out of our way to ensure that the budget that had been earmarked for the agreement would go instead to the fisherman affected. After some very difficult political and budgetary negotiations we secured this money.
The practical application of the regulations approved demonstrated to us the need to improve them. We did not want any potential beneficiary to be deprived of even a single euro.
We worked with great determination to rectify the situation.
This is the purpose of the resolution we will vote on tomorrow, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries. The proposal we have tabled has been improved by the contributions of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
A consensus was reached rapidly, and I think we should all congratulate ourselves on this. I believe the Commission should accept in full the proposals we will vote on tomorrow.
These will amend Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 and ensure better social cover. This is what we want and what the Commission wants, and I believe it should be achieved.
Mr President, on 15 November 2001 I was rapporteur for the report on Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 on the conversion of boats and fishermen dependent on the fisheries agreement with Morocco. On that occasion, Parliament agreed a series of amendments that seem to be very similar to the proposal before us today.
They sought to make the regulation more flexible and to convert this particular Community fleet.
As I am sure the Commissioner is aware, the fleet is based in Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Galicia and Portugal, It was left without their traditional fishing-ground.
The Council adopted this Regulation accepting, though only to a limited extent, some of Parliament's amendments. In due course, the weaknesses of the text adopted became clear.
As we had anticipated, it proved too rigid.
It did not allow a significant part of the sector concerned to access the aid for conversion.
The Committee on Fisheries has visited Galicia and Andalusia over the last two years. It noted that the non-renewal of the agreement seriously affected 400 boats, 4 300 fishermen and whole regions of Galicia and Andalusia.
A large number of associated industries were brought to a virtual standstill.
Last December, EUR 30 million was allocated to those affected by the Prestige disaster. The allocation of this money made it clear that it was not possible to spend it and that this regulation was inadequate.
The draft resolution tabled by the Committee on Fisheries rightly calls on the Commission to put forward an amendment to improve this regulation and make it sufficiently flexible. We call on the Commission to present a proposal to amend the present regulation as a matter of urgency.
We need this to solve the problems we are currently encountering in applying the regulation to fishermen. Above all, aid should not be linked to shipowners' decisions.
The Commission told us a few weeks ago that it could not propose amendments to the regulation because the Spanish authorities had not submitted the required information to the Commission.
When she met with the Committee on Fisheries, the Director-General of Fisheries of the Andalusian Regional Government told us that the Spanish authorities had not submitted the necessary information on the proportion of fishermen from this region who had received benefits during the six months' ban to the Regional Government. The authorities in Andalusia did not therefore even know exactly how many fishermen were entitled to aid.
Consequently, they had to establish six offices in the most affected ports to provide information on this aid. This entailed employing 12 people, an investment of EUR 721 000 from their own funds and the provision of a free telephone service.
Commissioner, in Andalusia alone, fishermen have made 800 visits and 1 500 enquires.
We are not asking for more money. We are asking for a better regulation so that the money allocated can be used efficiently for the purpose for which it was intended.
Mr President, it is with indignation and sorrow that I rise to speak on the proclaimed death of an industry - the fishing industry - which has been and should continue to be of economic importance to my country.
The Community Fisheries Agreement with Morocco expired on 30 November 1999.
Portugal neighbours that country, has obvious maritime connections, and a considerable part of its fishing fleet was directly involved in the fishing activities covered by this agreement.
Portuguese and Spanish fishermen have been hard hit by the non-renewal of the agreement because in many cases they have been unable to fish, which means that they have been unable to work.
I do not wish to return to the political assessment we made at the time of the failure headed by Commissioner Franz Fischler, who has today completely ignored the Portuguese fishermen.
What I wish to emphasise is the inaction and the lack of diligence at the time I have referred to, to which we can add the ineptitude of the way in which the measures of support for the ship-owners and fishermen affected were drawn up.
These people have been denied the right to fish and to work, and although they have been compensated with support measures for fleet conversion and for individual premiums, they have come up against Community legislation that is quite inflexible, inappropriate and whose implementation involves difficulties that are almost impossible to resolve.
It is regrettable that legislation should have been drafted in the aim of resolving situations such as this one but, instead, has further complicated the lives of the fishermen affected.
The lack of flexibility of the 2001 Regulation and the various administrative difficulties concerning the deadlines set for implementation have prevented or could invalidate access by fishermen to the exceptional support actions that have been planned, particularly to socioeconomic measures, the allocation of which turns on requirements that their beneficiaries cannot meet.
It has, therefore, become crucial for the Commission to set things right and what is needed urgently is a proposal for an amendment to the Regulation in order to resolve the implementing problems that have arisen, particularly a change to the allocation requirements for the premium due to the fishermen.
In fact, making the allocation of the individual premium of EUR 12 000 to anyone who is not a shipowner, but merely an employee, dependent on scrapping vessels amounts to taking away with one hand what is given with the other.
I shall conclude, Mr President, Commissioner, in the hope that this situation is duly corrected and that the Commission rapidly submits its proposal in the aim of effectively correcting the injustices created following the expiry of the Fisheries Agreement between the Community and Morocco.
Mr President, Commissioner, we can now make an evaluation of the implementation of these measures.
I think two of these are extremely relevant.
The first, and perhaps the most important - to which various Members have already referred - is the excessive rigidity with regard to the payment conditions for aid of EUR 12 000 to crew members.
As we know, in order for these people to receive the money, the vessels on which they worked must have been scrapped or integrated into joint ventures.
And yet the Commissioner said that the Commission shared the view that if the vessels have not been scrapped or integrated into joint ventures it is because they are fishing elsewhere and the crew members are therefore employed.
This is an erroneous assumption, however, because although in some cases shipowners do actually manage to send their vessels to fish in other fishing grounds, they are only able to make a partial profit, or to provide a partial alternative to what they had previously in the Moroccan fishing grounds.
In other cases, the shipowners themselves are waiting for an alternative for the future.
Whereas they are waiting or whereas they have partial alternatives, the crew members or fishermen of the vessels that previously fished in Morocco are now unemployed and inactive.
This is why this situation must be reviewed as a matter of urgency and why crew members, who are entirely blameless in the matter, should not be sacrificed.
The second element of rigidity concerns the fact that, at the time the agreement with Morocco lapsed, some shipowners were building vessels to fish in that country's waters.
As the agreement lapsed, these shipowners had to convert these vessels and refit them for other fishing grounds.
This refit of the vessels entailed increased costs, which were borne by the shipowners.
I think it would be fair, under the current regulation or under any other, for Community co-financing to be provided to cover this rise in shipowners' costs.
I shall finish by saying, as other Members have done, that these matters must be resolved.
They will not cost any more money; what is needed in order to resolve these problems is for flexibility to be shown.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to congratulate the Committee on Fisheries and most particularly its chairman, our esteemed fellow Member Struan Stevensen, on the aptness of this debate, because this is a debate on a matter that was selected in our Committee on Budgetary Control - as the Commissioner, in fact, is well aware - as the most important issue, the issue of budget underutilisation, which in 2001 totalled more than EUR 15 billion.
I must also say that before I came to this debate today I looked at the latest data on the utilisation of this budget line, with which the Commission regularly provides us, and I discovered that, apart from initial advance payments, no interim payments have yet been recorded.
This is the state of affairs after the programme has been in action for more than a year!
I also think that this piece of data, more than any other, is extremely significant with regard to the difficulties that the programme is facing in getting off the ground.
And as our colleagues explained to us so brilliantly, especially Mrs MiguÃ©lez DÃ­az, the issue is not the need to implement the programme.
This need does exist, but the problem is that it is not given due consideration in the blueprint for the regulation, which is too cumbersome and was not drawn up with the reality of the situation in mind.
I therefore call on the Commissioner to take due account of what our fellow Members have said, which I think is extraordinarily appropriate.
We would find it extremely regrettable if we were to face yet another blatant case of budgetary underutilisation, of the inability of the European institutions to respond to a real need.
I therefore call on the Commissioner to review this problem as thoroughly as possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me clarify matters very briefly.
Firstly, there have to date been no complaints or problems relating to the flow of funds in Portugal, where full use has been made of the money available; nor has the Portuguese Government had any complaint to make to us about anything not working.
Secondly, it is true that we have been paying in instalments so far, but the reason why the final instalment has not been paid is that we have not so far received a request for payment from either Spain or Portugal.
We can act only when the appropriate applications have been made, and so the Commission is perhaps the wrong body to which to address these complaints.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0027/2003) by Mr Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community participation in a research and development programme aimed at developing new clinical interventions to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through a long term partnership between Europe and the developing countries, undertaken by a number of Member States and Norway (COM(2002) 474 - C5-0392/2002 - 2002/0211(COD))
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2001, 14 EU Member States and Norway took the initiative of combining their research and clinical intervention efforts in the fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries under the EDCTP programme.
The aim of this research programme is to speed up the development and evaluation of new vaccines and drugs through a partnership between Europe and some fifteen developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Commission believes that it is in the Community's interest to be associated with an initiative of this kind, particularly against the background of creating the European Research Area.
It proposes to do this by applying Article 169 of the Treaty, under which the Community may, in implementing the framework programme, participate in research programmes undertaken by several Member States.
The Commission's specific proposal is to provide for a financial contribution of EUR 200 million from EU funds, which is earmarked in the Sixth Framework Research and Development Programme.
I would like to highlight the fact that this is a new departure in institutional terms, as this will be the first time Article 169 of the Treaty has actually been used.
Setting up the programme of clinical trials, the EDCTP programme, is an example of putting the European Research Area into practice.
This will provide real added value for Europe and for developing countries, and I would like to illustrate a few aspects of this.
This programme will enable us to integrate national and Community efforts by networking and pooling activities which up to now have been disparate and uncoordinated.
The platform to be created should make it possible to transfer research results more rapidly so as to assist clinical development in developing countries, and I wish to emphasise that this will involve those countries' full participation.
It will enhance the impact of public investment by means of a more coherent and targeted approach.
It will enable us to assemble a critical mass of expertise and resources needed to carry out large-scale clinical trials by optimising the use of European research results, particularly those of public research.
It will increase clinical development capacity in developing countries in terms of infrastructure and training.
The EDCTP represents a new approach which will bring industry and the public sector together in risk sharing and developing new kinds of partnership which are urgently needed to combat the disastrous effects of these diseases.
Industry has a key role to play in all the activities under the EDCTP programme.
The programme will finance research and development products for which industry can not expect any return on its investment.
Public financing will make research more attractive to industry, without taking industry's place.
The creation of new solid and effective public/private partnerships is a vital condition for the success of the programme.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the history of European research, we are in a position to adopt an ambitious programme which brings together the Member States' research activities and establishes a genuine partnership between Europe and Africa for clinical trials, a partnership which I hope will receive your support and thus get under way as quickly as possible.
Let us seize this opportunity today and provide ourselves with the means to take full advantage of this first opportunity.
We will earn the gratitude of researchers in Africa and Europe, and above all the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa, on whom these terrible diseases are taking a heavy toll.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when many people are rightly condemning a war that has already killed hundreds of people, I would like to start my speech this morning with some equally appalling figures.
Over 40 million people are now carrying the HIV virus, 36 million of them in developing countries and 28 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone.
Malaria, a disease that reappeared in the 1970s, kills around one million people a year.
Lastly, there are now 8 million cases of tuberculosis, with 2 million deaths a year, 1.9 million of those in countries of the South.
These three terrible diseases, which are incidentally by no means the only ones to be decimating the populations of poor countries, militate against the development of the countries affected and keep them in a state of poverty which, in turn, prevents them from setting up a health system worthy of the name.
Humanity must break this vicious and fatal circle if it wishes to survive.
It was with these appalling facts in mind - and in their hearts - that the Commission, Commissioner Busquin, the European Parliament and the Council agreed upon and drew up a programme of EUR 600 million under the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development, for which I was appointed general rapporteur.
This involves putting in place a new instrument under Article 169 - and this is a first, as the Commissioner has reminded us - with the financial participation of several Member States, Norway, the Commission, and, we hope, the private sector.
I am delighted, and proud, to have been appointed rapporteur and I wish to sincerely thank my colleagues in my new group for entrusting me with this new task, and also to thank all the other Members who gave me their help, not to mention the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and my assistant.
From the outset, we worked collectively and diligently. This House, which received the proposal from the Commission on 28 August 2002, acted swiftly and the ITRE Committee discussed it on three occasions, on 7 October, 11 November and 2 December 2002, before voting on this report and its amendments on 23 January 2003, that is to say within six months, taking into account the opinions of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, represented by Mrs SandbÃŠk, in accordance with the enhanced Hughes procedure, of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, represented by Mrs Evans, and of the Committee on Budgets, represented by Mr Hudghton.
Following those votes, a trialogue meeting was held with the Commission and the Greek Presidency in Strasbourg on 11 February.
I therefore worked quickly, stressing the importance of a North-South partnership and focussing our action on clinical trials and on the reception structures that needed to be built up in the countries of the South, and in particular in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
It was important to avoid over-extending the scope of the programme and the consequent risk of lessening its impact.
We need to heed the first victims of these terrible diseases and the people who are helping them to fight them.
We need to develop new products adapted to the needs of the populations of these countries and to take them into account when we define priorities.
Lastly, and above all, we need to act quickly.
At the trialogue meeting on 11 February 2003, we called on the Council to add a reference to other infectious diseases in a new recital.
We called for provisions on easy access to these new products.
We also called for the involvement of the NGOs and of the WHO, and, lastly, some Members called for more sustained appeals to be made to the private sector.
I immediately went on to thank and recognise the role of the Greek Presidency, the Council and the Commission, and my fellow Members were satisfied with the extent to which our requests were taken on board by the Council.
We accordingly drafted compromise amendments, which of course involved everyone making certain concessions, so as to come to an overall agreement at first reading.
I therefore invite you to support those amendments today, even though I recognise that some points are unsatisfactory, and I have certain reservations myself.
But we need to make decisions quickly if we are going to act quickly.
Every day that passes thousands of men, women and children die of these diseases.
Yes, we need to act quickly and to do everything to make this programme a success, so that it can serve as an example and open up the way to other programmes of the same type for other diseases also associated with poverty. Those diseases may be less well known and perhaps of less interest to the media, but they are just as terrible and just as destructive of lives and consequently of societies.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Caudron, the general rapporteur, for his work on this very important report.
It sets up a new fund for a new project, but it is designed to be tied together with the existing work which is already going on in the participating Member States and Norway as regards research into these diseases.
The statistics are quite horrifying - 90% of the world's HIV virus carriers live in developing countries and 95% of TB sufferers are in developing countries.
So clearly, a significant amount of work is required to be done to tackle these problems.
The Committee on Budgets - without dissent - approved the proposed EUR 200 million contribution from the EU which, of course, is in addition to the EUR 60 million which the EU has pledged to the global health fund.
The global health fund, of course, is not available for research.
It is important that any new work - or the consolidation and coordination of existing work - in the field of research into these diseases must be focused upon the needs and conditions existing in developing countries.
That is the idea behind the proposal.
I am glad to see that Parliament, at various stages, has spelled out how this project could and should be managed and how the progress can and will - I hope - be reported.
If we have to apply a total of EUR 600 million as this project envisages - EUR 200 million from the EU, EUR 200 million from existing Member State funds and, hopefully, EUR 200 million from other donors and industry - then it is important that it be spent wisely and successfully.
I would hope that since a significant proportion of that is public funding - taxpayer's money - the ownership of new procedures can remain with the public sector and be made available cheaply to the people who really need it most.
Mr President, exceptionally I will speak in English because at the end of my speech I am going to ask Mr Busquin a question which I want to be sure he understands and I expect a very clear answer.
First, I want to say that this programme is very laudable and commendable.
It is a highly-needed initiative which deserves a lot of attention and support.
To enhance the impact of the European contribution, we must improve what is already being done, and this must entail more coordination and consultation.
Material and non-material investment in the control of the major communicable diseases in poverty-ridden countries must be increased and, most importantly, new tools to prevent and combat the three diseases are needed here and now.
Affordable, effective, accessible and safe vaccines, drugs and microbicides are urgently required to prevent or ameliorate malaria, HIV and tuberculosis.
It is imperative to ensure that the beneficiaries, the end-users of these new tools, are fully involved in their clinical evaluation and application.
It is therefore heartening that the Commission's proposal for a European Developing Countries Clinical Trials programme (EDCTP) addresses the important issue of human capacity development in the societies most affected by the three diseases.
It is, however, very disheartening that the Commission, after two years, has still not provided any substantial information about the Member States' common activity, the very activity which forms the basis for mobilising Article 169.
As far as I know, the European Economic Interest Group is currently a structure which lacks defined programmatic content.
So here is my question: can the Commission provide me with any examples of how Member States have so far collaborated and jointly implemented activities within the EDCTP concept?
Have any of the Member States so far committed - and I mean committed and not identified, because I know that all the Member States have identified programmes - to any of the identified programmes so far?
We need to have credible examples of Member States' joint achievements in order to avoid the sustainability of the initiative coming into question, and a proposal being seen as merely wishful thinking.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Caudron on his work.
I very much welcome this initiative, which could be a real step forward in the battle against HIV/Aids, malaria and TB in the developing countries.
As has already been said, it is a rapidly growing problem, usually affecting the poorest and most vulnerable in society who have less access to health care and education - many of whom are women.
In fact, they make up two thirds of the world's poor and bear the main burden of poverty.
Therefore, the role of women as sufferers, main carers, educators and as active members of communities in the developing countries is key to finding the right solutions.
If we look at HIV/Aids, by the year 2000, 9 million women and 4.3 million children had died of Aids, and these figures are going up.
In sub-Saharan Africa, 55% of HIV infected adults are women.
Women face greater danger of HIV infection for biological and social reasons, because of lack of control of their sexual health and lack of access to preventative information.
So the focus of the opinion of the Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities Committee was on ensuring that drugs and treatment are affordable, that people in developing countries are central to the programmes and that the products developed and used in trials are suitable for local use.
Simple practical matters such as how to store drugs safely and how to administer or take drugs are crucial.
That is why grass-roots groups such as women's organisations must be fully involved in developing programmes and ensuring that training is given to health care providers in the use of products - whether in the home, the community or in institutions.
Training, capacity-building and infrastructure must be developed to enable these clinical trials to be carried out effectively and to ensure the long-term success of this programme.
Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for the excellent results attained on a programme which, rhetoric apart, can truly be defined as a real challenge for civilisation so to speak, equality between the northern and southern hemispheres.
Moreover, the best aspect of this work is that the Commission's proposal is an unprecedented innovation in that, although Article 169 is an excellent formulation, it is being applied in practice for the first time, and, by taking this line, we are creating a genuine, tangible partnership to address a real problem concerning the northern and southern hemispheres.
This initiative is so astute that it should be repeated in both the research sector and other key areas of the Union's foreign relations.
Since I agree with the position set out by the rapporteur, I will make three very brief remarks.
Firstly, I think that it was a positive decision not to extend the programme to related diseases, not because they are less important, but because we should not disperse our resources and efforts.
Moreover, the results can be used to improve the treatment of other diseases and can form the basis of new research activities, thereby contributing to resolving other health issues related to the problems experienced by developing countries.
Secondly, regarding Amendment No 13 - involvement of the private sector - I believe that it is particularly important to involve the private sector in the programme because this will enable additional funds to be leveraged, encouraging businesses to invest more in diseases which affect developing countries.
In this connection, a debate on tax differentiation mechanisms could be an extremely interesting incentive.
The third point concerns the protection of intellectual property.
Involvement of the pharmaceutical industry is essential for the success of the programme.
We must have differentiated pricing for medicines sold in developing countries and, in my opinion, we need different labels as well to prevent fraud.
Mr President, the health crisis in developing countries is unprecedented.
Given the huge need for drugs, the lack of attention on the part of the pharmaceutical industry is astounding.
I particularly welcome the Commission's initiative to set up a platform for clinical trials.
It is an excellent idea to bring all the activities in the Member States and the developing countries together under one umbrella as far as possible.
Individual research activities are useful, but not necessarily useful enough.
Article 169 offers the perfect basis for joining forces; indeed, a united effort is exactly what the developing countries need - and also exactly what Europe itself needs.
Europe can make a difference in the world if it pulls together.
Europe can address the health crisis and social distress.
For this, public leadership is required, and today we see a glimmer of the public leadership that the EU should have.
I give Mr Caudron my sincere thanks for the energy with which he has handled this dossier.
I support his approach and wish to raise once more the three concerns I have spoken about before now.
Firstly, we have to see to it that industry is involved in this project. This is only possible if we set up a credible programme.
As it is, industry is bringing out few new products.
It is a good time to set up joint projects, therefore.
There must be a reasonable return on investment for industry, but the emphasis must be on the public interest, the development of affordable drugs.
We must not deceive ourselves that public research institutes can manage the task alone.
For this reason, we must not invest in bureaucracy, but in cooperation with the private sector, too.
Secondly, we must focus on developing specific products.
We all know that a great deal needs to be done in order to combat the health crisis, but it is not necessary to fund malaria nets out of this budget, useful though they are.
Thirdly, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are a good place to start.
These three diseases claim the most victims and are spreading with devastating effect.
There are, however, other diseases, such as sleeping sickness and river blindness, which have been neglected.
We should be concerned about a disease like leprosy rearing its head again.
New means are necessary to combat this old disease.
I ask that the Commissioner and the Commission continue to give due attention to this, too.
Commissioner Busquin, I welcome the fact that the health crisis is high on your political agenda, and I also thank you for the letter you recently sent to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
We support this clinical trials project wholeheartedly.
Europe certainly needs a flagship: a model of cooperation which bears fruit.
Making this fruit visible will enable this project to act as a stimulus for joining forces in other fields, too.
Europe is not doing the world justice if it does not work together, and it is not doing itself justice if it does not derive any inspiration from the cooperation in the field of clinical trials.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, combating poverty in the developing countries is the priority of the European Union's current policy.
HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are poverty-related diseases which are rampant in the developing countries.
It beggars belief that in some developing countries, for example, there is a shortage of teachers because half of the teaching workforce has AIDS.
It is high time that the European Union pays special attention to this problem, and so I join the previous speakers in welcoming the Commission's initiative to invoke Article 169 of the Treaty in order that the Sixth Framework Programme for Research can be used to develop new clinical interventions to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
By establishing networks and coordinating national and regional research programmes, the EU can make a sizeable contribution towards a more efficient policy on research into the development of methods for combating the three above-mentioned diseases.
Involving the developing countries themselves, through the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, enables the work to be much more purposeful and means that the research is brought closer to the people concerned.
I think that that last point, in particular, is extremely important.
In his excellent report, the rapporteur also dotted a few more i's and crossed a few more t's. I welcome that, but I should like to make a couple of short comments.
The research programmes should not just focus on the development of new drugs, but also on the question as to the simplest way to administer those drugs.
How often does one hear the complaint that, although patients in remote areas of developing countries can find their way to a health centre, when they get the drugs home, they stop taking the medication as soon as they feel better.
This results in the development of resistant forms of the disease, as has happened with malaria.
This is clearly counter-productive.
The second point to which I should like to draw attention is the synergy with other European programmes.
A large amount of money and high-quality research is required.
The Commission's proposal to set up the Erasmus Mundus programme will shortly be given the support of our Parliament.
Students from all over the world will then be invited to come and study in Europe.
I should like to ask that students from developing countries, in particular, be given a special chance to take part in this, because the developing countries need highly qualified researchers.
EUR 600 million has been allocated for the present proposal, and another 200 million should be coming from the private sector.
By helping the researchers, industry, too, can and must make its own considerable contribution.
Mr President, I would naturally like to add to the congratulations for the rapporteur - Mr Caudron - who has done excellent work on improving, where necessary, the Commission's proposal, which is also an extremely important proposal which initiates, in pilot form, what could be a new relationship between the European Union and developing countries on shared issues of world concern.
It has also given rise to proposals and debates in the other committees, as we have seen in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, through the rapporteur for the committee's opinion, Mrs Ulla Sandbaek, and her pertinent questions.
In fact, as Mr Caudron said, we are at a very special moment, a crucial moment, in terms of the relationship between the developed world and the developing world, because our main concern is to promote a kind of humanitarian relationship, a relationship which has connections with the suffering of the developing world, and therefore the European Union's main concern at the moment should be to stop the horrendous war taking place in Iraq which is obscene and brings shame on the West.
It is a form of cooperation and, together with this request which the European Union should make, programmes such as the one we are discussing are examples of how much the old Europe, the European Union, can contribute to a world which is different from the one proposed in other places.
I would like to stress the significance of the proposal being made, because it represents going to the very heart of the problem of these three great diseases which successive reports by the WTO have shown to be the most significant, causing death and suffering throughout the world.
I would also like to say that the Horwitz circle, the circle of poverty and illness, cannot only be attacked on one front, and that, while it is true that it is necessary to increase the economic capacity of all countries in order to reduce diseases, it is also the case that we must deal with specific issues which will allow for research, facilitate access to medicines, achieve a different kind of cooperation and also call into question, sometimes, aspects such as intellectual property.
Because those of us who are researchers, doctors and university professors know that the knowledge we have today is not just due to our own efforts, but is an inheritance from centuries of effort on the part of human intelligence aimed at improving the conditions of mankind and is not therefore the exclusive property of an industry, but is part of a common inheritance.
It is therefore important that programmes such as these serve to initiate new stages in support relationships, and because of this inheritance I believe we have an historic debt to Sub-Saharan Africa stemming from the earlier era of colonialism.
Mr President, first of all I very much wish to congratulate GÃ©rard Caudron on his report concerning the first application of Article 169 of the Treaty to the Sixth Framework Research and Development Programme.
His work has certainly fostered excellent cooperation between us and has facilitated the success of this excellent proposal.
This is due to the courageous initiative taken by Commissioner Busquin, and involves allocating a total of EUR 600 million to large-scale research with the objective of combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis under the EDCTP programme.
Because of the importance of that objective and the means being implemented to achieve it, it is vital for us to stress that basic ethical standards need to be respected in relation to this research. We equally need to emphasise that the results of that research should be available for use in the general interest, and that we need to cooperate with developing countries and encourage scientific and technical development in those countries.
The ethical principles in question are those set out in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and those defined in the World Medical Association's Helsinki Declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.
The European and Developing countries Clinical Trials Partnership must apply the good clinical practice defined in Directive 2001/20/EC on the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use in the European Union.
The EDCTP programme should encourage the training of specialists and capacity building in developing countries, step up technology transfer to those countries and mobilise additional resources for the fight against these diseases.
The Community will ensure that these strategic decisions and the implementation of programmes are in line with the objective of placing on the market products that are at the same time effective, accessible at the lowest possible price and easy to use, and adapted to the specific conditions prevailing in developing countries.
These decisions should be based on the active participation of stakeholders from the developing countries, scientific experts from the North and the South, representatives of patient groups, and the NGOs and the WHO.
Finally, our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance hopes that the results obtained through this programme will be considered a public good, and will therefore not be subject to intellectual property rules such as those defined in the TRIPS agreements, so as to guarantee developing countries access to the treatments resulting from this research at the lowest possible price.
Mr President, there are currently over 40 million people in the world who are suffering from AIDS.
For the continent of Africa this pandemic is already amplifying the impact of famine which is now threatening so many countries in Africa itself.
Only USD 3 billion a year is being spent globally in trying to halt the spread of AIDS.
This figure must increase to at least USD 10 billion a year if we are to combat the disease effectively.
We have the technology and the treatments available to combat diseases such as AIDS.
However, governments in the developing countries cannot afford to pay the high prices for the medicines needed to combat the disease.
Developing countries must be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people under their own licensing terms.
This can only be achieved if agreement can be reached by member countries of the World Trade Organisation.
The European Union must remain at the forefront in ensuring that the American Government comes to an agreement which will guarantee the distribution of drugs which, in developing countries, could tackle, head on, diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
Time is of the essence in this regard, as the more we delay the more lives are lost.
Mr President, the research programme on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis is necessary because there is relatively little medical research into poverty-related diseases.
The programme is also useful, for example, on account of the close correlation between the scourge of AIDS and the hunger problem.
AIDS weakens the young adults, a group which traditionally determines the degree to which a people is able to withstand famine.
In addition, existing efforts must not be replaced, but rather stepped up.
I should like to ask that the Council and the Commission take pains to ensure that this programme provides a stimulus for Member States and research institutes.
By way of conclusion, there are two aspects that are often neglected with regard to the combating of AIDS.
In a proactive approach, marital fidelity and celibacy are essential elements to be stressed when giving information.
Encouraging results can be seen in this regard in a number of African countries.
I would therefore urge Commissioner Busquin to bring this to the notice of his colleague Mr Nielson once more.
The Creator who gives us the means to help others considerably also gives us commandments with a beneficial effect.
Mr President, I hope that we will soon adopt the Caudron report with a substantial majority at first reading.
The rapporteur has already cited the figures.
Millions of people in developing countries are dying of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis every year.
They are poverty diseases, as has also already been said.
These diseases account for a large proportion of serious illness, but up to now have had only a small research budget.
The help that has been offered up to now has been predominantly therapeutic, and also in the form of information regarding causes and prevention options.
What is special about the project that we are now discussing is that it has the potential to give an impetus to the development of new technologies and new safe, effective drugs for combating these diseases.
The research taking place in this field in the European Union is very fragmented, and very few networks have been established, which has resulted in organisational and economic obstacles to large-scale research and trials.
It is right, therefore, that this proposal makes use of Article 169 of the Treaty, which indeed enables the participation of the European Union in joint research and development programmes.
As has already been said, this is a first, and in my view the experiment is definitely worth the while.
I hope that it will constitute a good start to more intensive cooperation in many fields within the EU.
A very important criterion for our group was that the countries where these diseases are widespread be involved intensively in the setting up, and participate fully in the implementation, of the programme from the outset, and that a large number of the trials take place on site there.
Another point important to our group was that the programme should make a contribution towards capacity-building in the developing countries and ensuring the availability of good, affordable drugs in those countries.
In addition, we, too, value the involvement of the private sector.
By way of conclusion, I am of course proud that the Netherlands has managed to qualify to be allocated a seat of the executive office of the EDCTP.
The Netherlands will devote maximum efforts to making this project a success.
Mr President, congratulations to Mr Busquin and Mr GÃ©rard Caudron.
GÃ©rard has worked quickly but he has not been sloppy or careless.
We have been able to put across important points despite working quickly.
This is innovation.
This is a new use of Article 169 which will lead to considerable leverage, with EUR 200 million from the EU plus EUR 200 million from Member States and we hope for at least that much from industry.
In this area the market has failed, as it so often does, and there has been, until now, a certain lack of public leadership, with a particular bottleneck in the clinical trials aspect of finding new products.
We have heard that it is the biggest killer, that 5 million people die a year, 95% of them in poor countries.
Yesterday, we grieved publicly for the victims of the irresponsible and immoral war in Iraq by wearing black armbands.
We should be wearing them every day for the victims of these killer diseases.
There is, of course, a multi-pronged attack.
This point has been made by other speakers.
Other actions are needed but this particular action is research.
It is for clinical trials which will lead to the development of new products, in particular a new vaccine for tuberculosis, much better diagnostic tools, and combined medicines for HIV/AIDS which are easier to take and have fewer side effects.
That is what we want at the end.
That will be the outcome of these clinical trials.
We have made the point that they must be targeted.
Despite the complexity of the problem let us keep in mind the whole time what we want at the end.
We must strengthen the clinical research capacities in developing countries.
One of the tragedies of our planet is the waste of human intelligence and creativity in countries which have been politically discriminatory or else riven by poverty.
We must encourage that intelligence and creativity by having infrastructure, training and everything else.
Everything must be anchored in the developing countries with an understanding that, should we find these things, should we find a better vaccine for tuberculosis, better drugs for HIV/AIDS and better diagnostic tests, they will be available to those that need them.
It would be the greatest obscenity to do this work, discover the products and then find that those who need them cannot use them.
I am very pleased that has been emphasised and I thank GÃ©rard Caudron very much for his work as well as, of course, Commissioner Busquin.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating everyone who has been involved in this work: Mr Caudron, Mrs SandbÃŠk, the Commission and the Council, for this is a crucial action programme.
We have promised the developing countries that we shall eradicate poverty there, something that will not be possible if we do not overcome diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.
I think that, now that it has been debated in Parliament, the proposal is better than it appears, for the Commission's proposal gave far too much emphasis to the purely medical aspects.
Like other speakers in the debate, I believe however that success depends crucially upon preventive work and efforts made before the disease has broken out.
The issue of access and prices is of course incredibly important.
What we must not forget is that treatment with what are known as retardant medicines is, however, an extremely complicated form of medication that also requires a functioning medical and health care system.
Finally, I want to put the same question that Mrs SandbÃŠk put to the Commission: has any work already been begun?
What have the Member States done?
What, in practical terms, has the Commission done?
Noble intentions and fine words on paper are no longer enough. What, instead, is required without delay is practical action.
Mr President, there are occasions when words are meaningless and when failure to act undermines the credibility of what we say.
Let us hope that this is not another such occasion.
If politics is the art of the possible let us now challenge ourselves to do better, to respond in a more positive and caring way to the helpless pleas of those destined to die of AIDS, disease and hunger.
Let us give meaningful expression to Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which is the right to life.
To me it sounds incredible that we can find billions to inflict the torture of war on humanity and still not have the resources to address the basic human needs of those living in the depths of poverty and despair.
Is politics really the art of the possible or have we lost sight of the core values of the society that we purport to represent?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are a death sentence for those affected, most especially in the poor and the poorest countries of this world, but there is no longer any reason why anyone should have to die from malaria or tuberculosis.
These and other infectious diseases can be cured by the use of effective medicines.
Through the research programme, the European Union is contributing financially to the fight against these diseases and we can hope that this will give people suffering from AIDS in the developing countries a chance of getting effective and affordable medicines for their terrible affliction.
The Committee on Budgets has given this report a unanimous welcome.
We should, however, be clear that the provision of funding for the research programme will not in itself solve the problems.
The misery of poverty, underdevelopment, the lack of education and political lack of interest encourage the spread of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
This is where everyone in positions of responsibility must increase their commitment.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us today is a crucial one.
Not only are tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria a cause of suffering for many, many people, they have also became real obstacles to the economic, social and cultural development of entire regions of our planet. Furthermore, they undermine the other initiatives we are taking to create a fairer world.
It is therefore vital that the initiative we are considering today, which aims to combat these scourges of poverty by injecting considerable sums of money - over EUR 800 million - into the development of new drugs, should be approved at first reading and implemented as soon as possible, because the situation is urgent.
The lives of 5 million people a year are at stake.
We have every right to be proud of this important initiative, because it is a model research programme to be jointly undertaken by the European Union, the Member States and associated countries, and we have the right to hope that it will inspire other actions so that similar attention is focussed on other diseases that are taking a heavy toll on the poorest people on our planet.
This initiative is, however, also a model for the new philosophy needed for North-South relations - relations which do not involve exploitation, domination or paternalistic aid, but rather relations based on partnerships with a view to promoting the technological independence and development of the countries concerned, and their active participation in the implementation and coordination of the programme.
By the same token we should also be considering the price of patented drugs, and the development of public health services in developing countries.
I of course have in mind GATS and TRIPS, where the concept of partnership has been swept aside in favour of ideas about intellectual property and liberalisation.
I wish to plead once again for cooperation and the development of synergies within the Commission.
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Busquin for having given us, through the Sixth Framework Programme, the resources to develop this programme, and I would also like to thank Mr Caudron once again for the quality of his work.
I would also like to say that I believe that we are just at the beginning of a long haul.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's study, which supports this proposal, is both terrifying and encouraging.
It is terrifying because it presents a tragic view of the health situation in countries where the three major scourges of this century which we are discussing are concentrated: AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis claim more than five million victims every year. AIDS is the most recent scourge with, however, 90% of cases found mainly in developing countries and 70% in Sub-Saharan Africa: there are more than 40 million infected people.
Malaria reappeared in the 1970s and claims one million victims each year. Tuberculosis, which has been eradicated from western countries, kills two million people each year, perhaps also, as with malaria, owing to the so-called developed countries irresponsibly lowering their guard.
It is encouraging because of the figures on the new effort being made by all the Member States, which have appropriated EUR 600 million for research in addition to the 100 million stipulated by the Fifth Framework Programme.
It is now important that this programme reaches the recipients directly, overcoming the usual problem of the extremely high cost of medicines, especially for countries which do not have the necessary budgets and which need considerable assistance.
I would therefore reiterate a proposal which has already been put forward in order to cut these costs: the abolition of all royalties for medicines, making, if possible, not just the European Union pharmaceutical companies assume their responsibilities but those all over the world.
In conclusion, it is important for our political activity not to be yet again an end in itself, restricted just to debate in this Chamber: for once, when the Member States and other countries, in conjunction, intend to take real action, let us give an example of pragmatism and responsibility.
Certainly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights matters more than market rules.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur for his interesting stories, but we will let him stay in his own little world.
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are diseases connected with poverty, and in fact, as has here been said, five million people a year die of them, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
It is a vicious circle.
Poverty is a barrier to the development of a viable system of medical treatment, while at the same time the diseases prevent development and overcoming poverty.
We need swift action, adequate resources and a comprehensive system of cooperation to break this vicious circle.
A new kind of cooperation is needed.
When would we get 300 000 people to attack disease in the poor countries?
Instead of bullets we should be using medicine.
This project of ours is unparalleled in terms of its objectives and scope, and all the better for that.
A lack of cooperation and a lack of clinical trial facilities and trained staff in the developing countries have been a barrier to investment up till now.
We need to obtain a critical mass by combining expertise with resources.
We also need a situation where no one makes money from medicines, which are literally a matter of life and death, destined for poor countries.
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria betray the presence of a crisis in society, as they are responsible for the deaths of so many.
My question to the Commission is this: could we in the Union develop teams responsible for social crisis management, for example groups of one hundred thousand people consisting of doctors, nurses, engineers and teachers?
Might this not be what we in the European Union need to help others?
Mr President, I too welcome with great satisfaction the measure being debated today, precisely because it satisfies a series of requirements which are known, I see, to all the MEPs who have decided to discuss it in the Chamber this morning.
The first ground for satisfaction is the fact that this report marks a return to research in sectors such as the pharmaceutical sector, where Europe does too little.
In my opinion, the Sixth Framework Programme and the resources which have been made available under this programme bear witness to Europe's desire to commit substantial resources to research in this sector, which not only has economic value but social and political value too.
It is not by chance that holding patents and having the possibility to produce medicines and being able to influence their cost, particularly in developing countries, means being able, on the one hand, to press ahead with a development policy for us, and on the other, an aid policy for developing countries.
Many of the Members have stressed how this research, which proposes to help combat diseases by increasing knowledge in order to produce new drugs and to improve existing ones, combines with other policies which we, as Europe, must press ahead with in the education and employment sectors, because education, employment and health are the only factors which can contribute to the achievement of democracy in those countries which see Europe as an increasingly firm point of reference.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Caudron.
I believe that this report is the result of his excellent work carried out as rapporteur on the Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development, to which, moreover, I contributed as draftsman for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at its initial stage.
The partnership which we are establishing by applying Article 169, is an innovation, apparently without precedent, and we therefore warmly welcome it: it is a genuine, tangible contribution to the fight against poverty diseases, a fight in which the European Union has shouldered its responsibilities by taking up its position on the front line, as the leading world donor.
The allocated budget - EUR 600 million - is in addition to the series of initiatives implemented since Durban which aim to strengthen and make more effective the fight against these diseases which chiefly affect developing countries: I will mention only the Global Fund, set up at the Genoa G8 summit, and the European Community action programme.
This continuity is certainly a very positive signal, but we increasingly need to do more: five people die of AIDS in Africa every minute; in 2001 malaria and tuberculosis killed one million and two million victims respectively; in short, these three diseases are, in fact, holding back the development of the affected countries and are playing their part in keeping them in poverty.
This is why it is necessary, or rather essential, to invest and concentrate all the efforts necessary to obtain a systematic response from the whole of the international community.
This coordinated cooperation between the Member States, the European Union and the private sector, which is using a new, coordinated approach for a long-term Community strategy in the fight against these three diseases, has the considerable merit of actively involving the developing countries themselves, enabling real improvements to be made.
Therefore, in order for this involvement to be effective and efficient, it is essential that it takes place with the maximum transparency, so that the efforts and resources deployed are tangible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you very sincerely for your contributions.
As the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, said at the beginning of his speech, I believe that we are facing a challenge where time is of the essence.
That is why the will of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to work together in an attempt to coordinate their efforts as swiftly as possible is, as I see it, key for the success of this action, which although it will not of course solve all the problems, will nevertheless make Europe's efforts in the field of research and development more effective.
What sets this programme apart is that it involves the participation of partners from Africa, where the programme is to be implemented.
Turning to your various contributions, I think that the compromise amendments that you will have to vote on shortly very much reflect the concerns and aspirations expressed by you individually.
It is clear, as I have already said, that this project will not be able to solve every problem, but it is a step forward that should provide us with a model for other actions in the future.
But first of all we need to put this programme into practice.
It is for that reason that I wish to say, on behalf of the Commission, that we are able to accept all 36 compromise amendments, which reflect the spirit of the Commission's original proposal whilst improving and enriching it.
I would like to emphasise once again the quality of Parliament's work and of the support the Commission has received.
We have not only had support, our proposal has also been strengthened and given a higher profile.
I regard that higher profile as being very important, because this is a new departure for us.
So it is now up to the Member States to demonstrate the same determination and will, which is always a problem when we try something new.
The programme itself marks a turning point.
I would also like to mention, as some of you raised this point, that the programme forms part of the Commission's programme of action in a broader sense.
In dealing with AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis we are of course entering the sphere of research, but development, trade and other areas are also involved here.
So this is not an isolated initiative, we will be integrating the programme into the EU's overall strategy in this area.
By the same token, I would like to say that the joint programme, which is the stage we are embarking on now, is being set up on the basis of the programmes of each individual Member State.
We already have a good deal of knowledge about those programmes, Mrs SandbÃŠk, and we therefore know that there is some duplication of effort.
That is to be expected, but it demonstrates that we are not as efficient as we might be.
So it is now up to us to put that right, in conjunction with the Member States.
What is more, we require a legal basis to apply Article 169 of the Treaty.
The Commission will therefore have to wait for the tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament to be concluded before it can get the Member States to act without further delay to implement this joint programme.
We will only make our financial contribution once the joint programme is under way.
Having said that, Mrs SandbÃŠk, let me reply to your specific question. Concrete actions are now under way, particularly in the area of anti-malarial drugs.
Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain have already mounted operations with three clinical sites in Africa.
A second very concrete example is that of the health school in Vienna, which trains African researchers in the methodology of clinical trials.
So these are some examples of this type of activity.
I would like to finish by very warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and his shadow rapporteurs, Mr NisticÃ², Mr PiÃ©trasanta, Mrs Corbey and Mrs Flesch, and all the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, including its chairman, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza.
I also of course wish to thank the other committees for their contributions.
I have in mind the Committee on Development and Cooperation and its draftsman, Mrs SandbÃŠk, and the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
I also want to comment on the extent to which cooperation between the successive presidencies, that is the Danish and Greek Presidencies, has contributed to progress towards an optimal solution acceptable to everyone. Mr Caudron has been in a very good position to observe this.
I therefore wish to thank the Danish and Greek Presidencies.
Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have all gained a sense of the scale of the tragedy that these diseases represent for developing countries, and particularly for Africa.
We therefore hope that this experiment will yield a positive outcome and that it will open the way for similar initiatives on diseases that are neglected at present. That is by way of response to a number of questions.
I believe that this first example will enable us to demonstrate that by virtue of initiatives carried out under Article 169, we now have an additional instrument that will allow us to carry out even more effective actions at European level.
We should look at the possibilities which that prospect opens up.
In any case, I wish to thank Parliament for its very effective and helpful contribution.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11 a.m. today.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0048/2003) by Diemut R. Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission Green Paper on criminal-law protection of the financial interests of the Community and the establishment of a European Prosecutor (COM(2001) 715 - C5-0157/2002 - 2002/2065(COS)).
Mr President, in December 2001 the Commission adopted its Green Paper on the criminal-law protection of the financial interests of the Community and the establishment of a European Prosecutor.
This provoked a broad debate among academics and practitioners beyond legal circles.
That was also its intention and I would like to thank the Commission for it.
The European Parliament, too, got involved in the debate.
Even before the Green Paper appeared, it called in several resolutions for better protection for EU finances through the establishment of a European prosecutor for financial matters, who would deal with the growing number of cases of cross-border crime affecting the EU budget.
The time is ripe.
The EU is on the threshold of enlargement, with ten new Member States acceding in the coming year.
The Community budget will continue to grow, administration of European money will become even more complex.
At the same time, cross-border crime will increase as modern technology makes it increasingly professional.
The territorial fragmentation of criminal law systems and the difficulties in judicial cooperation between Member States are the reason why criminals are seldom caught and even more seldom convicted.
The statistics show that the EU budget loses as much as EUR 1 000 million every year to internationally active organised criminals.
It is possible that this money funds other criminal structures.
Cigarette smuggling is the best example.
European taxpayers' money is lost for actual EU purposes.
I repeat: lost, since even today we in Europe still do not have efficient structures for the prosecution of EU financial crime.
The Council has recognised the danger in so far as it anchored the protection of financial interests in the first pillar of the Treaty of Maastricht and enshrined cooperation with the Commission in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
With today's report from the Committee on Budgetary Control, Parliament joins the 72 opinions that the Commission has so far received from various quarters and considered concerning the Green Paper.
Please note that our report is an own-initiative report, not a legislative one.
We on the committee have taken time to make a thorough analysis of the subject of 'establishing a European Prosecutor'; we commissioned experts to make external studies and arranged a hearing with the national parliaments and representatives of civil society.
In this report, we are now putting forward options and calling on the Commission to make improvements, especially with regard to safeguarding basic rights and rights of defence, supervision of the European Public Prosecutor and his links with existing structures.
We want links with the existing structures of OLAF, Eurojust and Europol.
We want in that way to avoid duplication, but at the same time we want the Prosecutor to be an efficient instrument for the protection of EU finances at European level.
There are clear proposals as to how the future European Prosecutor could cooperate with the national authorities in the Member States.
The principle of subsidiarity is the maxim here.
All the questions of how the Public Prosecutor's Office should operate can then be settled by secondary law.
I would like to sincerely thank my colleagues from my committee, and also those from the Committees on Constitutional Affairs, Legal and Home Affairs and Petitions for their positive and constructive cooperation.
Their proposals have been incorporated into this report.
Our main concern is that an appropriate legal basis for the creation of this Public Prosecutor's Office should be laid down in the Treaty and that the Council should appoint this new organ with the assent of Parliament.
The revision of the treaties remains an essential prerequisite for this, because only a treaty reform can legitimise the proposal.
We call on the European Convention to provide for this legal basis for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to protect the EU's financial interests now so that it can be placed on the agenda for the 2004 intergovernmental conference.
As I said, the time is ripe.
We want the means to be created in the European Union and for the European Union to strengthen and secure the protection of the Community's financial interests before enlargement takes place.
We all want an area of freedom, security and justice, where a stop is put to fraud and corruption at the expense of the EU budget and therefore of the European taxpayer.
Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
(IT) Mr President, I agree with what the rapporteur said and I congratulate her on her report. The issue of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud is an example of the problems, sluggishness and inadequacy of European Union integration.
The scale and gravity of fraud prejudicial to Community financial interests is clear to all.
Just as clear is the ineffectiveness of the efforts to combat this type of crime, which goes largely unpunished.
The gravity of the situation was condemned by the European Parliament more than 12 years ago.
Years of careful research have led to the drafting of a specific, feasible proposal for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud, governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, with a corollary of criminal-law and procedural arrangements capable of fairly resolving the majority of issues raised by the need for a centralised criminal-law initiative and for criminal judgments reserved for national judges.
The legal basis for this institution was proposed by the Commission at the Nice intergovernmental conference which, unfortunately, here too, failed for want of a common desire on the part of the governments and a European perspective on the issues.
The launch of intergovernmental judicial cooperation under Eurojust has created more ambitious and less realistic expectations, while it has also created excuses for further delays.
The time for delays has passed: we must implement initiatives which ensure a uniform level of protection of citizens' fundamental rights in criminal-law proceedings and minimum rules for the admissibility of evidence, and the Convention on the Future of Europe must propose a suitable legal basis in the European Constitution which is sufficiently flexible to allow the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud, capable, in the future, of evolving within the context of Eurojust with wider objectives relating to the fight against cross-border crime.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, economic and financial crime significantly prejudice the financial interests of the European Union, to the tune of over EUR 1 billion each year, according to estimates.
Enlargement will certainly not improve this situation, as it will further fragment the European judicial area, increase the number of administrative bodies involved in the management of Community funds and accordingly increase the risk of fraud.
As we know, this fraud and crime are a long-standing concern of the European Parliament, and Article 280 of the Treaty of Amsterdam gave the Community power to take effective and equivalent measures in all the Member States.
I therefore fully support the Commission's Green Paper on the establishment of a European Prosecutor with the remit of defending the Community's financial interests, and I also wholeheartedly support Mrs Theato's report.
I also endorse the incorporation of a new Article 280a in the future constitutional treaty, an idea which was in fact rejected by the last intergovernmental conference, despite the support this House gave to the idea in 2000.
It is most definitely necessary to create a European Prosecutor, but we need to assure his or her democratic legitimacy by providing for the European Parliament to give its assent to his or her appointment. We also need stress the need for the European Prosecutor and his or her deputies to have a statute guaranteeing their total independence from parties to any trial and the European Union's Member States, bodies and institutions.
It is also essential to guarantee the uniformity of public prosecution throughout the European legal area by affirming the mandatory prosecution principle, and by imposing strict rules for the conditional dismissal of cases.
We also support the principle of a Community court responsible for preparing criminal cases, within the Court of Justice.
Lastly, it will of course also be important to guarantee better coordination, indeed the best coordination possible, between the European Prosecutor and the structures of OLAF, Eurojust and Europol.
As Mrs Theato has just emphasised, we have appealed to the Convention, and hope that it will take our views on board.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Theato.
Many thanks, Diemut, above all for your readiness to compromise.
I am glad that in the end a compromise was found between those who wanted to see a European Public Prosecutor close to the Commission and those who did not want a European Public Prosecutor at all.
The Theato report now makes quite clear that such a Public Prosecutor will only exist in connection with Eurojust, only as a position at Eurojust.
That makes sense because a European Public Prosecutor working separately would otherwise have to confront the same problems as national public prosecutors in cross-border prosecutions.
We will shortly have 25 national legal codes, 25 codes of criminal procedure, 25 legal systems and 21 languages in this enlarged European Union.
Such coordination would require an enormous new apparatus.
Alternatively, we could avoid duplication by simply relying on Eurojust.
That also means, however, that the actual charge must be brought before national courts by national public prosecutors.
That therefore means that a European Public Prosecutor merely prepares a case.
And it must also be made perfectly clear here that we are limiting the Public Prosecutor's powers to the protection of the European Union's financial interests.
We must therefore say a clear no to a general European Public Prosecutor for all serious cross-border crime, such as the Presidium of the Convention is currently proposing, because there is nothing to be gained by it.
In other areas, trials fail not out of lack of interest on the part of national public prosecutors, as is the case with the financial protection of the European Union, but mostly as a result of language barriers and legal problems.
We cannot harmonise everything in this Union, however.
We cannot, for example, harmonise criminal law, criminal procedure, the training of public prosecutors or the court system.
In these areas we can only coordinate.
That is why I would like to send a clear signal to the Convention again here: a Public Prosecutor to protect the financial interests of the European Union - Yes; a general European Public Prosecutor to fight crime - No.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her sterling work.
In its opinion, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs said YES to the establishment of a European Prosecutor.
It said yes because it feels that the problems which the European Union currently faces need a more systematic approach and solution.
At the same time, however, it underlines certain issues which it considers important.
The first issue has to do with the jurisdiction of the European Prosecutor.
Of course, we all agree that the starting point was to combat fraud, which something needs to be done about immediately.
It is a sad fact, unfortunately, but it is a fact nonetheless.
However, the committee pointed out that transnational relations and the collective structures to which Member States take recourse mean that an evolutionary approach must be taken to the jurisdiction of the European Prosecutor, so that, if necessary, powers to combat other crimes can be added at a later date; unfortunately, as we all know, the current international system is always thinking up new crimes.
The second point made by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerns the role of the European Parliament in relation to the European Prosecutor.
We feel that the European Parliament, which was the first to underline the issues and the problems of pan-European crime, should be the institution to which the European Prosecutor is accountable.
Thirdly, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor goes hand in hand with the development of European criminal law, which is an inevitable development, and finally, it is, I think, important to point out, within the structure of relations between the European Union and its Member States, how the European Prosecutor will stand in relation to national public prosecutors.
Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen. Mrs Theato, I am sorry I was not able to be here when you made your speech.
I had a trialogue here in the House that has only just finished.
Fighting European budget fraud is and remains one of the Commission's most important concerns.
We know that we can count on Parliament unreservedly in this, since it has taken and is taking many initiatives in this field.
We all know that the only appropriate and effective way of tackling crimes against Community finance is for there to be consistent criminal prosecution.
That is why, in 2000, the Commission proposed including a provision for establishing the office of a European Public Prosecutor in the EC Treaty.
At the time, the Council decided not to do so.
