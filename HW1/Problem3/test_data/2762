In doing so, it has undoubtedly strengthened the Commission's position in its negotiations with the United States.
Clearly, Parliament should not be silent at this stage.
I was indeed expecting some further expressions of concern and constructive criticism.
Of course nobody is asking Parliament to say that it approves of and espouses the American system and approach.
Indeed, the Commission itself does not espouse the American approach part and parcel, nor will we stop trying to achieve improvements in it.
Indeed, I am currently still in touch with the American authorities with a view to firming up and clarifying their commitments regarding the conditions under which they will be able to forward passenger data to third-country authorities.
So, we are still working to improve the situation even further â and will continue to do so â before the Commission takes its final decision on an adequacy finding.
It is one thing to say that what is on offer is not perfect, and quite another to seek its complete derailment â as the resolution as it stands does.
That is why I would ask you to reject this motion for a resolution.
To conclude, I shall summarise the choice before Parliament.
Rejection of the motion will allow the Commission's proposed package â the improvements in data protection that we negotiated with the United States â to go ahead.
Among these major improvements there are annual joint reviews to enable us to keep a close eye on things, and a clear cut-off date after three and a half years.
It would also end legal insecurity and remove threats of sanctions for the airlines.
I have no doubt there would be positive spin-offs for EU-US cooperation.
That is the first choice.
The second choice is adoption of the motion for a resolution, which would mean foregoing those advantages in return for a declaration of principle and a wish list that â I am sorry to say â cannot realistically be delivered.
Â Â  Madam President, we are once again debating an issue in this House with which we are all only too familiar.
In fact, since data on passengers whose final destination or transit destination is the United States was first forwarded to the United States more than a year ago, this Parliament has expressed many concerns about the completely unacceptable way in which this information has been and is still being forwarded.
Today, however, we are once again debating this issue, but in rather different circumstances.
Firstly, because we have before us a Commission decision which describes the level of protection that the United States guarantees for the data forwarded to them as âadequateâ, and, secondly, because the recent tragic attacks of 11 March in Madrid â following on from those of 11 September â oblige all of us to reflect and accept that only through international cooperation can we triumph over a brutal and merciless enemy which attacks free and democratic societies such as ours.
Ladies and gentlemen, my group is not entirely satisfied with the decision the Commission is presenting to us.
It even shares some of the criticisms expressed by the rapporteur in her report.
But what shall we do?
Shall we go back to the beginning?
Shall we wait another year?
Are we going to concern ourselves with strengthening legal safeguards as much as possible while terrorists move freely from one continent to another and mercilessly murder thousands of people, who â incidentally â have not been given any right to defend themselves?
Let us be realistic.
Let us accept this new legal framework for cooperation with the United States despite all our reservations.
Let us subject it to a test period and, if necessary, revise it later.
The general public, who are horrified by all this violence, would not understand any other option at this time.
The negotiations held between the Community authorities and the United States authorities have led to agreements, the importance of which I believe must not be underestimated: we have managed to reduce the data that will be forwarded, to restrict the purposes for which they will be collected, to restrict the time for which they will be stored and to ensure that our citizens have mechanisms allowing them to correct that data and lodge complaints in the event that these are used improperly.
Furthermore, following a period of three and a half years, the agreement could be revised in the light of the results achieved.
In saying this, I am not implying that the agreement reached is ideal in every way, but that it is satisfactory in some respects.
Furthermore â as I have said â circumstances have changed and have done so in a tragic way.
The European Union â and this was demonstrated by the European Council, which has just been held â has fully and firmly declared war on terrorism.
Effective action in this regard requires cooperation and coordination to be promoted within the European Union, between the police and judicial authorities of the Member States and between the bodies which the European Union has created for this purpose â of which I would highlight Europol and Eurojust â but also through cooperation with third countries, and there is absolutely no doubt that we share with the United States the common objective and firm intention of beating the scourge of terrorism.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the agreement we are debating today and which has been the subject of an excessively critical report by the rapporteur, strikes a reasonable balance between implementing much-needed security measures and safeguarding civil rights.
The agreement also provides citizens with a level of protection and legal certainty that we would lose if we decided to refer the Decision back to the Commission, leading to a further period in which there would be a legal vacuum.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the rapporteur for the work carried out and for the excellent proposal for a resolution that she drew up, a proposal with which I fully agree.
It is all too clear that the United States, like any other country that seriously wants to combat terrorism, has the right to carry out any type of inspection into the identity of those entering their territory, their reason for entering and the time that they are staying.
To this end, the European Parliament has often hoped for and continues to call for an international agreement defining what personal data of air passengers must be automatically transferred in advance to the United States security agencies, what further data can be requested, who can use them, how long they can be kept for, what responsibility airlines have in case of error in the transcription or transmission of data and, above all, what redress is offered to passengers in the event of error and what appeals are possible in the event of infringements of their rights.
Despite the long negotiations, the unilateral commitments made by the United States do not provide the guarantees requested or an adequate level of protection.
This is because these undertakings do not constitute a binding international agreement, in fact, it is explicitly stipulated that they do not result in any right for any public or private party.
It is also due to the fact that a huge amount of personal data, which varies according to the practices of individual companies, is obtained through direct access to different airline archives.
These data are collected for private purposes and might be different if collected for security purposes: for example, all those who failed to leave the United States on the return flight that they booked could be considered suspects.
Now we are all used to buying return air tickets simply because they often cost less than single tickets.
If we were to reply to a question from a policeman or a customs official concerning the date of our return, we would give the exact date and not the one appearing on the flight ticket that we do not intend to use for the return journey.
The date that will be considered, however, is the one that appears in the airline records.
Do you see what serious misunderstandings could be created by the uncontrolled use, for security purposes, of data collected for commercial purposes?
The same goes for the accuracy of data, such as the correct and complete spelling of names.
Personally, I am still waiting for the Council to reply to an urgent question on the serious misfortune of an Italian citizen, arrested on his arrival in the United States and sent back to Europe because of a misunderstanding, without being able to offer any explanation.
A European manager who is a victim of a similar misunderstanding and thus unfairly considered a suspect could see his career ruined.
How could he get justice?
It is wrong and dangerous, even to effectively combat terrorism, to depend on the arbitrary collection of data that were not specifically selected for security purposes, and it is unfair not to provide for quick and effective instruments to guarantee the rectification of incorrect data for those concerned.
I recall that Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that âeveryone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.â
The Commissionâs decision does not respect Community law or the Unionâs principles.
The Commission goes beyond the powers conferred on it by Article 25 of the directive on the protection of data when it states that the United States provides adequate protection of the rights of European citizens.
It is not true that it is impossible to obtain a more adequate result.
The US associations for the protection of fundamental rights are themselves calling for better legislative protection in their country.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commission is in an unenviable position.
Airlines are almost certainly breaking the law on data protection by giving the US authorities confidential information about their passengers.
To take action would harm our airlines and may lead to disruption in travel to the US; not to act rides roughshod over individual privacy in the European Union.
The Commission has sought to reach an agreement with the United States.
The concerns about this agreement are widespread.
They are shared by the Article 29 Committee, and quite possibly by the heads of state and government meeting last weekend, who amended the draft presidency conclusions on this issue.
They are very much borne out from this House in this report.
In the United States widespread criticism of methods adopted by the government in the fight against terrorism is evident, whether it is to do with the policy of detention without trial or the way in which the heavy hand of the state is being imposed in areas like this.
The Commission's proposed deal on the transfer of data is a deal too far: more information is sought than is strictly necessary; that information can be held too long with no right for the individual to correct it; there is no right to compensation for people denied boarding of aircraft and no legal redress against abuse of personal data by the state.
Liberal Democrats believe that it is possible to be tough on terrorism and true to the treaties we have signed on civil liberties.
We bow to nobody in our determination to fight terrorism.
We urge our Member States to act more effectively.
We recognise the need to work with democracies across the Atlantic; but let us do so intelligently, with a response that is measured and proportionate, and not sacrifice our freedoms in our determination to fight those who threaten them.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her considerable work on this issue and to say that my Group will support this report.
The point has already been made â not least by the Commissioner â that there is an issue here about balancing security and civil liberties.
It is our job as parliamentarians to scrutinise proposed agreements and to hold the line in terms of civil liberties.
My Group believes that the balance is wrong in this agreement, because there is a lack of certainty on the protection of information.
It seems, in many respects, to be a fishing policy â a wide trawl with the hope of catching something, and who cares about the by-catch, as it were.
We have already heard about the question of those refused boarding.
What happens to them?
What happens to their employment prospects if they cannot get into the United States because some of their details do not look right?
The issues of appeal and redress are crucial in any legal situation.
We are already aware that certain European Union airlines have been fined considerable sums of money by the United States for not supplying full data.
Certainly the attitude that we have heard from them is that they are quite willing to see the American Government in court over these particular fines.
This also raises the issue of whether our own institutions, despite the difficult situation, have the right effectively to override our own data-protection rules and controls in an international context.
Lastly, on the issue of passenger consent: it becomes totally meaningless if it has no result but to sign away rights that you were never sure you had in the first place.
So we shall support the report.
Â Â  Commissioner Bolkestein, we will never agree on the balance between security and freedom if we do not first agree on the fact that this balance must be put into practice in respect of the law.
Commissioner Bolkestein, for 13 months the law of 15 countries of the European Union and even Community regulations have been violated every day.
You have not dealt with this.
We should not have gone into negotiations such as these in the position of weakness of a party willing to give up respect for and enforcement of its own law.
Of course, today we are in a weak position because we were already in a weak position when we entered negotiations.
The US security authorities can in no way demand that airlines illegally transfer personal data.
This is only possible because you, Commissioner, all of you, the European Commission, the Member States and the majority of those guaranteeing privacy accepted all of this.
There could have been an alternative solution: a solution, for example, that provided for the preparation by the US security authorities of simple visa mechanisms, on the basis of which the individual would provide personal data, not to the airline company for commercial purposes, but to the security authorities.
You did not want to implement this solution because, just as the United States is doing, you are preparing to allow data that is collected for commercial purposes to be used for security purposes.
This is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Combating terrorism by tolerating illegality for 13 months is a true picture of what this Europe is doing; and âMr Terrorismâ has been appointed on the same basis.
Europol and Eurojust do not provide for any democratic control, or for any control by the Court of Justice.
This is no way to build an antiterrorist Europe!
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no place for emotion in this debate.
Terrorists have no fear of our debates, nor of directives or regulations; the only thing they fear is real and effective action.
We will have to get on with taking appropriate steps to protect ourselves and the European public.
What this means is that we have to act rather than holding interminable debates.
What we need is cooperation within the European Union and cooperation with those outside it, specifically with the United States of America, but we do, obviously, expect certain ground rules to be laid down for them and, of course, we expect them to be obeyed.
We have proposed, and the Commission has agreed, that certain expectations would have to be met, for example that the only data forwarded would be such as would help to combat terrorism, that data would be stored for decent period of time, which we demanded should be reduced, that only one authority in the United States would have access to it, that it would be possible to monitor what was done with it, that passengers had to be informed and that the European public would have an EU authority to represent them.
Those â among others â were our demands, and we were assured that they would actually be complied with.
If they have been, and if we can also set up a âpushâ system with filters, then we should use the opportunity to seek out others with whom we can cooperate in the fight against terrorism.
We are one step away from bringing this to a close.
We should see to it that we take prompt action, before it is too late for the European Union and for the security of its citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to warmly congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her excellent and clear political analyses and on her perseverance. That perseverance will yet come in useful.
I will repeat myself yet again: it is necessary to fight terrorism, but not all means are justified.
The agreement we are discussing today is one such means, which overshoots the mark when it comes to fighting terrorism.
Although the Commission, in its adequacy finding, has concluded that the United States offers a suitable level of protection for the passenger details that are transferred, I am not all that convinced.
The present agreement offers EU citizens insufficient guarantees.
There are no satisfactory legal means for citizens who get into difficulties, as has been demonstrated in the examples that a number of Members have given.
Moreover, it is explicitly stipulated that the details can also be used for other purposes, such as the domestic fight against crime in the United States.
In that respect, the third party to which the details are passed on is not specified, and it is very difficult to monitor what happens to them.
The Article 29 working party has come to the unanimous conclusion that this agreement contravenes European legislation.
In fact, the Council, too, carefully mooted the idea in February that the American measures might be in conflict with European national legislation and this doubt, as Mr Watson has already remarked in relation to the most recent European Council, has not been taken away â quite the opposite.
It therefore looks as if the Commission is the only institution still holding to its conclusions concerning the suitable level of protection.
Maybe the time has come for the Commission to acknowledge the error of its ways and admit that it has gone beyond its remit.
The present proposal is inadequate and that is why the Commission has to submit a fresh proposal, one containing sufficient protection mechanisms for the European public.
For nearly a year now, European legislation has been broken under the pretext of fighting terrorism.
If the Commission is so convinced that this agreement meets European legislation and does not contravene the Treaty, it is really beyond me why it is not prepared to apply the procedure of Article 300 of the EC Treaty and have the Court of Justice carry out a few verifications.
I am therefore pleased that this option is still open in the resolution before us.
Indeed, the fight is not over by a long way.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much support the rapporteur's position.
I agree with everything she said.
I was quite shocked at the Commissioner's attitude towards Parliament today.
It was extremely arrogant, to say the least.
Parliament has adopted a position much more in line with the Treaties than that of the Commission.
The Commission should ensure that the Treaties are complied with and that data transfer complies fully with EU legislation on data protection.
Last March Parliament asked the Commission to do this.
However, what it seems to have done is to have gone away and come back claiming that it has adequate levels of protection.
The Commissioner said that adequate levels of protection from the US is the best he can do and that Parliament's attitude is irresponsible.
I do not believe that is justified.
That is a cavalier attitude towards long-fought and established civil liberties.
What has been said today is in relation to access to data, trying to correct errors, the purpose for which this data will be used, where else it might go and, in particular, the right of people to legal redress.
People's lives could be dramatically changed as a result of incorrect data held on them or mistakes that have been made.
Why should European citizens have a different level of protection from US citizens?
Ideally I would like to see an immediate termination of PNR transfers to the US until we have a permanent legislative solution in place.
This is not the way to fight terrorism.
If we push aside the rule of law and long-established civil rights, we will not only allow the terrorists to win on one front, but allow them to win on all fronts.
We are creating a very dark and oppressive future for everyone.
This is not the approach that should be taken.
Civil liberties have to be upheld.
One only has to look at the United States to see the measures that have been brought in, in recent times, to combat terrorism.
They do not work.
The Patriot Act and other measures do not work.
All they do is suppress the rights of ordinary law-abiding citizens, without them having any right to legal redress.
I do not believe that this is the way forward in the 21st century.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recently wanted to fly to China.
In order to do this, I had to apply for a visa and provide a whole array of highly personal details.
As well as flying from Frankfurt to Peking, I was planning to take a connecting flight with a Chinese airline from Peking to Guilin, and this involved some of the data being transferred from one airline to another, a process that enables the Chinese state to get its hands on a plethora of personal data.
I have to tell Mrs Lambert that I am unaware of there being any sort of data protection law in China, nor can I ask who there is storing my data, or which data are stored for any particular purpose; I cannot ask for it to be corrected, contact the Chinese data protection supervisor or take the government to court.
Despite that, we are not banning flights to China or demanding general agreements.
Now there is, I know, a great difference involved here, in that, when you fly to the United States, their system can directly access or âpullâ your data, rather than it being âpushedâ over to them, so that the United States have direct access to our systems; they are not limited to the data that we forward to them.
Let me add, Commissioner, that the demands we are making now bear no relation to some sort of wish list; this is European data protection legislation, in black and white.
The obligation is now on you to switch over to a âpushâ system.
What I would like is a response from you, and right now. Failing that, I appeal for more calm.
The fact that different standards of data protection prevail does not mean that citizensâ rights are under threat.
The United States has a legitimate interest in this instance, that being in the defence of their country.
I doubt whether other countries could claim the same, even though they disregard our data protection legislation.
I might add, ladies and gentlemen, that I never got to China, because I had not submitted my visa information in good time.
Unfortunately, I had no legal remedy against that either.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt about the need for us to combat the growing menace of international crime and, most importantly, of terrorism.
There can also be no doubt that close cooperation is required, both at Community and at transatlantic level.
What concerns me, however, is that we might be undermining the healthy balance between security and justice by promoting a comprehensive system of vigilance over every single passenger, every single citizen, thereby violating the principle of proportionality, which, in any democratic society, must always be complied with.
Commissioner Bolkestein asks us what message we wish to send out to our partners.
What we must send out is a clear message that we wish to cooperate on our common objectives whilst complying with our laws.
Indeed, we received a most welcome contribution from the ArticleÂ 29 Group, containing the nineteen essential items of information that strike me as sufficient to protect passenger security.
We would also like assurances as regards the retention of this information, a right of appeal and the manner in which it is to be used.
Commissioner, what kind of message did we send to the citizens, in March 2003, when Parliament deemed the transfer of passenger name records (PNR) unacceptable, in case guarantees were not provided for adequate levels of protection and of compliance with the Community rules in force?
Or in OctoberÂ 2003, when we saw that the Commissionâs own conclusions indicated that the protection offered was considered inadequate?
Commissioner, you have heard speeches on the dilemma that you have posed Parliament in a vote on this proposal for a resolution.
Let me ask you a different question, in order to get to the crux of the debate: what has changed since March or October 2003 to justify Parliamentâs change of attitude?
Â Â  MrÂ President, frankly I must say that, emotionally speaking, my speech will be different from one that I would have made before 11Â March 2004, that is to say before the tragic events that took place in Spain.
Let us be honest: we had partially accepted, or at least we had become accustomed to the 11Â September tragedy and therefore the issue concerning the data requested by the United States also fell within a normal dispute over legitimacy.
I believe that we need to start with the assumption that, no matter what, citizens must be clearly informed in advance of the fact that they are going to face such requirements and, consequently, such control.
Citizens also need to be just as clearly informed of the use and the destination of the information, particularly information that goes beyond mere personal details and can, for example, reveal membership of a religion, of a political movement or indicate tastes or habits of an extremely sensitive nature.
On this subject, I would like to mention Directive 95/46/EC, which I quoted a short while ago pertaining to a request for clarification directed at Commissioner Bolkestein on the linguistic census in South Tyrol.
I hope, Commissioner, to have an answer sooner or later, before the day is out.
There is a principle that is also valid in this case, that is to say where Article 6(1)(c) states that the personal data that are collected must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed.
Precisely: I believe that the phrase ânot excessive in relation to the purposesâ gives the debate a much wider scope.
The purposes are known: this is about combating terrorism; and â quite truthfully â doubts are being alleviated, at least as far as I am concerned, and I am also managing to overcome my doubts about the number of agencies that have access to the data, about the fact that an immediate access system is used, about the absence of appeal procedures and many other aspects.
If I consider the fact that this is all for a purpose such as the one that we are aware of â combating terrorism â then I consider it a necessary sacrifice for a higher purpose.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU must of course be part of the international fight against terrorism, and the conclusions from last weekâs European Council also show this.
The conclusions offer a clearer analysis of the issues surrounding the guarantees of legal certainty and the democratic control that is to safeguard the measures concerned.
It is high time that the EU took seriously the balance between, on the one hand, combating terrorism and other crime and, on the other hand, preserving fundamental rights.
The new terrorism tsar should work in tandem with a privacy tsar.
If the political will existed, it should be possible right now â before the Constitution has entered into force â to guarantee democratic scrutiny.
The EU must not gamble away respect for privacy and private life.
Europe is a forerunner in this area, and ArticleÂ 29 of the committeeâs objections gives rise to great concern.
The objective is, of course, a global solution that has to provide people with the same high level of legal certainty.
The fight against terrorism is much more difficult and needs to be tackled in a much greater variety of ways.
This solution will not do away with all forms of terrorism, but it looks sometimes as though people believe it will.
Finally, I wish to point out the following.
It is an extremely unsatisfactory situation we are in.
Commissioner Bolkestein has just shown this through his speech.
Even before Parliament adopts a position on the issue, the Council has gone and stated that it intends to accept the American demands, leading one to wonder why, in such a situation, Parliament has to have an opinion at all.
Irrespective of how the voting goes on this issue, I would call upon the Commission tirelessly to go on striving for better protection of legal certainty, as well as for protection against terrorism in many forms other than just the present one.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you all warmly for your remarks, but I should like to add something.
The fact is that I am a little thrown by Commissioner Bolkesteinâs statement.
He said: âwe are still negotiating and we will then determine whether what we are doing is adequateâ.
However, in my view, there was an adequacy finding before us, which you described as being in order.
You have to make up your mind: either it is in order or it is not.
To Mr Pirker, I should like to say that according to the Dutch Personal Data Board, there are 1Â 800 enforcement and law enforcement bodies in the United States that could retrieve this data.
There are still a huge number of uncertainties and if even the European Commission is uncertain, why should Parliament give its approval at this moment in time?
I am quite convinced that, if this continues, we will have to ask the EC Court of Justice to advise us whether, in its opinion, this agreement is adequate and whether a light agreement can be concluded which intrudes into the data of EU citizens so drastically.
This is the only road that is open to us, and we have to take it because this light agreement has been decided on.
Commissioner, I would ask you again to withdraw this agreement and present a better one.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank Members of Parliament for their various comments.
I will reply briefly to some of the points, starting with the Mr Watson's remarks.
He is no longer in the Chamber, but no doubt he will take cognisance of the report of proceedings for this sitting.
Mr Watson said that the ArticleÂ 29 Working Party has rejected the adequacy finding, which the Commission has proposed.
That is perfectly true.
In reply I would say that the ArticleÂ 31 Committee has approved the Commission's findings by a qualified majority â in fact, 13 voted in favour and 2 against.
The two Member States which voted against were Luxembourg and Italy.
My second remark addresses comments made by MrsÂ Boogerd-Quaak and Mrs Paciotti on requests for access to own data.
The American commitments cover access in what the Commission calls a satisfactory way.
We must verify that the commitments are complied with in practice and there are means to monitor this.
Furthermore, the joint review and the possibility for European data protection Commissioners to intercede would see to that.
Mrs Paciotti also mentioned international agreement in the longer term.
The Commission is seeking a multilateral solution through the ICAO but that, as MrsÂ Paciotti will agree, will take time.
I return to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's comment on an international agreement that would legalise the pull system.
Mr Pirker also remarked on that.
I should like to stress here that the Commission is committed to a switch from pull to push and, although that is principally a matter for airlines, it is preparing actions which will facilitate that switch and make it possible in the coming months.
It is necessary to provide a legal basis for pull until the push system is in place.
Nonetheless, this provision of the international agreement must not become an excuse for the introduction of push to be delayed.
Mr Cappato said that the Commission should drop its initiative for a European policy on PNR.
The fight against terrorism is a global one.
The European Union cannot afford not to develop its own policy in that area, which is considered to be an important contribution to the global fight against terrorism and organised crime.
Last Thursday the European Council welcomed the Commission's intention to make a proposal by the middle of this year.
It called on the Council to act on this before the end of the year.
The Commission will, of course, take care that its proposal is fully respectful of civil liberties in general and data privacy rules in particular.
Mr Cappato also criticised the non-application of the law.
I take it that remark and criticism are addressed to the data protection authorities in the Member States.
As Mr Cappato and other Members will realise, the data-protection directive is 'policed' by Member States and not by the Commission.
Mrs Swiebel referred to Article 300 of the Treaty, concerning the international agreement.
The Commission does not see the need to consult the European Court of Justice on the legality of the agreement or the adequacy finding.
Mr Santini and others asked about passengers being informed â or not â about their rights.
The obligation to inform passengers rests with the data controller â in this case, initially the airlines, subsequently the United States Government.
The US undertakings contain a clear commitment in that regard.
The Commission is working with the airlines and the travel industry to ensure that citizens have access to full and accurate information that they should receive at the appropriate time, ideally before they purchase their tickets.
Lastly â and in general terms â I repeat what I said earlier, that the Commission does not espouse or approve of the US approach, but it shares some of the views about its effectiveness.
However, we have to be realistic and we should take the improvements that are now on offer.
Thus, it is not that we espouse the American approach, it is just that the Commission is at pains to stress that this is the best possible solution and that no other is on offer.
Â Â  â Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0135/2004) by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities and fight against fraud â Annual Report 2002 (COM(2003) 445 â C5-0593/2003 â 2003/2248(INI)).
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2002 presented us with another sharp increase in misuses, mismanagement and irregularities in the European Union, with which we had to deal.
If we add together the cases reported in the Member States and what OLAF brought to light â some years earlier, it must be admitted â then we are talking about over two billion euros.
I cannot recall a time when this sum was as substantial.
Let me stress that we are talking here about irregularities, and we know that, in the course of further investigations, only a fraction of these irregularities will turn out to be fraud.
Speaking as a representative of this House, I want to make it clear that this is where the various analyses that appear in the media do not go far enough.
Particularly at the end of a parliamentary term and of a Commissionâs term of office, the amount involved is enormous, and cannot be regarded as satisfactory.
The increase is particularly marked in the case of the Structural Funds, where the sums reported have trebled â from around EURÂ 200 million to over EURÂ 600 million.
This is where the question arises of how conscientious Member States are about reporting irregularities.
There are still different ways of interpreting things, and disputes as to what is to be reported and how, and it is quite simply incredible how a country like Belgium can report 14 cases to the Commission and Italy 107, while Germany reports nearly 2000 cases.
From that we know that there is a massive lack of harmonisation here, and I say this with particular reference to the reform of the structural policies, among others.
Those of us who sit on the Committee on Budgetary Control do not do so in order to record the history of our times; what we want is to take the weaknesses of the former policies and develop from them strengths for the future.
I can make this claim only in respect of my own share in the work.
Something similar applies where the recovery of funds is concerned.
What is the point, Commissioner, when it comes to fraud prevention, if one has to wait almost decades before the money is returned?
One particular Member State, Italy, has been waiting for recovery for many years already.
That is an open secret, as is the fact that it is being used as an instrument of policy.
The second major area is that of agriculture.
Our Committee has for a long time sought to get the Commission and the Member States, once and for all, to do away with export refunds and, most of all, with those paid for the unspeakable, because pain-filled, unethical and cruel transport of live cattle.
It defies comprehension how, in 2002, of some 262Â 000 live cattle, the export of which cost us some EURÂ 62 million of tax revenue, 226Â 000 could be delivered to a small country like Lebanon.
We have indications, which we have to take seriously, that Lebanon does not by any means possess the capacity to absorb, consume, slaughter or process this number of animals itself.
Commissioner, we can remember the case, not so long ago, when a sudden increase in meat exports to Jordan was eventually explained as the circumvention of UN sanctions against Iraq.
I cannot therefore understand why the Commission is again, ostrich-fashion, burying its head in the sand and pleading ignorance.
We call for OLAF to get involved in this.
I am not talking about prevention; I am just waiting for the first animal rights activists to accompany these exports and for us to see the first pictures in the media.
This is what European taxpayersâ money is being used for.
There is a third point I would like to mention: a few days ago, we heard of the unprecedented raid on a journalistâs home, not â contrary to what we have read today â in connection with anything that happens here in this House, but in connection with the case of Paul van Buitenen.
We would like to raise the issue of how OLAF has handled this case.
We well remember the reprimand given to OLAF in connection with this by the European Ombudsman.
We recall how OLAFâs investigations can commence only where there is well-founded suspicion and that they must be of appropriate duration â in other words, they must not be artificially extended.
We would ask the OLAF Supervisory Committee to state whether, in this instance, these rules have been broken and whether or not this investigation has been misused for the purpose of putting journalists under pressure or of intimidating them.
Mr Kendall, the chairman of the Supervisory Committee, has informed me that this will be an item on the agenda of the Committeeâs next meeting, in April, and has also confirmed to me that OLAF did not seek the Committeeâs opinion before calling in the Belgian justice authorities.
One member of the Committee, MrÂ Noack, told the press that, if the Committeeâs inquiries led it to the conclusion that OLAFâs actions were unacceptable, then the dismissal of its Director-General was not to be excluded as a possibility.
Let me stress at this point how important the Supervisory Committeeâs report on this matter will be to us.
This is the test case for whether the monitoring of OLAF works or not and for whether or not the necessary action is taken when things get out of control.
With this in mind, I can do no other than warn those in positions of responsibility within OLAF against hiding themselves behind Belgian justice.
There must be no exceptions: everything that OLAF has done in this matter so far, everything that has been passed on to the judicial authorities, must be submitted to the Supervisory Committee.
We need this matter to be clarified, and soon; not in months, but in a few weeks.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr BÃ¶sch, ladies and gentlemen, from the very outset, it was a matter of fundamental concern to the Commission under President Prodi that the administration of Europeâs finances should undergo extensive reform and that they should be protected against fraud.
The decisive action we have taken has achieved a great deal.
In carrying out our reforms, we have been guided by the report produced by the Group of Wise Men, which your House appointed at the end of the previous Commissionâs term of office.
The clear apportionment of responsibility has been central.
It is those who administer Europeâs funds who bear full responsibility for the proper handling of them.
Centralised financial control has been done away with, a course of action that was long overdue.
The division between financial control and policy management was a relic of a time when Europe still had a very small budget.
Now, at last, we have the sort of structure that is taken for granted in the Member States, with individual ministries being responsible for the proper spending of their budgets.
What happened in Eurostat during the nineties, with accounts being set up and administered outside the Budget, forcefully reminded everyone of the old systemâs deficiencies.
The Commission has, however, retained a central internal audit office, the importance of which was underlined when, as long ago as the summer of the year 2000, it was placed under the Vice-President of the Commission.
OLAF was established as an important and new anti-fraud body, intended to be fully independent in uncovering, by way of administrative investigations, fraud and irregularities within the institutions and in the external sphere.
Where will you find the like of it in the Member States?
In this, the European Union is ahead of the field, and it is of course encouraging that some of the new Member States are taking OLAFâs structure as a model.
As well as establishing and extending OLAF, the Commission has introduced a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to combating fraud; we have promoted the development of a culture of prevention not only by faultproofing legislation, but also by drawing up ethical standards for the Commissionâs staff and detailed provisions to protect whistle-blowers.
In combating fraud, we have stepped up operational cooperation with the Member States.
What makes this essential is the fact that it is the Member States who administer some 80% of the expenditure from the Community budget.
In this respect, OLAF is developing a true platform of services for the Member States.
The anti-fraud report for 2002 â which is what we are discussing today â shows that the Member States have made greater efforts to safeguard the EUâs finances than they did in the past.
It was in 2002 that the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests at last entered into force.
Even so, as Mr BÃ¶schâs report shows, there is still more to be done.
As one would expect of him, Mr BÃ¶sch has produced a comprehensive report dealing with a whole range of issues related to fraud prevention, and from various angles.
I would like to turn my attention to one aspect to which you, Mr BÃ¶sch, have just referred, and that is the issue of export refunds.
It is true to say that export refunds demand a high degree of vigilance, as it always involves more than one country, so it follows that this is an area in which monitoring must always be very consistent.
According to the Directorate-General of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler, though, the high volume of live cattle exported to Lebanon is also attributable to the steps that the European Union has taken to monitor the exports of live cattle in general.
At the beginning of this decade, the main players left in this field were Lebanon and Egypt.
During the BSE crisis, Egypt stopped importing live cattle from the European Union and instead started importing them from Australia.
This explains the current high volume exported to Lebanon.
I did of course ask whether the number of cattle exported there bore any relation to Lebanese consumer habits, and the DG Agriculture Policy again confirmed that these figures had of course to be considered in the light of the fact that the Lebanese eat practically no pigmeat and so it was only natural that more beef should be consumed than other varieties of meat.
I want to assure you, though, that I fully share your particular concerns about the protection of animals.
In 2003, the Commission enacted new regulations on the export of live animals and tightened up those already in force.
Today, the DG Agriculture has again confirmed to me that very tight controls are carried out both in the countries of origin and in the countries to which they are exported.
I would like to emphasise that Mr BÃ¶schâs report, as is usual, takes a highly critical line, and so we are all the more pleased that the report expresses appreciation for the actions taken by the Commission.
This is not the only reason for the Commission to be grateful to the rapporteur; on the contrary, many of the steps taken by the Commission in recent years to combat fraud originated in demands and suggestions made, in particular, by the Committee for Budgetary Control.
The improvements and reforms at OLAF are among them.
Here too, it was the rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶sch, who was particularly insistent on changes being made.
We now propose to amend the OLAF Regulation by improving the flow of information between OLAF and the Commission, by providing better procedural safeguards for those under investigation, and by giving a greater role to OLAFâs Supervisory Committee, to certain of whose functions you have just, again, referred.
Alongside this, communications within the Commission on the subject of suspected fraud have been improved, notably between the political level and the services.
These, too, had been brought to our attention by Parliament.
We â and by âweâ I mean Parliament too â have achieved a fundamental reform of the Financial Regulation.
The new Financial Regulation not only reinforces budgetary principles, but also contains important instruments for combating fraud, and for exclusion of parties from tenders where details given by them are false.
Very recently, has described this as exemplary.
Administrative reform is largely complete.
We have, in the shape of OLAF, an effective and powerful instrument for combating fraud, but we must, of course, be constantly working to improve it.
What we still need to do, though, is to set up a European Public Prosecutorâs Office; fraud that is detrimental to the European Budget must be punishable under criminal law.
The Committee on Budgetary Control â particularly its chairman and the rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶sch â have been arguing in favour of this for years.
Recently, we have joined together in campaigning â and very successfully too â for the Convention to incorporate in the draft Constitution the proposal for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutorâs Office to protect our financial interests.
It is, fortunately, probable that an Intergovernmental Conference will, before the end of the Irish presidencyâs six months, adopt a resolution on the draft Constitution.
I would reiterate, though, that we have not yet got over all the hurdles, and I see it as absolutely necessary that all those who have worked towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutorâs Office, should continue to be vigilant, lest it fall victim to some compromise or other.
Right up to the Intergovernmental Conference, which will be in June, we will need to keep a very watchful eye on this.

Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President; in 2002, EURÂ 1.8 billion went astray as a result of fraud and irregularities, which amounts, approximately, to an increase of a cool 36% over the previous year, and the greatest increases are to be found in the areas of own resources and structural policy.
That may be interesting, but there is nothing new about it.
It all adds up to a sorry story, Commissioner, and you cannot put a positive spin on it.
It could be said that fraud is continuing regardless.
A 36% rate of increase may well be desirable in other areas, but it is nothing more or less than a disaster in the anti-fraud field.
It actually reveals that you have nothing to show for the four and a half years that you have served as a Commissioner.
Let us remind ourselves how the Prodi Commission took office in the autumn of 1999 grandiosely committing itself to, and demanding, zero tolerance for fraud and irregularities.
Everything was to be different after the fall of the Santer Commission â and what happened?
One might say that one scandal gave way to another.
Let me remind you of the way you froze out the chief accountant after she said that the whole reform was not going as smoothly as you had told the outside world it was.
You changed the Financial Regulation, but without, in my view, making it more transparent or any clearer; instead, you did it by way of a jungle of regulations that nobody, at the end of the day, knows their way around.
Indeed, your cardinal error, in my view, was to do away with the independent position of Financial Controller, and to replace it with an internal audit service, one that is neither independent nor â it would appear â very appealing, in view of the fact that you will, in April, be losing its director, who is also making good his escape.
An accounting system has come to light that is described quite rightly in the press as being âas full of holes as a Swiss cheeseâ and âas open as a bank vaultâ.
Finally, we have the Eurostat affair, with its secret accounts and losses acknowledged as totalling at least EUR 8 million.
I do not mean it as praise, Commissioner, when I call that a fantastic result; only a cynic could congratulate you on it.
As always, though, you are unaware of any wrongdoing.
All the Commissioners responsible are simply wriggling out of it and hiding themselves in the regulatory jungle that they themselves have created.
That none of this encourages any confidence on the part of the European public is evidently a matter of no concern to you; it would appear that the prevalent attitude is still that one can be more free and easy with Europeâs money than with that of the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr BÃ¶sch, this report places due emphasis on the scandal of export refunds for live cattle intended for Lebanon, in 2002.
It should be noted that this scandal is only the latest in a long line of scandals.
Commissioner, you have mentioned here the reports provided by your colleague Commissioner Fischler on this matter.
I would, perhaps, ask you to take a look at the 2001 press in order to see, in great detail, the whole scandal of the export refunds for Jordan â which had also taken place as regards other countries â with the sole purpose of breaching UN sanctions on Iraq.
This has gone on for a number of years, involving various countries, and if the Commission has been unable to see what has been happening, I honestly think that this is because it did not wish to understand.
After all, detailed reports have even appeared in the press.
What I would like to say, however, is that we are not only dealing with the scandal of breaking the Iraq embargo with EU funds.
This is one of many, such as the scandal of the holding group set up by the Naples Camorra â involving large dairy companies from France, Belgium and Germany â to adulterate butter with beef tallow and oils.
This was also heavily financed by the Community budget, with export subsidies and disposal subsidies.
The problem is that Commissioner Fischler, whose name has not been mentioned here â though his name ought to be the first to come up in these circumstances â cannot ignore the scale of these successive scandals concerning the agriculture budget.
We have yet to receive any clarification whatsoever of the amount of money spent by the Community budget on disposing butter adulterated by this Camorra holding group between 1995 and 2000, and there has been a similar silence concerning the amount of money recovered.
We still do not know which companies were involved, nor why the Commission has not imposed any sanction against any of them, not even sanctions relating to the functioning of milk quota mechanisms.
We must discover why it is that the Commission treats the major agriculture and food companies with such indulgence and impunity, yet imposes harsh penalties on small-scale farmers or dairies for the slightest administrative lapse.
These are the important questions that require answers.
Â Â  â Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report.
The European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) was set up under great pressure from Parliament to replace the former UCLAF.
Its task obviously has to be clarified, but at the same time we must ensure that the European Union does not start to become a Community reminiscent of a police state.
At this stage our group does not support point 39, which goes too far in its outline of OLAFâs future role.
We still wish to keep our options open, and for that reason we have drafted Amendment No 8.
This gives attention to the following: the competence of the OLAF Supervisory Committee in relation to the Directorâs discretionary powers, the matter of where the secretariat is to be physically located, and the rights of the people whose actions OLAF is investigating.
We should remember that it would be a very alarming situation if OLAF were to investigate an unfounded report.
As points 1 and 2 imply that poor administration and fraud are due to the fact that the same Commissioner is responsible for both the budget and financial control, we cannot accept this conclusion, which oversimplifies the matter.
At the same time we do not wish to belittle the determination and firmness with which the Commission has pushed for administrative reforms.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, just as the rapporteur did, I should like to refer to the raid on a German journalistâs house, carried out just recently by the Belgian police on the instructions of OLAF.
OLAFâs breaking into a journalistâs house and seizing computers, notes, address registers and mobile telephones constitutes a very serious encroachment upon the freedom of the press.
Following the raid, the Belgian police did not actually bring any specific charges.
I therefore sincerely hope that OLAF has a very good explanation of why this course of action was taken.
An explanation really is needed.
If OLAF cannot provide such an explanation, I do not believe that OLAFâs director can remain in place.
I should also like to ask the European Commission whether it knew about this in advance and, if so, who in the Commission was aware of the matter.
Please answer this question here and now.
OLAF has faced a lot of criticism in the wake of the Eurostat scandal.
I think that this has, in the main, been justified.
OLAFâs director chose not to inform the Commission in time.
Obviously, there need to be fundamental reforms to the way in which information is passed on, something that is now in part also being proposed.
The rapporteurâs report is a very thorough piece of work, and makes for fairly gloomy reading.
It is a kind of balancing of the books following five yearsâ work since the Santer Commission was forced to go.
What is evident is that the problems involving fraud and irregularities have not disappeared.
The problems have even increased in the last year.
What is also evident is the fact that the promises previously made to demand political accountability have not been fulfilled, above all where the Eurostat scandal is concerned.
The problem does not only relate to control systems.
It is also about system errors.
A matter such as export refunds for live animals is an invitation to fraud.
It also involves systematically organised cruelty to animals, funded by the taxpayers.
The existence of such systems is in fact an invitation to misuse tax revenue in the European Union.
In this case, increased control is not what is in the first place required.
What is required is for the system to be done away with as quickly as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to concentrate on live exports and export refunds, but before that I should like to point out that it is only right that Parliament should have a full report on the case of the German journalists who had property confiscated.
As regards export refunds, a report is coming up in Parliament this week about the conditions under which animals can be transported.
Export refunds should be abolished.
Clearly the vast majority of European Union citizens do not approve of the idea that their money is being used to subsidise a trade which causes untold suffering to animals, regardless of how high standards are or how good the conditions are.
It is undeniable that animals are being subjected to unnecessary suffering.
To cap it all, European taxpayers are being forced to subsidise this.
The time has come for us to end export refunds.
There is a huge budget here which is wide open to abuse.
Looking at this recent case I believe it should be fully investigated by OLAF.
Regardless of whether we agree with export refunds or not â and I clearly do not â we need a full investigation as a result of recent reports regarding animals being transported to the Lebanon.
What was their final destination?
In general, export refunds are completely unjustifiable.
I do not believe that European taxpayers' money should go towards this kind of trade.
If export refunds were abolished, that would solve the whole problem.
There would be no more scandals in relation to abuse of taxpayers' money, but we need a full report on what has been mentioned in the media recently in relation to the scandals and the fraud involved.
Commissioner, you should ensure that investigation takes place.
It is essential that we have a commitment as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, sound management of the budget is of crucial importance for confidence in the European Union.
From the 2002 annual report, it appears that the number of reported cases of fraud has risen dramatically.
Although this is, in itself, not such a good thing, this rise does mean that more attention is being paid to the fight against fraud and irregularities.
More attention is a good thing, but it should also be translated into both punitive and preventive action.
The Commission has some catching up to do where the improvement of direct management is concerned.
A separate directorate general for financial control should be set up, independent of the present DG for the Budget.
As long as those in charge intend to keep a grip on their inspectors, there is no room for a transparent climate, in which people accept responsibility and hold others to account.
Our group is concerned that amendments have been tabled to delete paragraphs 1 and 2 from the resolution.
Has this Parliament perhaps been created with a view to taking the Commission under its wing â even when it makes mistakes or remains in default?
An uncritical attitude of this kind instils distrust in the voter, and rightly so, because this Parliament primarily has a monitoring task, which it has to carry out meticulously by fighting irregularities and fraud, also in its own House, in a consistent manner.
That is a first measure in order to increase the structurally low turnout in European elections.
Finally, I should like to mention the inadequate recovery of excessive or incorrect amounts paid.
Has a consistent register been finally set up in the accounting system?
Why is the Commission only claiming back a small proportion?
How do you explain this to the citizens in the Member States?
Is it in their interest that you recover so little?
Â Â  Mr President, it is exceedingly rare for me to find myself in agreement with large parts of a report drawn up for this Parliament.
However, the BÃ¶sch report contains a veritable litany of the failings of the Commission either to create an accounting system even approaching adequacy or to tackle the fraud that is inherent in everything the EU does.
He quotes a colossal EUR 2.12 billion â or, in real money, something like GBP 1.5 billion â as the total amount of fraud listed in the Commission's annual report for 2002.
From training seminars for senior civil servants that were never held, to mass defrauding of the CAP, this eye-opening record of failure is there for all to see.
The report notes that, incredibly, in 50% of the cases of agricultural fraud, it was impossible to identify the products concerned.
Under these circumstances, I also share the report's concern at the shortcomings of the work of OLAF.
However, the BÃ¶sch report provides a list of blindingly obvious things that could and should have been done many years ago to make this leaking ship more sound.
It is self-evident that a leaking ship will continue to leak and, indeed, eventually sink if it takes on new passengers.
As the accession countries join the EU on 1Â May, I put it to you that the EU's finances are in a huge mess and that the addition of ten new countries will simply make that mess even bigger and may well cause the ship to founder.
This report very effectively demonstrates the failure of a European Union that is hopelessly mired in fraud and corruption and lacks the will to do anything about it.
Any nation that continues to plough money into this black morass is very badly letting down the taxpayers who foot the bill.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to start with an observation for Mr Titfordâs benefit; this is not a Tempus Phase project, but rather a Tempus project.
My fellow-Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement has asked me to make this point clear.
One thing I would like to do is to respond to the questions that Mrs Stauner raised, and the statements she made, about the claim that EURÂ 1.8 billion went missing in 2002.
One simply cannot come to that conclusion on the basis of the figures in the report on the implementation of Article 280; the Member States are obliged to report any irregularities relating to the Structural Funds, the Agricultural Funds, or the own resources.
Irregularities are taken to mean infringements of European regulations.
Such an irregularity can be of a financial nature, but it can also be, for example, a breach of an environmental regulation, in which case no financial loss whatever is incurred.
As these reports have to relate to the project in its entirety, it is impossible to conclude that the whole project is in some way tantamount to fraud.
If, though, a financial irregularity has occurred, the money must be recovered, and it is the Member States themselves who must produce it.
It follows that, at the very least, the funds reclaimed must be deducted from the sums to which you, Mrs Stauner, have referred.
It is of course quite illusory to believe that you can have a budget made up of subsidies without any fraud whatever; the risk of fraud is inherent in it.
This makes rigorous and universal controls all the more necessary, and in some areas it is the Member States that have to carry these out.
Of course it is vexatious when reports either arrive late or are incomplete.
You are quite right to say, Mr BÃ¶sch, that if there is a country somewhere that has had nothing to report, that does not indicate that everything is being done properly there, but rather that checks are not being carried out.
Even in Member States that perhaps pride themselves on doing a good job of monitoring, we find, again and again, that they are not.
Take a look at the Court of Auditorsâ report for the year 2000.
It shows, unfortunately, that it is in the country from which you and I come, the country we both know best, that paying agencies â including one in Bavaria, your own part of the country â have the highest margin of error.
For that reason, offices everywhere must carry out checks, and as and when they find something, they have to take appropriate action â which may involve recovering the money.
In that event, we have to be consistent, and the money must be collected.
I have to tell Mrs Stauner that âzero toleranceâ does not mean that we stop carrying out checks, but that, if something is found, we draw the appropriate conclusions.
I would like, by way of a brief response to what Mr van Dam said, to point out that the DG Budget is not the DG with responsibility for financial control.
I will reiterate that point.
Financial control has now been decentralised, and the position is the same in all the countries from which you come, where it is always the ministry responsible for a particular programme that is also responsible for monitoring it and for its proper implementation; it cannot hide behind another Directorate-General.
That was our mistake in the past.
The internal audit service is independent, something that I believe it did indeed demonstrate while Mr Muis was responsible for running it.
I would like to return to the issue of the transport of live animals, export subsidies and the export of live cattle.
The fact of the matter is that this is permitted.
It is also stated, in a Council decision, that live exports are subsidised, albeit to a lesser extent than in the past, so I cannot categorise the export of live cattle as fraud; it is legal.
I share your concern that questions should be asked about precisely what, in terms of animal protection, is ethically justifiable about this.
I did mention that â as we saw in the case of Egypt â the Commission has tightened up the relevant regulations.
If, then, the European Union stops these exports, and these animals are transported from Australia, then, as far as the protection of animals is concerned, nothing has been gained.
This means that it is vital that we act in the interests of the welfare of animals not merely within the EU, but also seek out allies.
I have taken note of your critical comments in this area and will be passing them on to my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler.
I will be asking him to make available to you any further information you may wish to have.
In any case, I will tell him about the critical tone your House has adopted on this issue.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Î5-0160/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, on promoting gender equality in development cooperation (Rapporteur: Mrs Zrihen).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at the second reading of a report that should not pose any problems.
Nonetheless, I want to stress some points that I feel are essential in this report and once again make a number of observations.
A disproportionate majority of poor people in the world today are women.
There is a close link between gender inequality and poverty, just as there is between the eradication of poverty, greater independence for women and gender equality.
The four countries placed bottom on the United Nations index measuring gender equality also come last in terms of human poverty.
If we want effectively to reduce poverty, then gender equality must be improved.
Furthermore, if we take into account the important role played by women in society in developing countries, it is widely acknowledged that the full and complete participation of women is a prerequisite for sustainable development.
Women have for many years, women have been recognised as actors who have an important role in the success of projects, in change and in development.
It would be a mistake to undertake measures to promote development and sustainable development without taking into account the opinion of women and without genuinely involving them in projects.
The development cooperation policy that we are pursuing must not boil down to simply funding projects in order to clear our consciences. It must rather be an investment for the future so that the people and the countries targeted will one day become partners and can promote their own development.
Women play many and various roles in many societies.
They are wives, mothers, and teachers at the same time.
They start small businesses, they grow things, they sell things, they are genuine operators, and dare I say it, industrialists.
Nevertheless, in many cases, they are also the victims of societies that are falling apart; they are the victims of wars, disease and patriarchal structures.
Our action must consist of promoting and supporting the participation of women in economic, social, political and environmental fields.
Similarly, we must strive to ensure better access for women of all ages to the entire range of resources and services, such as health, education, training and infrastructures.
By strengthening the position and the power of women, we are allowing them to take charge of their own lives so that they can set their own objectives, so that they acquire the skills they need, so that they have more self-confidence, so that they can deal with their problems and learn to become independent.
By acting in this way, we allow men and women to take part in social and political life and to thus obtain citizenship, which is a fundamental element in any democracy.
This will also allow us to consolidate the rule of law and finally ensure that human rights, rights of the person and fundamental freedoms are respected in territories other than our own.
For several years, gender equality has formed an integral part of the political framework which includes the European Unionâs development cooperation.
The priorities and the objectives have been defined but there is still a long way to go to achieve tangible results and to improve the situation of women in developing countries.
The aim of the regulation that we are voting on this week is, therefore, to strengthen the implementation of measures aimed at promoting equality in the policies, strategies, and operations of the European Unionâs development cooperation.
Activities funded under this regulation must act as a catalyst for supplementing and strengthening existing policies and programmes in developing countries.
Financing this regulation is the only stumbling block that we have come up against.
Having found a solution, I hope that the sooner the projects are included, the more swiftly money will be released and actions taken on the ground together with NGOs and local womenâs associations.
We need something tangible; we need actions and not just talk and fine words.
Finally, I dare to hope, Commissioner, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, that the next time we renew this regulation we will finally obtain a substantial increase in the budget, as well as an impact assessment on the type of work carried out and a summary broken down by country and by area of actions.
Working together towards the future is our only chance of ensuring that democracy will be achieved.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Nielson, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Zrihen, for the outstanding and constructive cooperation throughout the whole codecision procedure, and most of all after the vote at first reading last December.
The Commission very much welcomes your recommendation that the Councilâs Common Position should be approved, as also should budget funds totalling EURÂ 9 million for the purpose of promoting gender equality in the context of development cooperation.
Parliamentâs request for additional budget funds had been the only point on which the three institutions had been unable to reach agreement in December.
As regards the others, we were or are in of one mind, as is evident from the fact that the Council and the Commission have taken on board 20 of the 21 amendments proposed by Parliament.
As soon as the new Regulation is adopted, we will devote all our efforts to enhancing its function as a catalyst and its strategic role.
All development measures funded by the Community should help to promote gender equality horizontally.
It is in these areas that the ideal of gender mainstreaming is of the utmost importance.
This Regulation provides us at last with a more broadly drawn concept, which will underpin the current implementation strategy in the best possible way.
The Regulation needs to have teeth if we are to be able to step up the promotion of equality and thereby make further progress in combating poverty, which is one of the millennium development objectives.
We are aware that some have expressed misgivings about the equality training that Commission staff receive, and so I am glad to be able to announce that we will shortly be mounting a comprehensive training programme intended not only for the Commissionâs own staff at home and in the delegations, but also to our partner countriesâ own workers.
We have already started elaborating a guide setting out the most important principles of gender mainstreaming and guidelines on how to promote it, as well as a range of best practice methodologies.
We will provide, in the annual report on development cooperation, detailed accounts of the measures funded under this Regulation; this will mainly consist of information on relevant experience with projects and on their outcomes.
Moreover, and before the expiry of this Regulation, we will be initiating an independent assessment to arrive at recommendations as to how the measures in question can continue to be as efficient as they are now, or even more so, since we want to constantly improve the promotion of gender equality as part of development cooperation.
I am persuaded that, by supporting this Regulation, Parliament will be helping to achieve the international development goals, to promote equality and to give women more rights and a greater role.
This is an essential requirement if we are to successfully combat poverty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by congratulating both the rapporteur from the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities and the rapporteur from the Committee on Development and Cooperation for the work they have done in connection with this report.
I think that the 20 or 21 amendments tabled at first reading show very well the cooperation there has been between these two committees.
They have been an inspiration to each other.
The Commission has adopted 20 out of 21 proposals, which is to be welcomed.
I naturally find it annoying that we have not been able to increase the budget from EURÂ 9Â million to EURÂ 11Â million but, in line with other rapporteurs, I accepted that, if we wanted to conclude matters now, we should have to conclude with a figure of EURÂ 9Â million for the appropriation for the next three years.
It was the only opportunity we had to complete things and get matters under way.
In common with others, I attached greater importance to this than to having the budget increased, partly because the previous funds have not been used.
That being said, I think, in a way, that EURÂ 9Â million is too small an amount when we consider what it really is we are up against.
We often talk about the EU being an economic superpower in the world, which is what it in fact is, but it can safely be said that we are positively prehistoric in the area of development.
Overall, we are clearly the worldâs biggest provider of aid, and it is therefore important, of course, that we debate the basic principles upon which development work is based.
Gender equality is one of the areas concerned, and a very important area too.
It is a that if we too do not combat female poverty, we shall simply not succeed in getting development under way.
There is reason for hoping that what we have before us may be a stimulus to such development.
In itself, it is not of course enough, but it can hopefully act as a catalyst, in the way described.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Î5-0196/2004), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (Rapporteur: Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner â whom I welcome â ladies and gentlemen, in 1994 the European Parliament approved at first reading the Commissionâs proposal on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents.
The differing natures of the four physical agents â noise, vibration, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields â led to a new approach on the part of the Council in 1999, which advocated specific directives.
Following the directives on vibration and noise, today we are examining the Directive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields.
The proposal for a directive falls under the heading of measures to improve the working environment because, according to Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights under the heading âFair and just working conditionsâ, every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity.
To start with, we must make it clear that the new Directive is extremely careful about its potential socio-economic impact, since it does not impose new obligations which were not already contained in the framework directive; it simply sets out their specific details.
The directive only deals with short- and medium-term adverse effects and not long-term adverse effects because of the lack of solid scientific data.
It does not deal with risks involving contact with live conductors.
Protection in this case is contained in the framework directive.
The proposalâs scope does not provide for exceptions, because that would represent discrimination, within the meaning of Article 13 of the EC Treaty and Article 20 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Furthermore, this is a health and safety directive, which is intended to eliminate risks at origin, although a specific directive â 93/42/EEC, for example â obliges the manufacturer to comply with essential requirements.
Use may be incorrect and therefore the sources of risk may be many and varied.
In order to understand the preventive content, we must take account of two concepts. Firstly, the exposure limit value above which no one is permitted to work.
Secondly, the action value which leads to an action in accordance with the terms laid down in the proposal. This Parliamentâs contributions mainly focus on the obligations for employers in terms of evaluating and measuring the levels of the electromagnetic fields workers are exposed to, on the consultation and participation of those workers and on training and information.
Another of Parliamentâs contributions is to set out detailed requirements for containing and monitoring this power â Article 8 â with the aim of preventing and diagnosing as swiftly as possible any adverse effect on health due to exposure to electromagnetic fields.
When exposure exceeding the limit values is detected, a medical examination is required and, in the event that any damage to health as a result of exposure is detected, the employer will be obliged to carry out a reassessment of the risks.
Effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are laid down, in accordance with national legislation â of course â in the event of infringement.
If Parliament votes in favour of this report and the Council accepts Parliamentâs amendments, the Directive will be the result of a form of social dialogue, of political dialogue, in this case, through the joint efforts of the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group who, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, have understood that, by means of this Directive, we could improve working conditions for European workers.
We accepted the initial proposal by Mr Crowley of the UEN Group.
In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to thank him and all my fellow Members for their contributions and, in particular, the coordinator for the Socialist Group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Stephen Hughes.
Without this agreement, the Directive would not be possible.
If we achieve the necessary votes tomorrow, we will have a Directive which is the result of dialogue between the majority political groups in this House aimed at improving the living conditions of workers and protecting their dignity as human beings.
Â Â  Commissioner Dimas has the floor.
Commissioner, I should like to take this opportunity to welcome you to the European Parliament, to congratulate you on your appointment and to wish you every success in your work.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by thanking you for your kind words and welcome.
It really is an immense honour and joy to be here in the European Parliament this evening.
I am sorry that I did not have the opportunity to meet the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but I shall meet them tomorrow, at the meeting we are to hold in the afternoon.
I am especially glad that I shall have the opportunity in the future to work closely with the European Parliament and the relevant committees.
The report by Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez was perfect and I must also thank him on behalf of the Commission because, on such a difficult technical issue as that in the proposal on physical agents, especially electromagnetic fields, he spoke so well and his report was truly exceptional.
The difficulty with this issue is exacerbated by the fact that, although the amended proposal was submitted to the Council back in 1994, the first part of the proposal â on vibration â was only approved in 2002 and the second part â on noise â was only approved in 2003.
Now we have the third part on electromagnetic fields at the level of second reading.
The Commission continues to attach the greatest importance to all measures which are designed to protect the health and safety of workers and which constitute an important factor in relation to the quality of life.
The social agenda emphasised this issue, which was confirmed in the Commission communication on a new strategy for health and safety in the workplace.
I am of the opinion that legislation on electromagnetic fields will be a fundamental step towards achieving better protection for the health and safety of workers exposed to risks from physical agents.
The most recent scientific information available shows that overexposure to electromagnetic fields may have serious consequences on the health of workers and therefore merits special attention.
The directive makes provision for precautions to protect the health and safety of workers, especially from induced electric currents in the body, shocks and burns and absorption of thermal energy produced by electromagnetic fields.
It should be noted that it was not yet possible to examine the carcinogenic effect of electromagnetic fields, due to a lack of adequate scientific data or indication of a link of cause and effect between electromagnetic fields and cancer.
For similar reasons, the directive does not set definitive values for exposure to static magnetic fields.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that, within the framework of the Commission report on the practical application, the Commission will pay particular attention to these issues and will closely monitor developments in scientific data in these two sectors.
If necessary, it will submit the necessary proposals at a later date.
I should like to congratulate the Members of Parliament on the quality of their amendments expressing Parliamentâs concern and interest as regards the risks and results of exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields.
It should be noted that the Commission, throughout the highly technical and very difficult legislative procedure, made intensive and, on occasion, persistent efforts to preserve a high level of protection in the text, while at the same time ensuring that a final compromise solution could be reached.
It should be noted that, in order to achieve an overall compromise, the Commission accepted the Council common position, even though it had reservations about the watering down of the provisions on health surveillance.
I am particularly pleased to see that one of your amendments, Amendment No 3, corrects this shortcoming in the common position and restores the preventive nature of health surveillance.
As far as your amendments are concerned, the Commission can accept them as they stand, in that they improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning.
Specifically, Amendment No 1 clarifies the procedure for assessing levels of exposure in accordance with the provisions of framework directive 89/391.
Amendment No 2 improves the quality of the text, in that the content of the information which must be provided to workers is further supplemented.
Amendment No 3 strengthens health surveillance in complete harmony with the Commissionâs reservations on the common position.
Amendment No 4 introduces a standardised provision governing sanctions, while Amendment No 5 stipulates the frequency of the Commission report, in keeping with the other health and safety directives.
There is no need for me to tell you that this report will evaluate scientific developments concerning the long-term effects of exposure to electromagnetic waves and the effects of static electromagnetic fields.
At the same time, any further initiatives will be examined in the light of new scientific knowledge.
May I also remind you that the gradual approach taken to the examination of the Commission proposal, starting with vibration, followed by noise and now electromagnetic fields, does not obviate the need for further work to be undertaken on the remaining physical agent included in the Commissionâs initial proposal, by which I mean optical radiation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I wish to tell the Commissioner that I am looking forward to meeting him tomorrow in order to exchange experiences and points of view concerning the social agenda.
I shall then address the rapporteur, MrÂ PÃ©rez Ãlvarez.
I see that MrÂ Hughes is not here today.
That is because it is sometimes difficult to make oneâs way to Strasbourg because of the lack of air connections.
MrÂ Hughes has got caught up on the way here.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and of MrÂ Hughes, I wish to thank MrÂ PÃ©rez Ãlvarez for his very constructive cooperation.
The fact that we have obtained this result has a lot to do with the sound cooperation between the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
MrÂ PÃ©rez Ãlvarez and MrÂ Hughes have been the leading figures in this cooperation.
We have set out in pursuit of two objectives.
The first is to produce a sound directive in this area that guarantees employeesâ health and security.
The second objective has been to reach an agreement before the end of the term of office so that we do not keep putting off the issue.
It has already been said that this directive is part of the health and safety and physical agents package.
We have previously dealt successfully with vibrations and noise and are now dealing with electromagnetic fields and workersâ exposure to these.
This affects many people in the labour market.
Let me take a few examples in the form of people within health-care, large-scale catering and the metal industry.
It is an important directive on which we now have to adopt a position.
A debate has taken place on the long-term effects and on the difficulties of finding scientific observations enabling the long-term effects to be evaluated.
I think that, through the amendments we have produced in the committee and for which we hope to obtain a hearing, we are highlighting some important matters.
Firstly, consultation and cooperation with employees is being debated.
Another important subject is, of course, prevention: that is to say, when an employee suffers overexposure, he should have an automatic right to health checks.
If, in the course of these health checks, it emerges that the employee has suffered overexposure and been harmed, a further risk evaluation should be carried out.
I consider this perhaps to be the most important proposal among the amendments now being tabled by our committee.
It is also important that there should be serious consequences for those employers who do not comply with these recommendations.
I must also mention the last amendment to the effect that there is a deadline before which the Commission must respond.
If new findings come to light, the initiative must be taken and Parliament consulted again.
Finally, I wish to say a big thank you.
This has been an example of constructive cooperation, and I hope the outcome will be successful. I am convinced it will be.
Â Â  Mr President, I join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the tremendous work she has undertaken on this report.
This report and the mechanism by which we are getting it through Parliament is the best example of cooperation that there is between the institutions.
Because of the time-frame within which we are now working during the Irish presidency, in particular with regard to the upcoming elections in June, it was necessary to find a compromise and a consensus, which may not be suitable for everybody, and may not cover all the individual points that each Member wanted to see covered, but does allow for legislation to be put on the books to ensure that workers are protected in these new risks to which they are exposed.
When we look at the advancing use of technology, in particular the dangers that may emanate from that technology, it is essential that this Parliament, and indeed the European Union as a whole, is seen to be able to respond quickly to those new innovations, as well as those new risks.
What we have before us is a compromise package.
In recent weeks the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs tabled five amendments which have been taken on board by Coreper and by the Council as a whole under the guidance of the Irish presidency.
This will allow us to bring forward this legislation into the domain of workers' rights, following on from a very proud and strong tradition of this House in ensuring the protection of workers under health and safety legislation.
I would like to welcome Commissioner Dimas to his new position.
I know it is very difficult for someone coming into office in such a short space of time.
I wish him well in his office and promise my cooperation and that of my Group in his work in the coming months.
The health and safety of workers must be to the forefront of all our legislation.
Of course it is important that we try to put in place rules and regulations with regard to competition and competitiveness to ensure that workers can have jobs, but as well as having jobs, they must be good jobs with real rewards and real protection.
It is only when we meet all these criteria that we can truly say that we have worked properly on behalf of all the citizens of the European Union.
I commend this report to the House.
I would ask all Members to endorse it and to support it so that we can move forward in this era of cooperation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, we have been looking forward to being able to put questions tomorrow in the committee.
It is of course a great pleasure after so many years to be able to put the finishing touches to this directive.
There is no doubt about that.
The directive has been in preparation for an incredibly long time, and I am also delighted to commend it to the House tomorrow.
It is also good that, unlike the other directives on physical agents, it is not full of transitional periods, possible dispensations and a host of exemptions.
This is something I think we can learn from when preparing the future directives in this area.
That being said, I must say how disappointed I am that the directive does not in any way mention the long-term effects of electromagnetic fields.
I am aware that there are problems in showing the connection between exposure and the development of cancer.
I think, however, that our legislation has to be influenced by the fact that we at present see a number of examples of people who worked with radar in the seventies and eighties and who now appear to be following a pattern of developing cancer.
I find it disappointing that this is not mentioned at all in the directive.
I think that, at some time or other, we must take account of the fact that there is also a precautionary principle in this area.
If we begin to see a pattern in those cases whereby, after 20 or 30 years, people develop cancer, we should do something about the fact.
I should therefore like to ask you directly, Commissioner, whether I heard you correctly and whether you do in fact interpret ArticleÂ 11 of the directive as saying that the Commission undertakes to present a new proposal as soon as there is new knowledge of the long-term effects of electromagnetic fields.
I should be very glad if the Commission could confirm this.
I think it is very important for the next Parliament to have a practical basis on which to proceed further.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I merely wished to say that, in the last point, I repeated that scientific developments on the long-term effects will be assessed and, of course, any further initiatives will be examined on the basis of this scientific knowledge.
Â Â  Thank you very much Commissioner.
I too wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and to welcome you to this Chamber.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0161/2004) by MrsÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the common position adopted by the Council on 6 February 2004 with a view to the adoption of a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I am sure we all welcome the fact that the Council, along with Parliament, has acknowledged that promoting equality between women and men requires, in practice, a range of measures, a structured programme, the involvement of civil society and, most importantly, the involvement of womenâs organisations and financial support for these.
As one of the founders of the European Womenâs Lobby, I acknowledge that its primary role is to promote equality between women and men. I am pleased to see, however, that, as I have been advocating for many years, there are other womenâs organisations outside the lobby, which are active at European level in the field of promoting equality between women and men and which are similarly worthy of support.
Our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa, for whom I am deputising today, did not have an easy task, either in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, or at first reading here, to persuade people that European womenâs organisations outside the lobby should not suffer discrimination.
Nonetheless, an agreement has finally been reached with the Council to ensure that the various womenâs organisations active at European level are accorded equal treatment.
The European Womenâs Lobby does not have a monopoly on representing, or on coordinating, womenâs NGOs.
It is, therefore, only right and proper that other organisations should also receive an annual operating grant in the framework of the Community action programme, covering the period from 1Â January 2004 to 31Â December 2005.
This Community action programme is open not only to the twenty-five Member States, but also to member countries of the European Free Trade Association, and to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, who are waiting in the wings to become EU Member States.
In light of this, Mr President, I feel distinctly underwhelmed by the financial envelope for carrying out this programme â EURÂ 2.2 million over two years â especially given that in the financial provisions, there is a restriction that states, and I quote, that âannual appropriations shall be authorised by the Budgetary Authority within the limits of the financial perspectiveâ.
In order not to delay any further the adoption of this decision, which should have been adopted before 1Â January 2004, when it came into force, I should like to ask you, on behalf of Mrs Kratsa, to endorse her position and adopt this text, which she negotiated so skilfully with the Council, without any amendments.
I should like to recall the most important aspects of these texts: the transfer of the European Womenâs Lobby from the first part to the annex; the setting of identical cofinancing rates for other organisations active at European level as for the European Womenâs Lobby; the non-application of degressivity to the funding of womenâs organisations that do not belong to the European Womenâs Lobby; and an annual operating grant to support the implementation of the permanent work programme of the womenâs organisations.
This is a good thing and I welcome this agreement.
I trust that the Members of this House, as Mrs Kratsa wishes, will give their approval to this text that she negotiated with the Council, as it is acceptable to everyone.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am delighted to see that progress has been made, within the framework both of the Council and the European Parliament, on the proposal in question and that we have now reached the final stage of its approval.
The proposal is designed to provide a legal basis for continuing financial support for organisations working at European Union level to promote equality between men and women.
It is designed to increase legal clarity and transparency when granting subsidies in accordance with the new financial regulation.
The present proposal forms part of a package of seven decisions which provide specific legal bases, from 2004 onwards, for subsidies which are currently funded on the basis of administrative operating appropriations.
I should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa on her report and Mrs Lulling on her presentation of it and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities for their work and proposals, most of which have been incorporated in the Commissionâs amended proposal.
We support the common position proposed by the Council in that it responds to the Commissionâs main objectives and incorporates most of your amendments.
It is very positive that the institutions worked closely together and arrived at a joint agreement on the basic issues of the duration of the programme and the level of central funding at the tripartite meeting in November 2003.
We all agree that the organisations in question play a crucial role in promoting Community policies in the area of equality between men and women.
It is important to safeguard the continuation of and avoid obstacles to Community support for the organisations in question.
Due to the delay in approving this decision, the amendments relating to the transitional clauses need to be included in the final decision, as agreed at the conciliation meeting last November.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it may be said that, unlike everyone else, I have thought it important to take the floor at this second reading.
It is quite simply because I want to take the opportunity to praise the work done by the European Womenâs Lobby.
It is of course important what the European political parties do to promote women in the decision-making processes and in all possible other areas.
I believe, however, that it is also safe to say that, if the European Womenâs Lobby were not active in this area, it would be much more difficult to push through a number of gender equality initiatives.
In particular, I think there is good cause for emphasising the need that exists for the European Womenâs Lobby in connection with enlargement to include the new Member States, which quite obviously have other gender equality traditions than ourselves in the current Member States.
It is important for the Womenâs Lobby, together with the organisations of MEPs in the individual nations, to be active so that we can continue to pursue the work concerning women, even though there are cultural differences between the new and old EU countries.
Â Â  I do not think that the Commission wishes to respond.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0155/2004) by Mrs Prets, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services.
Â Â  . â Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the European Union has been fighting for equal treatment of men and women for nearly fifty years now and it has made a great deal of progress in the employment sector, with the introduction of legislation to safeguard equal pay and equal working conditions.
Of course, legislation cannot resolve all the problems and a great deal still needs to be done in order to wipe out pay differentials between men and women.
In 2000, the Commission announced in the social policy agenda that it would examine discrimination outside the labour market.
This idea was supported by the European Council in Nice, which called on the Commission to strengthen rights relating to equality by approving a proposal for a directive on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty.
Before a detailed proposal was drafted, broad consultations were held with the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women, on which all the Members States and the social partners are represented, together with the insurance and other sectors, the European Parliament and civil society.
You have this proposal before you.
Following the example of the earlier directive on ethnic discrimination, the present directive focuses on the basic sector of access to goods and services, where there was evidence of unequal treatment of men and women and where it is known that legislation can change the situation.
Consequently, the present directive will mainly cover financial services which often require women to have a guarantor in order to obtain a loan, but not men.
Similarly housing, where single parent families, mainly women, face greater difficulties than men in renting accommodation and, of course, the insurance sector, mainly the car insurance, life assurance and pension sectors, as well as health insurance.
The proposal to ban discrimination between men and women with regard to access to goods and services is equivocal to the Council, Parliament and society in general.
It is equivocal because it questions established ideas in relation to the treatment of men and women, because it maintains that there are factors more important than gender when calculating premiums and because it implies that the approach which most insurance companies use today is basically unfair.
This is, however, an important step for the principle of equal treatment and it will change the lives of both men and women throughout the whole of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for what you have just said, which makes us very optimistic that we will be able to get rid of the unequal treatment that exists in the insurance sector.
The preparatory work has been very hard work and very long, but it has brought us at last to the point where we can vote on the report.
This proposal for a directive was announced as long ago as June 2000, when it featured in the Commissionâs social policy agenda and was called for by the Heads of State or Government at the Nice European Council in December 2000.
Four years on, the same gentlemen are still around and, now that the draft of such a directive is on the table, they are opposing it.
It took three years before, in September last year, a proposal was submitted, and this, too, was given a very rough ride by the Commission.
Then, in September 2003, I, as rapporteur, organised a public hearing in order to gain broad public support for our cause.
This hearing was very interesting and gave rise to some exciting developments, including the discovery of how questionable are the often-quoted statistics on the basis of which it is possible to charge women higher insurance premiums.
In the United Kingdom, for example, the lowest life expectancy for both men and women is in Manchester, while menâs life expectancy is highest in West Dorset and womenâs highest in West Somerset.
This exactly parallels the way in which men in the former East Germany live longer than men in the West, and the East-West divide, in terms of life expectancy, that exists in Austria.
What this means is that gender is certainly not the only factor in this; I believe that our approach to this equality directive cannot be based on economic factors to the exclusion of all others, and that this involves a purely political decision, the political will to declare ourselves in favour of equality or against it.
We also found it very regrettable that the final Commission proposal for a directive took no account of education, decision-making processes, and the content of media and advertising.
This leads me to agree with my colleague Mrs Swiebelâs view that, while a progressive approach is certainly not the best solution, it may well be the first manageable one.
This directive is very feeble in comparison with the existing directive on the principle of equal treatment on grounds of race, which goes much further in its demands.
So let me thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for taking this important step, while, at the same time, encouraging the Commission â through you, Commissioner Dimas â to delay no longer in adopting further proposals on comprehensive measures to combat sexual discrimination and to guarantee de facto equality in areas other than employment.
This directive is explicitly founded upon Article 13, inserted by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, and I do not share the view of certain members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it should have Article 95 as its basis.
Were that the case, I believe that it would have permitted access to the internal market in purely economic terms, and I am not sure that the Council would have allowed Parliament the power of codecision over it.
What is crucial â it is indeed at the heart of this report â is the actuarial factor, on which the insurance lobby has based its arguments, and which is the starting point for most of our differences.
Gender must not be used as an actuarial factor in calculating premiums and benefits.
To use gender as an objective factor is discriminatory, as gender is not freely chosen; women and men are born as what they are.
For example, I have learned from many discussions that women in the insurance sector, and not just insurance companies themselves, defend the idea that women alone should bear the costs of pregnancy, justifying this by saying that they too, use medical services.
As all women pay the same amount, there is solidarity between women who have children and those who do not, but what about men, who do, after all, have some part in women becoming pregnant?
At the moment, family policy is a big thing; demands are made for families to be supported and we are told that we need more children to be born, economics ministers trumpet aloud improvements to family policy while, at the same volume, proclaiming their opposition to this directive.
This goes to show that family policy, just as much as womenâs policies, is very often no more than a way for our male politicians to get themselves off the hook, with their fine words left hanging in the air while none of the things that are promised actually materialise.
I would like to clarify that the calculation of premiums on the basis of risk is to continue to be possible, but that gender must not be included as a factor in these calculations.
Using gender or race â both of them factors outside the control of the individual â as a factor in calculating premiums amounts to discrimination.
Â Â  . Mr President, as the rapporteur has already stated, this directive puts an end to the persistent form of sex discrimination, known as statistical discrimination.
In statistical discrimination, the average differences, established at a given point in time, between groups, in this case groups of men and groups of women, are made absolute as permanent assessment criteria for individuals.
Unfortunately, this statistical discrimination still occurs very frequently in the private insurance industry in a number of countries.
However, the essence of insurance is about sharing the risks.
Judging people on a characteristic over which they have no control must be considered discrimination.
The apparent logic of taking into consideration the difference between men and women by the insurance industry is a remnant of times gone by â taking the easy option.
We have to fight this as a matter of principle.
The opponents are fighting a rearguard action.
I am therefore pleased that such a large majority on the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has approved Mrs Pretsâ report, and I hope that the plenary will do likewise.
We are, however, waiting for the next step, which will put a stop to the so-called hierarchy of equality.
European anti-discrimination legislation is a patchwork which itself discriminates between the different grounds of discrimination.
Consequently, different groups are given different levels of protection.
Why is race discrimination prohibited by EU legislation in the areas of education and social services, while sex discrimination in those areas is not?
And why has in this area and that of social security no provision been made for discrimination on the basis of age, disability and social orientation?
We are looking forward to the Commission's promised Green Paper about the future of anti-discrimination legislation as a whole, and subsequently to new reparation legislation.
After all, a hierarchy of equality is not acceptable in the European Union, which reportedly wants to be a community of values.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, warm thanks, first of all, to our rapporteur Mrs Prets; I think we all agree on the basic premise that the fight against discrimination on the grounds of gender deserves our wholehearted support.
We should not, however, allow this concern to deflect our gaze from the problems that this directive engenders.
In essence, it has to do with the insurance sector.
The Commission, along with many Members of this House, takes the view that gender should no longer be taken into account when calculating insurance premiums, claiming that this is intrinsically discriminatory.
A majority on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market disagrees with this approach; the fact is that calculating risks is what insurance companies do, and where there are different levels of risk, these may be taken into account.
To take one example, in private old age pensions insurance, insurers take account, in their calculations, of the tendency of women to live longer than men can expect to do.
I do not see that as intrinsically discriminatory; it is one of the factors that may be taken into account when working out the contributions.
Another example is to be found in motor insurance; according to the statistics, it so happens that women cause fewer accidents than do men, and so insurers charge women lower rates.
I do not think that is discriminatory; that is the application of mathematics, which cannot simply be abrogated by legislation.
The one exception I would make is in the case of maternity and pregnancy, where I do not believe there should be any difference between men and women when it comes to the costs.
This is an area where both sexes, of course, share responsibility, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has therefore decided that they must be treated equally in this respect.
What leads me to oppose this directive is the fact that it stands for massive interference in peopleâs private affairs.
I am opposed to the introduction of unisex tariffs, and I hope that the amendments that our group has resubmitted will be supported by a majority of the plenary tomorrow.
Â Â  Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my support for Mrs Pretsâ report, which is of major importance to women.
Indeed, non-discrimination between persons is one of the common principles of the EU and its Member States.
We are not asking for money, as many seem to suggest; what we want is respect for European values and for the treaties.
Nor â contrary to certain peopleâs frequent apparent accusations â are we asking for special privileges.
Parliamentâs opinion must not be drawn along party political or partisan lines, but must be a political act in the cause of greater respect for gender equality.
We had for a long time hoped for a more wide-ranging directive, encompassing numerous fields in which to promote gender equality.
The directive before us, however, is somewhat limited, yet is very important for equality between persons, and in itself represents a step forward.
We expect that this directive will bring greater solidarity and equality between the sexes.
I should like to emphasise that we must oppose any discrimination based on criteria over which people have no control, such as sex, race, ethnic background and age.
This proposal for a directive does not target the calculation of premiums according to risk, but is solely concerned with the inclusion of sex as a factor in this calculation by the insurance companies.
Excuse me, but I am a woman and I do not believe that my gender constitutes a risk.
Other factors connected with lifestyle, irrespective of gender, can be taken into account in the calculation of certain types of insurance.
I should also like to underline that the right to equality between women and men is an individual right that belongs to both women and men as individuals and not as members of a group.
There are those who put forward arguments designed to alarm our female citizens.
Before I make a quick synopsis of the possible implications of the directive, I must emphasise that possible, not probable, reductions or increases in certain areas of insurance will only be applicable to new policies and not, as some would have us believe, to existing ones.
Furthermore, not only does this directive concern women, it also concerns men.
It will therefore affect insurance premium calculations for men, as well as other areas covered by this directive, namely access to and supply of goods and services.
Equality in the access to and supply of goods and services is essential.
Even today, in our civilised societies, discriminatory practices remain commonplace.
It is normal to see posters specifying that an apartment can only be rented either by men or women; and to see places or services that are only accessible to one of the sexes.
We have previously debated the subject of equal treatment between women and men in the field of cooperation and development.
The report concerned, which was intended to make it possible to strengthen the role of women and to combat discrimination between men and women in third countries, is an example that we must follow here, in our own back yard.
There are those whose amendments are aimed at removing all of the directiveâs substance.
I hope that this will not happen when it comes to the vote, and that we will approve this report.
I also hope that the EU and the Member States will put this directive in place and enforce it.
While EU law lays down the principle of equal treatment between women and men â and a directive has already been adopted to this end â this principle has always proved difficult to implement in practice.
Good will is all very well, but there is still disparity between men and women in the job market.
Such inequality, however, is now criticised as a hindrance to European competitiveness and to achieving the Lisbon objectives, as stated in the Commissionâs latest report on equality between men and women.
Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that during the coming legislature, the Commission will table a directive that plugs the gaps of non-discrimination between women and men in fields not yet covered.
I especially hope that tomorrow Parliament will send a strong and clear signal affirming non-discrimination and the equality of women and men.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her report and to thank her for her cooperation in respect of the opinion from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I can understand the concerns of the insurance industry.
The proposal will bring considerable changes to its practices and at present it is uncertain as to how to go about implementing these changes.
Understandably, industry never likes uncertainty.
However, I do not understand industry's argument that the current use of gender to differentiate premiums and benefits is not discriminatory because it is based on objective factors.
Even if it is the case that on average young men have more car accidents than young women, or that on average women live longer than men, this is not true of all individuals, and these individuals are disadvantaged accordingly.
In any event, the existence of objective differences, whether between individuals or groups, is not of itself sufficient grounds for according them unequal treatment.
There must be a sound political justification for doing so.
I have to say that in the 21st century I do not believe that such a justification can be provided where the routine provision of goods and services to men and women is concerned, any more than it could be where other such socially constructed groupings were involved.
If I speak with some feeling on the matter it is because, on several occasions in my own life, I have experienced the kind of discrimination that this directive is intended to prevent.
I do not want to see new generations bearing the same scars.
I would ask insurance companies to look to see whether the changes might not actually afford opportunities to them.
I would not willingly purchase an annuity because I do not believe it would offer a financially advantageous way of arranging my affairs.
Perhaps I am not the only woman who feels this way.
Â Â  Mr President, as long ago as the 1960s, I was fighting for equality between women and men and against any discrimination based on sex.
I have been fighting since 1963 for equal treatment and opportunities between men and women, in womenâs organisations, at national and at European level, and most of the time as president.
I cannot, therefore, be accused of not promoting the implementation of the principle of equality between men and women by directives covering all fields.
I also, therefore, believe that there is a real moral and legal obligation to support this proposal for a directive establishing equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services.
In politics, however, nobody is forced to do what is impossible or absurd.
Unfortunately, the Commissionâs proposal does not take account of the fact that in the field of insurance there is a further directive that requires insurers set sufficiently prudent premiums, taking into account all future commitments.
It is a fact that for certain risks, sex â I prefer to use the term genderÂ âÂ is an objectiveÂ criterion that insurers must take into account in determining the level of liability that they are to accept.
We cannot, therefore, prohibit insurers from taking sex into account on prudential grounds in the actuarial risk calculation, even if the premium does not eventually vary from one sex to the other.
Given that all those insured, regardless of sex, are primarily interested in the financial viability of insurance, we have tabled amendments to take account of this concern.
Like the Commission, we wish to lay down the principle that the use of sex as a determining and discriminatory factor in the calculation of premiums for insurance purposes must be prohibited for new contracts concluded after the directive has been adopted.
We would not accept retroactive legislation to cover existing contracts.
We would, however, allow sex to be taken into account according to objective, verifiable and transparent criteria, to be monitored by the Member States, for actuarial calculations.
This makes sense and is in the interests of all insured parties, especially since, as the Commission says in its short justification, âthere is little evidence of the existence of consistent discriminatory practices in the area of the access to or supply of goods and servicesâ.
The Commission says, in fact, that in the setting of rates, insurance companies should take into account criteria other than sex, such as lifestyle, behaviour or professional status.
I doubt whether such practice would be compatible with respect for private life, quite apart from the fact that it would cause new and manifold forms of discrimination between men and women.
Mr President, I do not see why we have to include provisions in this legislative text regarding sexual harassment.
I really do not see how I could be harassed when buying a commodity or service.
I do not believe, for example, that the chemist would harass me for buying condoms or Viagra for my husband or my boyfriend.
I would not do this, as I do not have either, but let us drop all of these politically correct elements that are a waste of space in a legislative text.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if there had been any doubt that this proposal for a directive were also about men and money, there was, in any case, no longer any such doubt when a number of jacket-clad men appeared on the rows furthest to the back during the discussion of this subject by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities.
It was quite legitimate that they should be there, but also very instructive because, when it boils down to it, the proposal is about rectifying a situation in which women pay more, and obtain less, than men when it comes to life assurance, pensions etc.
When they came to my office with views opposed to the proposal, a number of insurance people said that they just wanted to see a fair system.
It set me thinking about what is really meant by fairness.
Their conception of fairness was obvious.
It was quite fair that there should be solidarity among women and solidarity among men.
This means, for example, that women who cannot have children have to pay for those who can, while, from this insurance point of view, the childrenâs fathers do not participate in any form of financial solidarity at all.
I am of course in complete disagreement with the insurance industry.
Equality is a fundamental principle in the EU.
It is there in the existing Treaty and occurs again in the new draft constitutional treaty.
It is also stated that the EU must take initiatives to remedy situations in which these principles are not being complied with.
I should therefore like to thank the former Commissioner for the work she has done in this area, and I now hope that it will get through the European Parliament and, subsequently, the Council.
I should like to say that, in my view, there is much more at stake than just this proposal, for it is in reality the future of the EU that is at issue.
The proposal demonstrates whether there is a link between words and action.
When women now look at the âfamily photoâ, it is difficult for them to identify with the EU they see there.
If â and this can perhaps be excused â we in the Commission, the Council and Parliament show that we cannot even remedy an area such as this, there is no chance of getting women also to vote in favour of the future EU.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to remind the House that we have been waiting a long time for this directive.
The point has already been made that the directive to combat racism and discrimination based on ethnic origin was approved in the year 2000 â some four years ago.
It could be that nobody is interested in this issue; it could also be that this is simply an extremely tricky one.
It also appears to me that the Commission had a great deal of difficulty in reaching this agreement. The programme should have been much broader and should have encompassed education and the media, yet all of this is absent from the final draft.
I regret this, given that we are not satisfied with the replies given regarding the media and discrimination in the media, which consisted of saying that self-regulation is sufficient, andÂ that we have been told so by those who work in the sector. I feel that all of us here can confirm, with regard to our own countries, that self-regulation is not sufficient.
The âTelevision without frontiersâ directive also contains provisions to combat sexism in the media. The reality of the situation, however, leaves something to be desired.
The area before usÂ â that ofÂ housing, insurance, goods and servicesÂ âÂ is important; having listened this evening and read this report and draft, we realise how difficult it is to combat these forms of discrimination.
Against this backdrop, I do not wish to complain, but rather to take satisfaction from the fact that Europe is achieving more than each of our countries in terms of addressing an extremely tricky issue, namely, fighting against stereotypes in the criteria used to calculate premiums or in types of insurance.
I think it is tremendous that Europe is able to devote its attention to problems such as these.
Some speakers have suggested that, in actual fact, we are far from achieving our goal, that stereotypes still prevail, that we are content to use stereotypes rather than, as has been said time and again, to consider a range of contributory factors that would enable us to address more appropriately the difficulties that people have in the area of insurance. This is all too true.
I feel that it is imperative that we combat stereotypes in the area of insurance underwriting and risk assessment.
It has been said that women are the ones who lose out.
Men might say, from their point of view, that they do not all wish to be seen as road hogs and bad drivers.
It is, consequently, both men and women who will be affected if we manage to achieve equal representation in the area of insurance.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, welcome the Commission proposal and the report that Mrs Prets has produced on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, even though we do find it very much to be regretted that both fall far short of what had been expected, in that such important areas as education, the media and advertising have been left out.
We nevertheless believe that this proposal puts plenty of wind in the sails of equality for women and men in the EU.
The removal of these inequalities in services was long overdue, and, with this report, we have set up a landmark for equality policy.
It is hypocritical and unfair for the private insurance sector to make threatening gestures; it is merely trying to promote panic among consumers and its customers.
As has already been said, it is far better to include other risk factors in calculations.
It is lifestyle that is crucial to life expectancy.
We know from studies in the USA that 86% of us live for the same length of time.
Just as nobody thinks in terms of discriminating on the grounds of ethnic origin, there must be no discrimination on the grounds of gender.
Now of all times, when the adoption of a European constitution is about to be adopted, it would be a mockery for us to fail to push forward the equality that it â as has already been said â has as one of its core values.
Although I see the Commissionâs proposal for the progressive removal of discrimination as something of an admission of its inadequacy â we would have liked more than that â I do believe that, when we vote, we have to send a clear and unambiguous message in support of equality policy and against discrimination.
The principle of equality must count for more; after all, even private insurance companies are bound by it, and it is intolerable that these should use unacceptable forms of discrimination as a means of securing themselves a competitive advantage over statutory insurance schemes.
I would like us to be seen by the whole world as a beacon for equality policy; I want the EU, being such a great economic area, to set up a landmark, and our vote to carry a clear message.
Â Â  Mr President, this proposal is about the equal treatment of women and men in access to, and supply of, services, particularly about the actuarial problems in insurance services.
It is therefore not logical for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to have been allocated this report.
It has replaced the principle of equal treatment by equality of men and women, but that is not the issue.
The consequence of this change is that the text lacks coherence.
For example, Amendment No 19 stipulates that there shall be no sex discrimination, including less favourable treatment, also as a result of paternity.
There should also be equal treatment in the insurance industry, so that life expectancy on the basis of sex alone should no longer play a role in calculating insurance premiums.
The calculation of risks on the basis of life expectancy is based on outdated information and according to other male and female role models.
The premiums should therefore be based on solidarity between men and women.
The fact is that there is a greater variation within the group of men or women than there is between men and women.
There is, admittedly, a significant difference between men and women statistically speaking, but this can be explained historically.
In the future, the increasing similarity in lifestyle and occupational pursuits will mean that this statistically significant difference will not necessarily continue to exist.
Â Â  Mr President, as a woman, I have always been proud of what the European Community has achieved in the area of equal treatment of men and women.
In that respect, we have played a pioneering role, certainly as regards the equal treatment in what â for the sake of convenience â I should like to call the working and professional environment.
That has not always been the case.
Now that we have a legal basis enabling us to go one step beyond the professional and working environment, I think we should do this.
I do welcome the fact that, in terms of tax law, the Commission provides, at least at the moment, for temporary derogation.
I believe that to be important, because where tax law is concerned, we move into the realms of family policy, and I think that we should continue to give the Member States free choices in that field.
Understandably, the insurance industry has asked for a derogation to be put in place for them, because the proposal requires them to make huge adjustments.
I would, however, ask them to understand that we nevertheless want to include insurance in the scope of this directive.
I accept the legal argument that, strictly speaking, the unequal treatment of what is different does not amount to discrimination.
This, however, should not stop us from taking positive steps in order to establish the equal treatment of men and women in the broad sense of the word, in society.
That, therefore, means that we need to go beyond working and professional regulations and in that sense, I can also largely support the Commission's proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, in this debate, four key issues must be raised.
The first is the delay in tabling a proposal for a directive, as has already been mentioned here, to prohibit discrimination based on sex in fields other than work.
This was announced in the social policy agenda in June 2000 and we have repeatedly called for such a proposal in various reports approved by Parliament.
We deplore the fact that pressure and resistance on the part of various interested parties, in particular the insurance and media sectors, have delayed its passage.
The second issue concerns the vastly reduced scope of the proposal presented by the Commission, which covers only access to goods and services and the supply of these, and excludes other fields, such as media and advertising content, education and decision-making processes.
This is an appalling state of affairs, particularly when one sees the discrimination that persists in the media, in advertising and in decision-making processes.
Other areas, such as vocational training and social security, are covered by other directives, although we must look again at these areas in order to improve the content and to eliminate discrimination based on sex in all areas, particularly in occupational social security schemes.
The third is the need for mechanisms to ensure that the principle of equality is applied on the ground.
This principle has already been set out in previous directives, but is still not being implemented.
We therefore support the inclusion of some practical measures that will ensure that this principle is applied more effectively.
The fourth question concerns the need to eliminate discrimination in services that are essential to ensuring women to live on an equal footing with men on a day-to-day basis.
Unequal treatment between women and men must be prohibited in all areas of the supply of goods and services.
It is unacceptable that insurance companies include gender as a factor in risk calculations or that banks discriminate against women when granting credit.
The rapporteur, whom I should like to congratulate on her work, states that the right to equal treatment belongs to the citizen as an individual and not as a member of a group.
The ways in which insurance companies analyse risk, premiums and payment deadlines in terms of groups and of male and female averages, are, therefore, unacceptable.
This does not mean, however, that we should not be proactive in eliminating inequality and in promoting equality between men and women.
This is a tentative and incomplete step, which I hope will be approved tomorrow and will accordingly become a EU directive.
We must strive to fully implement, at the earliest possible opportunity, the processes that are still lacking.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed these interventions with a great deal of interest and I should like to thank the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, as well as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their contributions to the report being debated.
I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her excellent report, which proposes numerous improvements to our proposal and gives it greater clarity and greater cohesion with previous Community directives.
In particular, we welcome the amendments which bring the Commission proposal into line with Directive 2000/43 on racial discrimination or Directive 2002/73 on equal treatment for men and women in employment.
I refer to Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 part three and part four, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 20, 23 part one, 25 part one, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 43.
I should also like to thank the Committee on Womenâs Rights on its proposed Amendment No 15, which clarifies the dividing line between private pensions and occupational pensions, which are covered by existing directives on employment.
The above amendments are also in keeping with the discussions held in the Council.
We cannot support a number of other amendments, even though they are constructive, because they deviate from similar provisions in current directives and because we believe that it would be preferable to maintain the same approach for reasons of cohesion.
I refer mainly to Amendments Nos 16, 19, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 34 and 40.
Nor do we agree with the abolition of the exceptions for which provision is made in Article 1, paragraph 3, given that it is necessary to maintain a limited number of exceptions if the directive is to be applicable in practice.
I refer to Amendments Nos 9 and 13.
Nor can we support the amendments which extend the proposal to the education, mass media and advertising sectors.
The Commission proposal focuses on a specific sector, the goods and services sector.
As such, it is a step by step approach to a sector in which, as everyone knows, there is a great deal of gender-based discrimination which can be wiped out with a binding legislative act.
We recognise that the representation of the sexes in the mass media and advertising raises serious questions regarding the protection of the dignity of men and women and that, in the education sector, girls and boys are often discouraged from following non-traditional paths, but other complicated issues also arise, such as the freedom of means of communication.
Consequently, the Commission considers that, in order to deal with them, a binding legislative act is not appropriate at the present stage.
I refer to Amendments Nos 38 and 39.
Finally, as far as Amendments Nos 35 and 36 in Article 4 of the proposal are concerned, we cannot agree to amendments designed to allow the use of gender-based actuarial factors.
The use of gender-based actuarial factors is not compatible with the principle of equal treatment and cannot therefore be justified objectively.
Such actuarial factors make broad generalisations about all men and all women and cannot be justified.
They reflect statistics on the average population, but these statistics are misleading because they conceal the fact that other factors relating to life style are more important than gender.
In fact, studies have shown that 86% of men and women have the same life expectancy.
In this group of 86%, a woman is treated differently from a man under the same conditions, purely and simply because an inaccurate generalisation is made about the life expectancy of all women.
This practice infringes the principle of equal treatment and, as such, cannot be justified by a statistics-based generalisation.
Nonetheless, we welcome the fact that the proposed amendment recognises that the cost of pregnancy in life assurance should be borne by men and women equally, in order for there to be compliance with the principle of equal treatment.
As regards Amendments Nos 10, 22 and 41, which propose on the one hand, a reduction in the transitional period of six years provided for in Article 4 for gender-based actuarial factors and on the other, stricter monitoring requirements during that period, we do not agree with them because we believe that we cannot expect the insurance sector to adapt from one day to the next and because we consider that the additional six-year period provided for in Article 4 is needed in order to develop working methods for using other, more accurate factors than gender.
Nonetheless, we hope that, at the end of this period, the insurance industry will have no problems applying the principle of equal treatment and European consumers will reap the relevant benefits.
As regards the amendments which propose replacing the term âapplication of the principle of equal treatment of men and womenâ with the term âapplication of equality between men and womenâ throughout the proposal, we cannot support these amendments because this would go beyond the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty.
Article 13 authorises the Community to take action to combat discrimination, in other words to safeguard the equal treatment of men and women.
It does not grant it wider powers to promote equality or to guarantee full equality in practice.
Although Article 3, paragraph 2 of the Treaty makes provision for the Community to aim to promote equality between men and women in all its activities, this provision cannot change the nature of the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty.
I refer to Amendments Nos 1, 5 parts one and two, 11, 18, 23 part two and 42.
Finally, Mr President, regarding the last proposed amendment, Amendment No 45, which proposes that the Member States engage in dialogue with non-governmental organisations working to combat discrimination and the social partners, we agree in principle but we believe that the wording should be broad enough to cover all the agencies involved, because there are other organisations which represent social agents, such as consumer associations, social organisations and so on.
I am sorry I had to overrun my speaking time, but at least the good news is that we see that we men shall live approximately the same number of years as women.
Â Â  By all means, Commissioner.
You have made full and wise use of your speaking time.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner said that he could not accept our Amendments Nos 35 and 36.
He is doubtlessly aware that there is an âinsuranceâ directive, specifically devoted to insurance, and that Article 18 of this directive requires that insurers calculate sufficiently prudent premiums taking account of future commitments.
I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission has checked, with the legal service, whether the proposals before us are compatible with the âinsuranceâ directive.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as far as these arguments are concerned, I should like to say that the objective of the directive is to apply the principle of equal treatment of men and women.
The use of gender-based actuarial factors is not compatible with the principle of equal treatment and, consequently, must be abolished within the framework of the directive.
That is why the present directive is based on Article 13 of the Treaty, in a bid to combat gender-based discrimination.
The objective of the directive is not to legislate to regulate the operating terms of the internal market and, as such, Article 95 is not a suitable legal basis.
Â Â  Thank you for that clarification of the law, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

The Commission can accept the following amendments: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 107, 108, 111, 112, 114, 115, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 137, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158 and 164 to 209.
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 22, 28, 30, 31, 43, 50, 51, 59, 67, 68, 69, 70, 75, 76, 79, 89, 91, 92, 93, 98, 105, 109, 110, 113, 116, 117, 127, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 156, 159, 160, 161, 162 or 163.

Â Â  Mr President, today, and over the next few days, dozens of farmers from Karditsa, Trikala, Larissa and Magnisia in Thessalia and from other areas of Greece will stand in the dock accused of having taken part in rural demonstrations held in order to rebuff the all-out attack on them from the common agricultural policy and avoid being wiped out, so that they can stay on their land and in their villages.
The previous government responded to the reasonable demands of the farmers with hundreds of rural tribunals, which were set up throughout the country and sentenced farmers in order to break their fighting spirit.
Governments come and go but the rural tribunals stay.
The criminalisation of rural demonstrations is designed to terrorise the fighters of poor and middle-class farming into stopping their fight to overturn this policy, which has brought such hardship to Mediterranean products and to their income and has resulted in the abandonment of the countryside.
The new Greek Government which, when in opposition, said that it disagreed with these prosecutions, is keeping quiet like a new Pontius Pilate.
From this tribune we condemn the pogrom continuing even today of the fighters of the rural movement and we demand an immediate end to it.
It is certain that no trial or sentence will break their fighting spirit.
The poor farmers will fight to stay in their villages and on their land, they will continue their productive activity, because it is a question of life for them and their families.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
â Report (A5-0120/2004) by MrÂ Obiols i GermÃ , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republics of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama
â Report (A5-0119/2004) by MrÂ Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the signature of a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Andean Community and its Member States, the Republics of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, of the other part.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate and, looking at the speaking list, I am sure it will have been worth waiting for!
It is very important for us to have the opportunity once again to discuss the European Union's relations with Latin America, and I am particularly pleased that we have the views of two very distinguished colleagues who know so much about the subject and who have committed themselves so enthusiastically and knowledgeably to strengthening our relations over the last few years.
The agreements which we are discussing today mark an extremely important step forward in our relations with Central America and with the Andean Community.
I am therefore grateful for the strong support that the European Parliament gave to them.
As the House knows, the commitment to negotiate new political dialogue and cooperation agreements with each region was made at the Madrid EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit in 2002.
The European Union has delivered on this commitment.
Negotiations were successfully and rapidly concluded after just two rounds in October 2003, and both agreements were signed on 15Â December in Rome.
These new agreements are ambitious.
First of all, they institutionalise and strengthen the political dialogue: the San Jose dialogue with Central America that was initiated in 1984 and the ministerial political dialogue conducted with the Andean Community that goes back to the 1996 Rome Declaration.
Secondly, they expand the scope of both the political dialogue and the European Union's existing cooperation with the two regions, for example, by including some new areas such as migration, conflict prevention, good governance and counter-terrorism activities.
Obviously, having negotiated these agreements as rapidly as possible is not enough.
We must also make sure that they enter into force quickly and I hope that ratification procedures on both sides will be speedy.
This is important, because the new areas addressed by the agreements reflect the very real concerns of both regions.
At the European Union-Latin America and Caribbean summit in Madrid it was agreed that the conditions were not right to launch negotiations for association agreements.
These political dialogue and cooperation agreements were seen as an intermediate step: the aim of the agreements is to create the conditions which would allow the negotiation of association agreements, including free trade agreements, in the future.
The Heads of State and Government also defined what the main requirements were for advancing towards an association agreement, notably the achievement of deeper regional integration and the completion of the Doha Round.
I would like to take this opportunity to underline the importance of the recently negotiated agreements as an instrument towards our common goal of negotiating association agreements with these regions in the future.
We are now two years beyond one summit, on the eve of another â the Guadalajara Summit â and we must re-assess our relationship with these regions.
There are many questions we should ask ourselves.
To what extent are the conditions we set out in Madrid still valid in the light of recent developments?
How should the absence of substantial progress in the multilateral trade negotiations affect our relations with these regions?
How can we ensure that we do not inadvertently in any way undermine our principal trade objective of promoting multilateral agreements and completing the Doha Development Round?
Otherwise, would we not risk the opening of such negotiations becoming a mere political gesture, as we want agreements with content that go beyond what can be agreed at multilateral level?
Is there an acceptable political formula to cover all these objectives?
Regional integration remains of key importance: it can contribute to fostering political stability, economic and social development and social cohesion within each sub-region.
The Commission considers that further progress towards deepening integration is a sign of political and economic maturity.
How can we measure progress in regional integration?
I believe the essential elements for measuring progress revolve around three fundamental elements: a fully operational institutional framework, the existence of a customs union and the reduction of obstacles to intra-regional trade.
The next joint step should be to evaluate progress achieved by both regions with a view to preparing the ground for the opening of negotiations.
I would underline that this process should be carried out in an objective manner and we should not set impossible standards that might only lead to frustration among our counterparts.
The Commission has always supported regional integration.
We are convinced that it should continue to do so.
This support is not only one of words: under our regional programme for Central America, the Commission has approved one project in support of the Central American Customs Union worth EUR 8 million in 2001 and a second one in support of the regional integration institutions and the involvement of civil society in the process of regional integration worth EUR 15 million in 2003.
A further project in support of the development and implementation of common policies to the value of EUR 10Â million is currently under preparation.
In the Andean Community, projects on statistics, customs, competition and trade-related technical assistance, together worth more than EUR 15Â million, are being implemented and there are plans to strengthen this form of cooperation in the forthcoming revision of the regional strategy paper, adding another EUR 4Â million to the economic regional integration objective.
Central America, the Andean Community and Latin America as a whole are not suffering from a lack of interest from our side.
In the current financial perspectives from 2000 to 2006, funds for Latin America are about 20% higher than in the former financial perspective.
