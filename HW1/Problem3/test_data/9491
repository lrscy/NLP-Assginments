That was very helpful, and for it I want to express my warm thanks.
I would like to put the following questions to the Commission.
Firstly, the Commission was equipped with good ideas, but its lack of any strategy for how to communicate and convince meant that the public perception of the EU was that it was almost always on the defensive.
Other states were astute and adroit enough to depict the European Union as standing in the way of progress for its own selfish reasons.
What improvements is the Commission planning to make to its communications strategy?
What, in practical terms, does it propose to do and when?
Secondly, the original objective of the Doha development round was to agree on an ambitious programme for the reform and liberalisation of trade policy, particularly for the benefit of developing countries.
As we have seen, not least before, during and after Hong Kong, it is an unfortunate fact that more and more people associate the term âglobalisationâ with danger rather than with opportunity.
Here in Europe, we see a whole generation completing their school education without having learned the fundamentals of the social market economy and world trade, and that is why they are easy prey for campaigns of misinformation and untruths.
We also see our media running reports on the relocation of jobs almost to the exclusion of anything else, and certainly not about the creation of new jobs or the additional prosperity that world trade brings.
We can see people being made more and more insecure by this and by the campaigns run by radical groups with the intention of spreading fear and misinformation, and funded with European money.
In the plenary sitting of 12 May, the Commission undertook to put forward a plan for a proactive campaign, to be run while the WTO negotiations were in progress, to persuade people of the benefits of world trade.
No such plan has as yet seen the light of day.
Is work being done on one, and when will it be produced?
Thirdly, is the Commission planning to classify China as a market economy, even though that is no more justified than it ever has been?
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
I should like to begin with a few positives.
First of all â and I believe that no one has mentioned this â the fact that the final text tackles the US abuse of food aid and that the âsafe boxâ has been created is very important.
Secondly, it is important that the text reins in the worst excesses of the âblue boxâ.
The final text also contains quite hopeful language on the special products and on the special safeguard mechanisms.
Those are positives.
Aid for trade is also welcome, although I have reservations about the World Bank and the IMF being in charge of it, bearing in mind the emphasis on conditionalities for which they are so well known.
Like my colleague Mr van den Berg, I am very keen to know where the EURÂ 1Â billion promised by President Barroso at Gleneagles is going to come from.
There are huge gaps in the budgetary promises that have been made.
When I chaired a press conference of the ACP Group in Hong Kong I got a real sense of their feeling of frustration and betrayal.
On sugar, bananas and cotton the WTO has done the ACP no favours.
Mr Mandelson, these countries are our natural allies, but unless we really prove that we have in place a Doha development mandate, and that we are honouring that mandate, then I believe that in the months ahead we will not be able to rely on our ACP colleagues.
Also, it is absolutely critical that we have new long-term substantial funding for the Sugar Protocol countries.
Realistically, can we, in the short time available, make progress on ending dumping, on confirmation of the developing countriesâ rights to protect their farms, their infant industries and services?
Will we put in place fair and equitable access for developing countriesâ exports?
Those are essential.
It is a formidable list.
Can you do it by 30Â April, Commissioner?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong addressed quite a number of important global trade-related issues; however, the results offer no reason for celebration.
Only one report from the negotiation group on trade facilitation was approved by consensus, and there were virtually no results in the service sphere.
Some difficult negotiations are awaiting the Commission this spring.
In reality, the trade interests of the 149 developed and developing countries are very difficult to reconcile.
The WTO, as an organisation with its own regulations and decision-making procedures has, in the last five years, failed to come to any decisions; we have to admit that the WTO is undergoing a crisis.
Therefore, I invite the European Commission to initiate WTO reform: to modify regulations and decision-making, to add new dimensions to the regulations, for example social and environmental issues, and to promote fair trade competition among all WTO members, both developed and developing States.
I would also like to add that trade must no longer be treated as independent and in isolation from production, labour safety and environmental concerns.
Trade is only the outcome of economic activity.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the debate practically everything has been said.
Perhaps the most important and relevant thing, as the Commissioner has said, is that Parliament is fully involved in the negotiation being carried out by the Commission.
With regard to the assessment of Hong Kong, we have heard everything; nobody is entirely satisfied.
It is like the metaphor involving the glass: some see it as half full and others see it as half empty.
Has it been a complete failure?
No.
Has it been a complete success?
No.
Perhaps the success is that it has not been a failure, which it appeared it might turn out to be initially.
What role has the European Union played?
I believe that it is fair to acknowledge that the Commission and the Commissioner who has been in charge have played a very worthy role, and we should acknowledge this here.
We should also acknowledge â I believe this is only right â that this Parliament has been kept fully informed by the Commission's services, which is a very important step in terms of the work to which the Commissioner has referred.
Some people would have liked us to have given more ground on agriculture, but the European Union has clearly done it duty in this field with the reform of the CAP, as it has also done with the reform of fisheries by means of the CFP.
There are other people who need to make progress in this field and, as other speakers have said, perhaps what has most grated in this House has been the United Statesâ hypocritical position with regard to the European Union in the field of agriculture and also on development issues.
We have not made any progress on services, and others must be committed to opening up their markets to our large services companies: it is crucial for everybody.
For them as well, since services affect all economic sectors and this is a crucial issue for the European Union.
Talks and negotiations are continuing.
They are complex. Skill, patience and plenty of will to hold dialogue and reach consensus are required.
We want the Doha Round to be concluded to the benefit of everybody, everybody giving ground and reaching a satisfactory compromise with a view to freer and fairer trade, with multilateral and more transparent rules.
In this regard, we would like to thank the Commissioner for remaining in contact with Parliament.
As you have said, involving Parliament means involving the citizens.
We represent the citizens and it is very useful that we are all in agreement.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, despite the gloomy predictions, the Doha Round for Development and the WTO are still alive.
Though we must now carry on working with a tight timetable.
I am also grateful for the cooperation that we have maintained during this last Ministerial Conference and I believe that, as has been said, this House must remain closely involved in the whole negotiation process, including the General Council in Geneva on 30 April.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on the achievements on the elimination of export subsidies and similar measures.
Nevertheless, Commissioner, could you go into more depth on the commitments and the timetable agreed by our commercial partners with regard to export credits, food aid and State companies?
Since time is at a premium, has the Commission decided on any political initiative to encourage the main players, including the emerging economies, to respect their commitment successfully to conclude this development round this year?
Finally, how do you believe the agreements reached in Hong Kong will affect the negotiations of the desired agreement between the European Union and Mercosur?
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to return to this complex matter. I am simply going to emphasise a few considerations in order to highlight our keen interest in having a European Union that is there to act as a political tool for debates on subjects such as international trade.
I join others in thanking you, Commissioner, as well as MrsÂ Fischer-Boel and MrÂ Johnson from the European Council.
With regard to the date scheduled for the end of export subsidies in 2013, I have proposed an independent audit of all the forms of aid supposedly aimed at making a distinction between, on the one hand, aspects that are related to humanitarian issues and that must come under the public spotlight and, on the other hand, aspects that distort the rules of competition in international trade and that must be eliminated if the prevailing hypocrisy on this matter is to be dispensed with.
I should like to draw your attention to five points.
Firstly, in a complex world, it is vital that nations have a space worldwide for multilateral dialogue so they can discuss international trade issues.
Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the parliaments, which are the elected representatives of their nations, were not as fully involved in the negotiations as the non-governmental organisations were.
The Member States need to understand that it is no longer possible to call on parliaments to vote in favour of funding international trade agreements and so to ratify them, without involving MEPs in the negotiations.
Next, it is imperative that we protect access to our agricultural markets in the period of uncertainty just beginning.
We will need to be ready to fight with regard to the dossier on geographical origins, which is a battle far from being won.
Fourthly, a significant, forward-looking project needs to be developed, Commissioner, with a view to carrying out a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the economic and social impacts on Europe of all these negotiations. One such example is the impact on employment.
In this regard, we could usefully draw on the work done by the European Economic and Social Committee within the Single Market Observatory.
Finally, it is vital for the economies - particularly the Western economies - which create their wealth through the use of market principles, to help implement real mechanisms aimed at eradicating poverty in the world.
If we, as democrats, do not do so, then we will pay a very high price in political terms, not least through the rise in extremism.
Â Â  Mr President, Hong Kong achieved its reduced ambition of outlining a roadmap, and what that shows is that the road ahead is rocky and will require most of its leading drivers to make some sharp twists and turns.
What we have is a development package which is not generous enough, a date for ending export subsidies which is not soon enough, proposals on GATS which are not flexible enough, and a NAMA formula which is not fair enough, as well as an acknowledgement of the need for special and differential treatment which is not yet clear enough.
So we made progress in Hong Kong, but a lot remains to be done and the Commissioner will be well aware of the expression: âa lot done, a lot to be doneâ.
I believe that most of the blame for what still needs to be done does not lie with the European Union; it lies with our leading partners.
I would like to add my thanks to the Commissioner and his staff, and to the Council under the British Presidency, which made great efforts to push many of these items along.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I doubt very much whether we could we have expected more from the WTO Summit in Hong Kong.
Why would countries commit themselves at this stage if the final result has not been scheduled until the end of this year?
It stands to reason that more time has been taken out to strike the best balance between aid to poor countries and attention to the economic strength of our own.
I think that the participants are motivated to reach new trade agreements.
Good agreements are needed to prevent trade becoming a Wild West story.
Law and order in trade is in everybodyâs interests.
I am also confident that eventually, the idea of improving the position of the poor countries will enjoy wide support.
As such, I see the outcome as a promising intermediate step.
A great deal needs to be done, though, before we can call this a real development round.
I am pleased with the commitment to abolish the export subsidies in agriculture, including the indirect ones.
I also welcome the initiatives, such as Everything But Arms from other countries, which must also apply to more of their products, and also all LDCs.
I would also include the effect of a special and differential treatment, as well as capacity building.
I am pleased that the Commissioner shares my view that this round should be a development round, and I should like to congratulate him on his energy and commitment.
I think that he is negotiating from a particularly difficult position, because his mandate is known to the public beforehand and is the result of a public decision-making process in the Union.
It is a good thing that the Member States have consistently presented a united front, and perhaps unfortunate that the European strategy, more than that of other negotiators, has been under attack, sometimes even from European quarters.
Might that be the reason why the European Union was often dealt the bad card, even if it is much stronger and does much more than other countries?
In order to prevent the negotiations in Geneva from going without public support, I would ask the Commissioner to apply the same level of commitment when entering further into the negotiations and continuing to inform the EP about the state of affairs and about the strategy, with a view to making the necessary progress, even in important areas such as counterfeiting and services.
Indeed, much needs to be done in those areas.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the Hong Kong round is over, and where does the WTO go now?
While it is indeed the case that nothing concrete has been achieved, it has to be said that the lines of communication are not down, and that, under these circumstances, I regard as psychologically very important.
The points I would like to make today have more to do with the general situation.
For a start, Commissioner, you have made very good use of the negotiating mandate that you were given.
There was general praise for the way in which the EU, for once, achieved something by acting absolutely as one, even though we were to some extent forced into a corner.
More is, however, expected of us than of the other industrial states.
Secondly, you collaborated extremely well with this House, seeing it almost as a matter of obligation to inform us, whether in person or through others.
There is always room for improvement in anything, but we really did get very extensive information and involving us in the work going on was done very well.
The question is, though, whether that is enough, and how things can be done in the future.
I believe that Parliamentâs rights in foreign trade matters need to be reinforced as a matter of urgency, and that this is a quite separate matter from the constitutional treaty.
As globalisation goes further and deeper, the policy areas associated with external trade become ever more important.
When a policy area becomes important to the public, the publicâs elected representatives need to be able to have their say about it, and that is why we need to be able to have more influence over the Commission and be able to monitor it more closely.
In saying this, I am looking into the future rather than criticising the work they are doing now.
Â Â  Mr President, I note that in his opening remarks, replying to Mr BarÃ³n Crespoâs oral question, the Commissioner asked for Parliamentâs suggestions about future activity and future developments.
My understanding is â and this is an issue which has not so far been raised in this debate â that both Ukraine and Russia are candidate members of the WTO.
Does the Commissioner have in mind a timetable whereby accession of these two very important economies might be envisaged, and what might be some of the steps necessary before membership were to be achieved?
I have in mind one area which I understand is not subject to WTO discussions: energy.
Parliament will be debating that later this week.
But equally, agricultural products from a Member State, Poland, were blocked by Russia for reasons which many would find it difficult to understand.
Presumably, Commissioner, you would be very supportive of the notion that common rules should be observed and respected by all Members, whether or not their form and understanding of democracy and respect for international commercial law happened to coincide identically with our own.
This is an important point.
We have dwelt, so far, on development relations between what used to be described as the First and Third Worlds.
The Second World, as I understand it, was the then-Communist dictatorship bloc.
How do you see our relations improving in that direction?
Â Â  . Mr President, in response to the last question â which bears almost no relation whatsoever to the subject matter of this debate â let me say that the honourable Member makes a rather good case for Russia and Ukraine being brought into the WTO, because they would be subject to international rules and to the dispute settlement machinery of the WTO.
However, for them to enjoy that privilege, they have to accept certain undertakings unambiguously beforehand, and that remains the subject of continuing discussion between us.
I will try and be brief, but a very large number of points and issues have been raised in this debate.
I cannot do them all justice.
I welcome the ideas that have been put forward by Members.
I hear the criticisms that have been expressed about what we have done and needless to say I am grateful for the praise and compliments, but I am only too well aware that praise comes to a negotiator when he does not do anything wrong.
The test for the negotiator is for him to do something right.
That is harder, and that is the challenge held out before me in the coming months.
I am in complete agreement with the Member who said that we need to strengthen the rights of the European Parliament in relation to trade â I have always said that â and, in the spirit of the times, given that our relationship is going so swimmingly, I cannot think of anything I would rather have than a strengthened relationship between us.
A word to those who have expressed concern about the international criticism that has been directed at the European Union.
It is criticism up to a point, but a better word for it is propaganda.
All is fair in love and war in international trade negotiations, and we have to understand that where our negotiating partners arrive at a convergence of interests, notably in respect of agriculture, you will find a cacophony of voices directed against us, all of which have one goal in mind, which is to place pressure on the unity of the 25 Member States: to seek to divide the 25 and as a result, find advantage for themselves in the negotiations.
That is why the unity that we found in Hong Kong is so important.
It is not just a question of giving ourselves the comfort of solidarity amongst ourselves; unity of argument and message is the best riposte to the propaganda that will be aimed against us.
As it happens, my judgement is that whilst the propaganda will not fall away and its decibel count will not go down, whilst those critical voices will maintain their shrillness in years to come, they are becoming less convincing and finding a weaker reception amongst many of the international commentariat who follow these negotiations in detail.
I have found, since Hong Kong, a rather more balanced and nuanced appreciation of the content of these negotiations than I found on previous occasions.
But we do not just have to find responses to peopleâs criticisms and propaganda, as a number of Members have quite rightly argued; we also have to reach out and find allies.
We are not going to complete this round unless we are able to find some accommodation between ourselves and the interests and negotiating objectives of the G20 group of emerging economies.
They are not homogeneous, but they have an effective discipline which I welcome.
We would not be able to negotiate as we are; we would not have the prospect of finding a satisfactory outcome if we did not have those G20 countries, the emerging economies organised as they are and brought together as coherently as they are, in these negotiations.
I think therefore that post-CancÃºn, yes, it gives us a lot of grief sometimes in the European Union to find our negotiating partners so well organised, but on the other hand the opposite of organisation is chaos and chaos is the enemy of a successful trade round.
However, just as I welcome our negotiating partners in the G20, I think those Members who have pointed out tonight that we need to cement our coalition of interests and our relationship with the ACP countries are also correct.
One thing I have learned and that has been borne in on me since I took up this post â something that some Members might bear in mind, given some of the contributions that have been made this evening â is that when you appeal to, or respond to, or try to accommodate the interests of certain developing countries, more often than not you will find yourself taking away from, or denying opportunities to, or dissatisfying, other developing countries.
And so it is the case that when we are criticised, as the Commission has been on one or two occasions this evening, for not taking agricultural reform fast enough or far enough for the interests and benefit of certain rather more competitive developing countries, we have to understand that during the course of that reform, the further it goes or the faster it goes, the more pain we will be causing other developing countries to experience.
So when I travel around, whether it be in Africa or the Caribbean, the street demonstrations that I face are not amongst the poor and exploited of the world who want us to go further in agricultural reform; in my experience of street demonstrations it has been people from some very poor, needy and deprived developing countries who are asking us to go slower in our agricultural reform, not faster.
To an extent this is a question of compensating developing countries for the adjustment that is necessitated by that agricultural reform.
Mrs Kinnock has quite rightly highlighted the issue of sugar.
The Commissionâs approach â and I say this on behalf of Mrs Fischer Boel as well as myself â is clear.
We proposed EURÂ 190Â million per year for each year between 2007 and 2013 for our proposed sugar action plan agreed with ACP countries.
But the compromise that was found on the budget means a 20% reduction of the money that we thought we would have available for that action plan under the relevant heading.
That is an unattractive prospect, if we are going to have, through budgetary constraints, to retreat from the original ambition of the plan that we set forward.
Tonight I invite the European Parliament to help the Commission ensure that there is enough money to make that action plan a reality and to make sure that it genuinely meets the needs of those sugar-dependent ACP countries with whom we have had such an important historical relationship â a relationship we want to carry over as meaningfully to the future â and to help us ensure that that budgetary allocation is sustained.
I will certainly be pushing to maintain the original EUR 190 million, but we in the Commission are not the budgetary authority; you and the Council are.
Therefore I appeal to you to exert your best efforts to bring this about.
I should like to mention another issue that constantly arises â quite rightly â in these negotiations, concerning investment in services and a service-based infrastructure of developing countries.
Liberalisation in services is as important a part of the inbuilt agenda of this round as agriculture.
I want to stress that our purpose in these negotiations is to boost commerce, because trade drives inter-economic growth.
But boosting commerce, to my mind, is not the same as commercialising what other countries and governments legitimately want to keep within the public realm.
That is their choice.
That is the policy space to which they are entitled.
No part of this negotiation concerning the liberalisation of services seeks to erode, let alone remove, the right to regulate public services.
Take the example of water, as one Member already mentioned: where are developing countries going to get the capital investment, the transfer of technology, the transfer of management skills to operate the most efficient water industry in their countries that they can possibly get, to bring about the distribution that they so desperately need, if it is without foreign investment, foreign know-how and foreign transfer of technology?
We must keep a sense of perspective about this whilst recognising and safeguarding developing countriesâ rights to regulation.
With regard to agriculture â and incidentally, there is no question of excluding agriculture from these negotiations; anyone who ever dreamed that might be either desirable or possible has long since seen that dream disappear, never to return â we have an obligation to liberalise trade in agriculture, but we have to do it in a way and at a pace that are manageable and absorbable by European farm communities and that strike the right balance between the interests of different sorts of developing country; and, as I say, they are not the same.
However, as European agriculture changes and evolves, the importance of specialised production and products and of those products associated with geographical indications becomes ever greater.
That is why the protection of GIs remains not only an important but also an indispensable condition for our completion of this round.
I say this not only to Mrs Mann but also to others.
This is a single undertaking and that means that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.
In my view that is very important.
It is a necessary protection that each WTO member has to ensure that their vital interests are not shunned or overlooked.
If there were no single undertaking, no principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then we would be much weakened and not only us but also other WTO members would be less able to protect their vital interests.
In my view GIs are of vital interest.
In conclusion â and I am very much aware that I have not responded to many of the points made or taken up a number of the points â NAMA is an important issue; I shall address these other issues in remarks I shall be making in a weekâs time â let me just say that these multilateral trade talks are very important.
Why?
Because multilateralism is important.
Multilateral processes and institutions are important.
Yes, the European Union pay extra into this round and into this system in order to keep alive, to strengthen and to carry forward the multilateral values and principles that are at the heart of this round.
We will not pay indefinitely and we are not a bottomless pit, but it is true that we are prepared to pay for our principles, not only for the sake of our principles, but also because in a multilateral trade round the potential benefits for the global economy and for us in Europe and for the poor and needy people around the world are multiplied to a far greater extent through a multilateralisation of the agreement that we reach than any set of bilateral agreements between ourselves and other countries or regions could possibly achieve.
I am not ignoring the bilateral agenda.
Indeed, we have negotiations, whether it be ongoing, in the case of the Gulf States; ASEAN, potentially, when we have our roadmap put in place; and Mercosur.
Incidentally, we need to consider what we are going to keep back from this multilateral agreement for our bilateral Mercosur negotiation.
First and foremost we must make the multilateral talks successful.
It will be a huge challenge in the coming months to achieve that, the way in which we can strengthen international trade rules to drive up standards of trade and social and labour rights, and trade in environment as well.
There is a very great deal to achieve in a relatively short space of time.
If in the coming months I can get as much negotiation in as Mrs Kinnock did in her one-and-a-half minutes, I will be travelling at a reasonable rate.
It is a wee bit challenging for me to do that.
However, given the number of things you have mentioned and registered, which we will carry on in our discussion tomorrow morning, if I can match a part of the same rate of progress I will not be doing badly.
Â Â  I must close this very long debate. We are out of time.
The normal working time for the interpreters is until 10 p.m.
We still have another debate, so we must move on.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â It comes as no surprise that MrÂ Mandelson says he feels that the âdeveloping countriesâ are not convinced that opening up the markets is a good thing for everyone.
Let us remind ourselves of the true face of the liberalisation of world trade by the major economic and financial powers: every three seconds a child dies of avoidable causes; hundreds and hundreds of millions of people live in poverty, whilst wealth is concentrated at the cost of the exploitation of workers and of the resources that belong to the whole human race; in the past two decades, levels of inequality rose in 53 out of a group of 73 countries.
As far as Mr Mandelson is concerned, the rise from 55% to 60% in the WTO negotiations, which was described by the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Pascal Lamy, as a âresounding successâ, rescued the summit from failure.
The most important thing, they say, is that the negotiations are not âderailedâ and that more are scheduled.
We therefore continue our fight for food sovereignty and safety, for the right of each individual country to develop its economic potential in order to satisfy the need and aspirations of its people, for public services, for labour rights, against water privatisation, and against the patenting of life.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on climate change.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to debate with you the results of the successful conference on climate change held in Montreal in December.
In Montreal, apart from the 11th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we also had the first meeting of the parties which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
I was particularly delighted by the presence and positive action of the ten Members of the European Parliament at the Montreal conference.
It underlines the importance which both our institutions ascribe to meeting the challenge of climate change and to the role of the multilateral procedure in the course of doing so.
Our constant contacts and cooperation in Montreal bore fruit.
It is therefore important that we also continue this practice at future conferences.
The outcome of the Montreal conference is an important milestone for multilateral negotiations on climate.
The Kyoto Protocol has now been put into full operation, while the agreement on the Montreal action plan paves the way for discussion of future international cooperation on climate change issues.
This will safeguard, among other things, greater security for the European carbon dioxide emissions market and for the private sector.
The enumeration of the political achievements at Montreal is truly impressive.
Firstly, we agreed to launch two official dialogues on the subject of the future regime for addressing climate change.
All the parties which have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, including the United States and Australia and, of course, all the major developing countries, are included in the Convention dialogue.
A thorough, forward-looking dialogue will be held on the basis of the Convention, in the form of four workshops to be held over the next two years.
The results of the dialogue will be presented at the Conference of Parties in 2007.
The Kyoto dialogue will be used to discuss further emission reductions by developing countries on the basis of the Kyoto Protocol for the period after 2012.
A special ad hoc United Nations working group has been set up within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol.
This party will complete its work as quickly as possible and in time to ensure that there is no gap between the first and second Kyoto commitment period.
Secondly, all the necessary decisions were taken in Montreal for the full functioning of the Kyoto Protocol as follows: the operating rules of the Kyoto Protocol, known as the Marrakech Accords, were approved in their entirety.
The compliance decision makes the Kyoto Protocol binding for all parties and makes provision for a Compliance Committee to be set up.
The five-year adaptation work programme contains a full set of activities, including work designed to further enhance our knowledge of the impacts of and the problems caused by climate change.
It also includes specific tasks to design adaptation and the application of adaptation measures.
The Adaptation Fund will finance adaptation activities.
Its funds will come from contributions to the Clean Development Mechanism which will probably start to be paid in 2008.
Thirdly, the Montreal Conference went further, making the Kyoto Protocol a stronger and more effective system.
The Clean Development Mechanism was strengthened.
The executive and supervisory role of the CDM Executive Board was made more transparent and stronger.
The secretariat will hire more staff, in order to improve the services which it provides to the Executive Board and its committees.
The parties also pledged a sum of money to the operation of the Clean Development Mechanism.
Most of this money will constitute the contribution by the European Union.
The joint implementation bodies were also set up.
The preparatory work carried out on the Clean Development Mechanism can also be used for the approval of the joint implementation tasks.
This means that it is possible to speed up the approval of the joint implementation tasks for which plans have already been drawn up.
The European Union also pledged a sum of money in order to strengthen the committee supervising the joint implementation mechanism.
Finally, the European Union used the Montreal Conference to demonstrate its significant progress in the application of the Kyoto Protocol.
The numerous positive reactions which I received reinforce my conviction that the response of the European Union to the climate challenge may not only also be the most effective from the economic point of view, but may also offer a competitive edge to European businesses.
The acute interest in the emission rights trading system which we have introduced makes it clear that we are an example worth following.
The European Union has acquired a leading position internationally in combating climate change.
It continued to support the Kyoto Protocol when serious doubts overshadowed the beginning of its entry into force.
Nonetheless, we must always be conscious of the fact that greater efforts are needed within the Union.
Most of the Member States need to apply additional measures in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives.
New joint measures will also be needed at European Union level.
The current second stage of the European programme on climate change will help to determine the optimum measures.
I should also like to touch on the question of dialogue within the European Union on climate change.
I believe that the agreement to launch an international dialogue achieved in Montreal is an important stimulus for the European Union.
The strategy of the European Union seeking to supplement the process at the United Nations with bilateral commitments and to focus on confidence building and on including the views of the other parties has proven to be successful.
The Montreal conference ratified this approach.
The European Union now needs to cooperate with all sides, especially those with a large share of emissions, such as the United States, and the countries with emerging economies, in a constructive dialogue on broadening participation in the future international regime in the climate change sector.
I consider that Montreal marked a new phase in international cooperation to combat climate change.
The period of inquiry is over.
We now have an international system with all the necessary mechanisms.
Consequently, our efforts are focusing on consolidating it and on safeguarding its functioning.
However, we cannot rest on our laurels.
Climate change requires urgent action and concerns us all.
Drastic cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases will be needed if we are to stabilise and then reduce concentrations of these gases in our planet's atmosphere.
That is why, this year, in the second phase of the European programme on climate change, we shall discuss new initiatives in a bid to strengthen our climate policy.
This second European programme on climate change will include an extensive review of the policies of the first stage in the climate sector, which includes the European Union emission rights trading system, action on capturing and storing carbon dioxide, air and other forms of transport and other issues.
On the basis of this review, I shall propose new initiatives to strengthen our climate policy, depending on the results of this process of consultation with the interested parties.
I know that I can count on support in this task from the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, despite the absence of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is to be hoped that we will, tomorrow, be united in confirming that Parliament will take climate change and a future climate policy seriously.
The resolution that is before us tomorrow gives a good and complete overview of the results and expectations of the climate conference held in Montreal last December.
Let me start, though, with heartfelt congratulations for the whole EU delegation that took part in that conference.
Both the British Presidency and the Commission were instrumental in bringing about the positive outcome in Montreal.
As parliamentary delegation, we too tried very hard to do our bit.
I think that the unison we displayed was a decisive factor in Montreal.
The conference was a success and the climate resolution reflects our appreciation for starting the dialogue about future climate policy.
The resolution looks ahead to the second period of commitment after 2012 and also welcomes the United States on board, even though we remain critical about the lack of commitment on the part of the Bush administration.
Innovation is needed to combat climate change.
The directive on tradable emission rights is an important indicator of the EUâs commitment and still deserves our full support.
Montreal is good news, but we have also witnessed some bad news in recent weeks, such as the impact of a hitch in the energy supply, or the gas crisis, between Ukraine and Russia.
A conflict such as this very aptly illustrates the desperation and dependence in which the EU does not want to find itself, and proves once more that the European Union must build in a guarantee of secure energy supply.
The European Union can only attain this energy certainty by means of ambitious policy, common sustainable energy policy based on energy certainty, diversification and energy savings.
This policy has a chance of success, though, only if huge forward strides are made on all fronts.
Commitment to environmental technology is now more than ever necessary, as are serious efforts with a view to the involvement of developing countries.
Only ambitious policy can ensure that the EU can shake off this unfavourable position of dependence and that global warming remains restricted to two degrees.
We have tabled three amendments on environmental technology, the energy crisis and the developing world, and we would ask you to support them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have served in national parliaments where debates were timetabled to a second and the inability of this Parliament to get its act together means I have to apologise to the Commissioner because I will have to leave before hearing his concluding remarks.
today reported scientist James Lovelock saying that, frankly, it is too late already.
The multiplier effect is going to mean that the pace of climate change is going to accelerate and there is little we can do.
When you read the European Environment Agency reports that glaciers in Switzerland retreated by 10% in one year alone, in 2003, you think that maybe he has a point, that we are just not realising what is happening.
Here we are in this fantastic palace of energy use, debating what might be the end of civilisation.
Montreal was a success, but only in relative terms.
I am very conscious of the heavy burden you bear, Commissioner.
I cannot think of a single person on this planet who has more direct responsibility for coming up with solutions to try and take the world forward, to try and take the economic block and therefore the world with it.
You are hemmed in by ridiculous policies â we are still subsidising coal production â and economic priorities come to the fore, as they must, but sometimes to the detriment of the attempts we are all making to try and deal with these problems.
So, I urge you, be bold and be ambitious.
Let us not pretend that the Emissions Trading Scheme is somehow going to curb aviation emissions to a great extent.
We need more measures; we need aviation fuel tax.
If we are to deal with car manufacturers, we have got to set mandatory limits on CO2 limits; we have to have smaller cars.
It is ridiculous: we are losing the world for the sake of people wanting to drive around in giants.
I urge you, Commissioner, take the lead.
Governments will always complain and criticise you, but they need you.
They will scale back your ambitions, but unless you aim high, you are bound to achieve low.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is little time for this debate and so also to prevent climate change.
Researchers are extremely worried about the rate at which climate change is progressing; they are worried about what sort of world their children, our children, will be living in.
They say that the human race has 10 years at most to bring emissions right down: or, as Chris Davies said, perhaps it is already too late.
At Montreal it was merely agreed that talks on future reductions would be started.
We all know that the United States of America is the troublemaker where protection of the climate is concerned.
The EU now has a major responsibility; our role as leaders must therefore be made clearer.
At the next conference on climate the presidency of the EU will be held by Finland, which took an extremely vague line at Montreal.
Now we need to pull our socks up.
Finland and Austria should work with the Commission to draft a clear EU proposal to other countries.
We need a programme for the EUâs own emissions reductions for the period 2020-2050.
Businesses also need one.
For them to invest wisely, they need to be able to calculate the value of their investments and the price of their emissions in the years to come.
Â Â  . Mr President, in my view, far more attention should be paid to promoting public transport; one alternative, as someone has already suggested, would be an ecotax on the airline industry.
Why do airline tickets have to be so cheap?
Since flying is in any case generally not an option for people on average incomes, a hefty tax surplus would be a quite appropriate way of benefiting the climate.
In addition, I think it is a real disgrace that the nuclear energy lobby is constantly misusing the problem of climate change in order to get itself back on the map.
Where climate change is concerned, attention should first and foremost be paid to really sustainable alternatives.
Whilst the conference in Montreal was a minor success, it was not enough â not by a long shot in my view.
That is why the EU should send a strong message that it is serious about continuing the fight against climate change.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, the report on the reform of the United Nations recognises climate change as one of the most significant threats to global security.
The Kyoto Protocol has promoted the use of renewable sources of energy, but in order for positive development to continue the European Union must show more initiative in further developing these energy sources both in Europe and elsewhere in the world.
The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol following its ratification by the Russian Federation is a positive development, but in order to reduce climate change the USAâs involvement is also needed, as that country is responsible for one quarter of total emissions.
In my view, the USA ought at the same time to step up its focus on energy efficiency and conservation measures.
Several highly-developed countries can achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets for reasons unconnected with climate policy.
We should also bear in mind, however, the rapid development of China and India, for instance, which are home to a third of the worldâs population and where it is essential to find a balance between the needs of development and environmental protection.
I would like to call on the European Commission to pay particular attention to the disparity between the promises made in the Kyoto Protocol and steps taken to fulfil them.
I also call on the Commission, working together with the European Parliament and the Council, to formulate and actively defend a European Union strategy in talks at the UN forums on the future of the Kyoto Protocol and post-2012 commitments.
Â Â  Mr President, we know that climate change is dangerous and that it has been triggered not only by worldwide industrialisation and explosive population growth, but also by changes in nature.
We also know that there is no stopping it even in the event of an immediate halt to the increase in greenhouse gas concentration.
The appalling disasters that occurred in 2005 showed us what nature is capable of and may well be no more than the first indications of what we can reckon with happening frequently in the future.
Even though they have sustained enormous damage, the USA and Australia are not prepared to implement the Kyoto Protocol once and for all.
Six countries are responsible for almost 50% of worldwide greenhouse gas production, and we must step up the pressure on them to a substantial degree.
We here in Europe, though, are doing little better than they are if we now go back to singing the praises of nuclear power as an alternative compatible with Kyoto.
If we do not soon make a start on at last implementing the environmentally-friendly technologies for propulsion and energy that we have developed, on putting a stop to the squandering of water and on the abolition of subsidies for trans-European transport, then we will be condemning our children, and their children in turn, to life in a permanent state of ecological emergency.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was a member of Parliamentâs delegation to the Montreal Conference, and saw at first hand the efforts made by Commissioner Dimas and the British Presidency to reach an agreement, which, while not ideal, was very reasonable.
Despite the US Administration once again causing a great deal of trouble up until the last moment, common sense eventually prevailed.
Unfortunately, the US Administration does not wish to understand that the Kyoto Protocol does not pose a problem for the economy.
As Bill Clinton rightly said in Montreal, clean technologies and energies are a new economy that will create new business opportunities and new jobs.
According to a report by the European Environment Agency, Europe has witnessed climate change in the past two years on a scale not seen for 5Â 000 years.
The four hottest years on record were 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2004.
If we continue at this rate, without effective action, global warming will cause ice-sheets to melt in the north and the spread of deserts in the south.
We must, as a matter of urgent priority, go further, and do more to honour the Kyoto Protocol.
According to Professor Jacqueline McGlade, we need a gradual shift away from taxes on labour, and investment towards taxes on pollution and the inefficient use of materials and land.
We also need reforms in the way that subsidies are applied to transport, housing, energy and agriculture.
We need subsidies encouraging sustainable practices and efficient technologies.
Will we have sufficient courage to do what we have to do?
One thing is for sure: if we do not act right away, we will be mortgaging our childrenâs futures.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Dimas, you have the most important task of all the Commissioners.
If it is you that fail, the Commission too fails.
You are MrÂ Barrosoâs guide.
It is time we realised that it is climate chaos we are facing.
There is no negotiating with Mother Earth.
We are guests in her house and we must follow her rules.
That is why we must quickly limit emissions.
We must introduce carbon dioxide charges on products from countries that do not observe the Kyoto Agreement.
It would create pressure for better politics in the United States and Australia.
Countries that do not accept responsibility for the climate should not be able to be parasitic upon our earth.
Current economic policy and trade policy have failed, and they create climate chaos and devastation instead of well-being and prosperity.
Sorting this out is a matter of urgency.
We need trade rules that observe the rules of the earth rather than those of short-sighted lobbyists.
Legal proceedings cannot be taken against climate chaos.
We need aviation taxes, carbon dioxide charges on imports, better rules governing emissions from cars, better transport policy and better trade policy.
Only then can we take care of our earth.
Â Â  . I shall make brief comments.
I absolutely agree that climate change is one of the most serious, if not the most serious problem, which the world is facing today.
Of course for the European Commission, and for me in particular, climate change, as I have repeatedly emphasised, is one of the main priorities.
Of course, we have been fighting all this time to achieve the objectives which we set at the beginning of the year in our communication, which the European Parliament also adopted and which made the relevant recommendations for winning the battle against climate change.
This communication was the main document which set out the relevant arguments and on the basis of which the overall debate was held which terminated in the Montreal agreement â and not just in Montreal, but also during the intermediate discussions at the European Council, at Gleneagles at the G8 summit, in Bonn and during other discussions held before Montreal.
It therefore shows how important the contribution of the European Union was, both with this communication and the various interim discussions at bilateral level which we held with countries such as India, China and other rapidly developing countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, which are countries that emit large quantities of carbon dioxide, and with the climate of confidence which we cultivated throughout this time so as to achieve this success.
Of course, our ambitions were much bigger â and are much bigger â but on the basis of the Treaties, as I said earlier, this was a success.
We still have a long way to go and I agree that already today we are experiencing climate change.
There has already been a 0.7Â° Celsius rise in the temperature and many of the phenomena we see today are due to climate change.
As I said earlier, we are seeing various weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, prolonged droughts or floods in other parts of the world which are in keeping with scientists' predictions relating to climate change.
Not all these incidents may be connected or we may not be able to connect them directly to climate change, but they come within scientists' general predictions.
Of course, the phenomenon we are seeing today, the melting of the glaciers, both in the Alps and the Arctic Circle, the possible change in direction of the Gulf Stream, the rise in sea levels and a series of other phenomena will have serious repercussions on life, health, the environment and the ecosystems of the whole of mankind, which will be all the greater in the very poor countries, which do not have the means to deal with these consequences.
We therefore have a truly huge obligation, a huge duty, to address climate change.
The European Union really is the global leader on this issue.
We honestly are making an effort and we hope that we shall persuade countries which are not showing willing to cooperate, such as the United States, which we referred to earlier and which is presently emitting more carbon dioxide than any other country, to follow this path.
I am convinced that, in the not too distant future, all these countries, especially developed countries, will follow.
Of course we also want the developing countries to contribute in their way, in accordance with the principle of the United Nations on joint but differentiated participation, to combating the greenhouse effect.
I honestly believe that with you, with your help, which we urgently need, we shall be able to help combat this major problem for the world as a whole.
Â Â  Â I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on market access to port services (COM(2004) 0654 â C6 0147/2004 â 2004/0240(COD)) (A6-0410/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrÂ Jarzembowski and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the work they have done to improve the Commissionâs proposal.
This new proposal by the Commission for a directive on market access to port services meets the requirements already identified by the Commission back in 2001 when it adopted its first proposal on the matter.
The proposal we are debating was presented by my predecessor, MrsÂ de Palacio.
It pursues the same objectives as the previous proposal, namely to ensure that port services are freely provided, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty â as confirmed by the European Council via the Lisbon Agenda â the completion of the internal market in the port sector and the implementation of the conclusions of the 2001 White Paper on transport, which put forward solutions designed to reduce congestion on the road network and to increase cohesion with the peripheral regions.
Clearly, all of this should be done in complete accordance with the regulations in force relating not only to the environment â the regulation on maritime safety and security â but, above all, to social employment and to social protection.
Furthermore, the text stipulates that the Commission shall adopt guidelines on state aid for ports and that the ports concerned must comply with the provisions of the Commission directive on financial transparency.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to underline the importance of having efficient ports: ports are a vital link in the transport chain and in the development of the motorways of the sea.
Ninety percent of our external traffic passes through our ports.
We need a clear framework of rules that promote investment in our ports.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has made the changes it felt were necessary in relation to the text that was rejected in 2003.
I am nonetheless aware of your reservations about this new text and, for that very reason, I wish to listen closely to the debate due to take place, the main motivation for which I have pointed out: the modernisation of our ports with a view to further developing the port sector in Europe.
Thank you for listening.
MrÂ President, you emphasised the number of speakers. I believe that this debate will, in any case, be very enlightening for the Commission.
I therefore thank in advance all those who are due to take the floor and once again express my thanks to the committee and its rapporteur.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am much obliged to the Vice-President for the clarity with which he has spoken and for his willingness to engage with this Houseâs factual arguments.
Let me remind the House of the fact that all the arguments for or against a directive on sea ports have been the subject of intensive debate for months, and that there are two things that were determined as long ago as the Committee on Transport and Tourismâs hearing last June.
One is that everyone involved in what goes on in ports â from the port companies to the shipping lines â is in favour of unambiguous rules on transparency to create fair competition between sea ports.
The same can be said of all the groups in this House, and I might mention that none of them, in the course of the Transport Committeeâs deliberations, have tabled any substantial amendments to the provisions on transparency in the Commission proposal, and so I find it quite incomprehensible that four groups should move that the Commission proposal be rejected outright, for in so doing they are preventing the introduction of the rules on transparency.
It follows that, if you are in favour of transparency and fair competition, you cannot under any circumstances throw out that part of the directive.
Turning now to the issue of market access, it was clear from the hearing that there are very divergent interests at stake here.
The providers of port services, in other words the businesses currently operating in ports â container terminals, watermen, lightermen and so on â do not, of course want these things regulated at European level; they would like to see them remain in the national sphere.
Those who use port services, for example shippers and the business sectors that produce and ship goods, believe â and I think they are right to do so â that market access requires a European regulation.
That is why I believe that the right, laid down quite clearly in the EC Treaty, to establish oneself and offer services, must apply in sea ports as much as anywhere else and that we need to bring in fair and unambiguous regulations to make sure that it does.
I shall now proceed to set out, in brief, just five arguments in favour of European regulation of market access.
Firstly, it is to the benefit of new service providers that market access should be facilitated in the first place by means of regular invitations to tender for public leased areas, in the absence of which no new provider of port services will ever have a chance to get into the market.
Secondly, it is to the benefit of existing businesses handling goods in ports that these transitional provisions are intended to secure public leases, in theory at least for a period of up to 46 years.
What we are proposing does not, then, do anything to jeopardise any business or put even one single job at risk; on the contrary, the long transition periods make it possible for existing businesses to continue operating.
Our proposals are the right ones in terms of the interests of the port workers, since we want to delete self-handling from the directive.
We take the view that there is no need for European rules on self-handling, since it is not even possible in container traffic, which is the typical activity of a modern harbour.
The fact is that there is not one single container vessel that possesses the loading gear that would enable its own crew to load or unload containers.
I have already explained how the long transitional provisions secure the port workersâ jobs, and, at the end of the day, there will be no danger of social dumping or of any deterioration in working conditions, for it is stated quite explicitly in this directive that it does not interfere with Member Statesâ social security arrangements or with free collective bargaining.
Fourthly, our proposals are the right ones when it comes to securing the interests of shippers and of the businesses that use them, since, if new businesses come into the market, they can make their choice among the most efficient and best-value service providers and will not â as they currently do in some ports â have to contend with a monopoly situation in which they have to take what is put in front of them.
Fifthly, the directive, as amended, is right from the economic and consumer point of view, since it is vital to exports and imports, and of benefit to our consumers, that all ports be regulated even more efficiently and economically.
I do therefore believe that fair market access combined with protection for jobs and of the existing businessesâ interests is the best solution.
You have before you 140 amendments to that effect, and I urge you to vote on their substance rather than turning away from making a decision based on facts.
If you throw out the Commission proposal lock, stock and barrel â that is to say, not just the part that deals with competition, but also the part covering transparency â then there will be no European regulation, and, in its absence, nobody will have the certainty needed to plan ahead or any certainty as to what the law is.
Do not let yourselves be swayed by yesterdayâs strikes.
I thought it inconceivable that it could have been the trade unions that, by the use of false arguments, induced these people to come here.
Let us not allow the flares fired off by some of the demonstrators to show port workers in general in a bad light.
Let us come to a fair decision in this matter â that is my plea to the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which, of course, was not appreciated by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
I too regret the violence that we saw yesterday, but we must understand the frustration that the dockers are feeling at the moment.
This is a most ill-informed proposal from the Commission.
It is an absolute insult to Parliament that it was brought back in virtually the same form within 18Â months of its initial rejection.
It is a real insult to the only directly-elected democratic institution at European level.
The Commission should have thought very carefully after that initial rejection.
As was the case with the Services Directive, there is some really flawed thinking at the centre of this directive.
The idea of self-handling is ludicrous. It is a recipe for disaster and a health and safety nightmare.
What we need in the loading and unloading of cargo is a dedicated, trained, experienced set of people, not an onboard workforce which would be exposed to the dangers of hurriedly loading and unloading cargo.
Pilotage was included in this proposal.
I represent Teesport in the north-east of England, which is one of the busiest ports in Europe and serves a massive chemical industrial complex.
Highly volatile cargoes enter and leave that port every day.
The notion that you can tender for piloting services for ships of that description in order to secure the lowest price is, again, ludicrous.
It would put in danger not only the workers involved but also the entire population of my region.
The Commission should have done the sensible thing: it should have revised this proposal completely before it brought it forward.
I hope that it will readily withdraw it when we reject it tomorrow, as I am sure we will.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this House had rejected the port package, the Commission, through the agency of the Commissionerâs predecessor, delivered a fresh consignment in the form of a container with an extra dab of paint to indicate that this was a second package, even though its content is more or less identical to the first one.
The Commission has had the nerve to table a proposal which shows, as Mr Hughes rightly pointed out, that it ignores the voice of Parliament.
We would have appreciated a little more respect, but the Commission seems to have considered our input somewhat superfluous. It could deal with this on its own.
The Commission has road-tested self-handling and tomorrow, we will see that this can go wrong.
Self-handling is, of course, not the only problem.
Our group, too, believes that this proposal â of which we are highly critical â is probably heading for a rejection, and we realise that the rapporteur, who most definitely deserves our respect, has not, despite persistent efforts on his part but as a result of all these circumstances, managed to find a majority for an acceptable, useful and viable solution on the basis of this proposal.
If this does not kill off the port package or the port package journey altogether, then we know that we have to change tack and opt for a totally different approach.
We need an approach that focuses on solving the real problems, an approach that gives due consideration not only to investment goods, but also to people.
We need one that offers legal certainty to everyone, and for that calm consideration is vital. Down with the confrontation model.
Long live the consultation model.
Perhaps, Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission, you will be so kind as to tell us whether, when you table fresh proposals, you intend to take your time conferring with all parties involved beforehand.
Â Â  . Mr President, perhaps I might say, before I say anything else, that the behaviour indulged in by some of the dockers yesterday here in Strasbourg goes far beyond what is tolerable or permissible in political life.
By all means protest and demonstrate, but violence and vandalism are out â they cannot be allowed and must be denounced.
Let me now turn to the matter in hand.
In the past, we talked about clean waters and clean ports and campaigned for them.
We enacted legislation on the subject, one example being the November 2000 directive on port waste facilities.
If the port package belongs anywhere, that is where it belongs, in amongst the portâs waste; that is the right place for it.
That being so, Social Democrats and many others will, tomorrow, reject this âport package IIâ directive.
Why is this so?
The answer is quite simple.
The Commissionâs draft takes no account whatever of the realities of life in most of Europeâs ports; its intention of interfering in functioning, economically successful structures and using an enormous and expensive bureaucracy to impose on ports a competition that already exists in almost all of them, is intolerable.
At the end of the day, the most important thing is that what is at stake is a lot of skilled jobs; families and livelihoods are at risk, and that is what this is all about.
I have not, so far, heard a single reason to justify putting these jobs at risk and needlessly jeopardising social harmony in Europeâs ports.
There is no reason to do so.
We are told that the fundamental freedoms â which are constantly invoked â are not guaranteed in ports.
There may be a few ports like that in Europe, but unremitting competition is a fact of life in most of them.
It is only natural that there is limited space in most ports for those who want to provide port services, and by no means will every one of them get their chance at once, but that is far from saying that any one of them is discriminated against.

Let me give, as an example, a pedestrian area in the smartest part of a city.
Not everyone gets the chance to practise his profession there either, but does the Commission want to do something like stipulate a tendering process in future, simply because a German hairdresser is unable to rent a salon on the Ramblas in Barcelona just when he chooses to?
That is simply not on.
This is not just about Europe as a location for maritime business but also about how we Europeans measure up against the other continents.
If we want to maintain our European social model, we cannot go presenting Asian businesses with European ports on a silver platter â and, by the way, our European ports are in any case much more efficient than Asian ones these days.
You, Commissioner, inherited this questionable package from your predecessor, Mrs de Palacio.
Knowing that you are not the sort to go hunting for legacies, we suggest that you rid yourself of this one â we will help you do it.
The sort of proposal we want from you is one that cannot, in essence, be seen as anything other than European.
What is needed is a European policy on ports, and fair competition between them, along with a proper policy on the portsâ hinterlands.
We have to get European ports to compete properly with the rest of the world.
If that is the sort of policy you want, Commissioner, then we are right behind you and will gladly work together with you in producing one.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, almost 50 years since the Community was founded, there is now still no specific legislative framework for port services.
The ports sector is the only transport sector in which problems involving the free movement of services have to be solved one by one by the Commission and via the Court of Justice.
Of course, port services come under the fundamental freedoms listed by the EC Treaty â that is to say, freedom of movement and the right of establishment, as mentioned by yourself, Commissioner â and the general principles of the Treaty do not take full account of the special conditions that apply in ports.
That is why a legislative framework is needed for the ports sector.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are, then, in favour of a ports directive, albeit not in the form presented in the Commissionâs proposal. Indeed, very few people support a directive in that form.
We have supported the rapporteur, MrÂ Jarzembowski, in his efforts to transform this directive into something more sensible.
In the light of the developments reflected in MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs efforts, I have been surprised at the violent demonstrations against the Commissionâs proposal, which does not, of course, have an earthly chance of being adopted in its present form.
MrÂ Jarzembowski is to remove self-handling from the proposal in order to make it less controversial.
That said, we have to listen to bizarre and untrue assertions about Filipino dockworkers poised to take over the jobs of port workers.
Meanwhile, the port workers have repaid the good will that exists by staging disturbances in front of our Parliament building and smashing a large number of windows in the facade.
I think this shows a lack of understanding of, and indeed contempt for, the democratic process.
We need a ports directive that can establish the framework for free competition between service providers in ports and also for such freer competition between ports as will provide a safeguard against state aid that distorts competition.
The Commissionâs very point of departure is that, by putting an end to the monopolies, we could obtain more efficient and better run ports.
We should then see more goods transported by ship, something that would reduce the burden on both the roads and the environment.
This objective has, however, been completely lost sight of in the debate.
It has to be recognised that the Commissionâs proposal contains a number of weaknesses.
We think that better account needs to be taken of the ability of service providers to pay interest on, and write off, the often very large investments they have to make.
There must be better transitional rules when new service providers take over from old ones.
If the directive ends up being rejected â as many of us believe, but do not hope, it will be â the document should be used in future work involving a new impact analysis of legislation in this area.
Given the chaotic nature of developments so far, it is understandable that many should want the Commission to withdraw the proposal.
I have to say that my own group does not have a unanimous view on the approach we should adopt to this issue.
Precisely in view of the chaotic way things have gone, there are many who will simply vote against the proposal, but we continue to be interested in a ports directive.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is in itself quite a feat to be able to present a Commission proposal that has been subject to so much and such intense criticism by so many people, for that is the case here.
We were all, of course, able to witness what happened yesterday, namely, as Mr Piecyk stated a moment ago, that the port workers, sadly only a minority, went way beyond what is acceptable and tried to shoot themselves in the foot.
This was a rather absurd thing to do since it was directed towards the only European institution that has defended the interests of the port workers in the past and is apparently doing so again now.
This absurd action should not, though, detract from the port workersâ main, and constantly-stated, objection, namely that if an unchanged Commission proposal is adopted, there is a considerable risk that well-trained, experienced people will be replaced by cheap, badly trained shipsâ crews, and that is not something we should be encouraging.
What is striking, of course, is that it was not only the trade unions that displayed their dismay.
Port services and port employers in numerous European ports also appealed with us not to introduce any more red tape relating to new rules.
If you read the impact studies that have been carried out, then the conclusion is that if this directive is adopted unchanged, it will result in uncertainty and fewer investments, and will have an adverse effect on the quality of port services.
I should like to add a third argument for the Commissionâs attention.
Why is it that whilst your Commission, in the person of its President, has always claimed that Europe should only draft legislation if it is necessary, if it adds something and if it cannot be done at national level, it has now tabled a proposal that tries to solve a problem in a number of ports in southern Europe by saddling all European ports with uniform rules?
My groupâs conclusion is that we should reject this proposal.
I would urge the Commission to stop tabling proposals of this kind and instead to bring proposals which will meet with support in Parliament.
We should really clamp down on proposals for state aid.
I urge you to try to solve the problems in southern European ports in a different manner.
Â Â  . Mr President, legislation at European Union level or the imposition of obligations to harmonise national legislation of Member States is only of any use if it solves problems.
For the people working in the ports, this port directive only causes them.
The Commission has opened up the possibility of self-handling, as a result of which trained specialists, who know how to move cargo safely and accurately, could well be replaced by cheap shipsâ crews from outside of Europe.
Even if this Member State obligation is taken out of the directive, it still remains detrimental to ports where governments own the portâs inner harbours, the quays and adjacent industrial sites.
As a result of compulsory periodic tendering for operators, the people who work there could lose their jobs when the contract expires.
Continuity will then remain possible only in private ports, provided, that is, that they do not go into receivership or are not bought by the competition.
This proposal has met with huge opposition, starting in 2003, when it was eventually rejected at third reading, only for Commissioner De Palacio, just before her departure in 2004, to leave the repeat of this proposal behind like a ticking time bomb.
An important underlying motive may well have been that there were interested parties outside of ports that wanted to make transport by sea even cheaper.
That is astonishing, given that the rates in Europe are lower than those in Asia or America and also because they are only a negligible part of the production costs for industry.
Commissioner De Palacioâs official main argument was to promote shipping between Spain and Italy as an alternative to the huge stream of lorries that drive along the southern coast of France.
Even without a port directive, this short-distance sea transport appears to have skyrocketed already in recent years.
Moreover, it is reported that the impact on the German, Dutch, Belgian and French ports along the North Sea and the Channel with their major common hinterland would create chaos.
As long ago as 1998, this House took the view that a possible port directive should focus on putting investments paid with taxpayersâ money in the public domain and that it should also focus on the extent to which the rates included cover the costs.
The Commissionâs two subsequent proposals did nothing of the kind.
Nevertheless, whilst up to a week ago, the Christian Democrats and Liberals, half of this House in other words, were backing this proposal, now, virtually nobody seems to believe in it anymore.
We can defuse this time bomb in tomorrowâs vote once and for all.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the French delegation of the Independence and Democracy Group is in favour of promoting maritime transport.
In the current legal context, maritime transport yields good results.
In 2000, 41% of the bulk consignments transferred within Europe were transported via maritime transport, compared with 43% transported via road transport.
Yet, do we need this port services directive in order to promote this effective mode of transport?
The aim of this new proposal is to overcome the failure of the first package on port services, which was rejected by this very Parliament.
This new proposal takes up the main points contained in the first arrangement.
The scope remains the same, the list of services is identical and the promotion of competition remains excessive.
The few changes affecting this text do nothing to improve it.
The authorisations issued to the providers of port services genuinely give rise to suspicion.
The burden of new procedures will give rise to a whole host of disputes, and the management costs will increase as a result of legal uncertainty.
The authorisation periods do not take account of the long period of time required to justify significant investment decisions.
This succession of patch-up jobs belies an impulsive move made without any serious impact study.
The study published by the British Transport Ministry on 26 August 2005 even falls under the heading of aggravating circumstances: an increase in the ticket granting entry into the market and an allowance granted to large suppliers at the expense of small companies.
Changes affecting self-handling are re-igniting criticism of social dumping.
This crucial issue shows just how central the Bolkestein Directive continues to be to all of the Unionâs arrangements.
Therefore, despite Article 4 and the exclusion of transport services from the âServicesâ Directive, we know that these are the kinds of ploys we are used to in this House.
Yes, maritime transport needs specific and precise reforms.
Yes, this directive is primarily designed to disguise a new and obvious failure on the part of the Unionâs institutions.
Yes, maritime transport needs sovereign States that make it clear how they stand.
ConsequentlyÂ âŠ
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft ports directive that we are discussing at the moment is a classic product of the former European Commission.
When it submitted the draft in the spring of 2004, the European Commission carried out no research into its impact on the new European Union Member States, with the result that, for example, the Baltic states ports would under this directive be obliged to compete with Russiaâs ports in a situation of unfair competition.
Therefore, however much the rapporteur tries to find a compromise on this draft directive, it is clear that doing so will be very difficult.
Unfortunately, it may be that the organisers of the violent demonstration and various supporters of that demonstration on the left wing of this Parliament will tomorrow celebrate a victory.
However, stage what events they will, I would like to say to those who espouse the relaxed social standards of the old Europe that without major reforms it will not be possible to maintain those standards after all.
Â Â  Mr President, this rehashed directive will be decided during the Presidency of Austria, which has no ports at all.
It follows a chaotic vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when there was real doubt about the correct result.
Britain, may I remind you, is an island with over 100Â commercial ports and the biggest, Southampton, is in my constituency.
It adds over GBPÂ 2Â billion to the British economy every year and the local economy enjoys another GBPÂ 200Â million from the cruise industry alone.
These are big numbers.
As a global trading nation, the United Kingdom handles more international freight than any other EU country and port management there is driven by free enterprise and market forces.
There is no public ownership, no state subsidy, so expansion in the development of facilities and services in British ports depends on retaining the confidence of private investors and high standards of service and employment.
This directive will undermine confidence in those standards because it interferes in freely negotiated commercial contracts.
It imposes controls that are neither necessary nor desirable.
It seeks to solve problems in state-run ports that simply do not exist in Britain.
The port authorities know, suppliers of services and facilities know, customers know: the only people who do not appear to know are those in the Commission.
Even ship pilotsâ proper concerns over safety have met with indifference.
Do we really want novices piloting the biggest container ships in the world up narrow tidal waterways and trying to berth them safely?
Whenever the EU starts talking about creating a level playing field it reveals a fundamental ignorance of enterprise.
British ports use their initiative and investorsâ money to create competitive advantage: the very opposite of a level playing field.
If passed, this directive will cost without yielding benefit and will slow down growth and confidence.
The House should throw it out.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, from the previous positions and events relating to the demonstrations in Strasbourg and other areas of Europe, we have all realised that we are debating an issue which is very serious in its dimensions and repercussions.
We should therefore be attentive to its multilateral parameters and, at the same time, more efficient in the objectives we wish to serve, by which I mean economic development, competitiveness and convergence between the areas of Europe.
That is why we welcome the Commission initiative to propose a regulatory framework which is missing from the European Union more than fifty years after the establishment of the European Community.

We therefore have before us the option of acquiring a regulatory framework which will lend transparency to the operation of services and relations with government and other authorities and which will also give greater competitiveness to our ports, not only in the major ports of Europe, which are losing ground against Asian ports, but also in other secondary ports, which will have the possibility, on equal terms from the point of view of competition, to develop so that they can also address the explosion in international trade and the advantages which will emerge from the European Union policy on short-haul maritime transport or sea buses.
We must be ready to reap the benefits of these policies.
However, we would like to see an impact study, in advance, before we reach a final result; this is something we do not have today and relates to the lack of transparency and the lack of a regulatory framework in Europe.
However, we must try, at both European Union level and Member State level, to have such a study and we would also like this proposal for a directive to be integrated into the framework of a broader port policy, because competition is not just a regulatory framework, it also relates to services that give access and efficacy in general to the functioning of ports and transport.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join many others in the sharp criticism levelled at the Commission for the way in which it has handled this issue.
It remains astonishing how the Commission, less than a year after the previous port directive was rejected, launched a fresh proposal without consulting the sector, or Parliament for that matter, knowing full well how sensitive this issue is.
I would like to make a point of saying this because I am convinced things could have gone differently had there been a willingness early on to enter into dialogue with the parties involved.
I do know, however, that Mr Barrot is not particularly happy with this dossier either, and my comments are therefore not meant for him personally, but they need expressing nevertheless.
He knows, as well as I do, that it is not only the methodology, but also the content, of the text that meets with major opposition in the sector.
The trade unions are obviously concerned about the extent of self-handling, but the proposal has also come under heavy criticism from ports, port companies, pilots and even ship owners.
Mr Jarzembowski deserves credit for making an attempt to save the day despite all this, but I beg to differ with him as far as content is concerned.
Given the way in which this dossier was submitted and subsequently received by the sector, we have no choice but to reject it comprehensively and to ask the Commission to go back to the drawing board.
Approval would be an act of bad governance, certainly because we have no idea whatsoever what the outcome of the vote could be.
If you want to build a house, but know that the foundations are inadequate, you have no choice but to stop the building work and start again.
Rejection means that the ports will simply be able to continue working, as they have done for the past 40 to 50 years with spectacular growth figures in many cases.
This does not mean, of course, that we can afford to sit back.
The Commission should take its time, mull things over, enter into a discussion with the sector and study what there is in ports that really requires a European approach.
A fresh Green Paper or White Paper, as is suggested by some, strikes me as a good approach and the Commission can, meanwhile, focus on what is needed across the sector, namely clear rules on transparency with regard to government investments.
We need to reject this proposal first, though.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, having rejected it during the last legislature, today we are once again dealing with the Commissionâs proposal for the liberalisation of port services, and we find ourselves once again in practically the same situation, because, in substance, the text we originally rejected has hardly been changed at all.
The proposal is similar and the rapporteur is the same person; I say this with respect and affection for my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, but I believe that this proposal will also be rejected by a majority.
Being generally in favour of the liberalisation of the markets and also of port services, I cannot support the present proposal; firstly, because the intention is purely to deal with services provided within each port, with the healthy intention of promoting free competition, but not to deal with the very real practices that breach the rules on competition amongst different European ports.
I believe that numerous aspects of the normal practices in many ports need to be changed.
I believe that some of the abuses and forms of contracting imposed on service providers are unacceptable.
Nevertheless, I believe that changes cannot be proposed in such an aggressive way.
We must promote an ordered transition and, on the one hand, guarantee safety and efficiency in port operations and, on the other, safeguard the rights of workers.
I believe that companies have the right to choose workers freely but they should firstly take on those workers who have already been doing certain jobs and whose employment contracts are still in force.
As has happened in other economic sectors in crisis, if there is a surplus of workers, we will have to negotiate a suitable restructuring plan between the trade unions, companies and the administration.
Europe and this Parliament must not be seen by the citizens as an instrument for unbridled capitalism.
Proposals such as this, which we are discussing today and which I hope we will reject, have contributed to the Dutch and French âNoâs to the Constitutional Treaty.
We must modernise our economy, but with the necessary coverage and protection for the people affected, which is the main objective of any political action.
In that way we will have greater moral authority when it comes to condemning the use of violence that we witnessed here yesterday.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greens in this House reject the port package, not least for reasons of good form, since it was presented in haste by Commissioner De Palacio at her last part-session, that is to say at a time when she ought really to have relinquished office long ago.
It looks bad to reintroduce, almost unchanged, a directive that Parliament has already rejected and, so to speak, throw it down before your successor and the House.
Opposition to the port package comes from almost all the Member States; it has been rejected by the conservative government in Holland, the Labour government in Great Britain, and both the former red-green and the present conservative and social democrat coalition governments in Germany.
There is a justifiable fear of an economic backlash brought on by the need for investments to pay off over shorter periods of time, by the expensive growth in bureaucracy and by the fact that competition is already in place.
Costs in EU ports are very low; half of what they are in the USA and one-third of what they are in Asia.
The dockers are justified in going on strike, for they fear wage dumping.
There is no place in a social market economy for a social freeze policy of this kind.
Opposition to the port package comes from an immense coalition of conservatives, socialists and greens.
Let me urge you to join with us in rejecting it and in giving Commissioner Barrot the opportunity to put before us a new regulation that will create the transparency that European ports need.
Â Â  â Mr President, our debate is being held in the aftermath of the mass unemployment demonstration by dockworkers held yesterday in all the ports of the Member States with a great deal of success, sending a perfectly clear message to withdraw this directive on access to port services.
It is also being held two years after its rejection by the European Parliament.
The new version of this directive on ports, despite misleading claims of transparency, guarantees and so forth, is even worse than the one voted down by the European Parliament on 23 November 2003.
There is, in our view, a major political issue here.
Although the European Parliament rejected the directive in question, although the new version of it was rejected in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and although the rapporteur's proposal was voted down in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Commission has insisted that it be brought before the European Parliament, demonstrating once again the correlation between the will of the Members of the European Parliament and the workers employed in this sensitive area.
The new version of the directive includes selling off ports to the private sector, together with the entire range of port services: loading and unloading, stevedoring and storage.
Allow me to close by briefly adding the following to what other speakers have said: one of the basic issues which is a priority for the European Parliament is the safety of life at sea and environmental safety.
Adopting this directive will increase the risks and weÂ ...
Â Â  Mr President, the previous port services directive was rejected by the last Parliament in the 2003 plenary and, as nothing has changed, why should the Commission expect a different answer this time?
Neither management nor staff have shown any encouragement for this legislation.
Yesterday, a Parliament spokesman said that the protests had caused considerable damage, but what will be the damage in British ports if this directive is applied?
New investment of over EURÂ 400Â million by the management of my local ports of Felixstowe and Harwich may be jeopardised if they have to open the services to other companies.
Our British system has worked extremely well for decades, so why should British ports be disrupted when, clearly, this form of legislation is aimed at certain ports on the continent?
It is said that there is a need for greater competition in this sector to promote growth and job creation, but if this directive is applied, at what expense?
Dockers could lose their jobs, the security systems could break down and the safety issue would be jeopardised.
I voted to reject the similar bill two years ago and, as a British Member, I am going to do the same again this week.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, let us overlook the fact that the Members of this Parliament have already, on numerous occasions, come out against the need to adopt such a directive, and their objections have gone unheeded.
If, however, such a directive has to be adopted at any cost, for the sake of opening up the market to competition and creating a legal framework to harmonise port management procedures and to make them transparent, then it should at least be fair and rational.
The current proposal creates a series of distortions and will have consequences that are certainly undesirable, such as a decline in qualifications, with obvious repercussions on overall safety levels.
In particular, it grants the pilotage service alone certain prerogatives associated with safeguarding the safety of shipping, as well as specific public service obligations.
These, however, are characteristics of all technical maritime services, including mooring services, which should therefore be expressly protected and not exposed to free-market rules.
I therefore call for the safety of our ports and the professionalism of their workers to be prioritised.
Otherwise, I shall be forced to vote against the proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, along with most colleagues in this House, I have very serious concerns about the proposals before us.
However, not only do I dislike the content of the proposals, which I will come back to shortly, but I also find it unacceptable that the Commission seems unable to take no for an answer.
Two years ago, along with many colleagues, I found myself sitting in this very Chamber, having this very same debate, where a very similar proposal was rejected.
Commissioner Barrot, why do I find myself in the same position again today?
At a time when we hear that the Commission is about to repeal or will not proceed with over-regulatory legislation, we are faced with the proposals we are now debating.
For the United Kingdom, the content of the proposal has been met with disbelief by the industry.
There is not one port that welcomes the proposals.
Should they be adopted, businesses which have worked hard to become the best performing and most competitive in Europe would be compromised and threatened.
Within the proposals, authorisation periods and tendering are thought to be market-orientated measures that will increase services and competition.
They do nothing of the sort.
Services will be reduced as potential competitors cherry-pick only the profitable areas of business, meaning less development in the sector.
Financial institutions will also be less forthcoming with capital investment as returns will be minimal and not guaranteed, leading to exactly the opposite of what is intended.
I am all for the free market and can support any proposal that is market-orientated.
However, that is not the case with this proposal.
If the EU wants to see a market-orientated approach, I suggest that it follows what we already have in the UK: a tried and tested system.
I call on this House to reject the proposal in its entirety and send a simple message to the Commission: ânoâ means ânoâ in whatever language one speaks, except âEuro-eseâ where it appears to mean exactly the opposite.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, we have a slightly original debate in store for us tomorrow since the Committee on Transport and Tourism has done a procedural âu-turnâ.
We will therefore have to give our verdict on the raw text, that is to say on MrsÂ de Palacioâs âlegacyâ text â the poisoned chalice she bestowed on the European Commission.
Personally, I will be voting against it, not because â as everyone can confirm â I am particularly radical, but for three reasons.
Firstly, I will be voting against the text because we do not have to accept a denial of parliamentary democracy.
We cannot encourage the Commission to reproduce the same texts every time Parliament has voted against them, nor can we encourage it not to listen or to hear anything and to proceed on the basis of a mystical form of ultraliberalism that flouts everyoneâs opinions, including those of the professionals.
Secondly, I will be voting against it because this text is socially unacceptable and dangerous.
It comes down to legalising the same kind of serfdom in the ports that is rife on the seas.
Through self-handling by onboard personnel, it comes down to encouraging our ports to employ Filipinos and Malays in order to be competitive. In reality, it comes down to admitting that was right in June.
It is politically irresponsible because we withdrew a directive on crews, which was a social directive, and we are keeping the port services directive; because, in the context of the âbetter lawmakingâ initiative, we withdrew 60 European Parliament texts in the course of proceedings, yet we are keeping the port services directive; and because, in actual fact, this text gives food for thought and proves all the card-carrying Eurosceptics and those most fervently opposed to Europe, right.
As someone who fought to see Europe exist, I, for my part, believe that this is an insult to us.
Commissioner, I know what your feelings are and I think that the problems related to Europeâs ports are problems to do with the excessive concentration in the North Sea, with saturation, with the disorganisation of road traffic flows on the continent, with the security of the straits â one can see what took place again in the Pas-de-Calais â and with national and regional development.
A port is primarily a site. It is a strategic site; it is not a free-for-all service; it is not a supermarket.
You need to think along these lines in future when you design the new initiative.
Â Â  Mr President, according to the Commission, the purpose of this directive is to make it easier to open up the market in port services and thereby increase the competitiveness of European ports.
In reality, the directive would not open up the market, but instead would increase bureaucracy, reduce the productivity of ports and reduce competition too.
The Commissionâs proposal makes little sense.
The rapporteur, MrÂ Jarzembowski, has certainly done an excellent job and tabled some relevant amendments, but it has to be said that even he cannot accomplish miracles.
If the proposal is unworkable, it will not be made to work here in Parliament.
Europe does not need more poor administration: instead, Europe and we need to ensure the quality of the work done at ports, the safety of employees and their rights and see to it that ports operate flexibly.
The EU must focus on the essential, and the intention behind the Commissionâs simplification strategy is, or at least is said to be, to do away with needless regulation.
In this case at least it has not succeeded.
I hope that the Commission will also apply the principles which it articulates to the directive on port services and everything it does.
This directive will have to be rejected.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today and tomorrow, all eyes of the whole trade union world will be on this House, as will those of everyone who works hard for a more social Europe.
This spring is, indeed, set to become an important time, with, this month, the port directive up for discussion, while next month, it is the turn of the Bolkestein directive.
As responsible politicians, we are given the opportunity to put this House on the map once again and to make clear our refusal to go along with the of ever more competition, ever more privatisation and ever more liberalisation.
By rejecting this directive, we bring home the fact that we want a different Europe, where it is not only the economy that counts, but also the social and ecological dimensions.
Consideration should therefore be given to the people who work in the ports, the dockworkers, who are at risk of losing their jobs, whilst freight should be handled safely and efficiently.
Due account should also be given to the pilots who guide the ships safely into the ports and ensure that minor or major environmental disasters are prevented.
The Greens will therefore reject this directive because we believe that a different Europe is really possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to know if the Commissioner has heard a single speech â other than the one by Mr Jarzembowski, who seemed unsure whether he should say âyesâ or ânoâ â in which someone has taken a favourable view of this port services directive?
There is a wide variety of reasons for repudiating it, ranging from the social aspect to the bureaucracy involved, not to mention our sense that there is something undemocratic about a Commissioner past her sell-by date reintroducing a proposal that has already been rejected.
This House is very definitely united, and I do believe that you could do yourself and the Commission a favour by taking the opportunity of your closing speech to announce that you are withdrawing this proposal, thereby pre-empting Parliamentâs call on you to do just that.
You accept that the interested parties do not want this directive and that your idea of what is good democratic practice is not the only one, and so you stand a chance of bringing in a new directive, one dealing exclusively with transparency and with the aid that ports need.
That would be a sensible way of going about things, and by conducting yourself in that way you would be doing democracy in the European Union a great service.
Â Â  Mr President, that there are problems in certain European ports is not a matter of doubt; what is less certain is that the present Commission proposal will do an adequate job of addressing them.
Adopting a number of amendments will not change this fundamental issue either.
Given, to some extent, the growing resistance to the implications of this proposal among those involved, I would ask you to reconsider whether this measure is needed at this moment in time.
In my view, this proposal is not the right action at the right time despite the imminent arrival of the services directive.
Sectoral legislation for ports is welcome, and rules on state aid in ports are necessary.
This proposal, however, is not equal to the task of standing up to existing problems without imposing excessively administrative and organisational burdens.
I would therefore urge my fellow Members to reject this proposal and would ask the Commission to table a fresh, more focused proposal, together with a proposal for the regularisation of state aid in ports.
I warmly support the amendments that serve this purpose.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we have heard here today and what we saw in the streets of Strasbourg yesterday, naturally gives us a sense of .
It should not, of course, have come to this, had the Commission had the wisdom two years ago to quietly bury its catastrophic port directive.
For years, it has been evident that in the general public opinion and in the European ports in particular, there is no democratic support for this anti-social and ideological package of measures that has not been inspired by political common sense.
Even a young child would know that this â what has now become notorious â self-handling leads to unemployment, social unrest and unsafe situations in the ports.
Nevertheless, the Commission went ahead.
Based on purely doctrinarian considerations, a proposal is now being put before us virtually identical to that rejected by a majority in this Parliament two years ago, without much respect for this Parliament, against their better judgement, and against the will of the large majority of European dockworkers.
The same applies, to some extent, to the Bolkestein directive.
It should come as no surprise that the citizens in France and the Netherlands, as others will do elsewhere tomorrow, turn their backs on this kind of Europe.
The Commission could not be more blind to the social reality in the Member States, or further removed from the citizens in their suffering.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of the fate of this legislation, since it would appear that the House is highly divided, as a Spanish classic said, sometimes we must say what we feel and feel what we say, when faced with unacceptable pressure, however legitimate it may be.
The European Parliament is faced today with a dilemma: either we move forward with the creation of a genuine internal market or we remain in a state of stagnation.
Personally, I have decided to support a proposal whose fundamental principles and objectives are laid down in the Lisbon programme and in the Transport White Paper.
Improving competition amongst port service providers will increase competitiveness and efficiency in ports and contribute to developing goods transport by sea, which is ultimately the main objective of our support for maritime transport in the Union.
One of the fundamental elements of the proposal, but one which has given rise to the most controversy, is the express inclusion of self-handling.
It is fundamental for the Member States to guarantee the recognition of a method for the provision of port services that contributes to the genuine development of short-distance sea transport, which, by its very nature, requires efficiency and speed not just in customs operations, but also, in particular, in loading and unloading.
Ladies and gentlemen, in response to the fears of those people who believe that the approval of this directive will lead to a deterioration in the working conditions of workers, we must make it clear that the directive does not just respect the Member Statesâ legislation on working conditions, training and professional qualifications, but also those that relate to health, safety in the workplace, maritime safety and protection of the environment.
Furthermore, the transfer of loading to ports will increase the volume of operations in them, which in turn will lead to an increase in employment.
Â Â  Mr President, I must point out that my country is standing at a crucial maritime crossroads from commercial and logistical points of view, since we are the European gateway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
That is why it is essential from an economic point of view that we have modern, efficient and well-managed ports, since they must be competitive.
Spanish ports are self-supplying and self-funding compared to other ports; that is why it is necessary definitively to assess the issue of subsidies to ports, that is, state aid.
From a social point of view too, we have well-trained workers, with quality jobs and full employment rights, which is not always the case in maritime law.
Finally, from an environmental point of view, many of the services being talked about are fundamental to safety and to environmental protection.
This new proposal has achieved an unusual degree of unanimity, since even those people in my country who identified aspects that were useful for resolving certain bottlenecks and obsolete practices that persist in our ports, have preferred, and prefer, to reject it today.
Based on my conviction, therefore, that this Parliament will do what it has to do and reject this proposal, which has amply demonstrated its inadequacy in terms of the current needs of European ports, I would ask the Commissioner to be sensitive, as he has shown himself to be in other areas of transport, and, because the global situation requires it, as soon as possible to prepare an updated, necessary and courageous consultation process which deals openly and thoroughly with all of the necessary aspects of European ports.
In that way, within a reasonable space of time, we will be able to find the solutions to making European ports the centres of economic, social, technological and environmental development that Europe requires and, in view of the global framework, they will thereby contribute to better producing a more cohesive Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, having sat through this debate, I have a message for the dockers gathered in Strasbourg.
I say to them that I have heard Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament line up and put forward arguments which are in the interests of the people of Europe, and Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament expressing sympathies with the underlying arguments that they are presenting.
Rather than standing and attacking this House, they should take a step back, listen to what is being said in this debate and give their support to this House.
That is my appeal to them.
Tomorrow, this House will be considering a proposal that it effectively rejected in November 2003.
It is a project that the Commissioner has tried to distance himself from entirely and a process that is democratically deficient, owing to a failure to consider, consult or compromise with those at its heart.
It is clear that this proposal was designed with continental ports in mind, with the desire to liberalise the port services market, which is, for the most part, still nationalised.
That is a welcome and necessary step, but it needs to be done in the right way.
However, the United Kingdom ports industry has set itself apart from its continental counterparts.
Our ports are privately owned. They receive no financial assistance from the government and capital for new investment is raised within the market.
Owing to the large number of thriving ports, the industry already enjoys the healthy competition that this proposal seeks to achieve.
The move to impose such a landlord model on United Kingdom ports will be enormously damaging.
The threat of a trend towards a non-permanent workforce will lead to a lack of job security, lower skills levels, lower wages, a deterioration in working conditions, and will have a detrimental impact on the surrounding communities.
My constituency, in the north-west of England, has a long and proud history in the maritime industry, with ports such as Liverpool, Manchester and Heysham numbering among some of the largest on the United Kingdom coastline.
At its heart is Liverpool, the home of the United Kingdomâs first commercial dry dock.
Under this directive, Liverpoolâs communities, which are already among the most deprived in Europe, will witness hard-grafting dockers being put out of work.
All this with a compensation package on the table insufficient to comply with United Kingdom law, let alone the European Convention on Human Rights.
It is neither desirable nor practical for this House to try to amend this proposal, which is fundamentally flawed.
It is for all these reasons that we must vote this proposal down.
Â Â  â We are yet again presented with an unacceptable proposal to liberalise port services; and this proposal has, yet again, been met by a fierce struggle on the part of the workers to have it rejected, a struggle that we have supported from the outset, just as we did in 2003.
This proposal for a directive forms part of the so-called âLisbon Strategyâ aimed at speeding up liberalisations, leading to a ferocious onslaught against the public sector and on public services.
Quite apart from the crucial questions of national sovereignty that this strategic sector raises, this proposal, if adopted, would lead to unemployment, precarious working situations and work insecurity, especially via what is known as self-handling.
Collective contracts and union rights are under attack; productivity and vocational training are dwindling; the risk of serious accidents is on the rise; and all in the name of competition.
This is a proposal that panders to the interests of the large shipowners.
We have therefore tabled a proposal to reject this directive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are several good reasons for rejecting the ports directive.
Firstly, this is an issue on which each Member State should decide in accordance with the EUâs principle of subsidiarity.
It is for the Member States to adopt positions on this type of issue.
Our basic view is that Swedish rules should apply on Swedish territory.
Secondly, the process whereby the ports directive has again appeared on the agenda is undemocratic.
The European Parliament rejected an identical proposal by the Commission barely a year ago.
Thirdly, the players who would be affected by this directive do not think very much of it.
There is currently efficient competition between European ports.
The ports directive would lead to a distortion of competition because the ship ownersâ own staff would take over the job of loading and unloading.
Who really wants this directive?
Its main advocate is the Commission, which wants to drive through this legislation at any price.
The Swedish June List will reject this legislative proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am convinced that you will get a majority in this House to back a ports directive for Europe if the directive you put before us is well thought-out and really does promote transparency and competitiveness in Europe in this area.
This directive, though, is not suited to that task and so I suggest that you withdraw it.
You must have realised, in the course of this debate, what agreement, across the party boundaries, you have prompted in this House on this subject.
You must surely realise that this draft directive, lacking as it does sufficient underpinning, is ill-prepared for debate.
Even though Mr Jarzembowski has done a splendid job, there is little chance of this House improving a bad directive when one is put before it.
The Commission also needs to get used to the idea that this House cannot be used as a repair workshop for bad directives.
What makes this draft directive scarcely fit for consideration is the fact that important aspects of it are unclear; its definition of markets certainly is.
Is it meant to mean competition within ports, among the ports themselves or something that involves both the ports and the traffic that they share in their hinterland?
No impact assessment has been carried out, nor is it at all clear what benefit the consumer is supposed to derive from all this.
More competition ought, by rights, to reduce handling costs, yet, from what we know, handling costs in Europe are less than half what they are in Singapore or Dubai anyway, which adds up to a good deal lower.
The intention is that they should stay that way, yet this proposal opens the door to the possibility of their being increased.
Will this directive really get more service providers into ports?
I ask you to reconsider it, to withdraw it and put a better one before us.
If it is thought through properly, you will get a majority for transparency and competition in Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a strong, continent-wide economy needs a port system rather than individual ports; it needs a system that will integrate the Europe of 25 and facilitate the transition from allowing competition to strengthening overall competitiveness.
The directive does not achieve that aim and, at a time of profound European political crisis, that is a bad or, rather, a shocking sign of the gap between the institutions and the actual needs of the interests at stake in a globalised world.
All these many interests can no longer be reconciled along old lines.
Inappropriate signs like these have to be eliminated.
What we need is a vision of a common port system, a common policy, and transparent guidelines for investments and state aid.
Such guidelines must not confine themselves to prioritising competition among ports, but must be able to prevent the competitive disadvantages of some of these ports from weakening the whole system.
We need protection for skilled labour that will eliminate social dumping and instead encourage joint training.
We need to protect the efficiency of public services and to recognise their requirements in the areas of safety, quality and accessibility.
Lastly, we need to assess the impact of liberalising the sector, because what we find most worrying at this point in time is the current trend towards concentrating production and logistics in certain ports around the world.
These are the new challenges, and the directive does not meet them.
What has happened between the first proposal in 2001 and this second one is not a good example of European politics.
I repeat, however, that a directive and rules are needed, and achieving them will require a major political commitment that does not shrink from laying down common rules, notwithstanding the autonomy of the portsâŠ
Â Â  MrÂ President, the port services directive presented to us for the second time completely overlooks the general interest and the improvement of the living conditions of Europeans.
What is worse, it only serves the financial interests of the large transnational freight companies, to the detriment of all the actors in the port sector, from the port worker to the small businessman.
Its only aims are those of demolishing the statutes and social protection measures and dragging salaries down in order to make a minority rich, and this to the detriment of peopleâs safety and the environment.
This directiveâs social model is as good as the law of the jungle; self-handling is slavery reborn.
All the technical-nautical professions and all the European trade unions unanimously reject this Bolkestein-style directive for the ports.
Yesterday, I joined the 10Â 000 port workers from all over Europe in demonstrating before Parliament.
I can bear witness to their determination to stand in the way of this monstrous directive.
I can assure you that voting in favour of a directive such as this means taking responsibility for many of the Unionâs ports being blocked by hard-line strikes, with all the economic consequences that such action entails.
I, like others, would point out to the Commission that we, as the representatives of the nations of Europe, had already rejected this directive.
To propose another, almost identical, version of it constitutes a political affront to Parliament and to the port authorities as a whole.
For the sake of the construction of another Europe seeking a high level of social and democratic integration, we call for this directive to be rejected.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I wonder who wants this directive?

There is not a single port agency which is served by or which accepts this directive; all it serves is globalisation and the new order, which you are indeed monitoring and you are indeed following, by which I mean dumbing down.
It flies in the face of logic and it flies in the face of Convention 137 of the International Dockworkers Council, which clearly states that priority must be given to skilled dockworkers.
What are you trying to do?
Are you going to put cartels in the ports?
We in Greece have three-quarters of all the islands in Europe; in other words, we have most of the ports in Europe.
We know how they operate.
There is a positive modus operandi.
We could have quicker results, but with people we know, people with experience.
Are we going to put in unskilled workers to give us better results?
So why are you flying in the face of logic, democracy and the workers' interests?
We do not ultimately want an arbitrary Europe; we want a Europe of the peoples.
Â Â  Mr President, whenever there are demonstrations in front of our buildings, whether here in Strasbourg or in Brussels, we know that they have to do with the defence of existing interests, and if these demonstrations become violent, we know that the balance of these interests is very definitely the number one issue.
It is, though, an unfortunate fact that the slogans and truncheons conceal the real alternatives.
What this is all about, in essence, is not fundamental issues such as liberalisation, transparency and the like, but rather, as always, the details of the practical arrangements.
That is why, in this debate on how to take this directive further, I am right alongside Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, in his desire to improve the Commission proposal, which, it has to be admitted, was not a good one.
Nor am I greatly heartened by the slogan, âBack to the Startâ; if we were to do that, we would simply be wasting a lot of time.
The fact that people are calling for White Papers or even Green Papers is evidence of a desire in this House for five yearsâ rest from being Europeâs legislator.
I see this debate as running parallel not only to the debate on the services directive that we are going to be having next month, but also to the debate on the constitution.
There, too, the issue is not about whether Europe should or should not be âsocialâ, but, in essence, about hundreds of details that go to make up a workable, better, shared Europe.
The only thing is that there is no willingness to talk through these hundreds of details, no willingness to make the effort to seek and find consensus; instead, people would rather resort to slogans.
They may attract the attention of the media, but they help nobody in this Europe in which we share to find their way to better and workable solutions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is a riddle to me why the European Commission should have put forward this proposal again.
We hear of the significant resistance it is meeting, and MrÂ Barrot now has an opportunity to show that the EU is in step with our citizens by withdrawing this proposal.
I think that there are three arguments for doing so.
First and foremost, we do not need the directive.
Many European ports are thriving, as I know is the case in, for example, my own country, Sweden.
Ports are being developed, and there are many flexible solutions.
What we need instead is a directive on competition between ports, as we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have also pointed out.
This proposal by the Commission is for a piece of centralised European regulation.
It is not about deregulation within the ports, as is being made out.
It is a piece of centralised European regulation that we do not need because it would not lead to ports being developed.
On the contrary, it might hinder their development.
Unfortunately, it is not, then, out of concern for the ports and transportation that the European Commission has put forward this proposal.
Such centralised regulations would make it more difficult for ports to carry on their activities.
It would become more difficult to develop ports and transport systems because ports are transport hubs and combined terminals that have to be efficient if the whole transport system is also to be so.
What would be best is to allow regional and local players to develop the ports.
Finally, this ports directive would be bad for port workers.
It is they who would have to pay the price for the centralised regulation proposed by the Commission.
Many job opportunities would probably be lost, and a lot of activities transferred to the lease-in industry, the result being poorer conditions and less security for workers.
It is for many good reasons, then, that I propose that Parliament reject this proposal.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we support the dock workers against this directive, which is wrong for employment, wrong for their right to safety and wrong for the economy itself, because it proposes competition based on dumping.
It must therefore be rejected, as it was in 2003.
We need to think about the kind of collapse to which free-market policies are leading.
Dock work has a glorious, long-standing tradition, which has created rights and prosperity by linking trading activities with the towns that welcomed them.
Without this noble work, which the directive would wipe out for the sake of free-market policies, there would be no future for Europe.
The European social model is our chief resource, and this directive, just like the Bolkestein directive, is the negation of it.
That is why I believe that the workers are right and that this Parliament should endorse their demands by rejecting the directive before us.
Â Â  Mr President, whilst we set out with a premature proposal by the committee, under Mr Jarzembowskiâs leadership, a sound package of amendment proposals was thrashed out with built-in certainty, with more certainty for companies and port workers, and without self-handling.
The news of this last aspect still does not seem to have got through to the trade union movement, or to some Members of this House for that matter.
Sadly, battle and emotion appear to have prevailed over a sound discussion on content and, Commissioner, it is not what you say, it is the way you say it
It all stems from the Commission, your predecessor in fact, who started a flawed discussion.
Why do you not withdraw this directive?
I would like you to explain this for me in a moment, for that would be the best solution all round.
However, todayâs political reality is that there is insufficient support for the hefty package of amendment proposals by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where it enjoyed a narrow majority.
Since there is insufficient support for the package of amendment proposals, we cannot back this directive.
I do remain convinced, though, that we need port policy specifically tailored to Europe.
This has been amply clarified by Members of this House, first among them Mr Jarzembowski, with whom, and on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have tabled a proposal.
We would ask the Commissioner to present a document setting out its vision of port policy in the broadest sense, including competition between the ports, as a basis for what we hope will be a sound discussion this time.
Are you prepared, Commissioner, to draft a substantive discussion document of that kind?
Would you also include the body of ideas from the package of amendment proposals, as prepared by Mr Jarzembowski?
Let us hope that that will prompt a sound discussion.
Â Â  Mr President, when the European Parliament threw out the proposed port services directive two years ago no one believed that the Commission would try to bring it back.
Yet it did not consult, it would not listen and it decided to ignore this democratic parliament.
Let us be very clear about the damage that this law, if adopted, would inflict on ports, including the east coast ports which I represent in this Parliament.
Replacing highly skilled, trained staff with shipsâ crew able to load and unload is a recipe for accidents, injury and, possibly, deaths.
Compare that with the port of Tilbury, which achieved a 50% reduction in accidents in 2005, or Great Yarmouth, which has seen no reportable accidents for two years.
I want to say to Mr Jarzembowski that this law would be devastating for jobs.
Port owners tell me that over 600Â new jobs at Felixstowe and over 750Â new jobs at Harwich would all be threatened.
Not one of 650Â jobs at the port of Tilbury would be safe.
That is what the port owners say themselves and these port owners would see their incentive for vital new investments destroyed.
Already two new investment projects at Tilbury have been put on hold because of the uncertainty created by this directive.
Port expansion at Bathside Bay, so recently approved at Harwich, and the positive decision we very much hope for this week for the Felixstowe South expansion, are both in jeopardy.
I would say to the UK Independence Party, that represents GBPÂ 1Â billion of expenditure, if you check your figures; and we would not even have to be here now but for the fact that your members voted for this legislation in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
On investment again, in Great Yarmouth a campaign for more than a decade to build an outer harbour would see this put in competition with the existing inner harbour, substituting existing jobs rather than expanding jobs and services in an area recognised as a priority to tackle unemployment in the whole of the European Union.
Make no mistake, it is skilled dock workers who would suffer most â people like Steven Drew from Yarmouth, sitting in the Public Gallery listening to this debate, who, together with his father Frank before him, have given 55 yearsâ combined service to the ports industry.
Competition is needed between ports, not within them.
The European Union should now do what it should have done before: consult ports, trade unions and shipping lines from scratch, starting with a blank sheet of paper, and on this proposal it should admit defeat.
This European Parliament, having sought to reject this proposal once and for all, should now vote ânoâ for a second time and never again.
Â Â  â As the previous speeches have shown, this proposal for a directive has caused huge controversy, which has extended way beyond this Chamber, covering many port operators and most workers in the sector.
As regards the latter, I should like to state that we understand their protest but do not accept their violent methods.
That said, the two committees called upon to give their opinions both declared their opposition to the proposal for a directive, thereby further securing its political fate.
The importance of the port sector, Mr President, needs no added emphasis.
We all know that almost all external trade in the EU is conducted through its ports and that the ports employ some 350Â 000 people directly, not to mention those employed indirectly in the sector.
What is more, techniques for moving cargo and equipment are constantly evolving and this requires constant investment and renewal.
The questions that arise are therefore the following:
Is the proposal for a directive conducive to investment, competition and access to the market?
Does it respect the rights acquired as regards current operators?
Does it violate the principle of subsidiarity?
Is it fair as regards compensation in the event of replacing providers?
Does it affect the labour market and the social rights of workers in the sector?
In a word, does it achieve the objectives of greater efficiency, better competition, more internal market and better services?
Mr Jarzembowski sought to find even-handed answers to these questions, and I therefore wish to congratulate him.
It does strike me, however, that this proposal needs to be looked at again, in light of the conditions under which it has been presented by the Commission.
What is needed is a political strategy which genuinely stimulates the development of Europeâs ports, as the rapporteur himself points out and amends, which takes account of the current state of affairs in the market and which involves all interested parties, naturally including Parliament.
It is for you, Commissioner, to provide the answer.
As far as we are concerned, it will obviously be much easier to make a decision in line with the stated objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy also means that we should prune unnecessary and ineffectual legislation and not increase bureaucracy.
European port services are already very competitive currently, both in terms of quality and charges.
This does not represent a conflict between labour and capital because port owners, users and workers in different European countries regard the proposal as harmful, and not of any use.
Competition for competitionâs sake should be rejected and there needs to be greater focus on quality and safety.
This directive will definitely not increase competition: on the contrary, it may even harm it.
For example, the authorisation system will increase bureaucracy.
An ILO Convention guarantees to give registered professional port workers priority for this kind of work, and in Finland this is reinforced in a collective bargaining agreement.
The key factor is safety: would it be in the interests of health and safety at work if, after a hard dayâs work, seafarers had to attend to the handling of yet another load in a foreign port?
Â Â  MrÂ President, the basic issue in this debate is about whether, in this area as in all others, competition and new services are a good thing.
It is about whether competition would cause matters to become worse for consumers, employees and businesses.
To hear some of the debaters, one would think that the existence of competition and more companies is bad for the whole of society.
We can, in fact, see how those European societies that have opened the doors to competition and new enterprise have seen services and businesses develop, with lower prices and better service for the consumer.
We have seen this within area after area, including the telecommunications and aviation areas, and have heard the same cautionary arguments before deregulation has been implemented.
I remember how, when telecommunications deregulation was, at one stage, debated, it was maintained in all seriousness that telephone calls would be a thing of the past and that those who worked within the industry would lose their jobs.
In actual fact, there have been more jobs.
When it comes to ports, which are so crucial to trade and development within the EU, it is obvious that the dynamic entailed in increased market access and in competition between and within ports will lead to a development of services.
These things are crucial not only for enabling the ports industry as such to operate better but also because shipping, transport and trade will be more efficient.
What is at issue here is not only the whole flow of goods in Europe, but also opportunities for new regions to develop â new ports and new structures in our economy.
If we want to see competition, we shall also get to see new developments and change.
Anyone who maintains that everything is already perfect and that our ports throughout Europe operate exactly as they should need not be afraid of competition.
If we obtain new enterprise and new opportunities, things will happen.
That is why the basic issue is that of whether we want, as I myself do, to see a more dynamic flow of goods in Europe.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
We are not talking here about containers; we are talking here about people, about my colleagues.
This discussion is about a directive which, justifiably, the European Transport Workers Federation is calling unnecessary, provocative and unbalanced, and the port authorities and the industry also agree about this.
It contains the worst elements of another proposal which this Parliament has already rejected.
After that vote, instead of forgetting all about it or at least coming up with a decent proposal, the Commission took an even worse position.
My vote will be against this directive because it undermines the rights which this category of workers, port workers, acquired with much difficulty in the course of a long period of time.
I am going to vote against this directive because it opens the door for abuses in the way that certain workers are treated, as well as putting workers against each other.
I am going to vote against this directive because it reduces the health and safety in such delicate areas as ports.
When we boast so much here about health and safety, how can we do something which undermines it?
I am going to vote against this directive because I believe in balanced competition where everybody gives his share, and not where it is always the workers and the lower paid who have to pay.
I believe that even those who are in favour of liberalisation of port services should vote to reject this directive.
This is because a vote in favour would be opening the way for an original directive which even our colleagues seem to agree that it has a lot of shortcomings.
Let us give a strong signal that we are building a social Europe and not a system without a conscience.
The vote on the ports directive is a golden opportunity to give hope and direction to the many who are waiting for a move from an institution like ours.
I am proud that the Maltese Labour Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are responding in a consistent way to this call.
To the millions of European workers, among them hundreds of Maltese workers represented by the General Workers Union, and who are also here today and who are affected by this directive, we want to let them know that we are solidly behind them.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a few technical considerations.
Above all, it seems that this proposal does not take account of the Green Paper being prepared by the Commissioner for Transport, MrÂ Barrot.
We should take the opportunity offered by this initiative to examine the new supply of services from the countries that have recently joined, and we should compare the national legal requirements on costs to be borne by the goods, so that free-market conditions can effectively prevail.
It seems to me that the directive before us runs absolutely counter to competition and market rules, in that it allows the large companies operating in northern European ports to set up oligopolies, in contrast to the different situation in Mediterranean ports, and above all it leaves us open to attack from the major East Asian companies, which are invading our port system.
We must certainly compare the effects of state aid policies on competition and clarify the concept and practical applicability of such aid, particularly as regards concessionary leases and other means of allowing a provider of services to provide them as a public service subject to public rules.
Above all, this directive includes no comparison of the environmental protection rules for carrying out new infrastructure works, or of waste disposal policies.
We have to clarify the rules on competitiveness in view of the risk of unfair competition from the East and, even more importantly, we must reaffirm the environmental guarantees for the Mediterranean, which is under attack by operators who do not respect Community environmental legislation.
Self-handling is a very serious threat to the small and medium-sized enterprises operating within our ports.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has retabled the proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services, but without taking account of why it was rejected by Parliament in 2003.
Today's proposal for a directive is basically no different from the previous one.
It maintains the provision of self-service, which is out of keeping with the modern working conditions needed in European ports in the sectors of hygiene, safety and quality of port services.
Where, in truth, are the proposals for the proper layout of ports?
Where are the proposals for modernising the overall functioning of ports?
We have not heard the old call for exemption from the scope of the directive for pilot services, which are not a commercial activity but constitute a public service, the objective of which is the safety of shipping and the protection of ports and the marine environment.
Nor did we hear about the efforts made by the members of the committee in order to improve the proposal of the European Commission, despite Mr Jarzembowski's honourable efforts.
The lack of policy will result in a long period of uncertainty and, of course, there will be no investment climate.
The best proposal is to withdraw it.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not question the need for a directive or the need to pave the way for liberalisation.
This proposal for a directive, however, has been framed in a similar way to the one that was rejected in the House in NovemberÂ 2003, and does not take account of Parliamentâs recommendations.
It is therefore unacceptable.
Furthermore, there are legal inconsistencies in the proposed directive in relation to the international and Community regulatory framework.
Firstly, it fails to guarantee compatibility with the ongoing proposed review of Regulation (EEC) No 1191 of the Council concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service.
It also fails to take into account the specific characteristics of each individual port, not least ports in the outermost regions, where public services are vital to the survival of communities and where forced liberalisation can lead to socially and economically unacceptable monopolies.
The proposal for a directive before us is already unacceptable, but the report makes matters worse by increasing deregulation and by creating problems relating to security, to guarantees of public services, to the efficient operation of port services, and to the safeguarding of social rights, arising from the proposal to extend self-handling without any regulation.
I therefore believe, Commissioner, that this proposal for a directive should be withdrawn and subsequently replaced by another that takes account of Parliamentâs recommendationsÂ âŠ
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Estonia is a maritime country, and port services represent a large proportion of our gross national product.
The implementation of the Port Services Directive would not lead to big changes for us.
The port services market was liberalised soon after Estonia gained its freedom from the Soviet command economy.
The directive proposed by the European Commission broadly interferes in details, such as the licensing process and the duration of contracts, while leaving responsibility in important areas to the Member States.
Uniform and clear standards concerning quality, environment and safety would be more useful for improving competition in the internal market than detailed regulations.
I also share the fears of the port workers of old Europe.
It appears that the Commission wishes to achieve an increase in efficiency mainly at the expense of qualified workers.
Let it be said that the ports of my homeland Estonia, in the so-called ânew Europeâ, compete on quality, not cheap labour.
I am certain that the intellectual potential of the European Union could produce a much better directive.
The Commission should make use of this opportunity.
Commissioner, I regret to say that I will vote against this directive tomorrow.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, even though the debate was not a chorus of praise, I have listened very carefully to each and every one of you.
Firstly, it is useful to point out the background to this proposal, which in fact came from the previous Commission and from my predecessor.
Nevertheless, I can understand that Parliament might have been surprised, MrÂ President, that this proposal was presented to it again and I can understand that this move might have shocked some of you.
I would simply like to raise some points that â without justifying it â also explain the reason why this proposal is back on the table.
Firstly, it is because, despite everything, we feel the need which some of you have highlighted to have a clear legal framework in order to promote port investments.
Ninety percent of our European exports pass through our ports.
We need efficient and modern ports.
Secondly, this proposal was re-presented with very strict limits on self-handling, which had undoubtedly been the subject of the most serious criticism at the time of first reading.
Thirdly, as someone who has exercised social responsibilities, I cannot all the same let it be said that this proposal would violate all the social rights existing in the port sector.
It was not the Commissionâs intention to reduce the social rights of workers in this sector.
The Commission has even included in its proposal an obligation for all the providers of port services to receive an authorisation forcing them to comply with the minimum rules of Community social law.
Furthermore, Article 4 of the proposal constitutes a safeguard by stipulating that the directive will in no way affect the application of national legislation on the employment of personnel.
I will put it very simply, ladies and gentlemen: I would never have re-presented this proposal if I, personally, had felt it presented such serious risks as some of you believed it did.
In all honesty, I would not have done so.
Nevertheless, I must say that the debate has all the same been useful and it has shed some light on all the aspects of a port policy which cannot, in fact, be merely reduced to the subject of this text.
Many of you pointed out that other problems were very important.
These include greater transparency with regard to the costs of services, the introduction of fairer competition between our ports and the need to boost investments in order to further increase the capacities of our ports.
I am therefore well aware that a port policy cannot be reduced to a text of this type and, in this regard, the debate has been very useful.
Another thing the debate has done is to highlight the very diverse situations of Europeâs ports, even though I had already become aware of that state of affairs in this, my first year as Commissioner for Transport.
In this regard, we are also coming up against a problem.
Some of you rightly emphasised that it was impossible to deal with the fact that situations differ so greatly from one port to the next by focusing too much on centralisation, and I admit that you are right.
We are also faced with the high-speed development of the technologies used in the ports, which also brings a factor into play not present in the situation that prevailed when this proposal for a directive was devised.
I would say both that the debate was useful and that your committee has done a really good job.
It is true that I will give my full agreement in advance if Parliament goes as far as to discuss the amendments tabled by its committee.
I am in favour of extending the expiry dates for the authorisations.
I am in favour of the transitional measures, MrÂ Jarzembowski.
I am also in favour of the compromise amendments on the protection of investments made prior to the entry into force of the directive, provided, of course, that the stated aims, that is to say non-discriminatory and fair market access for all, are observed.
It is quite clear â and here we are faced with a paradox â that the Commissioner addressing you had hoped that you would reach a verdict on the text amended by your committee.
