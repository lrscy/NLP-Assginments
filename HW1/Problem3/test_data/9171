He said that the only problem for a couple in a registered partnership was when one of them was a foreign national.
If they are both EU nationals, under Article 18, they could both independently move to another State.
That is true, but what they lose is the status of registered partnership and the tax or social rights that go with that - for instance, the right to be recognised as next of kin if one of them is in hospital.
His answer does not address that issue.
It is not just an immigration question, it is also a question of recognition as a family.
I do not think he can just get around that, and I believe the mutual recognition argument has strong force, as in other sectors like criminal law.
Madam President, Mrs Ludford is of course right, but her remark raises a second problem, which is that of the legislation of the host country discriminating against unregistered couples.
One has to recognise that partners who do not lose the privileges they have in the country of origin, will enjoy a privilege which the citizens of the host state do not have.
That is the heart of the issue.
I respect your opinion, Mrs Ludford, and I look forward to the discussion with the Council under the co-decision and qualified majority voting procedures, with which you are much more familiar than I am.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at midday.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (ARTICLE 120)
This report and proposal for a directive constitute an important step towards giving practical shape to a basic feature of European citizenship, that of people's effective freedom of movement within the European Union.
I should like nonetheless to put forward a criticism concerned with an aspect that, unfortunately, has not been taken into account.
In fact, inequality still exists between those resident in a Member State of which they are nationals and those from another Member State whose residence in the former is on a long-term basis but who apparently enjoy a permanent right of residence, confirmed by the issue of a residence permit.
These people will continue to be at a disadvantage in relation to nationals as soon as they want to cross internal borders of the European Union, for they will then have to be furnished with passports or identity cards issued by the states from which they derive their nationality, all of which implies additional administration and costs.
It is a pity that the opportunity has not been seized to put an end to this injustice, either by providing for a system of European identity cards or by arranging for the permanent residence permit to be considered equivalent to an identity card when it comes to crossing the European Union's internal borders.
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2003) by Mrs TerrÃ³n I Cusi, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for adoption of a Council directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities [COM(2001) 386 - C5-0447/2001 - 2001/0154(CNS)].
Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­, and all those who have contributed to this very positive report which we are considering today.
By way of the proposed directive, we put forward a framework which, once approved, will lead Member States to be open and transparent about their immigration policies.
This is very much a step forward.
Nowadays, Member States do not know what each other's immigration policy really is.
Many of the national immigration policies have in the past been simply conducted by stealth.
What the public knows is that those who come in illegally, end up having their situation legalised by Member States in one way or another.
Our proposal is a first step aimed at ending such a pattern.
Immigrants must be able to come in legally and be given work permits and a set of rights, if there are jobs - and we are increasingly aware that there are - that cannot be filled by the domestic job market.
In this respect, it must be pointed out that such rights do not cover the right to stay unemployed in the European Union.
The proposal further helps to streamline cumbersome procedures and to bring about clarity and legal security.
However, as we clearly stated in our communication on migration policy of November 2000, we do not intend to decide by directive the number of immigrants that our economies and societies are prepared to absorb.
The proposed directive leaves that decision to the Member States who, together with their civil societies and, above all, their local and regional authorities, know how many they are capable of integrating.
I therefore emphasise that, as I have always said, this proposal does not allow one single entry of one single immigrant into the labour market of the European Union.
The Commission is certainly not creating a subjective right to immigration.
Its aim is simply to harmonise the procedure for admission and it believes such harmonisation is necessary.
We simply want Member States to inform each other and the Commission of what is happening so that everybody can learn from each other's experience and find out what the added value of European responses might be.
All the more so as we mostly live in a border-free area where decisions affect our neighbours.
The European Union must primarily mobilise its existing human resources, including migrant workers currently residing legally in the European Union.
More must be done on training, bringing older people and women into the labour market.
In this respect, the proposal gives a clear preference to the domestic labour market.
There is, therefore, no incompatibility between the fight against unemployment and the proposal.
Our unemployed have four weeks in which to show up and take jobs free from the competition of foreign workers.
However, given that our unemployed are not always willing or capable, the effect of an ageing population and the related skills gap means that restricting legal migration risks jeopardising our economic health.
As I have said before, even if Member States were to face labour market shortages, they would be free to cap the total number of migrants they are ready to admit, if they consider, for instance, that their society is already facing too much of an integration burden.
Immigration numbers are one of our citizens' priorities, and one of the areas where they clearly expect us to tackle the problem at European level.
I hope that this debate and its impact on the Council will allow us to move forward.
Madam President, we have said a thousand times in this House that a global European immigration policy must be based, firstly, on the establishment of legal immigration rules and then on strong instruments to ensure that these rules are complied with.
We are today discussing a proposed directive which would constitute the cornerstone of this policy, a directive on which the Council, of course, has not made much progress.
Parliament should also have given its opinion some time ago, but we always lag behind on these issues.
I have chosen this moment to present my report because, for the first time in a long time, the Greek Presidency has included the issue of legal immigration on the political agenda, something which I am glad about.
The Commission's proposed directive is intended to harmonise the conditions for entry and residence for nationals of third countries who intend to enter a Member State for employment reasons.
It allows the entry of workers from a third country in the event that the post cannot be filled by a national worker or a worker from another Member State of the Union or by a resident of a third country with the right to access the labour market.
The proposal lays down a contract at origin for the immigrant worker, except for those who reside legally within the European Union for other reasons.
The residence permit and the work permit would be combined as one single document.
The adoption of this directive would involved the recognition of the need for legal channels for immigration and would create a more transparent framework with simpler procedures, which would provide economic actors with more facilities and also reinforce the rights of immigrants.
For my part, I welcome the Commission's proposal.
I only regret that the Commission, no doubt as a result of realism, has not been able to reflect in this proposed directive some of the ideas it put forward in previous communications, because I sincerely believe that we cannot continue to copy models of immigration control employed during the last century, when the industrial society was at its height, but that we must be able to imagine new procedures suited to our world, to a society and a labour market which operate according to principles which are very different to those of the decades following the war.
Some of the measures studied by the Commission, such as mobility, moved in the right direction and reality will oblige us to return to them.
Madam President, this is just an opinion report.
I would have preferred to have produced a resolution rather than a package of amendments - which are unlikely to be read or taken into account by those people with real decision-making powers.
But for procedural reasons we have had to present a package of amendments and these must reflect two fundamental issues.
Firstly, a strong will and a strong signal in favour of a European immigration policy.
We need clear rules which can be complied with.
We have therefore rejected the amendments, above all those presented by the PPE-DE Group, which intended to convert the directive into a kind of recommendation which the States could comply with or not.
Neither have we accepted the amendments which introduced requirements other than employment and which were difficult to verify.
If we accept that the possibility of performing a job of work is what legitimises entry and residence in the Union, we must then ensure that this system works.
By requiring that the immigrant has a contract or a firm offer while still in the country of origin, we are thereby regulating access in accordance with the labour market.
Even in a situation of unemployment, this would simply become paralysed.
Secondly, we must establish rules which can be complied with, thereby incentivising the arrival of immigrants through regular channels and preventing illegal contracts; preventing immigrant workers from ending up in an illegal situation, for bureaucratic reasons, once in the Union; and discourage, as far as possible, the entry of immigrants without permits.
We proposed three things in this regard: that people legally residing in the Union, or who are here legally for any reason or have entered with a residency permit and have lost it, can recover their legal situation and not remain permanently in an irregular situation and that the States can, if they wish, establish a six-month visa for seeking work.
Other elements we have introduced are the strengthening of equal conditions amongst workers, with a view to preventing all types of discrimination and the creation of a second-class labour market to which both immigrants and native workers would fall victim.
We also intend for workers to be given equal rights and obligations, for workers to be allowed to move freely within the Member State - for obvious reasons I do not believe we have to go further - and, in general, to reduce the time periods and bureaucratic obstacles to establishing this immigration policy.
Like our citizens and their representatives, like the employers and the unions, I hope that we can create clear rules based on the criteria of efficiency and not on ideological problems, which are of little help.
Madam President, I thank the rapporteur.
I too am pleased to see that certain amendments that were put forward by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - but not accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - have been tabled by a variety of the political groups in the House.
The majority position of my committee is that we need to simplify and clarify the procedures.
We have heard from a number of reputable companies about the length of time it could take to get work permits for their employees, which pushed some towards using tourist visas to get their employees into the country in order to fulfil contract obligations, and others to lose business.
We heard from small- and medium-sized enterprises without departments devoted to human resources as to how complex it can be to find the individual that you want and deal with the paperwork, and how long it can take before that person actually starts work.
We heard from individuals about what a frustrating and ridiculous process it can be when an application is halted for a minor technical reason and nobody has the responsibility to inform the person concerned of what that reason is.
We also heard about the issues of having to return to one's country of origin, at great expense and inconvenience, in order to apply for a new work permit attached to a new job.
That was from an employee at UNICE, the employers' federation.
Hence we support the amendments about tightening up timetables and response times on work permits, about the requirement to inform the applicant of problems in an application and about moving away from the employer having to demonstrate the need, yet again, for a third-country national to fill a job if one becomes vacant within 12 months - although, from some of the horror stories we have heard about the length of time it can take to get permits, perhaps we should extend that even further.
We have tried to strip away some of the duplication between what the employer has to do and what the state has to do in trying to treat a worker as a responsible adult.
We supported the ECOSOC proposal to look at the idea of a job-seeker's permit, which could be of great assistance to small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Madam President, the Committee on Petitions gets a number of submissions to do with the lack of opportunities for immigration into Europe, and this is another reason why a directive on the subject is needed.
Commissioner Vitorino, you are also right to say that, following this directive's entry into force, it will be left to the Member States to decide whether they want immigration, and if so, how much of it.
But, by this proposal for a directive, you are putting down a marker to the effect that 'immigration is a right.'
You, on Thursday, will not be returning to a country in which, at present, 4.6 million people are unemployed.
Or, to put the question another way, are there schools in Portugal in which half the children do not understand Portuguese?
It is true that we need rules on legal immigration, and that we have to control it, but it is also the case that our problems with the economy and education mean that we lack appropriate jobs for our own fellow-citizens.
Despite its few tentative good points, the signal you are sending out by means of this directive is the wrong one, and it is being sent at the wrong time.
For example, you also intend to grant a third-country national the right to immigrate even if he reveals the existence of a job that has been vacant for four weeks, and you, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­, with your three-week period, want to undercut this proposal.
This reminds me of a motor race in a James Dean film, in which the contest is to see who will be the last to jump out of a car heading for a precipice.
Incidentally, the film's German title translates as 'They know not what they do'.
Despite high unemployment in Germany, there are still at present many positions that remain unfilled.
One of the reasons for this is that the education system has been run into the ground.
What you are now saying is, 'do not worry about reforming your own country's educational system - we shall just get immigrants to do the jobs.' - but that cannot be the solution!
So let me repeat: the proposal is well-intentioned, but it sends the wrong signal, and, by the way, as you know, Commissioner, I take the view that the Convention has to be even bolder.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive presented by Commissioner Vitorino will be the foundational European draft law on immigration into Europe.
In presenting it, he is taking a quite specifically systematic approach in generally opening up European labour markets to immigrants, whilst, by way of derogation, giving the Member States the option of taking their own absorption capacity into account and reducing the number of immigrants, right down to zero if need be.
This is happening at a time when we have 15 million unemployed in Europe, and when, in my own country, the figure is nearing 5 million.
Experts are unanimous in stating that this state of affairs will persist for years, so that we can say without further ado that Europe will not generally need more workers for many years to come.
They are needed in certain sectors, in certain lines of business, in certain regions and on a temporary basis, but, in principle and in general, there is no need for them.
What this means is that, in the event of this directive becoming law, there will be increased pressure on Europe's labour markets, to the detriment of those who are already unemployed, and not least to the detriment of the third-country nationals who are in the European Union legally and who, in any case, are more likely to be unemployed than are EU citizens.
You are opening up this possibility if a position cannot be filled within four weeks.
Last year in Germany, the average vacancy, in terms of the period of time elapsing between the job being advertised and somebody taking it, was around seventy days.
This shows that the four-week period is absurdly short and will, as I have said, put our unemployed under much more pressure.
The problematic thing about this system is that it involves a legal right, since, if an application is refused, the applicants are to be able to appeal to the national courts.
We have already seen, to our horror, what happens when asylum-seekers make appeals of this sort, and so we do not want to repeat the experience with would-be immigrants.
The report by the admirable Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ makes matters dramatically worse, as the majority on the committee went so far as to remove the regulatory element, the national right of control provided for by Commissioner Vitorino, so that all that is left is open access.
Moreover, they have the idea that even illegal immigrants should also have the chance to apply for a work permit, which amounts to giving them a prize for getting in illegally, and one cannot sensibly support that either.
The Council has been attempting to digest this draft since as long ago as July 2001.
I am quite certain that the TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ report will end up in the Council's great big waste paper basket, and that Commissioner Vitorino, too, will have to make substantial changes to his draft if he wants it to stand a chance of getting the necessary majority.
Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur for her report.
I very much applaud the principle of having brought this up for debate.
It is a major step towards a common European immigration policy.
Without legal means, many people resort to dangerous and illegal ways of circumventing frontiers.
Without legal migration, we will struggle to meet our target of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.
I was saddened by what Mr Nassauer has said.
We have to move the debate forward.
There are 350 million people in the European Union at the moment and there will soon be 500 million.
He has highlighted that 50 million of those may be unemployed, 5 million of them in Germany.
However, as Mr Nassauer will know, and as we have heard in the previous debate, it is not as easy as we would like for someone to move from one EU country to another to work.
We must do more to facilitate that, certainly, but in the meantime we must also do more to have legal migration, so as to ensure that the vacant positions we have are filled.
We have also got to make sure there are safeguards, because in encouraging third country nationals into the EU we must also make certain that we are not depriving those countries of the very important key workers that they need to help them develop.
We do not want to take all the doctors and nurses and teachers from developing countries simply because we need them.
But then neither, on the other hand, do we want to say to third country nationals: 'you can come to the EU but the only jobs you can do are the low-level, manual, nasty jobs that we don't want to do'.
So we have got to have a properly balanced scheme, with legal migration that respects individuals and respects their position, supporting both third countries and the EU.
The UK may not have chosen to opt into this measure at the moment, but I am contributing to this debate and participating in it as other British Members are because we want to make certain that we have sound legislation laying down sensible provisions, so that the UK will be able to opt into it in the future.
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to welcome Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­'s report.
It is an important and necessary report.
The conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities vary greatly from one Member State to another.
Only a few common rules and procedures apply in all the Member States, and this means that there is no legal and administrative tool that can contribute to better management of migration flows.
What is proposed would rectify this situation.
Adoption of the directive would lead to common rules being laid down governing the rights and duties of third-country nationals.
The directive would also ensure that the existing rules were enforced equitably.
What is proposed would give easier access to the labour force, and flexibility and mobility in the European labour market would in that way be increased.
At the same time, the directive contains safety clauses worded strongly enough to restrict economic migration.
I believe that adoption of this report would entail some clear benefits.
For one thing, procedural clarity and much needed harmonisation of the rules governing this group of third-country nationals would be created within the EU area.
Furthermore, what is proposed would increase the legal rights of this group of self-supporting third country nationals who have entered their countries of residence legally.
Finally, what is proposed would give the Member States a tool ensuring their ability to respond quickly to changes in the economic and demographic conditions in the labour market.
Contrary to a previous speaker, I hope that the proposal will be well received by the Council with a view to its being adopted quickly.
The proposal has been passed around between the institutions for a long time, and it is therefore important that the Council should not place obstacles in the way of this important area.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal being examined today is aimed at establishing a harmonised legal framework for the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals.
On this subject, it has to be stated that the European Union is still a very weak vessel.
We can only regret the hypocrisy of European policies.
While all countries see development aid as a means of combating illegal immigration, cooperation budgets are reduced and, with not one bit of responsibility accepted for training, there are no qualms about participating in the brain drain.
There is no hesitation in cherry-picking the most promising immigrants, or those who serve our interests. As for the others, the re-admission clauses in the cooperation agreements are used in order all the better to expel those who have no papers but who are already settled in their social and professional lives and participating fully in the construction of Europe.
Without a thought for the future of immigrants or their protection or even for the respect of their fundamental rights to health, education and accommodation, the economic and demographic needs of the Member States are satisfied by making use of controlled immigration that is liable to be ruthlessly exploited and manipulated and that mainly serves to make up for the labour shortage and to compensate for the demographic imbalance.
Yes, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ is right.
The immigration issue must be part of an overall, long-term vision of the EU's policy as a community.
In this context, there is good reason for tackling the issues relating to the management of migration flows. These include essential policy on visas, policy on unifying families - particularly in relation to the rights associated with European citizenship - and the new definition of development aid, implying genuine cooperation.
Although one of the Tampere conclusions is about ensuring equitable treatment for third-country nationals, this objective proves to be far from having been achieved when closer attention is given not only to the conditions of entry and residence but also to citizens' rights, particularly freedom of movement, the right to live as part of a family and those rights that should be linked to residence rather than nationality.
If European legislation enables workers from third countries to be turned into cheap labour or a kind of cannon fodder on the field of insecure employment, the European Union will lose all the credibility that it has built up over many years through its programmes to combat forms of discrimination, programmes that it is duty-bound to defend on the basis of its ideals of justice and freedom.
Everyone knows that a citizens' Europe cannot be built upon forms of discrimination that give rise to injustice and exclusion and that engender racism.
It is therefore our responsibility to work for a humanitarian and Community-based policy on immigration, and one that respects fundamental rights and reaffirms immigration as an opportunity for Europe.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive that we are examining today is aimed at harmonising, at European level, the rules according to which work permits are granted to third-country nationals.
It presents an initial huge problem: what exactly is the point of it?
The explanatory memorandum gives three reasons for it.
First of all, current rules relating to the admission of third-country workers apparently differ from one Member State to another.
Where, however, is the difficulty?
Rather, it is good and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity that each state should be able to adapt the rules for accepting foreign workers on the basis of its social needs and its labour market.
The second reason cited by the explanatory memorandum is that job seekers and employers apparently come up against national administrative procedures that are sometimes, we are told, very complex.
Here again, however, this is a problem for the Member States and one in which the EU authorities should not interfere.
The third reason cited is that the regulations governing the immigration of third-country workers is apparently a cornerstone of general immigration policy.
That proves nothing, for the Treaty of Amsterdam has not turned immigration in general into an EU matter.
What is more, Commissioner, it is, rather, the fight against illegal immigration and not the granting of work permits that, in my opinion, is the cornerstone.
All things considered, such Community harmonisation of work permits is not justified.
It would serve only to open immigration policy up a little more at a time when we already have too many unemployed.
For example, I would cite this surprising provision in Article 29, paragraph 4 of the proposal, specifying that a refusal by a Member State to grant a work permit to a third-country national should contain - and I quote - 'a statement of reasons based upon objective and verifiable criteria'.
I believe that the granting of work permits to third-country nationals is a regalian right and that the Member States should not be hampered in this area, especially in the current economic situation in which they need to safeguard their basic interests.
Moreover, this proposal for a directive would lay the foundations for still greater centralisation in the future.
Our Assembly's Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has understood this so well that it is falling over itself to propose removing other powers from the Member States, for example the right to break off issuing permits for reasons connected with there being insufficient capacity to receive immigrants.
It can be seen where all that would lead us if this directive were to be adopted.
So overtly, however, does it violate the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, with which we are deluded every day, that someone in the Council will, I hope, be able to stop it in its tracks.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Vitorino is right to say that this represents a first attempt at laying down unified rules on legal immigration by workers and the self-employed.
I also take a favourable view of much of the detailed proposals, such as the - obvious - possibility of limitation by the Member States, which would make it possible to stipulate how many of which types of workers should be allowed to enter the European Union, or the deportation of offenders, the proof of financial resources and so on.
There are a lot of good things in the proposal, but we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have two basic problems with it.
In our view, the proposal exceeds, firstly, the legislative competence of the European Union.
Whilst the Treaty establishing the European Communities provides specific rules on immigration, the attempt is made here to lay down a general rule of the European Union.
We want the principal competence to remain where it is - with the Member States - and we want the European Union to make rules on matters within its remit, specifically on what provision - such as working visas and appropriate controls - is to be made for the entry of third-country nationals into the European Union, and on what rules should then apply to their freedom of movement within it.
That is the present situation, and that is the way it should stay.
The approach contained in the Commission proposal is equally ill-chosen, as it is based on the assumption that immigration is generally necessary.
It is, however, an established fact that the situation varies in every respect from one Member State to another, both as regards the qualifications needed by workers who want to enter the country and the extent to which immigration is needed.
From that assumption you deduce that immigration is a right, and an actionable one at that.
Such a thing exists nowhere on earth, and we do not want to have it in future either.
And when this proposal is developed by the addition of proposals originating in the committee, the report goes so far that we cannot vote in favour of it.
Where entry into the EU is concerned, we want framework principles; what we do not want, though, is a general rule that largely pushes back the competence of the Member States!
Mr President, in order to achieve legislation in the field of immigration at Community level we should pay particular attention to the positive effects of immigration, something we are debating here today.
I come from a country - Spain - from which, until a few years ago, many citizens emigrated in search of work and today we are a country into which, thanks to our growth and stability, we receive many immigrants in search of work, often honourable work, who undoubtedly make a positive contribution to our companies and who often carry out work which our citizens reject.
The current reality, with migratory flows which are speeding up all the time, is reflected every day in the Spanish press. We see thousands of Moroccans and Sub-Saharan Africans arriving on our territory looking for work.
In view of this reality, which is not confined to Spain, we must look for a way to control and regulate the situation, in order to prevent the growing networks trafficking in immigrants.
The fight against illegal immigration requires the regulation of legal immigration.
If there are employment opportunities but we do not allow the legal entry of immigrants, we will be promoting illegal immigration, and with it work which is often sub-human, dishonest and sometimes even verging on extortion.
I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal since it promotes a coordinated economic migration policy.
However, as other rapporteurs from my group have said, we must maintain the Member States' competence to regulate how many immigrants they can receive to cover the work possibilities.
We must be prudent.
The admission of immigrants into our labour market may become a problem in the future when the situations of each of our countries change and our labour markets have higher unemployment rates than the current ones.
We cannot provide direct access to the labour market for illegal immigrants, particularly those who entered legally, but who are now in our territory illegally, people desperate to find work.
This would undoubtedly lead to exploitation by many employers and the extortion I mentioned earlier.
We must improve all the possible mechanisms for the employment of immigrants from their countries of origin.
We must give employers the opportunity to employ these immigrants so that the relationship between the immigrants in the State of origin and the employers is as fluid as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we all agree that we in the European Union urgently need immigration, since our economy's labour requirements simply cannot be met by the numbers as they are at present.
This is the reason why immigration is so necessary.
It is also evident that any such immigration has to be managed in the best way available in order to meet the needs of the labour market at the same time as those of the population and also of the immigrants themselves.
On that we all agree.
It is also self-evident that there are economic areas in which we will need workers and others in which we will not.
We agree on that as well.
It is equally clear that we cannot allow, and do not want, our own workers at home to have to face competition.
Thus far, we are all of one mind.
If I may consider Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­'s report, let me observe that we can be grateful to her for having been so bold as to endorse the Commission proposal and making a contribution to our eventual shaping of the uniform provisions as regards immigration and the European labour market.
Her having done that makes it a matter of course that some will end up having problems with her proposals, just as they do with the Commission's.
On the other hand, though, Mr Nassauer, I do not see why either this report or the directive from the Commission should be destined for the dustbin.
Why does the Treaty on the European Communities have to be treated as if it were holy writ?
And why do we, European politicians that we are, who want the competences in all other areas of European policy to be laid down in Brussels, suddenly have colossal problems because the labour market is involved and want to have everything organised at national level?
I think this is where we could take a long view, a rather more generous approach, and demonstrate more willingness.
Things that do not fit in today's thinking could perhaps be European policy in five years' time.
It is for this reason that I can well imagine that we could adopt a much more generous approach in this area.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of an increasingly global labour market, the European Union has been the target of constant migratory pressure, which must be properly managed.
I agree with the need to draw up a new common immigration policy, but this policy must always take account of the real needs of the labour market and of the economy itself in each Member State.
For this reason we can only adopt the report that Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ has presented if the amendments retabled by the PPE-DE Group are accepted.
I wish to highlight two points: firstly, this proposal for a directive seeks to establish a common legal framework for conditions of admission and residence of immigrants for the purpose of employment.
Consequently, on the basis of this directive, immigration for the purpose of employment in the European Union will be permitted if certain conditions are met.
In our opinion, however, the power of Member States' to regulate, through their governments, whether or not to open up their labour markets cannot and must not be taken away from them. In other words, this is a decision that can only be taken by Member States themselves and not at Community level.
It is the responsibility of each Member State to assess and decide whether or not it needs to increase its labour force, by how much and in what sectors, taking account of their real needs as well as - and I think we all agree on this - their ability to receive and integrate third-country nationals.
Secondly, the TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ report criticises the fact that the Commission's initial proposal only addresses the situation of individuals who are legally present on Union territory.
It also claims that illegal workers should also have the right to request a residence permit, which should be granted to them.
Regardless of the rapporteur's generous approach, this would clearly encourage an increase in illegal immigration, basically saying to these people that once they are on Union territory, even if they have entered illegally, they will have the right to be legalised.
Mr President, as in other areas of human immigration, we must always be prudent.
This is not simply a matter of protecting Member State nationals.
In these areas, excessively generous solutions create more problems than they are intended to resolve.
Mr President, poor Mr Vitorino has one of the most difficult jobs in the Commission and he does it extremely well.
I come from a country that, tragically, has a history of mass emigration over hundreds of years.
In view of our history, I am perhaps a little more liberal in my thinking about these particular issues.
My colleagues from Spain and Portugal have also referred to this.
I agree with my group that the main competence needs to remain with the individual Member States, not because I want to suggest that we keep immigrants out of the country, but so that we can begin seriously to address the chaotic situation that exists in many of our countries regarding the processing and acceptance of immigrants.
It is a serious problem in a small country such as my own.
Many of those arriving in certain Member States - and indeed in my own - are being treated extremely badly, particularly by employers who are not themselves subject to the kind of controls that are applied to apparently legal immigrants into the country.
These immigrants are under-paid; they are often housed in disgraceful conditions.
In many cases, it is as if animals rather than human beings were being brought into the country.
We have to accept that Member States know their own situation best.
We also have a situation where, with the rise of unemployment, many of those who have been brought to Ireland as legal workers are being let go simply because it is no longer convenient for employers to have them.
While I agree with many of the points made by the Commissioner, we have to be realistic about these matters.
The issue is not about keeping people out, but making sure that, having come in, they are treated with the dignity they deserve.
Mr President, firstly, on a point of order, I believe that immigration policy has many elements and I do not wish to discuss issues such as allocations in this report.
I believe that we are going to do so by means of the open coordination method in a future report.
Secondly, as a personal statement, I would like say to Mr Nassauer and Mr Coelho that no part of my report promotes illegal immigration or allows a work permit in the European Union to be granted to people who enter illegally.
I am talking about people whose illegal status has come about for bureaucratic reasons and who have not been expelled and who once again fulfil the admission criteria.
I believe that this is far from promoting illegal immigration.
My report in no way provides for the possibility of entering illegally and seeking work.
Finally, Mr Nassauer, I regret that it pleases you that what may be a majority opinion in this House should be thrown out.
I hope that the participants in the Convention take a different view and that in the future the majority opinions of this House are taken into account.
Mr President, for the purpose of correction, I refer to Amendment No 17, which amended Mr Vitorino's original draft to indicate that application may be made by anyone who 'is legally present or already present there and has entered legally in order to reside there.'
The justification states that 'individuals who are illegally present in the country should, however, also be offered the opportunity' to obtain a contract of employment.
That means that the application is to be made on the basis of illegality; even your own justification says so.
Mr President, first of all concerning the legal bases - the issue raised by Mr Pirker - our assessment is that Article 63(3) of the Treaty on conditions for entry and residence is the correct legal basis for this proposal for a directive that deals with common definitions, criteria and procedures regarding the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment.
I recognise this is a difficult debate.
To be frank, Mr Nassauer and I have been discussing these issues for a very long time, and we all know that there is no magic solution to this very complex problem of immigration.
I accept the criticisms, I can even admit that I can be wrong.
However, what I find difficult to accept is being criticised for things that I have never said and that are not written in my proposal.
I have never said that there is a right to immigration.
There is no right to immigration.
I will repeat it hundreds of times: there is a right to asylum, but there is no right to immigration.
Immigration is only a possibility.
Our proposal states that very clearly.
The decision on admission is exclusively that of the government of each Member State or even of the regional or local authorities of the Member States - Brussels does not decide on one single entry.
I recognise that the link between migration and unemployment is very complex.
Evidence shows that migrants might affect and disrupt the internal labour market.
The first victims of new waves of migrants, as far as the functioning of our Member States' labour market is concerned, are previous waves of migrants, because there is direct competition between newcomers and the earlier migrants.
That is a source of concern, because the existing migrants will be a burden for the social welfare state.
Is there a direct link between the arrival of migrants and the re-entry into the labour market of our own European citizens?
There the connection is much more complex, because in certain cases the difficulty of re-entering the labour market is more connected with the specific characteristics of the welfare state and social security systems that benefit our own citizens.
It is unfair to say that migration policies are the reason why European Union citizens have difficulty re-entering the labour market.
In fact, it is the lack of reform of the welfare state that is responsible for the difficulty of encouraging people to re-enter the labour market.
Of course, that lack of reform varies from one Member State to another.
I do not want to harmonise anything with regard to reform of the welfare state.
As far as the report is concerned, the Commission welcomes and fully agrees with Amendments 6, 11, 8 and 12, but we cannot make any commitment today on those amendments concerning rules on intra-corporate transfers and contractual service suppliers.
Those rules are very interesting and we will bear them in mind.
However, they are closely linked to international trade issues and we have to wait for the ongoing World Trade Organisation negotiations to see what the impact of those negotiations will be on migration policy, above all as far as services are concerned.
I would urge you to keep the reference to the EURES system before being able to recruit third-country workers, because keeping that system will guarantee the principle of preference for the European labour market.
That is a fundamental principle in our proposal.
I look forward to seeing Parliament's amendments and thank you for this very interesting and stimulating debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
The next item is the report (A5-0005/2003) by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (COM(2002) 679 - C5-0609/2002 - 2002/0280(CNS)).
Mr President, the European Council of Seville of 21 and 22 June 2002 fixed a certain number of priorities in the fight against illegal immigration, and revision of Regulation 539/2001 on visas before the end of 2002 was definitely one of them.
The Commission has a monopoly on initiatives in this field but considered it appropriate to profit from the experience of the Member States and collect from them, via a specific questionnaire, relevant information regarding the criteria on the basis of which third country nationals are subject to, or exempt from, visas.
The answers of the Member States converged essentially on two factors: a significant rise in illegal immigration from Ecuador and respect of the reciprocity principle as regards visas.
In this last respect, it was noted that certain third countries exempted from visas do not grant, or grant in only a limited way, visa exemptions to nationals of certain Member States.
Taking into account these two aspects, the Commission proposed transferring Ecuador to Annex 1 of Regulation 539/2001 which lists the third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa obligation.
In addition, we propose to submit a report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implications of reciprocity as regards visas.
The Commission is very pleased with the collaboration of the European Parliament, which dealt with this proposal promptly, and appreciates very much Mr Hernandez Mollar's report confirming our approach.
We congratulate the rapporteur.
Mr President, Commissioner, appropriate management of migratory flows through all Member States, including States of origin and transit, the fight against human traffickers and illegal immigration, as well as the need to reconcile immigration pressure with the capacity of the receiving society, are aspects which from many points of view - as we have just heard - we have been advocating as the necessary means to put an end to the human tragedies and dramas which uncontrolled immigration is producing within and beyond our borders.
Furthermore, we must not forget that the gradual disappearance of the Union's internal borders as a means of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, as called for in Tampere, is a project which involves certain risks.
The proliferation of mafias of every kind, of terrorist and criminal groups, as well as their free movement throughout the Union, must be combated through the fulfilment by all the Member States of our responsibilities, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen controls at the Union's external borders.
The European Union therefore reached the conclusion that it was necessary to establish an objective list of countries whose nationals would require a visa to enter European territory, thereby making a start on the harmonisation of the Member States in the field of visas.
Subsequently, the global plan to combat illegal immigration set as an objective, ratified by the Seville European Council, a review by the end of 2000 of this list of third countries, as the Commissioner has just pointed out.
This is the subject of the report we are discussing today, for which I am rapporteur.
It responds to the data provided by the Member States which demonstrate the increase in the number of Ecuadorian immigrants in an illegal situation and which lead to the need to include Ecuador on the list of countries whose nationals require visas.
While it is true that the dramatic events taking place practically every day on the southern coasts of Europe are the most visible and newsworthy aspects of illegal immigration, we must not forget that this is a phenomenon with many other faces.
From a quantitative point of view, the daily trickle of illegals arriving aboard small boats cannot be compared with the number of foreigners who enter the Community by means of other borders, such as airports.
The majority enter as mere tourists, only obliged to carry a minimal quantity of money - which is often arranged by mafias - and once in Europe they become illegal immigrants seeking work on the black market, with the resulting employment exploitation.
It is therefore essential, ladies and gentlemen, that together with repressive measures which only deal with a part of the phenomenon of illegal immigration, we opt for the adoption of rules aimed at promoting the arrival of people on European territory by means of legal channels.
The proposal we are discussing today falls within this context.
On the basis of the reality demonstrated by the data currently available to us, we must facilitate the legal arrival of Ecuadorians, preventing them from falling into the hands of heartless gangs as well as the creation of false expectations about what awaits them on European territory.
Finally, Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure will require, on the one hand, that the Republic of Ecuador fulfil its responsibility to properly manage its own emigration and, on the other, that the European Union prioritise the policy of cooperation in the field of emigration with the countries of Latin America.
We will therefore vote in favour of the amendments which, to this end, have been presented by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Mr President, I would firstly like to clarify that, during the debate on the previous report, I wished to read a phrase in Spanish, which is the correct linguistic version.
I had the right to do so, but I am going to do so tomorrow during the vote, although that is less convenient, since it is different from the phrase read by Mr Nassauer.
With regard to the report we are discussing now by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, I would like to say that this is not a happy occasion.
We cannot take pleasure in the restriction of the right to free movement, which - as we pointed out this morning - is an essential factor in the Europeans' world view.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists, however, despite the irresponsible inclinations in favour of illegal immigration I am accused of by certain Members from the PPE-DE Group, will vote in favour of the inclusion of Ecuador in the list of countries whose nationals require a Schengen visa.
It will do so having analysed the information which has been provided by the countries requesting it and because it believes that it will provide better guarantees of the rights of those people who today are being denied entry in the terminals of the European Union's airports, which often also affects people who wish to enter for the purposes of tourism.
In any event, I would like to call on the European Commission to see this as a serious alarm call with regard to a country which is reaching very serious levels of poverty and, in accordance with its own statements on the Union's immigration policy, to treat this country as a priority objective, in terms of development cooperation and co-development measures.
I believe we could thereby compensate for the sad message which unfortunately we have to send today from the Union to the citizens of that country.
I thank the rapporteur for his work and for accepting this amendment, because I am convinced that we share this concern.
Mr President, ever since the Tampere Summit of European Union leaders in 1999, the issue of formulating common policies in Europe to tackle illegal immigration has been high on the agenda of our institutions.
The bottom line is that we live in a European Union where there is a system of free movement of services, capital, goods and persons.
The European Union, as we all know, has a population of 370 million and, with enlargement, the Union's population will rise to 500 million.
It is not only a question of dealing with the rights of European Union citizens working in different European Union countries, it is equally about formulating common policies to deal with people who seek to enter the European Union as asylum-seekers or refugees, or those who fall into the bracket of economic migrants.
We need to address how we protect the external borders of the European Union.
Trafficking in human beings is now the world's fastest growing criminal business.
The attempts that have been made at European level to tackle this problem are inadequate.
We have also sadly witnessed many tragedies in recent times, as persons seeking to enter the European Union have died in awful circumstances.
The battle to defeat the scourge of trafficking in human beings must be tackled at European Union level in a coordinated and structured manner.
Organised criminal gangs with vast resources that are illegally trafficking human beings into the European Union cannot be allowed, under any circumstances, to operate with impunity.
On a separate but related matter, it is certainly the case that the working group on freedom, security and justice at the European Convention has brought forward some interesting proposals in this area.
There are certainly many people who believe that qualified majority voting and codecision procedures should be used to tackle immigration issues.
There is also a belief that the objective of a common policy on immigration should be enshrined in the proposed new treaty.
This is certainly going to focus the minds of those drafting this treaty over the coming months and in the run-up to the next Intergovernmental Conference.
However, the proposal that judicial cooperation in the field of civil matters should be governed by qualified majority voting is contentious.
For example, Ireland and Britain have common law systems in operation, but many other European Union states have a civil law structure.
This is an area that is going to have to be given the closest attention.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and support.
The Commission cannot accept one of the amendments on purely legal grounds.
I refer to the amendment that asks the Commission to submit a report on the incidence of the visa obligation and to make, if necessary, proposals for the simplification of the procedures.
This issue cannot be governed by the regulation on visas which, owing to its legal basis, Article 62(2)(b) of the Treaty, is purely restricted to determining the lists of countries subject to, or exempt from, visa obligations.
The Commission views this amendment as a sign of support for the efforts it is already making, within the appropriate legal framework, to ensure proper application of the procedures for the granting of visas and to evaluate the adequacy of these measures, a matter it will subsequently report on to Parliament.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0024/2003) by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on relations between the European Union and Belarus: towards a future partnership (2002/2164(INI)).
Mr President, after the completion of the process of enlargement and of European construction following the Convention and the new Union Treaty of 2003, the European Union will have new borders which will not only require a new form of economic, social and cultural partnership and cooperation with these new neighbours but also, above all, a firm, very broad and effective common foreign and defence policy.
The reasons depend on the importance of these new neighbours, from the Ukraine and Georgia to Belarus, in which the presence of the giant Russia plays a pivotal role.
It is therefore a great challenge for the European Union to do the right thing in terms of how relations with these countries develop.

One of these countries, Belarus, borders Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and, until 1996, had developed in a fairly similar way to the other former members of the USSR but, since that year, it has taken an authoritarian course which has restricted human rights and democracy and imposed abusive social controls which prevent the European Union from establishing mechanisms for relations, association and cooperation such as the ones it has put in place with the rest of these countries.
So much so that the three European institutions which have monitored the development of events in Belarus, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the European Union - the parliamentary troika - has had no hesitation in describing these events as incompatible with minimum democratic requirements and has suspended its relations with that Republic until those requirements are met.
The presentation of this resolution has been delayed considerably as a result of having to convert an initial draft report on the European Union's relations with Belarus into an own-initiative resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy due to the deterioration of the situation in terms of the exercise of democracy and respect for human rights in that country.
In 1995, the European Union had prepared an agreement on trade and commercial cooperation based on the agreement which had existed since 1989 between the USSR and the European Economic Community and furthermore the victory of Lukashenko had given rise to a degree of hope.
But all of this became deadlocked when in 1996 President Lukashenko put the brakes on the democratisation process.
The authoritarian approach of Lukashenko has been characterised by the adoption of mechanisms to harass the opposition, to eliminate critical voices and to create a network of patronage by means of abuses of power and at the same time has tried to come closer to and more dependent on Russia, which Putin has recently pulled back from.
The various elections held since 1996 have been described by the parliamentary troika as lacking in effective democratic guarantees.
This has lead to the consolidation of a democratic opposition platform which has been maturing and which involves a broad spectrum, ranging from parties on the right to parties on the left - the communist party for example - which agree on fundamental aspects such as the establishment of democracy, partnership and, when appropriate, integration into the European Union.
Awareness of the need for democracy is increasing within Belarusian society and there are increasing numbers of members of the current Parliament of Belarus in favour of democratic reforms which bring the legal framework for freedoms closer to the requirements of the European Union.
Therefore the recommendation which we in the European Union must make, and which we are proposing in this resolution, combines two considerations: on the one hand, a firm rejection of reaching an association agreement at this time since that would imply a legitimisation of the current authoritarian regime and would hinder the establishment of democracy, and, on the other, an increase in initiatives which send a clear signal of cooperation and solidarity - with the victims of Chernobyl, for example - or coming closer in social, cultural and trade union terms which will allow democracy to be restored.
This is what our proposal is aimed at.
We must not forget the important role Russia can play in this process.
I would like to end by thanking all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their significant cooperation and I must finally acknowledge that I do not accept some of the amendments proposed by my own group for the reasons I have just given.
. Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to debate Belarus and the relations between Belarus and the European Union.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, for his excellent preparatory work.
I will indicate, in my remarks, where we find ourselves in profound agreement with what the rapporteur has said.
It is a very sad reality that, as on the many previous occasions when we have discussed Belarus, the focus is on a number of very difficult subjects: on the whole question of the cases of disappeared persons; on the harassment of the media; on the limitations on the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion; on the recent open confrontation by the authorities in Belarus with the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group in Minsk.
Alas, we have never been in a position to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement with Belarus.
That country is the only European successor of the former Soviet Union without a privileged contractual relationship with the European Union, including a clear mutual commitment to the common values of democracy and human rights.
It is obvious that the current state of relations between the European Union and Belarus is profoundly unsatisfactory for both sides.
While we are developing new forms of cooperation, for example, with the Russian Federation, while we are about to address the specific challenges and opportunities of enlargement in defining new forms of cooperation with those countries that will be our new eastern neighbours after enlargement, Belarus has sadly chosen the role of spectator.
The Commission has been invited by the Copenhagen European Council to submit proposals on the EU's future relations with its neighbours, including Belarus.
I am sure a number of honourable Members, during this debate, will want to make reference to this 'New Neighbours' or 'Wider Europe' debate.
Obviously, we will have to be prepared for the moment when Belarus sends a signal that it is ready to co-operate with us.
Given the present situation on democracy, freedom of speech and the media, and on human rights in general, it is difficult to imagine when the EU will be able to have normal relations with Belarus.
I am very grateful for the clear message that this debate and Parliament's resolution will send in this respect.
However, I fully agree with the elements in the resolution - and I am sure this will be followed up in a number of speeches today - which recalled the importance Belarus has, not only for the European Union, but also for the stability and prosperity of the whole region.
I can assure you that this is the common ground we are all working on.
There are many issues where the Commission would like to broaden its activities and its co-operation with Belarus, be it in addressing common threats of cross-border organised crime and illegal migration, or in regional development, economic and structural reform, environmental protection and so on.
Every day lost in dealing with these issues adds to the hardship of the people of Belarus, and to the potential risks building up on this part of our future eastern border.
On different occasions, in particular since early 2000, the European Union has co-operated with the OSCE and the Council of Europe to build a bridge that would help Belarus move towards normalisation of its relations with the international community.
Belarus has, on several occasions, missed these opportunities, including prior to the elections in 2000 and 2001.
The European Parliament and its Delegation for relations with Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, has been very active in the framework of the Parliamentary Troika with the Parliamentary Assemblies of the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
While the European Union has limited its official contacts with Belarus to a strict minimum, this alternative form of political dialogue is very useful and demonstrates that in terms of minimum standards of democracy and human rights, the elected representatives of all three organisations speak with one voice to Belarus.
The Commission strongly agrees with the emphasis in the resolution on strengthening dialogue with civil society, NGOs, democratic forces, the media and with the universities in Belarus.
However, as to the call to the Commission in Article 9 of the draft resolution, to: '?develop a strategy for Belarus within the proposal 'Wider Europe' for the democratisation and the development of a social market economy' in Belarus, it seems obvious to me that any assistance or help from the Commission could only be in support of a comprehensive government strategy.
It could never replace a strategy by Belarus itself.
The driving force for this sort of change would need to come from Belarus.
Unfortunately, it does not seem to be there yet.
What we can and will do in the Commission, is to use the instruments at our disposal to continue support and assistance to grass roots civil society organisations, to journalists and independent media, to universities and also - where it is appropriate - to local authorities.
Within the limits of the restrictions set by the September 1997 General Affairs Council, the Commission is also proceeding with technical assistance on border and regional projects, as well as projects linked to the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe.
When calling for broader engagement in terms of assistance, we should also not forget the difficult ground we are working on in Belarus.
It is the authorities, with instruments like the notorious 'Decree No 8', that make the work of foreign donors and their partners in Belarus extremely difficult.
We had some joint projects with the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Belarus.
The de facto closure of the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group in Minsk last October has obviously threatened the further implementation of such projects.
Only after the 19 November 2002 decision of 14 EU Member States to impose a visa ban on President Lukashenko and seven other leading personalities in Belarus was a compromise finally reached to establish a new OSCE Minsk office as of 1 January 2003.
The coming weeks and months will demonstrate whether the authorities in Belarus are finally committed to take the path towards freedom, democracy and an improvement in human rights.
Normalised relations with the OSCE could be a first step.
Compliance with minimum standards during the coming local elections in early March would be a second step, followed by a convincing commitment to fulfil all the conditions outlined in Parliament's draft resolution.
These are the sort of benchmarks that could prepare the way for the eventual accession of Belarus to the Council of Europe and, beyond that, open the perspective for a gradual normalisation of relations with the European Union.
I am very grateful to the rapporteur for the work he has done to make these things possible - we all hope - in the future.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Marset Campos for his sterling work on this report, which has been characterised by considerable consensus.
It is an extremely important debate that Commissioner Patten is drawing to our attention here.
The European Union is now going on the offensive and, in its relations with Belarus, is active in a quite different way than it has been in the past.
We demonstrably have a pariah state at our borders.
In spite of this, it is important that a structured dialogue with Belarus be instituted, as pointed out in a number of amendments by, for example, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Mr Patten intimates what might be the shape of that dialogue.
As the European Parliament, it is our task to demand that a structured dialogue of this kind be brought about.
What are at stake are cross-border and domestic policy matters of common interest, such as illegal immigration, the sex trade and trafficking in human beings, including women.
It is also a question of the European Union's now adopting a structured approach to instituting discussions and of its putting pressure on the Belorusian authorities, not by isolating them but through active engagement and discussions with them.
I believe that the European Union ought in actual fact to give priority to Belarus in the present situation.
Especially in view of the fact that the European Union is so divided in its view of Iraq, it is perhaps a matter of additional urgency that the common foreign and security policy, which was set out in the Treaty of Maastricht and which is now in pieces, be given a dimension relating to Belarus.
Precisely now, when we are divided within the European Union, we ought to unite around those areas in which we can take vigorous action.
I think we should engage in some self-examination and ask ourselves the question: have we been sufficiently vigorous and energetic when it comes to Belarus?
Belarus suffers from huge problems, of course.
These include a leader who is quite consciously governing his country dictatorially; the disappearance of opposition politicians and others of whose fate we are unaware, such as Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovksy and Yuri Zaharenko.
Other problems are a lack of freedom of association, whereby the regime attempts to control the trade unions; legislation governing religious freedom that limits the right of various new evangelical churches to operate freely in that country; and, in addition, politicians who not only disappear but are also imprisoned.
We must nonetheless apply a strategy towards the Belorusian authorities that involves our saying: 'we are not going to isolate you but, rather, conduct a dialogue with you'.
Belarus has itself chosen the isolation to which it has been exposed.
Let us join forces within the EU in the interests of new relations with Belarus, involving demands for democracy and human rights.
I compliment Mr Marset Campos, particularly on the way in which he maintained a consistent line in the report, a line consistent with all Parliament's statements and actions over the past few years.
Anyone who reads the report as it has been adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will find it hard to imagine that it is about a European country that will be a neighbouring state from next May.
The mark on its report card is quite plainly devastating.
Despite all the efforts in that regard, including on the part of the European Parliament via the parliamentary troika with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the situation for democracy has not improved at all since 1997.
In fact you could say that the reverse has been the case.
The most important conclusion must therefore be that there is no reason to change the policy of more or less frozen relations with the current regime as long as President Lukashenko continues his policy of isolation.
This is most deplorable as far as the 10 million inhabitants of that country are concerned, for they deserve better.
The politics of that country stand in the way of improvements in relations and are therefore also hindering the desired cooperation in numerous areas, including in the humanitarian sphere.
Until such time as President Lukashenko takes a significant step towards greater democracy, it will not be possible for the European Union to implement a positive policy.
That is a shame, because this is something we need to do, not least on account of our future borders with the country.
The European Union must, however, continue to support alternative forces in Belarus, such as the independent media as well as the third sector and what we call civil society.
Without internal dynamics there, without an internal democratic movement, the situation is not going to change in the near future.
Help for the victims of Chernobyl must also be improved.
We have already discussed in this Parliament the provision of additional support for cancer hospitals in Belarus in the context of the Budget.
Mr Marset Campos' report also includes an implicit call to the Russian Federation to be more concerned about the democratic credentials of the regime in Belarus.
More than once I have watched the Russians congratulate President Lukashenko on an election result after the entire Council of Europe and the EU had rejected it.
This is of course unacceptable.
This is the kind of contradiction that will get us nowhere.
Do the Russians actually intend to create a union with a country whose leadership has such a poor reputation with the European Union and the other European organisations?
I therefore ask the Council and the Commission in particular to be more emphatic about this point in consultations with the Russian Federation.
The joint economic and political pressure exerted by the European Union and Russia and the need for greater internal dynamics which I have already referred to will ultimately turn out to be deciding factors.
Pressure from outside and pressure from within, and especially with some emphasis on the economic element.
It is to be hoped that this concept will be reflected in the coming communication about an enlarged Europe.
In the meantime, we must make do with the channel that we ourselves helped to create, the parliamentary troika, in order to maintain a minimal dialogue with the country.
It does, however, remain depressing and very frustrating.
Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party hopes that it might be possible for Belarus one day to be accepted into the European Community.
We hope that the country can introduce democracy, human rights and principles characteristic of a state governed by law.
We hope that a market economy will be introduced so that the badly afflicted Belorusian people might experience economic prosperity and dare to believe in the future.
Unfortunately, we are an infinitely long way away from realising that vision.
The trend is completely in the wrong direction, and it is no exaggeration to say that Lukashenko is an odious Communist dictator.
His latest professions of friendship for his fellow dictator, Saddam Hussein are no doubt in keeping with what we know about the Belorusian leader.
The list of atrocities in Belarus is endless: imprisoned and disappeared journalists, persecution, maltreatment, torture of opponents, farcical elections, frequent application of the death penalty and no freedom of expression.
Moreover, Belarus is both a country of origin and country of transit when it comes to extensive trafficking in women and children, and a vast number of illegal weapons circulate there.
Obviously, it is not possible to have any official and formal contacts with the Belorusian regime.
Even though I value the idea of a structured dialogue, I wonder how it will be possible for this to take place with the regime in question.
However, it is important, just as Commissioner Patten said, to strengthen the limited and courageous opposition that exists: opposition parties, human rights organisations, voluntary organisations and journalists who desperately need our help and who are fighting against extreme odds.
This support would be best provided in cooperation with the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the UN.
The troika, of which the European Parliament is a part, would also fulfil a very important function.
There is cause for taking a gloomy view of developments in Belarus, but let us not for that reason betray the Belorusian people, who have had to put up with a great deal, and let us never stop putting pressure on the regime and the authorities.
The forthcoming local elections are something to focus on.
My group supports Mr Marset Campos's very well prepared report and wants to congratulate him on this work.
Mr President, as is well known, Belarus is to become the EU's new neighbour, and it is therefore incredibly important that we should begin to concern ourselves with what is happening there and to take the country seriously.
That is why it is also an important report that my fellow group member has written, making it apparent to anyone who still needed to be informed, how critical and difficult the situation is and how much is awry in terms of human rights, democracy and so on.
I wish to thank Mr Marset Campos very much for an incredibly good report on a very important topic.
Now, the fact is that my group is confederal in nature, and we do not therefore praise each other as a matter of course, but I am nonetheless able to say, on behalf of the Nordic Green Left, that we fully support what Mr Marset Campos has written in his report.
Our confederal nature also means that the group has come up with amendments with which we do not agree and, like the rapporteur, I do not support these.
It is apparent from this report that many things are required if, as I hope it one day will, Belarus is ever to reach the point at which it can become a member of the EU.
First and foremost, democratic developments are required, and I think that, if it wishes to do so, the EU can play a decisive role in this area.
As good democrats, it should be our task to support those activities, inside and outside Belarus, that are aimed at changing how things stand for ordinary people and for the democratic movements.
The Church has been mentioned, but I am also thinking of the trade unions and a number of journalists who really are doing a sterling job in moving the country in the right direction.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, for his report, which does indeed very well summarise the decisive conclusions resulting from this Parliament's work in recent years.
This makes it a very important document in the discussions on the subject of Belarus.
It might well be important to reiterate in this context that it is not the European institutions that are isolating Belarus, but the country itself, and the dictator who has plunged it into crisis and who prohibits and represses every form of democratic expression.
We are a long way from being able to take up normal relations with this country.
On that, Commissioner, I agree with you entirely.
Despite that, the reality is that Belarus is our neighbour, and we must have an interest in overcoming its self-imposed isolation.
If that cannot be done in the context of normal relations, the need still remains for the European Union to develop a strategy for dealing with Belarus.
All the same, I think it would be a good thing if you were to turn your attention to item 9, which demands that we should adopt a strategy for dealing with Belarus.
To do so would of course result in consideration of where we should have recourse to such important diplomatic instruments as the carrot and the stick, or what sort of instruments we should apply, where we should impose sanctions and where we should offer support.
The instruments we have had up to now are inappropriate, so we must modify them to our purposes as regards Belarus.
Item 9 sets out with the utmost clarity what they are to be modified to do and in which areas more needs to be done than was done within the last programme.
That is what this item is for, and it is my belief that it thus gives the Commission very, very good indications of what to do.
I would also like to reiterate that the local elections and our observation of them will be of great importance to future relations.
I hope that this is where we can enjoy very good strategic cooperation with the Commission.
Mr President, whilst it is self-evidently legitimate to criticise Belarus' political system, the same criticisms can be levelled at the other states of the former Soviet Union, and I would like to take this opportunity to point out that there are also highly favourable indicators in Belarus.
By this I mean the Sakharov University in Minsk, whose work in relation to the environment may be regarded as pointing a way for others to follow.
The European Union should support more reform movements of this sort, which, in the long term, will make the country more democratic.
Last year, I gained a very strong impression that living conditions had improved in comparison to what they had been in previous years, although a short visit to a country cannot give you the complete picture.
One cannot, unfortunately, sound the all-clear as regards the consequences of Chernobyl.
Vast numbers of people are still dying in der Gomel region.
Lack of funding prevents people over the age of 45 being treated.
The international community must give more attention to this problem and, above all, provide more material assistance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union will change the political landscape.
From May 2004, future members such as Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will share external borders with Belarus, a country contiguous with the European Union, one that is part of the legacy of the Soviet Union's collapse, and one that can, alas, be described, politically, economically and legally speaking, as a problem case lagging behind everyone else.
We cannot regard with indifference the regression of a country, soon to be a neighbour to the European Union, into an authoritarian and dictatorial regime.
Belarus is increasingly cutting itself off.
We see this in the failure to extend the OSCE mission in Minsk.
The Council of Europe refuses to let Belarus become a member.
Thus, Belarus' isolation is increasing, and so the situation remains utterly unchanged.
Parliament's attempt, by means of a report, at exerting some influence, is therefore to be welcomed, even if only because it sends out a signal to encourage the democratic opposition forces, which, although weak, are nonetheless still there, to show signs of life in the forthcoming local elections in March.
Any country excluding itself in this way from European development cannot do other than become a security problem for the European Union.
Because of the de facto lack of security on the border with its Russian neighbour, with which it has close economic and political ties, Belarus is a main transit country for illegal immigrants travelling from Russia to the EU.
In terms of illegal immigration, it is to be regarded as more important as a transit country than as a country of origin.
There is thus a clearly perceptible trend towards migration into Austria from the Indian subcontinent and Iraq by way of Belarus and the Ukraine.
Over recent months, Minsk has created problems for flights to Austria.
Increased numbers of illegal immigrants have been intercepted at Vienna's Schwechat airport, having travelled from Iraq and India and flown from Minsk.
A structured dialogue - as soon as circumstances permit - is thus very much to be desired.
Mr President, we would like to have Belarus as one of Community Europe's neighbours and, perhaps, one day, as part of it too.
Although we may wonder to what extent some countries can become part of Europe, that problem does not exist where Belarus is concerned, for it is in Europe.
However, the last assessment of the situation carried out by the Council of Europe a few months ago excludes the possibility of inviting Belarus to join its Parliamentary Assembly.
From the point of view of democracy, nothing much has changed, and yet the European Parliament is patiently hoping for an initiative that can further the re-establishment of certain rights.
At first, it might even be a case of agreeing on the meaning of individual definitions, for I sometimes have the impression that a dialogue is taking place between deaf people, between two parties who do not understand what the other means by the word 'democracy'.
It is true that there are many reasons why Belarus might want to attach itself to Russia, but it would be in its national interest to maintain a certain balance.
The next local elections will, in any case, be measurable evidence of whether any progress has been made in the area of fundamental rights.
The abolition of the death penalty, freedom of the press, of association, of religion: these are the minimum conditions, but how long will it take to achieve them so that dialogue can be resumed?
In geopolitical terms it makes sense: sooner or later it will happen.
An extremely high level of corruption, poverty and disorder catapulted Lukashenko to power in 1994, but his remedy was too brutal: he eliminated some of the corruption but his authoritarian tendencies were combined with the sort of dirigisme which had already led to the break-up of the Soviet Union, and there has been little change since then.
Let us hope that some progress is made soon.
Mr President, the European Union is trying in any way it can to put pressure on Belarus to respect human rights and bring about democratic reform.
Until now we have used more stick than carrot.
In the future it will be wise of us to try and find more positive ways of achieving our aims.
After the enlargement of the EU Belarus will be our neighbour, sharing a common border with no fewer than three new Member States: Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
We must encourage Belarus to maintain its independence as a state and orientate itself towards European cooperation.
Multilateral cooperation will provide us with a good forum for cooperation with Belarus.
Positions in the Council of Baltic Sea States will alter when the Baltic countries and Poland go from being neighbours to members of the EU.
In this situation the EU must be more firmly committed than it has hitherto to the work of the Council and channel more funds to projects to be undertaken.
With Union enlargement the importance of cross-border cooperation will increase.
We have to encourage Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in particular to develop cross-border cooperation with Belarus.
In the future the Union must be prepared to finance projects in connection with this.
There must be a new scheme to provide funds created in the European Union for cross-border cooperation, either in association with TACIS or as a separate arrangement.
There must be more conspicuous channelling of funds on the part of the Union than there has been until now towards development in our neighbouring countries, especially those neighbouring regions across our borders.
Differences in standards of living must also be narrowed down effectively on the Union's external borders.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen representing the Member States, although we approve of the general objective of the Marset-Campos report, aimed at strengthening links with Belarus, as ought moreover to be done in the case of Russia, we are unable to approve either the conditions it sets for doing so or the ways and means to which it intends giving preference.
Indeed, we are in the process of giving wider currency to what, if I may put it this way, is the form of justice we are applying to Iraq.
In other words, our aim is to choose regimes rather than recognise states.
It is a form of logic that may have far-reaching consequences.
In fact, it is not for us to pass judgment upon governments.
Mr Lukashenko's regime does not perhaps meet the criteria of our democracies which are themselves, moreover, far from being perfect and, even, increasingly devoid of any content as national sovereignty is progressively relinquished.
That being said, my stay in Minsk, to which I was sent by Parliament, enabled me to observe that, in spite of everything, democracy is making real progress there, that the word pluralism is not completely out of place and, above all, that President Lukashenko enjoys a certain legitimacy.
This is explained by the fact that, following the collapse of the Soviet regime, he has replaced a succession of ephemeral governments which had exasperated the Belorusian population by, firstly, privatising everything left, right and centre, including even essential public services which thereupon came under the control of Western firms and, secondly and above all, by attempting to detach Belarus from Russia, something to which the Belorusian people could not consent.
Nor is it up to us, as advocated by the report, either to encourage the opposition or any political party whatsoever or, in fact, to turn NGOs into instruments for use in subversion operations.
Nor is it up to us to choose this or that economic model for Belarus.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are extremely dangerous routes to go down, for there is no way in which international society can live in peace if, by virtue of being rich and strong, a state or states claim the right to overthrow those governments they do not like and, in their place, to designate governments after their own fashion.
There could be no peace under these conditions.
Let us therefore respect states as they are and peoples as they are.
Whatever may happen, Belarus is a part of Europe and has been so for centuries.
It will at any event be an important partner for our countries and, of course, very much so in the case of France.
Mr President, Belarus is the last surviving European bastion of neo-soviet ideology.
It is now politically important, as, in 2004, it will become a neighbouring country of the European Union.
One can say in its favour that, unlike some of its neighbours, it remains free of inter-ethnic strife and has unilaterally renounced its nuclear arsenal, as well as much of its conventional weaponry.
It is also rather surprisingly still enjoying an economic growth rate of 4%.
Unfortunately, the country deteriorated into authoritarianism and the repression of linguistic and religious rights after the election of Lukashenko as president in 1994.
However, he is no Saddam Hussein.
The election led initially to the hope that authority would be upheld, corruption rooted out and the economy put back on track, in particular stopping the asset-stripping and tax evasion seen in other CIS countries.
Belarus is currently under enormous pressure to reinforce its borders with Russia and the Ukraine to avoid any further influx of immigrants, and the European Union must cooperate in this area, irrespective of the nature of the government in Minsk.
Private enterprise in Belarus cannot function efficiently, and the effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave concern.
There is alleged harassment of the opposition, the silencing of critical voices and the establishment of a network of patronage throughout the country.
The forthcoming municipal elections in March 2003 will be a test of the potential for favourable political developments in Belarus, and we hope that observers from this Parliament will be invited.
The European Union should await the election results and respond towards Belarus accordingly, in line with a step-by-step policy.
There is growing appreciation within Belarus of the need for democracy; hence the need for greater western contact with pro-democracy parliamentarians to avoid the risk of self-imposed isolationism.
Finally, if the people of Belarus so wish, we must also offer them the prospect of possible EU membership in the longer term.
Mr President, I have nothing extensive or substantive to add to what I said in my introductory remarks.
But since there have been a number of references to the 'Wider Europe' debate, perhaps I could keep Members informed about how our thinking is developing on that.
The Commission is committed to producing a communication on 'Wider Europe' by the time of the March General Affairs and External Relations Council, following the remit that we were given at Copenhagen.
It obliges us to look not just at the eastern neighbours - to whom we have turned our attention today - but also at our broader neighbourhood to the south and east.
In the context of that communication, we will want to follow the point Mr VÃ€yrynen made so ably about both financial instruments and the importance of the northern dimension and its various component parts in any serious neighbourhood policy.
We will want to pursue those points vigorously.
I finish with a telegram of what I said at the outset: we wish to hold out the hand of friendship and cooperation to Belarus, but that demands of Belarus a sea change in its attitude to the political and, frankly, economic values that we hold dear.
I hope that there will be sufficient change in Belarus for us to develop a warmer relationship with that important country.
However, to borrow a sporting metaphor, the ball is in the Belarus Government's court.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended for a few minutes until voting time)
Mr President, as the House knows, my report concerns the Spanish initiative to simplify the Schengen rules and cut out as much red tape as possible, by allowing group visas to be issued at external borders to seamen in transit, thereby making things easier for Member States with a navy.
My report is a considerable improvement on the original proposal, because it protects citizens' individual rights and personal data, using the Schengen provisions on which the regulation is based.
My report also edits the text so that it is gender neutral, in recognition of the fact that many women have entered the seafaring profession over recent years.
Most importantly, we reject the criterion of common nationality because there are insufficient grounds for requiring seamen to be of the same nationality in order to obtain a group visa.
The report therefore proposes that short group visas should be issued to groups of between five and fifty seamen, even if they are not all of the same nationality.
This will help European shipping considerably.
Mr President, there should be no problem at all in banning E 425 konjac.
It is a completely unnecessary additive which, moreover, is dangerous.
What, however, is rather controversial is my, and a unanimous committee's, proposal that the Commission go through all the lists of food additives in the light of children's consuming them.
What, above all, we are concerned with here are soft drinks, sweets and the like which children consume in larger quantities than is desirable.
I can recommend our voting against Amendments Nos 1 and 3 if the Commission now sincerely pledges to change these lists of additives and make a point of examining them within a reasonable period.
This is, then, a question for the Commission.
. Mr President, I wish to begin by saying to Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Byrne, how grateful we are to her for her work as rapporteur on this extremely important subject.
I shall respond directly to the point she made.
I can confirm that the review of authorised food additives is required in the overall framework directive and in the three specific directives on the various classes of additives.
The framework directive requires food additives to be re-evaluated whenever necessary.
The specific directives require Member States to monitor the consumption of food additives and the Commission to use this information to report to Parliament and to the Council.
The Commission presented a first report two years ago in 2001.
I want to underline the point that it covered consumption of food additives by adults and children.
It has identified additives on which more refined data is necessary.
In particular, it concluded that consumption by children of a series of additives should be better evaluated by the Member States, for example, sulphites and benzoates.
A second report is foreseen next year in 2004.
Last October, the Commission formally reminded the Member States of their obligation to provide the information for this new report.
Three Member States have since then transmitted information and four Member States have confirmed that they have ongoing studies.
Even if all Member States do not submit such information, it will be possible to evaluate on this basis whether the current use pattern of some additives has to be modified.
If necessary, on the basis of the new report, the Commission will propose restrictions to currently authorised use patterns, in particular to ensure that intake by children is safe.
I hope that those reassurances will meet the very important points made by the rapporteur.
Does the rapporteur wish to maintain the advice she gave before she asked the question to the Commission?
Mr President, I recommend my fellow MEPs to vote against Amendments Nos 1 and 3, to vote in favour of Amendment No 2 and, of course, to vote in favour in the final vote.
Mr President, my voting machine is making a very strange noise and it has a lot of lights on it.
Mr President, there are, very confusingly, a large number of translations of item 14.
It is apparent from its context that it is about the United Nations rather than the United States, and that must be made clear.
Neither the English nor the German translations get it right; you have to go back to the Spanish version, which makes it perfectly clear that it is the United Nations that is meant, the subject being international organisations.
That has to be borne in mind, and it is perhaps important as we come to the vote.
Mr President, I have tabled Amendment No 6 which will become null and void if Amendment No 3 is voted for.
Through my amendment, I wanted to ask for a dialogue to be opened immediately between the European Union and Belarus in the context of the fight against crime and the trade in human beings.
As a prior condition of such a dialogue, Amendment No 3 would have Belarus fulfil all the conditions set out in the report, meaning that this collaboration in the fight against crime would not begin for several years, whereas it needs to begin right away.
I propose that you either vote on my amendment before voting on Amendment No 3 or hold a split vote and vote separately on the part of the sentence reading 'as soon as the basic conditions are fulfilled'.
I ask you to vote against this part of the sentence because I think that cooperation of this kind, focused on the fight against crime, must begin immediately, whatever the conditions prevailing in the country concerned.
The voting list shows that Amendment No 3 should be voted first.
Amendment No 6 rests on that.
We have had a suggestion that there should be a split vote instead.
I ask for the rapporteur's advice on this matter.
Mr President, I have no objection to a separate vote, but I agree with the order established since that was what was approved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Mr President, Amendment No 3 has not been lodged with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
One amendment only has been lodged with that committee, namely Amendment No 6.
That does not help.
We have valid amendments before us, the first of which is Amendment No 3.
You have called for a split vote and the rapporteur said he would be in favour of this.
Is that correct?
Mr President, my proposal is firstly Amendment No 3 and then later Amendment No 6. And if there is an Amendment No 6, a separate vote.
- (FR) For any normal person, freedom of movement means that any individual who is a citizen of an EU country or who has come from outside the European Union and now lives within it may move and reside within the EU as he sees fit.
That would be too simple, however, for the generations of self-styled 'fathers of Europe'.
The interminable haggling between Member States, united solely by the desire to bring about the free circulation of capital, has resulted in such a jumble of different regulations where visas are concerned that it has become a problem even for the conduct of business.
Spain's indignation has been aroused, not from the human rights point of view but because the situation 'causes valuable time to be lost and inflicts serious losses on seamen, shipping companies and airlines, since it frequently causes flights or flight connections to be missed'.
Hence, a number of measures to make it easier to obtain certain categories of visa.
We have not voted against this report, for the new regulations will perhaps prevent a few of the inconveniences, and even humiliations, that seamen have to bear at present.
This pathetic haggling and these short-sighted measures are, however, a good illustration of the gulf between the ostensible desire to build a unified Europe of the nations and the reality of a Europe that remains divided, surrounded by barbed wire and incapable of ensuring genuine freedom of movement for those within it.
. (PT) Although visas should only be granted at borders in exceptional circumstances, common procedures must be established in the Member States for the transit of seamen, a professional category that is subject to enormous labour mobility.
This initiative is intended to update, clarify and streamline rules for granting visas to seamen in transit.
The major legislative innovation consists of the possibility, provided that certain conditions are met, of issuing collective transit visas to seamen from the same vessel who are travelling in a group of between five and fifty people, provided that the period of transit is limited.
They must not be required to have the same nationality, however, because in practical terms, this would basically nullify the effects of this proposal.
It is also important to make the shipping agent and the shipping line responsible for visa requests. The need for the exchange of information must also be emphasised to ascertain, for example, whether an individual has been arrested, whether he has a criminal record, whether he is suspected of being involved in trafficking or in illegal immigration.
This initiative, with the amendments tabled by the European Parliament can contribute to making the complex Schengen acquis a little more comprehensible and bring solutions which, although perhaps not the ones we would wish to see - such as the introduction of more thoroughgoing reforms of the Schengen acquis - are solutions that are possible.
. (PT) I voted in favour of this report for two main reasons.
On the one hand, I acknowledge the clear need to promote the harmonisation of the divergent legislation in this field, an essential requirement for making the Schengen acquis intelligible and accessible.
I would emphasise, however, that even were this not the case, I do not see the slightest problem in there existing differences between national legislations on migratory phenomena. On the contrary, I feel that any artificial attempt to standardise, exceeding the provisions of Article 63(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, would be counterproductive.
Furthermore, I also share the rapporteur's conviction about the importance of controlling external borders as a means of combating illegal immigration and crime.
To conclude, I welcome the integration into the Common Manual of practices applicable to seamen in transit and would highlight the importance of the collective visa which, as the rapporteur quite rightly observed, could become unenforceable if it were only issued to nationals of the same State.
I deplore, however, the 'politically correct' approach adopted by the rapporteur in insisting on adding gender-related words, when the fact is that basic interpretive rules would suffice and there was clearly never any discrimination in the Commission's text.
Yesterday, Mr President, while I was in the aeroplane flying me from Bergamo to Strasbourg, I shut my eyes for a moment and I saw the Italian theatrical character, Pantalone, who is famous for being penniless and poverty-stricken, talking to Mr Santini.
Pantalone was asking Mr Santini: 'Why do you not let me move throughout Europe in your report?' 'I?' replied Mr Santini.
'But you can move throughout Europe!' And Pantalone insisted: 'No, I can't, because the report says that those who want to travel must have the financial resources to pay for the trip, for the flight, which means that one needs to be reasonably well-off.
I am Pantalone, I am poor, I have no money, and so I cannot move throughout Europe.
I am not happy about this, and so I advise Mr Fatuzzo to vote against the motion.'
And I did, in fact, vote against the motion.
You can take it up with Mr Santini over lunch.
Mr President, I just want to make a brief comment on the Santini report, which, along with the substantive amendments from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Members belonging to the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted for, even though it is clear to us that there are elements in this report about which the Council will have serious misgivings, some of them originating from the German Government.
We will return to these controversial points, which primarily concern the obligations to support family members, in the course of further discussions, especially when the Council comes to set down its Common Position.
The reason why I am giving this explanation of vote is that we may well find ourselves having to define our position anew at Second Reading stage.
Mr President, the majority of British Labour Members, myself included, have abstained on the Santini report.
Although we support its fundamental objectives, which serve a sound purpose, we are concerned that, as the report stands, the provisions designed to reach this valuable goal do not include sufficient guarantees against potential exploitation by criminal gangs and those seeking to enter the EU illegally.
We do not, for example, accept the need to do away with documentary evidence proving family relationship.
Furthermore, whilst we wish to protect the rights of unmarried and same-sex partners, we cannot allow a situation to arise where the unmarried partners of EU nationals could have greater rights to enter a Member State than the nationals of that country.
Moreover, there must be safeguards to ensure that we do not encourage the use of marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry.
The provisions which seek to soften the economic conditions attached to residence in exceptional circumstances need more work and clarification before a further reading.
Finally, we do not accept the provision in Article 26(2) which would prevent Member States from expelling permanent residents in exceptional circumstances.
This power is rarely used, but we must reserve the right to use it for serious breaches of public security.
. (EL) The motion to allow European citizens freedom of movement and residence on Community territory is on the right track, which is why I support it.
It gives citizens greater opportunity to exercise their right to move freely throughout the Community by calling for procedures to be simplified and pared down.
Of course, making over six months' residence dependent on financial resources could give rise to social discrimination.
Now that the definition of the family has been extended to same sex or unmarried partners, the directive reflects the diversity of family relationships in today's society more closely.
Finally, greater flexibility is needed for students studying abroad; with the length of time studying takes nowadays, this could be considered as a reason for obtaining a residence permit.
. (FR) The proposal for a directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States is gradually changing all aspects of the meaning of this right.
In fact, according to the Treaty, it means that the citizens of each Member State may in principle move or reside in the territory of other Member States, but it does not mean that the States of residence have no right of control or right of justified refusal.
The directive proposed by the Commission, however, switches from one meaning to the other, taking the case-law of the Court of Justice as a basis but going beyond it, without the necessary adjustments being made in the Treaty after democratic debate.
This text would take power away from the Member States and make them lose a little more of the control of their territory, which we refuse to accept.
Even the French Government, although it is generally indulgent towards the Community institutions, has protested in particular against the suppression, laid down by the directive, of the right to expel a Community national after a permanent stay of four years.
On these grounds, we voted against this text.
. (FR) The right to free movement within the territory of the Member States was in principle decided when the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 and was due to enter into force at the same time as the Treaty.
The simple fact that, 45 years later, we still need to vote on resolutions so that this right can come into play is truly a sign that, for those taking the decisions on European unity, the only thing that counts is free movement of capital and goods, not citizens' rights.
Even in the proposal for a directive, this right is partial and its limits carefully defined.
For example, it will be the responsibility of the Member State of residence to determine whether or not it intends to provide social aid or student grants.
This, however, does not prevent us from constantly talking about European citizenship!
We voted in favour of this report, however, because its recommendations would considerably improve the directive currently being prepared on citizens' right to move and reside within the territory of the European Union, in particular with regard to the rights of spouses and children.
. (PT) I welcome the improvements being made to the situation of EU citizens who wish to settle in another Member State of the Union, in particular reducing the bureaucracy that currently proliferates.
On the basis of the proposal for a directive put forward by the European Commission, it will now be possible for an EU citizen to remain on the territory of another Member State without having to comply with any formalities, for a period of six months and not only three months, which is the current requirement.
For stays of more than six months, if a Union citizen is engaged in a gainful activity, he is simply required to make a declaration to that effect.
If he is not engaged in a gainful activity, he is obliged to declare that he has sufficient resources and Member States may not fix any threshold for this. He must also take out sickness insurance cover for his first four years of residence.
The right to permanent residence at the end of these four years is the major innovation introduced by the directive and consists of the fact that this right is granted to the European citizen and to the members of his/her family.
The report makes some positive improvements, widening the concept of the family, eliminating or simplifying some bureaucracy, and guaranteeing more rights than those planned initially.
Hence our vote in favour.
. Support for these measures from British Labour and Liberal Democrat Members comes at a time when our own government has had to admit that immigration systems are already at breaking point in the United Kingdom.
These proposals come at a time of increased terror risk in the EU when Member States are already struggling to cope with the weight of the movement of people across the continent.
British Conservatives cannot, therefore, support this report.
- (DA) We have today in the European Parliament refrained from voting in favour of Mr Santini's report (A5-0009/2003) on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.
Basically, we think that the Commission's proposal is too far-reaching in as much as a Member State would not be able to deport people with permanent residence permits.
We have nonetheless voted in favour of quite a few of the European Parliament's ameliorative amendments which, for example, put registered partners on an equal footing with married couples.
. (NL) The European Union has succeeded in one aspect.
In the consciousness of the inhabitants of the 15 Member States, every citizen of a Member State is free to visit the territory of another Member State and to stay there for a long period of time or even undertake paid work there.
Virtually nobody believes that there are still rules which seriously restrict that right.
It is therefore quite ridiculous that we are today still discussing the circumstances under which such stays can be permitted and for how long, and what the rights of same-sex partners or unmarried cohabitees of a different nationality are.
What we seem to be doing today is restricting freedoms that already exist instead of broadening them, mainly in order to exclude people from social security for the first four years.
We are constantly arguing for greater mobility of labour, which would entail Europeans, like Americans, being willing to move thousands of kilometres for paid work.
People do not want this kind of pressure at all; what they want is the freedom they thought they already had to make the decision themselves to live and work abroad.
I am voting for this regulation because it reduces existing restrictions and excludes the expulsion of people on account of illness or an accident.
. (PT) We are aware that studying this report appeared at the outset to be a difficult exercise, basically due not only to the issue of the categories of person that should be included in the definition of 'family member' - or of 'beneficiary', in addition to the EU citizen, the definition of the right to move to and particularly to reside in the European Union - but also to the problems inherent in defining the conditions that EU citizens must fulfil in order to benefit from this right.
The fact is that the solutions adopted in these nuclear definitions both in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and in plenary, have all had the majority support of the parliamentary left.
In fact, with regard to the definition of the term 'family', most of the solutions were adopted in a sense that does not match the values that I hold dear, especially Amendment No 53: the 'spouse', regardless of their sex, the 'unmarried partner' and/or 'person with whom they live', regardless of their sex, 'in a de facto union', 'with whom the applicant has a durable relationship' and 'registered' under the terms of the relevant national legislation, the 'partner' and/or 'person with whom they live' from third countries or without a residence permit and lastly, direct descendents and direct relatives in the ascendant line and those of the spouse or registered partner with whom they live.
My position is not rooted in any type of ideological or religious fundamentalism.
I am not judging, and nor is it my place to judge anyone's rights on the grounds of their sexual or any other kind of orientation.
I see no reason why the EU should promote legal definitions of the family that are far removed not only from national legislation, making it difficult to transpose them, but also from traditional values that have always been commonly accepted. Apart from anything, such definitions will encourage all sorts of abuses by those who attempt illegally to move to the EU and settle.
Hence my vote against.
. (PT) Although I believe that creating a genuine European area of free movement and genuinely defining the Union's citizens' right to residence justify promoting a coherent and articulate policy, I have had to vote against the report.
I regret that the excessive approach of the proposals, voted for mainly by the left in the parliamentary committee, remove any merit the report had, and take it far from the considerably more balanced approach of the rapporteur.
The final text suffers from the vices of failing to add to the rights and freedoms that are enshrined the duties that go with them, thereby denying the need to take account of their real value and of their real existence. They also seek to impose a European identity, ignoring true national identities; establishing an artificial equation between the family and other human relationships in a way that is no longer surprising and takes opportunistic advantage of one issue in order to impose another; and it ignores the third largest concern of Europe's citizens - the fight against organised crime.
In addition to breaking down the internal doors of the Union, this text would not allow Member States to learn about and monitor migratory phenomena, a factor that will affect their domestic social balance and the implementation of their budgets, especially for social assistance.
The European Parliament has therefore opted for what is a clearly excessive approach, which goes far beyond what is needed. This will, in a counterproductive way, only create further difficulties and new unnecessary obstacles to the adoption of these rules.
As I have already said, those who wish to achieve too much will prevent us from achieving the basic goals.
Together with the whole of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have voted against the report, which was nonetheless approved by 269 votes in favour, 225 against and 46 abstentions.
We Christian Democrats cannot go along with the watered down definition of 'marriage' or 'the family' that the majority of Parliament supports by wanting the definition also to include partners of the same sex, unmarried cohabiting partners and registered partners, irrespective of sex, in circumstances where, by law or in practice, the country of origin or the recipient country puts such people on an equal footing with married couples.
Instead, we fully support the Commission's proposal, based upon time-honoured definitions of marriage and the family that our western Christian civilisation has used throughout the centuries, such as its definition of a married couple as husband and wife.
The conditions governing freedom of movement and residence within the EU for persons without EU citizenship must be clear and simple to apply legally.
Today's adoption of Amendments Nos 14 to 16 (262 votes in favour, 238 against and 30 abstentions) shows that a majority wishes to move in the opposite direction.
To attempt, with the smallest possible political majority, to use European regulations on freedom of movement and residence in this way, namely in order to export to other Member States, and indirectly to impose upon them, a view of the family and marriage that is not embraced by these countries' culture and national legislation, is contrary to the spirit of cooperation in the EU and, in my opinion, deeply objectionable.
. The ability of Member States in the European Union to decide their own policy on requiring visas for travel to those states and to change it, as and when required, for security or other reasons would be adversely affected by this measure.
Visas are necessary and useful tools in providing controls.
British Conservatives cannot, therefore, accept this proposal.
. (NL) Visas are a way for governments to torment people.
People think that their passports will get them into other countries but they are refused entry because they come from a country that is regarded as too hostile, too poor or too far away.
Inhabitants of the EU, like Americans, are subject to far fewer compulsory visas than many others, because our territory is rich and powerful and sees itself as the centre of the world.
We can find out what obstacles we are subjecting other people to by looking at the experiences of EU citizens travelling through Serbia or Belarus.
The first lesson is that you must not make people queue at a customs office or outside one to pay transit tax.
The second lesson is that you must never send people back to a distant embassy in a capital city or even in their country of origin to get a visa.
If we turn people away we must have a good reason for doing so.
If we do admit people, we must not only do so because we hope that companies in our countries can do business with them.
A visa policy must be reasonable, also for students, tourists and people who are coming to present their problems to international organisations.
. (PT) The European Parliament has today had to face the fact that five Member States have declared themselves to be in favour of transferring Ecuador to the list of third countries whose nationals require visas, basically because of illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, regional coherence and considerations of public order.
According to information that has been provided, many Ecuadoreans enter Europe legally under the cover of tourism but then stay on illegally for longer than three months.
The expulsion of Ecuadorean nationals is becoming increasingly frequent, due mainly to a lack of evidence that they have sufficient means of subsistence and their inability to submit valid proof of the purpose of their journey.
There is also the consideration of geographical coherence, because visas are currently required of nationals of other Andean countries, which makes Ecuadorean passports more 'interesting' and encourages their falsification and counterfeiting.
Since the Commission proposal was drawn up in response to the priority established at the Seville European Council, to combat illegal immigration, we have voted in favour of it.
. (PT) I am voting in favour of this report, primarily because it is a further demonstration that East Timor is recognised as a fully-fledged State.
I understand the need to re-examine the list of third countries subject to visa requirements, due to the necessary and urgent fight against crime and illegal immigration, I welcome the possibility of reassessing the impact of making visas mandatory, particularly with regard to journeys undertaken for business, leisure and research purposes.
Going now into the most widely debated point, it is clear, given the Member States' answers to the questionnaire published by the Commission, that transferring Ecuador to the permanent list of countries on Annex I of Regulation (EC) NoÂº539/2001 is justified by the concerns expressed about illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, regional coherence and public order.
The Ecuadorian Government's concern at the legislative change we are discussing is understandable, but we cannot minimise the dissuasive effect that experience has proved necessary to step up.
In fact, the human tragedy of being uprooted, of being in an illegal situation and of lacking the means to survive has, with the implementation of this amendment, better possibilities of being avoided upstream, thereby ending the particular attraction that an Ecuadorean passport holds for forgers and counterfeiters.
I would like, if I may, Mr President, to address the Belarusian Head of State.
Mr Lukashenko, I see from page 13 of the Marset Campos report that you have stopped paying pensioners their pensions: you are paying them extremely late.
I would like to propose to you a method which is used here in some European States when they can no longer pay pensions.
In Italy, for example, a law is passed stating that a certain category of citizens will no longer receive pensions.
So why are you paying pensions late, Mr Lukashenko?
Pass a law - you have the authority to do it - suppressing a large proportion of pensions in Belarus. That way, you will be able to do legally what is currently perceived to be just poor administration on your part.
Belarus has cut itself off from the international community because of the autocratic policy followed by its regime.
This policy involves persecuting the opposition, restricting the freedom of the press, restricting trade union freedoms, imprisoning, mistreating and doing away with political opponents and applying the death penalty.
Belarus needs to start democratising if it is going to be in a position to ratify the partnership and cooperation agreement between the ?U and Belarus in the not too distant future.
It goes without saying that the European Parliament's call for democratisation must not conceal any attempt by the EU to challenge the right of Belarus to decide its own foreign policy.
. (FR) The Belarusian regime is clearly a dictatorship riddled with corruption, which oppresses its people.
Implying that swifter progress on the road to a market economy would be a source of hope for the Belarusian people, however, is to ignore the many dozens of poor countries throughout the world, such as Haiti and almost all of Africa, which are thoroughly integrated into the market economy and some of which, nonetheless, live in even greater poverty, under the yoke of equally despicable dictatorships.
Not to mention countries such as Argentina which, although it is wealthier than Belarus, has similarly seen its working classes plunged into poverty by the unpredictability of the market economy.
Furthermore, the report compares an undemocratic Belarus with a Russia that is portrayed as democratic.
The most vehement eulogisers of the change in the Russian regime are nonetheless forced to recognise the extensive corruption among the clans that run the country, the reign of official or criminal mafias and the appalling monetary gain of some through pillaging as the population in general grows poorer, not to mention the horrors of the war in Chechnya.
In view of this, there is no question of our supporting this text.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report on Belarus because it represents monumental intervention by the ?U in the internal affairs of an independent country.
The problem for the EU is not one of democracy; it is the fact that Belarus insists on respect for international law, territorial integrity and national sovereignty and is against selling out to the multinationals.
The report - and this is pure blackmail - makes future relations with Belarus dependent on its immediate transition to a market economy and even calls for cooperation with the USA in a bid to make its intervention - which nowadays can mean anything and everything, including military intervention - more effective.
There is a problem in Belarus with respect for human rights and democratic freedoms.
However, this is a matter for its own people and does not warrant foreign intervention.
The supposed democratic freedoms which international imperialist organisations and this report are endeavouring to blackmail Belarus into accepting are freedom of action for big business and the freedom to wipe out any achievements left over from the socialist regime.
All this is illustrated by the fact that the amendment proposed by the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, calling on the ?U to cooperate directly with Belarus in combating trafficking in human beings, was rejected in favour of an amendment requiring Belarus to toe the EU line.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.44 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the recommendation by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra (A5-0017/2003) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the conclusion of an Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part [13767/2002 - COM(2002) 536 - C5-0589/2002 - 2002/0239(AVC)].
Mr President, first of all, I feel in many respects that I should be taking second place to the honourable Member, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, in discussing this subject, because he has played such an important role in achieving what we are discussing today.
He is in a sense - if this is not regarded as blasphemous - the John the Baptist for this agreement.
We have both had the pleasure in the past of addressing conferences on this subject, speaking on this subject in Santiago and elsewhere.
It is extremely important to recognise the role that he and other Members have played in this important and happy occasion.
We are considering today a very important proposal on the adoption of the Association Agreement that we signed with Chile in November last year.
This agreement is not only crucial for European Union-Chile relations, it is also extremely important in the context of Latin America as a whole.
Indeed, the agreement is a very tangible expression of the European Union's willingness to establish a strategic partnership with that continent, despite its present economic problems and its political turbulence and the violence which some countries in the region are still suffering, not least from terrorism - a subject about which the honourable Member has understandably expressed considerable concern.
We both come from countries that have suffered from mindless and vicious terrorism in the past and our sympathies go out to those countries, like Colombia, that are suffering from terrorist madness today.
It is more important than ever for us to send a positive signal of support to the region - from the European Union to Latin America.
Parliament has played an active and supportive role throughout the negotiation of this agreement.
In November 2001, Parliament adopted a resolution inviting the Commission to conclude the negotiations of the EU-Chile Agreement at the second EU and Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Madrid in May 2002.
I am pleased to note that the Commission met this objective and managed to negotiate a very ambitious agreement.
We worked very closely with the Spanish presidency in the first semester of last year to achieve this, and it was a very important step forward.
This association agreement is firstly a political agreement - indeed it is important for the European Union to establish privileged links with those countries like Chile that share common values and objectives.
Chile, as we know, is a constructive player on the international stage and endorses the same values and policies that we defend in the European Union.
For example, it is not surprising that last year Chile ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
There are many other examples.
We certainly want to deepen the political dialogue with Chile and to define converging positions on issues of common interest.
I am pleased that Chile is keen on closer political relations with the European Union.
This is shown in the almost unanimous support that the Chilean Congress gave to the agreement in January, less than two months after the agreement was signed in Brussels.
The European Union-Chile Agreement is also a comprehensive free trade agreement which, according to the very important sustainable impact assessment study carried out by the Commission, should generate additional growth for Chile's GDP of about 0.5% and which should contribute to raising the standard of living of the Chilean people.
The European Union has been for a long time Chile's first trade partner; this agreement should further consolidate and increase our trade relations.
Let me point out as an example that after only two years of implementation, the EU-Mexico Agreement - which in many respects set the pattern for the EU-Chile Agreement - has already led to an increase of 28% in bilateral trade.
The agreement should allow us to overcome obstacles and to build an operating framework for entrepreneurs which allows more predictability, confidence and bigger trade flows.
Not only did Chile and the European Union agree to liberalise gradually over 97% of our bilateral trade in goods, but we also agreed on a whole set of rules to facilitate trade, on the establishment of a free trade area in services, on the liberalisation of investment and on the reciprocal opening of government procurement markets.
The bulk of the trade chapter entered into force on 1 February; I trust that entrepreneurs and consumers on both sides will soon reap the benefits of the agreement.
However, the EU-Chile partnership will extend well beyond politics and trade: it will intensify our cooperation in a number of areas and stimulate social, economic and environmental development.
The cooperation strategy devised jointly for the period 2000-2006 with the Chilean authorities may need to be adapted so as to take into account rather better the recommendations of the sustainable impact assessment study and to accompany the implementation of the agreement.
Let me say a final word about the institutional framework of this association agreement.
The agreement singles out the need for an increased involvement of civil society - this should materialise through regular meetings of representatives of Chilean and European civil societies so as to allow an exchange of views on the implementation of the different parts of the agreement.
I would also like to highlight the establishment in the agreement of an Association Parliamentary Committee, which will be a discussion forum for Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Chilean Congress.
I hope that honourable Members of this Parliament will participate actively in this committee.
Judging by the enthusiasm with which they have pressed us to make this agreement, that should be no problem.
Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for the leadership it has shown in this issue.
I am sure the beneficiaries will be not only the people of the European Union and Chile but also the overall relationship with such an important and dynamic continent.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in the production of this report, which has been unanimously approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and I would like to stress this cooperation since it does not happen very often.
Secondly, I would congratulate the Commission on its impeccable negotiation of this association agreement with Chile - as Commissioner Patten has pointed out - taking up the suggestions of the European Parliament in relation to the timetable and overcoming the difficulties caused by the negotiation guidelines.
Commissioner Patten asked us to trust in his judgment in order to overcome the problems relating to the timetable and he has been proved right.
The result, Mr President, is that we have the most innovative, ambitious and global agreement the European Union has ever concluded with a third country which is not a candidate for accession.
An agreement which has been described by the Commission - correctly I believe - as an agreement for the twenty-first century, a fourth generation plus agreement.
I believe we must be pleased that this agreement has been concluded with a country such as Chile, since in a way this agreement is a recognition of the great civil maturity of the citizens of that country and their decisive desire for openness and trade.
As Commissioner Patten said to us a moment ago, this agreement also represents a message of hope to a region which is currently experiencing a difficult situation: instability in Venezuela, crisis in Argentina, the hopes and challenges arising from the election of President Lula da Silva in Brazil, poverty on the subcontinent and the phenomenon of violence in Colombia.
I would particularly express my gratitude for the words of Mr Patten, who, on behalf of the European Parliament, is also going to communicate a message of solidarity to the Colombian authorities in relation to the attack which killed many people in BogotÃ¡ last weekend.
This agreement - as the Commissioner quite rightly pointed out - takes a similar approach to the Association Agreement with Mexico which has lead to an increase in commercial transactions since its entry into force and which is an agreement which goes much further than these requirements, since it provides for the liberalisation of 100% of transactions, many going much further than the forecasts established in the negotiations of the World Trade Organisation.
I would like to highlight an aspect which I believe to be particularly important, and that is that Chile has concluded this association agreement with the European Union before concluding its agreement with the United States.
I would also stress that the Commission has stated that this agreement goes beyond mere commercial thinking, since association agreements try to establish a strategic partnership based on the principles and rights contained in the democratic clause for both parties.
This agreement is very rich in terms of commercial liberalisation.
It involves almost 100% of products, not just agricultural products, but products of every type, it establishes stipulations relating to agreements and technical clauses, it lays down the greatest degree of liberalisation ever to have been created in an agreement on the services sector and also establishes, Mr President, the most generous treatment Chile has ever given to a third country, and, for the first time in negotiations with the European Union, it lays down accessibility for foreign investors in an agreement of this nature.
I believe that this agreement completes the network of agreements being negotiated at the moment.
The only one remaining is that with Mercosur, and we are awaiting negotiation guidelines for agreements on political dialogue and cooperation with the Andean and Central American Community, which we hope - as Parliament has requested on many occasions - can become association agreements.
In this way, Mr President, I believe we will be able to respond to the difficult situations being experienced by certain Latin American countries and create an extensive range of relations between our two regions which should culminate - and this is what Parliament wants - in the coming summit of Heads of State in Mexico, and we hope that these agreements can lead the way to a strategic and bi-regional partnership which will result in this global partnership we want to see.
Therefore this agreement, Mr President, represents a geographical consolidation of the existing links between both regions, which are destined to be political, commercial and strategic partners, and increases the tools at our disposal for responding to the challenges and uncertainties we are faced with in this globalised world.
I would like to thank all the political groups for their positive and constructive cooperation in the issuing of this favourable opinion on the association agreement.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to express the satisfaction of the Group of the European Peoples' Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - and mine in particular - at the conclusion of this association agreement between the Community and its Member States and Chile, the most ambitious, innovative and global agreement the European Union has ever negotiated with a country which is not a candidate for accession, to use the words of the European Commission, in line with what, as has been said already, should be the bi-regional strategic partnership between Latin America and the European Union that this Parliament proposed.
Furthermore, I would like to, and must, congratulate Mr Salafranca on the work he has done in order to realise this work and the Commission on the efforts and guidance it has contributed to the conclusion of this Agreement, which began as soon as Chile had recovered its rights and freedoms, which would not have been possible without the political vision and tenacity of the Chilean leaders, from President Elwin to the current President, President Lagos, and which reflects the will of Chile and of the European Union and its Member States to establish privileged relations in the political, commercial and cooperation fields which the agreement encompasses and to strengthen links, as a result of the shared values which unite them.
Within the framework of the liberalisation of the markets, the benefits in terms of economic growth and sustainable development which may result from reciprocal economic and trade relations is unquestionable, as are the benefits of a political dialogue aimed at promoting democracy and the formulation of common responses to the great challenges of this millennium.
That is why I am convinced that this agreement - which my group will support resoundingly - is a very positive step not only for relations between the European Union and Chile, but also for the economic and social well-being of the Chilean people in their democratic journey, which has so far been recovered in such an exemplary fashion, and which must serve, and in reality does serve, as an example to Latin America during these difficult times for some of its countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Salafranca.
There were reasons for this Agreement's problem-free progress through the committee and the unanimous support it received in it, for we worked together very well, not only on this Agreement but generally, and Chile's concerns have found a worthy rapporteur in the person of Mr Salafranca.

As has already been mentioned, this is an Agreement with a large number of objectives, a complete Agreement intended to cover a great deal and to bring us closer together.
The Commissioner has stated that, even while the Agreement was being worked out, bilateral trade increased by 28%, and, whilst I believe that there is room for further increases and greater cooperation, I would like to point out that the actual reason Chile deserves this special new Agreement is that it currently represents an atoll of stability in Latin America, which is so turbulent economically, politically and in other ways.
It is in our interests to maintain this stability and help to make it even more secure.
My principal interest is in the political dimension, and there are two points I would like to address at this point.
The first, the ratification of the treaty on the International Criminal Court, initially appeared to be something of a problem but has been resolved by cooperation with the Chilean embassy in Brussels and by the government's assurances.
We attach great importance to Chile's ratification of this treaty.
We are aware of the constitutional difficulties that exist at present, but, having satisfied ourselves that the government is working on it, we have hope of it being ratified soon.
The second point is that Chile is currently a member of the Security Council.
In these very difficult times, it will be very important that Chile should, in consultation and coordination with the relevant Member States of the European Union, help to achieve a peaceful solution to the present conflict.
Mr President, Commissioner, we must be glad about the establishment of this agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile and I also believe it is fair to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Salafranca, on his efforts and the results achieved.
It is a very broad agreement which will undoubtedly increase commercial transactions between the European Union and Chile and this is positive at a time when many countries in Latin America are in a particularly difficult situation.
It should be stressed that the total of tariffs on imports from Chile, relating to industrial products, will be restricted in 2006 and that in the agricultural field this will take place in 2012.
The agreement also offers great possibilities in the fields of services and financial services, as well as on all aspects relating to investments.
It is also positive that it includes a protocol on fishing enterprises.
I have read the report of the International Human Rights Federation on the indigenous populations in Chile.
These represent 4.4 % of the total population, or 13%, depending on the source of statistics.
Of these populations, the Mapuche people, in percentage terms, are the most significant.
The problems of the indigenous population relate to forest exploitation and the construction of large hydro-electric projects.
We must remember that these problems were exacerbated enormously during the dictatorship of Pinochet.
We are glad that the report contains explicit references to the protection of human rights and specifically mentions the rights of indigenous minorities.
We hope that this Agreement will create greater transparency and mutual understanding, and that it will also recognise the rights of the indigenous peoples.
Finally, while on the subject of Chile, as a citizen of Catalonia, I must acknowledge Chile's reception in former times of Catalan exiles fleeing the Franco dictatorship.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU/Chile Association Agreement enacts particularly ambitious, strengthened cooperation.
Such intense dialogue should, of course, be encouraged with the greatest possible number of third countries in order to support economic development and emphasise the ecological values and democratic clauses of the European Union.
Furthermore, we feel this far-reaching agreement has taken place too quickly, in particular given the impact assessment unveiled at the same time.
It is a shame that the impact assessment did not really act as a basis for this association agreement.
The European Union negotiations, which are very strong with regard to trade and, in our opinion, excessive with regard to liberalisation, should now also be based, in a balanced manner, around human rights and the environment.
Following Chile's dark history, all our vigilance should be focused on political rights, in particular the fate of the Mapuche Indians.
With regard to fisheries, the Union's interests for Chile should be balanced and only have meaning and a future within the perspective of development and sustainable management of fisheries resources.
Let us spare the Chilean fishermen the overexploitation of their resources that has destroyed our own European marine resources.
In particular, let us spare Chile from being relegated to the role of ersatz fishmonger for our Community ports.
Lastly, we think the scope of this agreement should have given rise to a prior discussion of the same magnitude.
This agreement, which aspires to be a model for the twenty-first century, is being dealt with too cursorily.
Although the agreement is interesting because it integrates the human rights dimension and consultation of civil society, it nevertheless deserved a more extensive debate on its possible impact, both positive and negative.
We submitted an oral question in this regard to allow a debate worthy of the agreement, but the proposal was dismissed.
Far from constituting barriers to the implementation of the agreement under consideration, these observations - and we would emphasise this - are an attempt to increase its relevance and durability.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like this twenty-first century agreement to become a beacon for a new kind of trade based on fair trade, respect for the environment and human rights.
Mr President, according to the Commission, the new Association Agreement between Chile and the European Union is the most ambitious, most innovative, most far-reaching agreement ever negotiated with a non-candidate country.
Classed as a fourth-generation agreement, it should even, we are told, constitute a model for future association agreements with the other Latin American countries.
These grandiose perspectives are, however, more cause for concern than for celebration.
In the economic domain, the agreement provides for the total removal of customs borders, but, contrary to what free-trade extremists claim, borders are not a barrier to trade.
Quite the opposite.
They play a role similar to locks in a waterways system, allowing regularisation between countries with differing standards of living.
Many of our industries have already paid the cost of customs disarmament.
The World Trade Organisation agreements, accepted by Brussels, thus forced them to delocalise production in order to counter competition.
Enlargement to the East, which has been decided in haste, will aggravate this phenomenon.
The fourth-generation agreement extended to all of Latin America will make millions more men and women unemployed.
As for our last remaining farmers, there is little chance that those who survive enlargement to the East will survive the process of opening up to the West, because the agreement stipulates almost total liberalisation of agricultural imports over the next ten years.
In the political domain, it is common to wax lyrical about the creation of a transatlantic Euro-Latin-American assembly.
Having built a bureaucratic super-State in Brussels, having swallowed up an Eastern Europe that has only just escaped the Soviet empire, the Euro-federalists are still not satisfied.
When and where will they stop?
In a kind of political gluttony, they want to integrate into their economic plans not only Turkey and Asia minor but the whole of Latin America as well.
Of course, there is still natural solidarity between our nations and those of Latin America.
Just as we want a Europe of free nations, however, rather than an antinational, antisocial Europe, we want the nations of Europe to base their cooperation with the nations of Latin America on the principle of national sovereignty and economic realism.
Mr President, I just wanted to tell Mr Lang that opening itself up to world markets has paid off for Chile.
Living standards have gone up, Chile's growth rate is far higher than that of other Latin American countries, and I just hope that this policy catches on in them as well.
What I would like to say to Commissioner Patten is that we are already engaged in active cooperation with members of Chile's parliament.
We had a meeting with them here in Strasbourg as long ago as the autumn - even before the Agreement was ratified - and had, surprisingly enough, an extraordinarily lively debate with the Chilean Congress and House of Deputies.
The problem we now have is not with the treaty.
The treaty is excellent, and I also wish to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his superlative report.
There is a treaty, but it must not be allowed to remain an empty form of words.
It has to be filled out - with something real.
Let me, by the way, remind you of the fact that we also have a scientific agreement with Chile.
If that is not to remain a mere formality, it too has to be filled out, and that is what I want to urge us to do.
Money is needed if that is to be done, but money is not the most important thing.
If that is to be done, the main thing we will need is will, the will of the European institutions, but also the will of enterprises and organisations.
What I hope at the end of the day is that this Agreement, whose objective is also very strongly political, will contribute to Latin America growing together, will contribute to stronger relationships between Europe and Latin America, and, above all, that cooperation with Chile will help to overcome the conflicts in certain Latin American countries, some of which conflicts - in Colombia, for example - are raging openly.
Mr President, most of the previous speakers have sung the praises of this agreement, first and foremost the rapporteur.
I would like to be able to add my voice to this almost unanimous choir, but I must admit to being perplexed.
The real question, the only one that deserves to be asked, is this: thanks to this agreement, will the people of this State be less poor, better educated and better cared for in the future?
Will they be able to surf the Internet or travel if they wish to?
I am not sure.
There is one people, in any case, that shares my doubts, and that is the Mapuche people.
First of all, the Chilean Government has not yet ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on indigenous peoples.
Many arbitrary acts of violence committed by the police against the indigenous communities go unpunished.
Next, this agreement states that one of the principles on which it is based is sustainable development, while the Mapuche territory is experiencing blind exploitation of its natural resources: deforestation and construction of dams that flood the ancestral soil, as a result of national hydrological plans.
Lastly, I am not convinced that the wholesale liberalism of the agreement allows for harmonious development of the economies of this State.
Economic and monetary dependency might lead to the 'Argentinisation' of the country.
Those are the risks and those are my doubts.
I shall abstain from voting on this agreement.
Mr President, one thing that has not been mentioned during this debate is the fisheries protocol which has been attached to this agreement.
The effect of this fisheries protocol is that EU-subsidised companies will now be allowed to invest in Chile with up to 100% ownership rights.
It will allow them direct access to Chilean fish stocks.
There are several aspects of concern for Chile's coastal communities: unfair competition with the local artisanal sector and the unknown impact on marine resources, for example.
We have only to look at the Argentinean case.
EU companies will be able to buy up Chilean fish quotas on fully exploited fish stocks; they will also have free access rights to Chile's under-exploited fisheries resources.
The opportunities provided by this protocol for EU fisheries companies, combined with the process of privatisation in Chilean fisheries, threaten the sustainability of the artisanal fisheries sector.
The protocol will be used to transfer part of the EU's overcapacity to Chilean waters.
I am fed up with this irresponsible and exploitative approach to the problems of overcapacity of EU vessels.
Is it any coincidence that this protocol was attached during the Spanish presidency and forced through?
It seems to have been used as a bargaining chip, and it has taken no account of a sector that employs more than 60 000 fisherman and provides for some 400 000 jobs in the industry in that area.
The artisanal fisheries contribute over 90% of fish consumed locally and provide 25% of export earnings for the fisheries market.
So it is unacceptable that this aspect has not been properly assessed and taken into account.
Mr President, this debate has been slightly livelier than some of us might have anticipated.
I would associate myself entirely with Mr Linkohr's remarks in response to Mr Lang, who may be living on the right planet, but it is certainly a different planet to the one I live on.
Speaking for the bureaucratic superstate, I should like to respond firstly to Mr Sakellariou on the important point which he raised about the International Criminal Court.
He will know that Chile participated actively in the preparatory work on the Statute of the International Criminal Court.
On 22 January last year the Chilean Chamber of Deputies approved the text with a large majority, but the Senate asked for the opinion of the Constitutional Court in Chile.
That court indicated that it was necessary to modify the Chilean constitution before approving the Treaty.
Since modifying the constitution is a lengthy procedure, as it requires a two-thirds majority in Congress, the Treaty cannot yet be ratified.
However, ratification of the Treaty remains high on the political agenda of the Chilean Government, since it is entirely consistent with its external policy of promotion of respect for human rights.
If there is one country which should understand the arguments for the International Criminal Court, as the honourable Member and I would agree, it is Chile.
He also said that he hoped that as a member of the Security Council the Chilean Government would try to coordinate its response to the crisis in Iraq with European Member States.
I hope he does not regard it as lÃšse-majestÃ© on my part to say that I hope the Member States of the European Union will try to coordinate their policy in the Security Council in dealing with this terrible crisis in Iraq.
There is Article 19 of the Treaty and there is the Maastricht Treaty, but perhaps I should not be drawn down these boulevards.
It is interesting that in the Convention we are discussing how much further we can go in coordinating a common foreign and security policy when we are not even using and implementing the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.
In any case, I am using what he said about Chile merely as a trigger to fire off some of my thoughts on this subject.
Several honourable Members raised the question of indigenous peoples, which is always a particularly important issue on these occasions.
Difficult as these issues are, the Chilean Government is trying to handle them in a sensitive and democratic way.
They have set up a public agency to try to handle some of these challenges.
They have taken at least 16 concrete measures to help deal with some of the problems, of which Members have been informed.
My view is that we can help with the efforts that the Chilean Government is already taking through, for example, co-operation projects that are paid for by the funds voted by this Parliament.
On the question of fisheries - and I realise what a controversial issue this can be - I should like to remind Members who have spoken that the association agreement does not include a fisheries agreement, although we would be interested in concluding one.
There is the protocol, which has been referred to.
Community fishing companies will be allowed to own up to 100% of Chilean fishing companies.
However, that is under exactly the same conditions as Chilean investors.
That implies that they will have to respect, for example, the catch quotas defined in Chilean laws.
There is an elaborate regulatory framework in Chile to address the issue of stock depletion since a serious decline in catch levels of certain species, mostly due to over-fishing, was registered toward the end of the 1990s.
It is not right to say that the implementation of the agreement will lead to over-exploitation of fishing resources.
The current dynamism of the artisanal fishing sector in Chile is something all of us should recognise, and it needs to be underlined in debating these matters.
This sector is the main supplier of seafood products to the domestic fresh fish market.
It currently provides 25% of export income from fisheries products.
A significant increase in the artisanal fishing sector has been recorded over the past years, and the interests of the sector have been preserved in the recently adopted fisheries law.
If there is to be a loss of artisanal fishing employment in the long term - and this may well happen since artisanal fishing is a highly labour intensive, but not capital intensive business - it would probably occur with or without the agreement we are discussing today.
Without any reservation whatsoever, I commend this agreement to the Chamber.
I am sure that the Vice-President of the Commission would also warmly endorse all that we are trying to achieve with this important agreement.
Once again, I wish to thank Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra and his colleagues, Mr Linkohr and others, who have taken such an active interest in this matter.
This is a model of this sort of agreement.
It is the sort of agreement that will not impoverish the world, that will not bring people the 'joys' of North Korean economics - which some people endorse - but that should make the world a more prosperous place, that should ensure that we better protect our environment and that we have greater political stability than would otherwise be the case.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0019/2003) by Mr Caveri, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the establishment of an ecopoint system applicable to heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria for the year 2004 [COM(2001) 807 - C5-0699/2001 - 2001/0310(COD)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal was presented on 20 December 2001 in order to respond to the request of the European Council in Laeken.
However, the Commission does not believe that the system of ecopoints is a valid long-term system for resolving the problems of traffic associated with sensitive regions.
The text we will present contains certain significant elements, such as the removal of the 108% clause, which imposes an annual limit on the number of transit journeys by Community lorries through Austria.
On the other hand, the proposal maintains the system in force throughout Austrian territory and also the number of ecopoints available for 2003.
In fact, in 2003 the objective of the system will be achieved, which is to reduce pollution by 60% over the last twelve years.
This proposal therefore responds to the desire of the Heads of State and Government and implies an extension for a limited period - one year renewable for two further consecutive years, that is up to a maximum of three years - but under no circumstances can it be the definitive proposal, but simply a transitional solution until we can implement other solutions.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this is a matter for the whole of the European Union, although the majority of speakers on the list are Italian or Austrian.
In any case, before I go any further, I would like to say that, as a mountain-dweller, I fully understand the Austrians' concerns.
Furthermore, the situation of Austria and the Alpine question as a whole have come about as a direct result of a transport policy which needs to be completely overhauled, as is clearly indicated in the White Paper which, by pure coincidence, we are going to discuss this very afternoon.
There are two requirements: on the one hand, free movement of goods and the single market, and, on the other, environmental protection, road safety and public health - basically, what is meant by the catchphrase 'sustainable development'.
What should our strategy for transport be?
Fewer lorries, more trains, a shift away from the transport monoculture, more intermodal transport, fewer roads and road tunnels and more rail tunnels, an overall rebalancing of the situation with due regard for freedom of the market but also taking into account the need for guiding parameters, including clear information on the real costs of transport, and consistent pricing, the freeing-up of resources for rail investments, the development of a European structure for the rail networks through the railways packages, safety guarantees provided by the relevant directive on tunnels and by common rules to make road transport safer; lastly, a growing effort to introduce less-pollutant transport systems, and also, I would say, to finish with, the use of systems such as the satellite system, Galileo, to track fleets of lorries.
The Austrian question relates to the Alps but the situation is similar in other mountain ranges such as the Pyrenees too.
We are faced with a boom in freight transport, which will expand even further with enlargement.
In the past, Austria used this ecopoints system - which was soon to be abandoned - and, after Laeken, the European Council remained strangely undecided until the very end of last year, when a solution was found that was described in committee as a virtual solution, meaning that, in actual fact, the figures were theoretical.
That is why a broad majority of the European Parliament, in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, decided on a plan of action, starting from the assumption that we need to work towards a legal basis consisting, first and foremost, of the Alpine Convention transport protocol, which appears to be the only instrument which would compel the European Union to regulate the flow of lorry traffic in the Alpine region as well.
There is a need for a new policy based on the Swiss model.
The committee of which I am Chairman has made every endeavour to find a balanced solution. We have consulted the Ministers.
We have even had the date for the construction of the Brenner Base Tunnel brought forward definitively from 2021 to 2012. Above all, through the amendments we are tabling before the House, we have endeavoured to find a solution which gets away from the ecopoints system, in any case to find a solution for the period stretching from now until 2006 based on the need, as I said, to take into consideration the provisions of the Alpine Convention and, I would say, more generally, the sensitive areas of the Alps.
It is not by chance that Amendment No 15 refers to other areas such as FrÃ©jus in the Alps to the north-west of Italy, to the Mont Blanc region and to the Austrian Alps, in other words to the whole of the Alps, for I believe that this is the overall picture which we must consider.
Particularly in Article 13, we have taken great care to achieve the phasing out of heavy goods vehicles, introducing a quota system for 2004, 2005 and 2006, which in 2005 - 2006 will lead to a ban on EURO 0 and EURO 1 lorries, a quota system for EURO 2 lorries and free transit for EURO 3 lorries.
Lastly, as regards the amendments, I feel that the Swoboda and Simpson amendments cannot be accepted in that they considerably alter the proposal endorsed by the majority of the committee and that the Rack amendment cannot be accepted because it too completely changes the parameters.
I can accept Amendment No 19 tabled by the Greens, which calls for further debate.
Lastly, I feel we must reject Amendments Nos 20 and 21 because they too change the proposal completely.
I will end, Mr President, by saying that, as Committee Chairman and rapporteur, it was my duty to find a balance.
As a mountain-dweller, I might have preferred to go further, but I felt it was right for Parliament to be able to see the current state of the debate.
Mr President, the rapporteur's coordinating work has enabled us to achieve a great deal of agreement in Parliament.
A new regulation is being proposed to replace the old eco points system.
Because the objectives of the old system, which expires at the end of 2003, were achieved in 2002, we came to the conclusion that it would not be a good thing to continue the old system.
The present regulation provides a good balance between protection of the vulnerable Alpine region on the one hand and the wishes of the Austrian population and the absolutely fundamental principle of the free movement of goods on the other.
It is not easy for anyone to arrive at a balanced solution for transit traffic through the Austrian Alps.
The concerns about environmental pollution and public health are understandable.
Geographically speaking, Austria is, after all, a transit country, which is why we suggested excluding from the area the lorries that produce the most pollution.
At the same time we call upon the Council and the Commission to promote clean and quiet EURO-4 category lorries as soon as they are on the market by providing a purchase subsidy for transport companies, thus helping them to bear the considerable financial burden these lorries will represent.
I think that this is one of the major advantages that Parliament's proposal has over that of the Council and the Commission.
If we promote cleaner lorries, transport companies will be encouraged to buy environmentally friendly vehicles.
Cleaner lorries, the so-called EURO-3 and EURO-4, are therefore not subject to the quota system but have free passage.
The proposals of both the Commission and the Council do not promote the use of clean lorries in any way whatsoever.
In fact they even go so far as to penalise the use of the clean EURO-4 by reducing the number of points that will be available.
It must also be crystal clear to all parties concerned that it will really be over after 2006.
