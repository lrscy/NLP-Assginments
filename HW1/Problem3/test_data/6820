For these reasons I have voted for the TrÃŒpel report, including the Commission's recommendations, as it constitutes a European reference instrument for key competences and suggests ways of ensuring access for all European citizens to these competences, by way of lifelong learning.
This document makes an important contribution to the attainment of the Lisbon Strategy goals for growth and employment and, in particular, the implementation of the Education and Training 2010 work programme.
Â Â  . Coming, as I do, from a country in which there are still high levels of illiteracy and long-term unemployment, and in which 50% of pupils do not finish secondary education, I supported this report, which puts lifelong learning high on the agenda in the reform of labour markets.
The pressure of globalisation and new technologies has clearly highlighted a number of gaps in a range of key skills, which make it more difficult for workers to adapt to increasingly flexible labour markets.
With the adoption of a European reference framework, this becomes both an upstream action â insofar as it supports educating and training young people to give them the key knowledge they need to start their working lives â and a downstream action, developing and updating the key skills of workers by means of lifelong learning.
The action is thus aimed both at acquiring the skills and at developing and subsequently updating those skills.
This initiative forms part of the Lisbon Strategy objectives of investing in growth and employment, and is to be funded by the new generation of Community programmes (2007-2013), such as the European Social Fund, of which lifelong learning is one of the priorities.
I welcome this report as it promotes a modern social policy, taking account of the new realities of the society in which we live and work.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I support the strategy elaborated by the rapporteur, but I would make two criticisms: first of all, the European strategy on air pollution has no mandatory targets, and it should do; and secondly, the Community should allow the Member States and regions to decide for themselves how to achieve those targets.
This freedom of choice is restricted by a huge number of Community provisions: think, for example, of the Infrastructure Costs Directive, which does not allow tolls to be charged for heavy road vehicles in areas where there is serious environmental and air pollution.
Â Â  In her report, the rapporteur discusses the Commissionâs thematic strategy on air pollution.
The June List believes that cross-border environmental problems represent an issue that should be dealt with at Community level.
Air pollution is an example of just such a problem.
ParagraphÂ 25 calls on the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council to strike an interinstitutional agreement in which they express their dedication to the air quality targets.
The June List clearly also wishes to see better legislation, but we believe that this will be difficult to achieve if the legislature and the executive power have agreed in advance which regulations are going to apply in the future.
We have therefore voted against the report in todayâs vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, two-thirds of the population of my country, Hungary, live in cities.
They are the ones who are most exposed to environmental damage caused by industry and transport.
This in itself is sufficient reason for us to make special efforts to improve the urban environment.
The situation in Budapest is particularly bad, and therefore I considered it important to support this report, although it contains several objectionable elements.
MrÂ Hegyi expects EU standards in quite a few areas which fall exclusively within the sphere of competence of the Member States or of local authorities.
I understand his reasons since, like me, he lives in Budapest, where nothing has been done in recent years to improve the quality of the environment.
EU requirements can indeed serve as important incentives, and their observance needs to be monitored strictly.
We cannot, however, expect the Union to solve the environmental problems of European cities with standards outlining detailed, specific programmes.
This is the task of territorial local authorities, and Strasbourg or Brussels cannot compensate for their failures.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Hegyi report (A6-0233/2006) on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, because it is vital to boost the overall environmental performance of cities in Europe by reducing bureaucracy, by enhancing the efficiency of environmental policy implementation, and by encouraging long-term environmental planning.
Some 80% of Europeâs citizens live in urban areas, but their needs and interests are often under-represented in the Unionâs funds, projects, initiatives and strategies.
Consequently, with a view to raising the quality of life of Europeâs city-dwellers, Community law needs to go further, by adopting sustainable urban management and transport plans.
Â Â  . The report that has just been adopted in Parliament has some positive points that we support; for example, the more widespread use of more environmentally-friendly transport, encouragement to use public transport, reduction in the density of construction, more green spaces in urban areas, the renovation of run-down buildings and, more importantly, of historic centres, and better environmental performance of buildings in terms of insulation and the use of renewable energy sources.
It is also important, as the report says, to promote the exchange of best practice at Community level as regards sustainable urban management strategy and planning, and the increased involvement of the citizens in public debates at the planning stage.
Nevertheless, all of this presupposes that increased Community funding has been granted, which unfortunately is not the case.
Far from it, in fact; the EU has been introducing more obligations and requirements without creating the appropriate financial resources, which may exacerbate the inequalities between the wealthiest countries and regions and other areas that lag behind.
Â Â  . Accessibility is a key factor in sustainable development, and, as such, transport is at the core of any debate on urban policy.
Given that there are a number of ideas aimed at solving environmental issues and the congestion that our cities suffer are beset with, I feel that we should be channelling our efforts into addressing the impact on public health and the quality of life, in terms of socio-economic dynamism.
The idea of sustainable urban transport plans is undoubtedly important, yet we must not overlook the need to use this instrument flexibly and in a way that is appropriate to the specific characteristics of each city.
The use of environmentally-friendly means of transport and technologies is a key factor in achieving a cleaner environment.
It will only become widespread, however, if local and national authorities exchange experiences and good practice.
It therefore strikes me as clear that in order to foster an integrated approach to urban policy, it is crucial to promote private-public partnerships and to effectively manage existing Community instruments to support urban policy.
Only with measures that are appropriate to the actual situation in each Member State will we be able to deliver a sustainable future for our cities and the harmonious growth of our societies.
Â Â  I am voting in favour of this report despite the fact that it contains negative points such as, for example, green areas per capita and how music from domestic sources is to be reduced in the urban environment, these clearly being local issues that should be decided at local level.
The positives within the report, such as congestion charging, reduced car use and local sustainability plans outweigh the negatives, however, and conservative governments may very well need a push from the EU when it comes to such matters.
That being said, the content of the report ought to remain advisory in nature and not give rise to comprehensive legislation.
Â Â  . As the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the report on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, I called on the members of my group to abstain from the final vote today.
The report tries to destroy the subsidiarity principle.
Nevertheless, I considered it unjustified to completely reject the report, because the majority of it describes existing regulations, calls for the sharing of experience between cities and simply calls on the European Commission to issue guidelines.
Particularly in the new Member States, it is absolutely vital to improve the urban environment by means of such measures.
Â Â  . I abstained from the vote on the report on the thematic strategy on the urban environment.

Particularly in the new Member States, it is absolutely vital to improve the urban environment by means of such measures.
Â Â  I voted against this report, not because I wish to denigrate MrÂ Hegy's work, but because subsidiarity is being treated with contempt and the EU and its institutions are interfering in national matters.
I do not think that this is justified.
This tendency for Europe to continually interfere in the daily lives of its citizens, even when it is not necessary, is one of the primary reasons why people are becoming so disenchanted with Europe.
Â Â  . Given the importance to people seeking to move to other countries of mutual recognition of qualifications between the different EU Member States, a European Qualifications Framework could prove beneficial.
I share the reportâs view that the setting of prescriptive criteria for learning pathways or for the duration and location of education and training courses must be rejected.
We also welcome the idea that the organisation and validation of lifelong learning are a matter for the Member States and cannot easily be brought within the purview of the EQF.
Yet we must focus on the form in which the EQF is developed, the foundations on which it is based and the objectives that we are seeking to attain.
In this regard, the report contains some contradictions, for example, the attempts to bring the EQF into line with the so-called Bologna process and the so-called Lisbon Strategy, which as we know, is aimed primarily at pandering to the interests of the economic and financial groups.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  . I support this report because I firmly believe that the creation of a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) will make a contribution towards the employability and geographical mobility of the workforce in the EU.
I welcome a European approach such as this because it meets the fresh challenges posed by a knowledge-based society head-on and seeks to address the new requirements of the European labour market.
The underlying philosophy of the EQF is, after all, to promote the competitiveness of the European economy and social cohesion, in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
I warmly welcome initiatives that will bring to the top of the agenda the citizensâ ability to gain employment, by encouraging professional mobility by means of the recognition, comparability and transferability of professional qualifications in the Community area.
I regret, however, that this initiative does not sufficiently reflect what is actually happening in the labour market and overlooks the importance of vocational training, focusing, instead, mainly on academic training.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Communication on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission has just adopted its final report on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Our conclusion is that both countries are in a position to take on the rights and obligations of European Union membership on 1 January 2007.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will mark an historic achievement: the completion of the fifth enlargement of the European Union, which further pursues the reunification of our European family.
On this occasion, I would like to congratulate the peoples and authorities of Bulgaria and Romania for all the efforts they have produced in order to fulfil the conditions for accession to the European Union.
I would also like to thank you, honourable Members, for the constructive role played by Parliament.
The European Parliament has always been a staunch champion of the political, economic and cultural benefits of enlargement.
Your support has helped to spread peace, stability and prosperity in Europe.
The most recent enlargement, like others before it, has proved to be a great success.
It has confirmed that the enlargement of the Union, if carefully managed, produces a win-win situation for both the existing and the acceding Member States.
Enlargement stimulates economic growth and social cohesion and reinforces the role and influence of the European Union in the world.
The readiness of Bulgaria and Romania is a direct result of the sustained progress both countries have achieved over the last few years and particularly since our last report in May.
The Commission takes its responsibility as guardian of the treaties very seriously.
First and foremost, we must protect the functioning of the European Union.
This endorsement of the 2007 accession date for Bulgaria and Romania is based on a rigorous, fair and objective assessment, as Commissioner Rehn will explain in detail in a few moments.
Bulgaria and Romania have found the right answer to our strict conditionality by addressing the areas we highlighted in May.
In doing so, they have achieved considerable progress.
However, todayâs report also outlines some areas where both countries need to achieve further progress by sustaining the current reform drive until accession and beyond.
The Commission has drawn up a number of measures to accompany the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
In particular, the Commission will set up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime.
The mechanism contains specific benchmarks that have to be met.
The Commission will report regularly to Parliament and to the Council on the progress achieved.
On that basis, the Commission may, if necessary, invoke the safeguard measures set out in the Accession Treaty.
The Commission has further accompanying measures at its disposal, which will ensure the proper functioning of the Union up to and beyond the accession of both countries.
European Union rules provide us with a comprehensive set of measures that allow us to combat potential risks in acceding and in current Member States and to address concerns such as food safety or the management of European taxpayersâ money.
The rigorous application of these accompanying measures underlines the emphasis we have placed on conditionality throughout the accession preparations for those countries.
We are therefore convinced that, once again, enlargement will proceed smoothly in a way that will strengthen, not compromise, the functioning of the European Union.
It is important to ensure that, as we enlarge, we are still able to function efficiently.
I should like to use this opportunity to state my position concerning future enlargements.
After the completion of this fifth enlargement, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, I believe that an institutional settlement should precede any future enlargement.
This is the way to ensure that our enlarged Union will function in an efficient and harmonious way.
In any case, the Nice Treaty already requires us to adapt our institutional set-up following the accession of the 27th member.
Last Juneâs European Council conclusions have set the course for that institutional settlement and I hope that by the end of 2008 we will succeed.
In following that timetable, we will respect our commitments towards countries for which we have opened up the possibility of accession and fulfil our strategic goal of consolidating peace, democracy and prosperity on our continent.
We are looking forward to Bulgaria and Romaniaâs historic achievement of European Union membership in 2007.
I expect both to contribute energetically to the process of European integration.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to join President Barroso in congratulating Bulgaria and Romania on their historic achievement.
Over the past months, both countries have demonstrated their readiness to join the European Union.
The key to this success was a combination of substantial Bulgarian and Romanian efforts with the strong encouragement and support of the Union.
Let me also join President Barroso in thanking the European Parliament for its continuous support for the gradual and carefully managed accession process to the Union.
The Commissionâs assessment is based on an even more rigorous system of conditionality than the one applied in the past.
Over the past two years in particular, Bulgaria and Romania have responded strongly to our system of conditionality. This has resulted in a remarkable transformation, with reforms in several sectors peaking over the past three to four months.
Thus, the strategy we devised together last May has worked well, to the benefit of Europe, Bulgaria and Romania.
Todayâs report focuses on those areas which required further progress in May.
The majority of Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs overall preparations had already been completed by that time.
In terms of the political criteria, Bulgaria has continued the reform of the judiciary.
The legal framework has improved, for instance, through the adoption of rules that establish objective procedures for the appointment and evaluation of magistrates, which is very important for the independence of the court systems.
The ongoing preparations of constitutional reform in that regard are also very welcome.
Efforts to combat corruption have resulted in more officials having to declare their personal assets and in the establishment of internal fraud inspectorates.
The Prosecutor General has continued to be proactive in terms of requests for lifting the immunity of members of parliament.
In the fight against organised crime, more specialists have been recruited and some successful actions have been registered against criminal networks.
However, at the moment the number of successful prosecutions is still low and the implementation record still needs to be improved.
Romania has made further progress in reforming its justice system and the results are tangible and positive.
The interpretation and application of the law is being further harmonised and staffing levels in the judicial system are increasing.
There has been definite and tangible progress in the fight against corruption.
Criminal liability has been broadened to legal persons and rules on financing for political parties have been tightened. This has led to further non-partisan investigations and indictments of high-level corruption.
The report outlines a limited number of areas where we need to see further progress in the months leading up to accession and beyond.
Therefore, this report also spells out accompanying measures which the Commission will initiate upon accession, unless the remaining concerns have been remedied.
The Commission will set up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime.
For this purpose, as President Barroso said, benchmarks have been established which refer to the particular circumstances of each country.
The mechanism allows the Commission to help the countries to continue the reforms with vigour and rigour, and to verify that the expected progress is taking place on the ground.
The Commission will also ask both Bulgaria and Romania to report bi-annually on progress in addressing these specific benchmarks until they have been met.
The first report should be submitted by the end of March 2007.
We will then report to the European Parliament and to the Council by June 2007.
The Commission will also apply the safeguard measures of the Accession Treaty if either country fails to address the benchmarks adequately.
The report also underlines that EU rules contain the necessary guarantees for the proper management of EU agricultural and structural funds.
The new regulation on structural funds provides the mechanisms to ensure that these funds, which are of course EU-taxpayersâ money, are spent properly.
Payments can be interrupted, suspended or cancelled, if the Commission suspects or detects cases of irregularities or fraud, including corrupt practices.
Moreoverfurther to this range of safeguard measures for the EU funds, financial corrections can take place if individual or systemic irregularities are found in the regular financial controls.
There is still a risk that preparations for the management of agricultural funds may not have been completed by the time of accession.
As a precaution, we have adopted specific provisions to ensure the proper management of these funds by Bulgaria and Romania.
This gives both countries time to complete preparations in 2007.
At the same time, failure to do so will enable the Commission to reduce the payments in 2007.
Of course, we hope that we will not have to resort to this mechanism, which should be seen as an incentive for both Bulgaria and Romania.
As to the third safeguard measure, food safety, some measures are currently in place because of animal diseases.
These will be maintained after accession.
Restrictions may also need to be applied upon accession on the use of certain animal by-products.
Non-compliant food establishments in the milk, meat and fish sectors will be denied access to the internal market, but will be allowed to produce for the national market bearing a specific label.
After three years, they will have to comply with EU rules or close down.
I have outlined the sufficient guarantees offered by the and the Accession Treaty.
I am therefore confident that Bulgaria and Romania will enrich the Union without compromising the proper functioning of EU policies and institutions.
The interests of the EU and our citizens can be assured and EU taxpayersâ money protected.
Overall, Bulgaria and Romania should be commended for their far-reaching efforts and achievements to adapt their legislation and administration to the laws and rules of the European Union.
On the basis of the progress made, our report shows that both countries will be ready to join the Union in 2007.
The suggested accompanying measures will ensure the continuity and irreversibility of the reforms in the two countries.
I trust that we can count on your support for facilitating a swift and successful ratification of the Accession Treaty in the remaining Member States.
Bulgaria and Romania have undertaken remarkable efforts to join us in the European Union and they deserve our congratulations and a very warm welcome.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Bulgaria and Romania are an essential part of the fifth enlargement of the European Union.
It is well known that it has been our aim to welcome both countries as Member States on 1Â January 2007.
In this respect, the communication from the Commission can be greeted with satisfaction.
During the entire enlargement process, the views of the European Parliament on how well prepared Bulgaria and Romania are to join the Union have been taken into consideration.
On behalf of the Presidency, I wish to thank the European Parliament for its considerable input with regard to both countriesâ accession to the Union.
The European Union has closely followed the progress that both countries have made in finally adopting reforms and meeting their membership obligations under the Treaty of Accession.
While the European Council that met in June commended Bulgaria and Romania on the reform measures they had recently implemented, it appealed to both countries to make even more of an effort to solve, decisively and without delay, the problems still remaining, which were mentioned in the Commissionâs last progress report produced in May.
The Finnish Presidency has encouraged both countries to deal with unsolved issues. These include in particular the reform of the judiciary, organised crime, corruption and administrative initiatives in several key areas.
The meetings of the Association Council have been an opportunity to evaluate the progress made with respect to the and have clearly demonstrated that the reforms that are needed must be finally adopted and implemented immediately.
The meetings of the parliamentary joint committees have also had a key role in this work.
The Presidency notes the recommendations in the Commissionâs reports.
We would like to commend both Bulgaria and Romania on their endeavours to fulfil the demands of accession.
Bulgaria and Romania should now address all outstanding problems without delay.
I know that these countries are already trying to resolve these problems.
The Council notes the Commissionâs plans regarding protective measures and stepped-up monitoring that may be introduced on the basis of Articles 37 and 38 of the Accession Treaty, should there be insufficient progress in these areas.
The Council now proposes to undertake a thorough examination of the Commissionâs communication and recommendations and a comprehensive assessment of the main issues.
In undertaking these tasks, the Council will of course also take account of the views expressed by the European Parliament.
The Accession Treatyâs ratification process itself is now well underway, and we trust that it will be completed on time.
MrÂ President, although the Unionâs future enlargement has more to do with the next topic on the agenda, I would like to say here that the European Council confirmed in June 2006 that it would adhere to existing commitments.
The Finnish Presidency will act on the basis of these decisions.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, Commissioner Rehn, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the Commission's proposal that Bulgaria and Romania should join the European Union on 1Â January 2007.
Bulgaria and Romania are two major nations with a European culture, and on accession they will become members of our European family.
Our group â like the others â already has national Members from Bulgaria and Romania: the Bulgarians are represented by MrsÂ Cappone, and the Romanians by MrÂ Marinescu, and over the past few months we have developed a good level of cooperation.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I should like to express our appreciation to both Bulgaria and Romania â to the governments, but in particular to the people in both countries â for the huge efforts they have made since the fall of Communism.
When a country was ruled by Communism for forty or fifty years, when there was no rule of law, no administration governed by it and no independent judiciary â when we look at all these facts, we can see just how much work both populations, just like those of the other former Communist countries, had to do.
When we in so-called 'old' Europe take a critical view of these countries, I sometimes wish that we would remember, and express our recognition of, the huge achievements of their people.
All in all, we consider the proposal that you have submitted, MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Rehn â and I would particularly like to thank MrÂ Rehn for his very honest efforts over recent years â to be a balanced one.
On the one hand, membership is planned for 1Â January 2007, but on the other hand we must not lose sight of the fact that there is still much work to be done.
It would be irresponsible, not only with respect to the people of the current European Union but also with respect to Bulgaria and Romania, to gloss over all the work that still needs to be done.
Both MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Rehn stated that there were still major deficits in the use of European money, that there was a risk of corruption and that there were still major problems in the fight against organised crime and with internal security.
Indeed, Commissioner Rehn specifically said that the implementation of criminal prosecutions needs to be improved.
In other words, the laws are in place, but they still need to be enforced.
Serious breaches of the law must also be pursued through the courts, and those responsible must be held to account.
We will be reminded of this by the fact, amongst other things, that both countries will have to present a progress report in six months' time.
CommissionerÂ Rehn was, in my view, very wise to say that the 'safeguard clauses' â which could also be described as transitional provisions â will hopefully not need to be invoked.
Whether or not they are invoked depends on the progress made in the reforms.
If these reforms, which must be continued with full commitment after 1Â January 2007, are not made, then the safeguard clauses will come into effect.
We must bear this in mind at all times.
To the people of Bulgaria and Romania I have to say, in the midst of all the joy at accession, that the European Union you are joining on 1Â January 2007 is not some kind of heaven on earth.
We have seen in other countries how, once they have become Members of the European Union, their enthusiasm has waned considerably.
Of course, you do not have to be enthusiastic about Europe, but you should always stand by it, and we must all be aware that we in the European Union can only have a shared future in the 21st century as a Union based on shared values that is capable of taking action.
I hope that this awareness will never be lost in the two countries that are now joining, Bulgaria and Romania, or in the other countries of the European Union.
MrÂ Barroso quite rightly spoke of the institutional consolidation of the European Union that must precede each enlargement.
On behalf of the European People's Party element of our group, I would like to say 'yes' to institutional consolidation, but we have great ambitions in this field.
We want the principles and substance of the constitutional treaty, including its values, to become a legal and therefore political reality.
That is the main agenda for the months and years ahead of us, so let us work together to that end.
In this spirit, we would like to extend a warm welcome to Bulgaria and Romania.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when people in my electoral district ask me why I support the accession of Bulgaria and Romania despite the fact that there are so many problems, that we have not yet been able to cope with the previous enlargement, that the Constitution has not been adopted, that there are so many unresolved issues in the countries themselves, I do not try to respond by referring to the various problems.
That is the job of CommissionerÂ Rehn, and he has done it today.
There are still several issues that need to be resolved in Bulgaria and Romania.
Several problems need to be described that require the governments to work towards a solution, and to convince the people that reforms are needed.
All of this is being done and all of it is necessary.
The shortcomings must be remedied.
This is not the time or the place to discuss the various problems, however.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007 will continue the integration in Europe that is unparalleled in the world.
Our grandfathers and grandmothers were proud of Western European integration.
Why can we not be proud of the pan-European integration we are furthering with todayâs debate?
Bulgaria and Romania are part of Europe, and I agree with MrÂ Poettering when he says that we should welcome them.
On behalf of my group, I say âyes, they are welcomeâ.
What is at stake is nothing less than putting an end to the division of our continent that ran counter to its historical development, and became bitter reality after the Second World War.
I was born in Western Europe.
I was born in a country that was divided, and that was overjoyed when it managed to restore its unity: and rightly so, as Germany had deserved it.
What Germany deserved, the whole continent has deserved.
The men and women who fought against the communist dictatorships in Bulgaria and Romania, the people there who, over the last sixteen years, have had to go through a process of transformation harder than the burdens faced by people in Western Europe in recent years: for all of this, these two countries have deserved to be rewarded with a welcome into the EU.
After all, what problems would become easier if they remained outside?
Which of our concerns would be easier to solve if they did not join?
The answer is that nothing would be better if we left them outside.
The reverse is true: the uncertainty in these countries and the whole Black Sea region would increase if we did not let them join.
For this reason, it is also common sense to welcome them into our ranks.
Everything that has been achieved in European history, that has had to be fought for, has been achieved in the face of scepticism.
I am fairly sure that there was no standing ovation in store for the Heads of State or Government of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France when, in 1950â52, they told their people of the need to include Germany in the European Coal and Steel Community, as it was then.
There were very many people who said: Germany has just destroyed our country twice, and now we are supposed to welcome it into our Community?
Now we are supposed to give it money?
Yet the Heads of State or Government firmly believed that Germanyâs integration into the European Community would bring peace and economic growth, and that integration would help to overcome the hatred and enmity â and it has.
What we are doing now is no different.
The people of all our countries are asking whether we are taking on too much, whether we are spending too much money on this, whether this is costing too much, whether all of this is too uncertain.
We can only reply that our goal is to increase economic strength and social cohesion, and to export the integration of culture and peoples as a peace-building project.
It is to extend what was realised internally in the old Europe to those countries that have been unable to benefit from it before now.
All this cannot be achieved by signing a treaty, but must be fought and worked for â and we have to start somewhere.
This also means having the courage to speak out in the face of all the scepticism and opposition and say that European integration is the right course to take in Eastern as well as Western Europe, because this integration brings peace, economic growth and greater scope for economic development in the internal market.
Every country we welcome into the EU enriches our internal market.
It creates social cohesion, and it helps Europe attain the proportions it needs as an economic area to withstand intercontinental competition in the long run.
On the whole, there are plenty of small things we could find fault with: such and such a thing has not been put right, more reform is needed here, administrative reform is needed there, judicial, police and agricultural reforms elsewhere.
All of this is true and it all needs to be done, but this does not change the fact that Bulgaria and Romania should be welcomed among us, as we need them.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is a Romanian proverb: .
It means where there are two or more, we are stronger.
Well, there are two: Bulgaria and Romania recognise that they will be stronger in the European Union and the European Union will be stronger with Romania and Bulgaria.
Size matters.
With the supranational challenges we face in todayâs world, the more countries that share our values and practise good government and democracy within our Union, the more able we will be to promote those values beyond it.
So I salute the people of Romania and Bulgaria.
I salute their governments, in which Liberals and Democrats are proud to play an important role.
I salute, in particular, Meglena Kuneva and Anca Boagiu, who have conducted the detailed negotiations on behalf of their countries like a pair of swans, apparently gliding serenely across the surface of the water but with their feet paddling away ten to the dozen underneath.
I express my thanks to the European Commission, and in particular to Commissioner Rehn, for a difficult task imaginatively tackled and accomplished appropriately under a Finnish Presidency.
We all recognise that there is unfinished business.
The European Union is a moving target with the constantly evolving.
Bulgaria and Romania are developing themselves.
We know that democracies are sometimes run by crisis management: often problems are often not solved until they have to be solved.
We acknowledge that there is only a certain elasticity in the management of public affairs.
Moreover, we recognise that there is a need, as in previous enlargements, for transition periods and safeguard clauses.
I urge the governments and people of both countries to continue their reforms, but to those who doubt their readiness I ask, would they be better off and would we be better off with them outside?
Should we say ânoâ or ânot yetâ?
As the American commentator Mencken once said, that âFor every complex problem there is an answer which is clear, simple and wrong.â
Leaving them outside the Union would be the wrong answer.
I am pleased, however, that the Commission draws attention in its report to the need for greater efforts in the fight against crime and the need for more serious efforts in improving the situation of the Roma people in both the countries joining us.
The rule of law and social inclusion are fundaments of our Union.
More action needs to be taken by the governments of both countries and the Commission needs to monitor that action on our behalf.
What matters to the health of a society is less what it possesses than the direction in which its face is set.
It seems to me that the direction of both countries is the right one.
To quote from the hymn to St Cyril and St Methodius: âMarch ahead, oh revived people, to your future march ahead, forge your destiny of glory ...â.
Forge it with us.
There is work to be done in Romania and Bulgaria to make the European Union a reality.
We build the European Union together.
It will never be built purely from the top down.
It must be built from the ground up.
That was perhaps summed up by the Romanian writer Adrian Marino, when he wrote: â âWe must bring Europe into our homesâ.
But there is work to be done in the European Union, too, to convince our citizens that the cost they are paying for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is not a net negative.
To explain to them, as the Å pidla report showed us, that those countries which welcome new countries as partners gain economic benefits.
To point out to them that unless we let low-cost labour come to where the investment is, then the investment will go to where the low-cost labour is.
It is a win-win calculation in bringing new countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into the Union.
We will all be winners.
There are some who ask whether this will be the last enlargement.
I believe that our Member States will be obliged to sort out Europeâs constitutional challenges before new countries are taken in.
I hope that is what the Commission President meant when he said that this might be the last enlargement.
We owe our citizens and the citizens of these two future Member States the duty of sorting our Europeâs constitution before we take in further countries.
In conclusion, let us welcome Romania and Bulgaria today, not in a spirit of triumph but in a spirit of satisfaction with work well accomplished.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, seldom have I seen a more hypocritical debate in this Parliament than the one we are holding today.
Firstly, this Parliament has nothing more to say in any case.
We decided to say yes a year ago.
Well, you can say to me: âthey have delivered us 150 pagesâ.
For my part, I can assure you that with the 100 pages we have here you would have said no a year ago, but you have to say yes today because you said yes in any case.
This Parliamentâs hands are therefore tied and it is happy for them to be.
Well done, the ball is in your court!
Secondly, MrÂ Barroso has just said something extraordinary: âan institutional settlement should precede any future enlargement!â
We said that when there were ten of us.
We said it when there were fifteen!
We said it at 17, we said it at 25, we are saying it at 27 and I am sure that when there are 30, 35, 40 or even 45 Member States we will be saying it will be the last time, and we will all be dead and it will be the last time, next year in Jerusalem.
I have had enough!
I have had enough of hearing such lies because, with MrÂ Schultzâs arguments, with MrÂ Watsonâs poetic arguments, how will you be able to say no to the Balkans?
You have talked of peace, but it is obvious that the Balkans have a future in the European Union, it is obvious that Romania and Bulgaria have a future in the European Union.
They must become European.
The problem is: how?
On what terms, how quickly and in what way?
Poetry will not organise everyday politics, not poetry, and today I ask you one thing: to be serious.
I say to you in all seriousness, if this report had been for Turkey, you would all have said no!
Whereas the arguments about peace, the future, the market, my grandmother, my grandfather would have been the same, but noÂ ... because you have a very simple ideological bias, and one that is right: the European Union must enlarge.
There is a funnel effect.
The Commission and the Council decide, the Council decides, the Commission follows, Parliament does its yes man act, you get the funnel and everything slides, slides, slides and in it goes.
No one can do anything any more because when you have a funnel effect you can no longer stop itÂ ... and you have no way of raising political problems.
Just read: so far as the media are concerned, the conditions of fairness are not guaranteed, but it does not matter, it will come.
In one case the judiciary is not independent, but it does not matter, it will come; the machinery for protecting minorities is not yet in place, but it does not matter, it will come.
When and how will it come?
How can you know it will come?
The fact is, have got problems.
Moreover, for the problems of immigration the Council is incapable of getting the justice and law policy through, of getting it through in the first pillar.
Unanimity is not required.
It will be much easier with 27!
You will see, it will be much easier to get everything through with unanimity.
The German Government promises us it will all be sorted out with the Constitution.
But how?
How will you get this Constitution approved in the 27 Member States?
No one knows, absolutely no one; but you will see what you will see.
For my part, I think we are hypocrites.
Yes, Romania and Bulgaria have a European perspective.
Yes, the Balkans, but as for us, we are incapable of making Europe a real Europe, and the worst thing, and I will finish with this, is that with enlargement as we are doing it we are heading towards a renationalisation of how States think, of politics and of practices.
You saw that in the last Council; well, I say to you we are impotent, but as Parliament we are proud to be!
Â Â  . Mr President, in 2004, Romania and Bulgaria were considered less ready than the ten states that joined at the time.
There was no doubt that, given time, they would be treated as equal to them.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has always backed them in their endeavour, being guided by the principle that those countries should not in the first place be assessed in terms of privatisations, cutbacks, good relations with internationally active large enterprises or of their NATO membership.
Instead, our focus is on human rights, good democratic governance and good environmental policy.
In 2005, I voted to support, in principle, the future accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
The question then remained as to when and how this enlargement could be achieved effectively.
This House has insisted on Romania having the right to defer, whilst for Bulgaria, the application of that possibility was left entirely in the hands of the Council.
That happened at a time when the disquiet surrounding shortcomings in Romania was at its peak and it was expected that Bulgaria would yield the least problems.
Since then, in fact, it has been Bulgaria that has been the cause of increasing disquiet.
In both countries, the plight of the Roma people is worse than in most of the other states that have recently joined us.
In a number of cases, the places they have called home for a long time have been declared illegal and they have been driven away.
The people belonging to the Hungarian minority in Romania or the Turkish minority in Bulgaria also have problems to contend with, even though those to a lesser degree than in the recent past.
The government is no longer intentionally putting those people at a disadvantage, but there is an attitude of apathy in respect of the discrimination by ultra-nationalists against those groups.
Nor, indeed, has anti-Semitism yet ceased to be a problem.
During previous debates on this topic, my group tabled proposals for improvements, among others, further to the illegal payments that are demanded from EU residents of Turkish origin passing through Romania.
It is unfortunate that a majority could not be found in this House to back these demands, although a majority did express concern about the use of a dangerous toxin in mining preparations in Rosia Montana.
In a communication issued by Romania on 23Â September, it was reported that an environmental impact report had been launched and that its neighbour Hungary is being consulted in respect of the risks concerning toxic waste water moving in its direction.
Since there is no outcome as yet, we will be unable, unfortunately, to incorporate it in this Houseâs final verdict on Romaniaâs membership on 11Â October.
My group fears that, after accession, many problems will still need solving, and that in the event of any mishaps, a further enlargement of the European Union will be seen as ever more controversial by public opinion in the current Member States.
Despite this, it looks like a majority of my group will, following preparatory discussions, be voting in favour of accession on 1Â January 2007, an important argument in favour being that other Member States have joined before despite their unresolved problems, and that a yearâs delay will not yield any significant improvements.
Finally, I should share with you that the Dutch Socialist Party, to which I belong, has been led by these many problems to join, in the Dutch Parliament, with the Christian Democrats in speaking out against 2007 as an accession date.
We think that a host of problems have yet to be resolved, but the real vote will be on 11Â October.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to welcome President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn and President-in-Office LehtomÃ€ki and join with my colleagues in welcoming the very sensible decision on Romanian and Bulgarian accession on 1 January 2007.
Despite all the difficulties, what has actually been achieved in both those countries in the last 12 to 13 years is phenomenal: the change of culture, the change of attitude, the willingness to engage, the openness and transparency.
The enormous sea change in legislation alone to comply with the is something that no existing Member State could achieve in such a short time.
We can speak about the theoretical importance of this enlargement and the abstract and political arguments. But the most important argument of all is for the 7.5 million people in Bulgaria and the 22 million people in Romania to be given the same opportunities that all of us in the European Union have today, which we got when we were weaker or smaller countries or poorer economies with less developed judiciaries or economic and educational spheres.
Of course, there is more work to be done.
Ongoing reforms are needed; constant vigilance is necessary against the ability of mankind to interfere with, interrupt or corrode public life.
That is why the safeguard clauses are there.
But let us celebrate what has been achieved so far.
I have only one small query and that concerns the ongoing difficulties in both countries with abandoned and orphaned children and children and young people with disabilities.
They still do not get the levels of support, independence and protection they need.
Many years ago, a greater Irishman than I am said, âNobody or no group has the right to put a stop on the march of a nationâ.
We do not have the right to stop the reunification of Europe to correct the mistakes of history.
Like all good families, we should encourage those within our family who are trying to achieve more to pursue common ideals, goals and standards.
We should welcome Romania and Bulgaria, congratulate their officials, their governments and their people for what they have achieved so far, remember the horrors that they have come through and look forward to the bright future that lies ahead for them and for us.
Â Â  â Mr President, those of us from the post-Communist countries that are now Members of the Union suddenly find ourselves facing the kind of temptation that has all too often proved irresistible to the original, old, advanced â call them what you will â western countries.
We are inside the ramparts, able to look down patronisingly on the newcomers trying to get inside the EU castle of which they have been dreaming.
We peer at them and lecture them.
Luckily, we in the Czech Republic have very recent direct experience of this degrading, patronising behaviour and of having to face a constant stream of pointless new conditions and quotas, as well as one-sided restrictions.
For this reason, we are able to express our solidarity with both of these countries.
We also know that many of the problems that beset Romania and Bulgaria are not of their own making, but the result of half a century over which, like us, they were deprived of natural development, of market economics and of free, representative democracy.
Like us, they were handed to the wrong half of Europe by the decision of the post-war powers, and the people of both countries went through hell under the Communist dictatorship.
We believe that this is why we in the Czech Republic have resisted the temptation to impose more humiliating restrictions on them concerning movement, employment and services.
This is clearly what the protectionist western EU Member States are seeking.
I believe that our relationship with them will be the same as we expected from the 15 western countries when we became fully-fledged Member States.
We are still second-class Member States, and I feel that, for this reason, we will not turn the two new countries into third-class Member States.
All the less so for the fact that while the EU is lecturing Romania and Bulgaria, two countries with European traditions, culture and values, it is at the same time playing a dangerous game over the accession of Turkey, turning a blind eye to Turkeyâs attitude to minorities, to democracy, to the plurality of faiths, to women's rights and to its own brutal history.
I believe that these two most European of countries, Romania and Bulgaria will soon become fully-fledged EU Member States alongside the rest of us.
Â Â  I am very glad that both the Bulgarian and Romanian governments, on the one hand, and the European Union on the other, have reached a consensus following constructive negotiations on the conditions for Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession to the EU.
As an MEP representing Slovakia, a country that joined the EU just two years ago, I am pleased that on 1Â January 2007 Rumania and Bulgaria will become members of the European Union, and I fully support their accession.
It is also my wish that no one in the Union will regard these new Member States as inferior, and that their sound economies and democratic institutions will continue to show robust growth.
Regarding the shortcomings that have often been mentioned in connection with these countries, I would like to focus on Romaniaâs new legislation banning international adoptions.
International adoption is both a global and ethical issue.
Trafficking in children under the mistaken notion that this is in the interests of the children is unacceptable in the European Union.
A state which trafficks in its own citizens, who represent its future potential, is playing into the hands of organised international crime.
Such a state must revise its priorities, and should do so not only on paper but in actual fact.
It should think hard about the means for achieving these goals.
The selling of children amounts to a counterproductive waste of a countryâs potential, undermining the very meaning of family support.
As a full member of the European Union with all of the rights that ensue from such membership, Romania should be in a position to take care of its citizens from the cradle to the grave, as the Romanian Prime Minister put it last week.
It is necessary to improve social work and to train qualified professional staff for adoption counselling in Romania, as well as simplifying adoption within the country.
Despite several well-known problems concerning the implementation of this law, I consider its enactment to be a very welcome step in the right direction.
This law can undoubtedly be regarded as complying fully with the standards for European legislation.
Our Romanian and Bulgarian friends are warmly welcome here!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, a long period of discussion is slowly coming to an end in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on these two countries, whose accession to the EU we have supported from the outset.
We should bear in mind that we had concerns about many accessions, yet all of them turned out to be political and economic successes. They turned into a win-win situation.
There are also several transitional rules for the benefit of both sides, to enable accession to take place without great controversy from the point of view of the EU.
Examples are rules concerning the free movement of workers, and the fact that border controls on persons have not yet been lifted, since these countries are not yet members of Schengen.
Whilst welcoming the new States, however, we must make it clear that each enlargement only works if the rules are observed.
The Commissionâs statement today that benchmarking and monitoring processes are in place to resolve the issues of legal systems, corruption, money laundering and organised crime, is very important.
We shall then have to wait and see whether, if the need arises, these are actually used.
The same goes for the legal conditions and controls for the Structural Funds and agricultural funds, and also for the opening of the foodstuffs markets.
The Commission bears a great deal of responsibility at this time, because only if this works and the Commission makes credible use of its mechanisms will the future of the EU be assured, and only then can we think about future enlargements, too.
It is extremely important that we welcome these countries, but also that both sides comply with the rules, so that we are not faced with serious problems at the end of the day as a result of failure to do so.
For this reason, I shall be monitoring very closely the way in which the Commission makes use of the possibilities it has mentioned today in practice.
The last thing I want to say is that the Constitutional Treaty was drawn up for the Union of 25, or rather of 27 following this enlargement to include countries that suffered so unspeakably under Communism.
It is not the size of the EU that will enable it to play a role in this world, however, but only its inner strength.
Size is not an indication of strength.
I should like to remind the House at this juncture, therefore, that the EU has not yet done its homework.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Rehn and the staff of DG Enlargement, in particular Timo Summa and Mrs Bridget Czarnota, deserve our thanks for the very professional and dedicated manner in which they have conducted their work in regard to Bulgaria over many months and years.
There is no doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have been subject to a degree of scrutiny probably unparalleled in EU history.
The reasons for this are not just related to the countries concerned but are also a reflection of the growing scepticism about enlargement in certain political quarters.
This is a pity.
Enlargement is, I hope, a vehicle for reform and change in the European Union.
I very much welcome the Commissionâs confirmation that Bulgarian accession should take place on 1 January 2007.
Postponement would have served no useful purpose.
At the same time, we are under no illusions that much remains to be done.
Continuing reform is needed in Bulgaria, not just because of EU accession but for the sake of Bulgaria and its people.
The key word now is âtransparencyâ in every sector, whether it is public procurement, the appointment of officials and magistrates or whether it concerns the reasons why a particular investigation is suddenly stopped dead in its tracks.
Citizens need to have confidence that those in authority are acting openly for them and in their best interests.
Of course, many measures are still being put in place by the Bulgarian authorities.
I particularly welcome the recent announcement that the services of the Dutch former Prosecutor General have been enlisted to assist Bulgariaâs own excellent Prosecutor General and I would encourage other countries to come forward with similar assistance.
On the subject of migration of workers, many of our countries, not least the United Kingdom, have seen the consequences of a decade and more of failed and catastrophic immigration policies, largely unrelated to the European Union.
It is a pity that Bulgaria and Romania may now suffer the consequences of this.
It has been a colossal task for Bulgaria to recover from the effects of 50 years of communism.
Now we see a stable democracy, a buoyant economy, 5% growth, record foreign direct investment, a factor of regional stability and a contributor to NATO.
Well done Bulgaria â and welcome!
Â Â  . Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of MrÂ Moscovici, our rapporteur for Romania, who is, unfortunately, unable to be here at this important moment in time.
Allow me to start by extending warm congratulations to both countries on the conclusions which the Commission presented today on Romania's and Bulgaria's accession date.
I should like to extend a warm welcome to both countries, but to Romania in particular.
After everything that has happened, that countryâs history, 50 years of dictatorship, 15 years of hard work, it is now being rewarded by the European Union in the shape of membership.
My group has been consistently in favour of both Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession.
It is the different governments, not just the current ones but also previous ones, that have generated the dynamism in Romania which has, in turn, led to the Commission reaching its conclusion.
It is an enormous achievement on the part of both countries, and an historic day in Bucharest and Sofia, in Bulgaria and Romania.
I am also pleased with the President of the Commissionâs remark that on the basis of permanent progress those two countries have made, it can now be decided against using this delay option, but simply to make a start on 1Â January of next year.
The Commission has indicated that there is plenty of scopefor it to cooperate with these two new Member States in ensuring that the outstanding issues will be carefully resolved in the next few years in a process of verification and cooperation between it and them, on the basis of clear and precisely formulated goals to which both the Commission and the two governments will commit themselves.
The treaty provides plenty of guarantees that the Commission will be able to ensure that the EUâs interests will be protected in that process.
A yearâs delay would probably have meant that both sides would no longer make the effort and it would lead to automatic membership of some sort.
Instead, the progress and dynamism present in both countries is now being drawn on in order to get what is left of the accession process out of the way in a thorough manner and to clear the desks as quickly as possible.
In short, congratulations, and thanks, to the Commission, thanks to Commissioner Rehn for all the work he has done over the last few years and congratulations once again to Romania and Bulgaria.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Camiel Eurlings, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Turkey's progress towards accession [2006/2118(INI)] (A6-0269/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, we are bringing to the final debate this report on Turkey at a special moment.
This report is preceding the European Commissionâs progress report, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to influence and enrich the stance of the European Commission.
This does not mean, however, that there would be so much need to influence the Commission on this point, because the report as I have presented it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and as I present it now here in this sitting, has been prepared in very good cooperation with the European Commission and with Commissioner Rehn himself.
I also think of Mr Rehnâs words when I presented the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, words of welcome which were very clear.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by a large majority: 54 votes to 6.
The report has been described as fair but tough: fair because it is based on facts and is constructive; tough because, unfortunately, there is reason for criticism of at least a strong push from Parliament.
The basic conclusion of the report is that we, as the European Parliament, regret that there is a slowdown in reforms.
We had expected at the start of the negotiations in 2004, when we made a decision, that the impressive reforms of 2002-2004 would continue.
Unfortunately they have slowed down.
That is not to say that nothing has happened.
I compliment the Turkish politicians on their ninth package of legislative reforms and the many proposals that were adopted by Parliament.
I also compliment the Turkish officials for their professional work in the negotiations so that the first chapter could be provisionally closed.
So why then is there criticism?
Because we would have liked to have seen more progress in the mainstream of further political reforms.
I will mention a few vital areas.
Firstly, on freedom of expression, we as a Parliament have already criticised some parts of the new penal code.
Although it was a big improvement, some articles raised doubts â Article 301, first and foremost.
Some people have been set free.
However, the reconfirmation of the sentence of Mr Hrant Dink proves, as Ali Birand, the famous journalist, also stated so clearly, that Article 301 has to be changed or repealed.
I ask the Turkish Government and the Turkish people to see the need for this.
It is important for the freedom of the Turkish people, it is important for the image of Turkey in Europe and the wider world.
Second, a lot needs to be done as regards freedom of religion.
I was in Turkey a few weeks ago.
Until recently, monasteries and churches have been taken away, and the new proposed law on foundation, as the Commissioner said, is not good enough.
So please let this stop.
Give back the properties to the religious minorities and change the proposal of the law on foundation so that if they cannot be given back, then at least there is a good compensation for the minority churches.
Also, the training of clergy must resume.
Since 1971 seminaries are closed, and for a country that wants to be European, it is very important that it should be as easy to build a Christian church in Turkey as it is to build a Turkish mosque in the rest of the European Union.
We said we want priority for these reforms because that is the European spirit.
We ask it as a Parliament, and Turkey signed, in the revised accession partnership, a commitment to achieve the short-term priorities before the end of 2007, and then we as a Parliament asked Turkey to do what was agreed.
A third situation that worries us is the situation in the south-east.
We strongly condemn the PKK and any terrorism.
We strongly condemn it â there is never any excuse for terrorism; but at the same time we ask Turkey to try to find peaceful interlocutors, try to find a political way and invest in the social and economic development of the south-east.
A last major point: Cyprus.
It was agreed at the start of negotiations that there would be no formal recognition ceremony by Turkey of Cyprus but that there would be an Ankara Protocol as a kind of normalisation of relations.
The protocol was signed, the Council asked for it to be implemented before the end of 2006, and it is now a matter of credibility â also for the credibility of our institutions â that Turkey fulfils its commitments and implements a protocol before the end of 2006.
As a Parliament, we also make it very clear that we want to see more efforts in the northern part of the island in terms of trade regulation.
But once again, Turkey cannot just sign up to this: it should do what it promised to do.
I shall finish with one last point â I shall try to make it short.
There was a vast majority in the committee for the basic line of the report and I thank the Members for it because with it we are giving an important signal.
There was unease, however, because of an amendment on the Armenian genocide.
Allow me in two sentences to make my position clear.
In paragraph 50 of the report, as rapporteur I tried to put forward a position that is both strong but also realistic.
It says that recognition as such is formally not a criterion, but for a country on its road to Europe it is indispensable to come to terms with its past and therefore we want committees, research, open discussion.
I think that is a line that is strong but fair and beyond criticism.
I know that, with an amendment from Mrs De Keyser, another text has been voted in as well.
It is of course the responsibility of every Member of Parliament to vote as he or she pleases, but if you ask for my opinion, the text in paragraph 50 is the best text and the one that takes us the furthest.
I have been speaking for too long.
I want to thank Members once again for their support up till now and I just want to say that I hope, as the rapporteur for Turkish accession, that this signal â a tough but fair signal â will be perceived by Turkish politicians and the Turkish public as an encouragement to restart the reform process, to vigorously support those people who want it, so that I as rapporteur can be more positive in my next report than I have been here today.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Finnish Presidency, I wish to thank the European Parliament, and particularly Camiel Eurlings, for what is a comprehensive report on Turkeyâs progress in the accession process.
Every debate is a good opportunity for us to get to know more about Turkeyâs accession process, to inspire both the citizens of the EU countries and Turkey to take an active part in this process, and to support the Turkish Government in its accession goals.
Finland, the country holding the Presidency of the Council, will naturally take into consideration the views expressed by the European Parliament.
In early November, the Commission will be bringing out its annual report on Turkeyâs progress in the negotiations on its accession. The European Council will examine this report very carefully.
In todayâs debate, I would like to focus attention on a few points in those negotiations.
The Presidency shares the European Parliamentâs concern regarding the reform process in Turkey.
Turkey must accelerate the implementation of political reforms and the reform process generally.
Full and effective implementation is vital to ensuring that the reforms are permanent and ongoing.
We need concrete results.
We share Parliamentâs concern regarding the slow progress that Turkey has made in the crucially important areas of fundamental freedoms and human rights.
Although the situation in Turkey has improved compared with five years ago, the country needs to continue making tangible reforms, especially in the areas of freedom of expression, freedom of religion, cultural rights, womenâs rights and action against torture and ill treatment.
Most of these issues have been described as priorities in the Revised Accession Partnership, and Turkey must implement the appropriate action without delay.
At present, the Presidency is awaiting the adoption of the Ninth Reform package regarding Turkish law, whose purpose it is to provide answers to some of the problems that I have just mentioned.
The new laws must be fully compatible with EU standards.
The Council expects immediate action from Turkey on the matter of freedom of expression in particular, in order to avoid in future the kind of legal action that has been brought against people who have expressed non-violent opinions.
As regards religious freedom, we expect legislation on the rights of the non-Muslim minorities to be fully implemented without delay, in accordance with European standards.
Like Parliament, we are concerned about the situation in South-East Turkey.
The Presidency has condemned the recent bomb attacks in various places in Turkey, and regards them as senseless terrorist acts.
Terrorist acts can never be justified.
This is a multi-agency issue which we are following carefully as part of the reform process.
Turkey quickly needs to evolve a comprehensive approach in order to reduce regional inequality.
The aim here should be for Turkey to provide better opportunities for all its citizens, including the Kurds, and to strengthen the countryâs economic, social and cultural potential.
In addition to the Copenhagen criteria, Turkeyâs progress in the accession process is being judged within the context of the requirements of the Negotiating Framework, which include the implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement.
Progress here is essential for continuing the talks.
Turkey must apply the Protocol fully to all the Member States of the European Union and remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, including transport restrictions.
The initiation of talks fundamentally connected with this issue will depend on how Turkey discharges its contractual obligations towards the Member States.
If it were to neglect these, this would have an overall impact on the progress of talks.
Progress is being monitored with regard to all the essential issues which were mentioned in the declaration of 21Â September 2005 by the European Community and the Member States.
A spirit of enterprise and determination will need to continue if the European Unionâs standards and membership requirements are to be met.
This determination is not just required of the applicant country, but also of the Union itself.
This is why I want to say very clearly that Turkeyâs accession process is very important to us and the Finnish Presidency will do all it can to ensure that progress can be made in negotiations.
The Union supports Turkey in its aspirations to membership, but progress in the accession negotiations obviously depends very largely on Turkeyâs own actions.
The accession process will continue while Turkey continues its process of reform and discharges its obligations accordingly.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I am sorry but, unusually in my case, I have to leave halfway through this debate, because I have a press conference with European Commission President Barroso at 4 p.m., 10 minutes from now, which I have to attend.
Straight after that we are both leaving for Sofia, in Bulgaria, and Bucharest, in Romania, to communicate todayâs decision and the content of Parliamentâs debate to these two future EU Member States.
I regret that I have to serve two masters, but the last debate overran slightly and I am afraid that I have no alternative.
Mr President, in the previous debate MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki made a statement on behalf of the Council on the future of enlargement.
Like President Barroso, I welcome the statement and reiterate the Commissionâs commitment and our policy of a consolidated enlargement agenda, which covers south-eastern Europe apart from Bulgaria and Romania.
It covers Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans.
We are cautious about any new commitments, but we stick to our existing commitments to the countries of south-eastern Europe.
They have the prospect of joining the European Union once they meet the conditions, as promised for the countries of the western Balkans at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003.
While we prepare internally for a new institutional settlement, the gradual and carefully-managed accession process continues with these countries of south-eastern Europe.
We cannot take a sabbatical from our responsibilities for peace, stability, liberty and democracy.
We expect the EU Member States to be able to agree on a new institutional settlement in 2008; hence the new institutional settlement should have been born by the time the next member is likely to join.
If Croatia, which is likely to be the next new member, pursues reforms with rigour and results, it should be ready to join the Union around the end of this decade.
Let me thank Mr Eurlings for his report, which includes useful elements for the assessment of Turkeyâs progress towards accession.
I also thank the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their contributions.
Turkeyâs accession is a matter of constant debate.
It is true that the momentum for reform has slowed down in Turkey in the past year.
However, we should not lose sight of the progress accomplished in the last decade, nor of our commitments towards Turkey.
The goal of the negotiations started on 3 October 2005 is full EU membership of Turkey, and by its very nature it is an open-ended process with no automatism.
This commitment stems from a solid understanding that integrating Turkey into the EU is of mutual benefit.
In its own interest, the European Union needs a democratic, stable and increasingly prosperous Turkey.
Turkeyâs strategic significance was once again illustrated by its decision to take part in the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon.
In the past twelve months, there has been a lack of progress in the reforms.
It is important that new initiatives are taken and that tangible progress is still achieved before the Commission presents its report on 8 November.
First, freedom of expression is the cornerstone of the reforms.
Journalists, authors, publishers and human rights activists still face judicial proceedings for violations of the notorious Article 301 of the Penal Code on the vague grounds of âinsulting Turkishnessâ.
In July, the final ruling of the Court of Cassation in the case of Hrant Dink established jurisprudence on that notorious Article 301, which violates European standards.
Thus, despite the acquittal of novelist ElifÂ Shafak last week, freedom of expression remains under threat in Turkey.
The judicial proceedings have a chilling effect and damage the important work carried out by journalists, intellectuals and activists.
I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about this, most recently last week to Foreign Minister GÃŒl.
Frankly, I am rather tired of repeating myself endlessly, but I shall continue to do so until the end of my term, unless this shortcoming is corrected.
I cannot even imagine a Member State in the European Union which does not respect such a fundamental principle as freedom of expression.
It is now high time for Turkey to amend the restrictive articles in the penal code and bring them truly into line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
This matters also as regards the internal debate on Turkey to which the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, referred.
An open and constructive exchange of views is needed in Turkey, including the most sensitive issues.
That is necessary both for the democratic process in Turkey and for facing tomorrowâs challenges, as well as for Turkeyâs reconciliation with its neighbours, including Armenia.
Reconciliation is a principle that is both the origin and the outcome of the European integration process.
I therefore urge Turkey to continue to take concrete steps in that direction.
Secondly, with regard to freedom of religion, I fully agree with the rapporteur and the Council on this important matter.
The Law on Foundations currently debated in the Turkish Grand National Assembly should address the shortcomings.
Restrictions applied to property rights, management of foundations and training of the clergy must be lifted.
There are also Muslim minorities that face discrimination.
The Alevi, a community of 15 to 20 million people, face legal restrictions on establishing places of worship and receive no financial support from the State religious authority.
In the south-east, the spiral of violence undermines positive developments witnessed since emergency rule was lifted some years ago.
Terrorism is our common enemy.
Turkey and the EU unequivocally condemn the PKK, and I deeply deplore the loss of innocent lives in the attacks that have taken place throughout the year in Turkey.
However, a policy based merely on security considerations is not sufficient to address the problems of the region.
The south-east faces an aggravated socio-economic situation, due not only to security threats but also to high unemployment and poverty.
We expect Turkey soon to adopt a comprehensive strategy targeting all the needs of this region: economic, social and cultural.
Let me turn to the obligations which Turkey needs to respect.
We expect Turkey to implement fully the Additional Protocol of the Ankara Agreement.
That means that Turkey should remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, including those on means of transport, which are in breach of the Association Agreement.
Hence Turkey should open its ports to vessels under flags of all Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus.
As set out in the Negotiating Framework, progress in the negotiations also depends on Turkey meeting its obligations.
Let me reiterate that Turkeyâs obligations under the Ankara Protocol are not linked to the ending of economic isolation of the Turkish-Cypriot community.
The draft report rightly calls on the Council to make renewed efforts to reach an agreement on the trade facilitation regulation concerning the northern part of Cyprus.
The Commission fully supports the serious efforts of the Finnish Presidency to overcome the stalemate on the trade regulation, thus helping the Council and the EU Member States to live up to their commitments.
It is also appropriate to underline the continuation of the constructive commitment by Turkey in finding a comprehensive settlement on the Cyprus question, acceptable to both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, based upon the principles on which the EU was founded.
To conclude, it is in our mutual interest for Turkey to pursue its democratic, societal and economic transformation with the goal of joining the EU.
If Turkey succeeds, with our consistent support, it can become an ever-sturdier bridge between civilisations, at a moment when the relationship between Europe and Islam is the greatest challenge of our time.
Turkey is an important benchmark in this regard and it matters for our own future and for the future of our children and grandchildren.
While the Commission is prepared to support Turkey through the process, it is ultimately up to Turkey to carry it forward.
The extraordinary parliamentary session convened last week to accelerate the adoption of the ninth reform package is a welcome step in the right direction.
Yet a more resolute reform process is needed for Turkey to progress on the path to EU accession.
In this process, we should remember that â as Prime Minister Erdogan suggested â the Copenhagen criteria should be called the Ankara criteria, since they are there, in the first place, for the sake of Turkish citizens and their rights, not merely to please the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Eurlings for his hard work; it has not always been plain sailing.
Unfortunately, the report as it now stands has, on account of the opponents of Turkish accession to the EU, become a cause for disappointment for many of us, including reform-minded Turks, those Europeans who want Turkey as an ally, and not least women in Turkey.
As rapporteur for womenâs rights, I have seen that Turkey is definitely making headway in the area of womenâs rights, partly as a result of pressure from the EU in general and the European Parliament, in particular.
The enlargement strategy is effective in encouraging reforms in candidate states, but it only works if those reforms are also recognised.
As MrÂ Eurlingsâ party in the Netherlands likes to put it, âwe need sweet after sourâ, in other words we need light after dark.
The Eurlings report fails to recognise Turkeyâs achievements to date.
It is negative, not only in terms of substance, but also in its tone.
That is a sure-fire way of sabotaging reforms in Turkey by undermining public support for them and by equipping Turkish eurosceptics with a powerful weapon for the forthcoming elections in Turkey.
What we really want, surely, is for that criticism to be translated into action, for that will benefit everyone.
We could turn things on its head and mention reforms that have been successful, acquaint ourselves with the first steps that Turkey has taken in order to come to terms with its past and promote further attempts, but I urge you to remove acknowledgement of genocides as a condition for membership, for that does not form part of the Copenhagen criteria and has, in all fairness, never been put to any of the other Member States.
All references to a privileged partnership should be deleted, for the objective of the negotiations is that a reformed Turkey should become a Member State.
If these changes are made, we can keep the Turks in Europe, welcoming this secular state with its Muslim people as our ally in the fight against terrorism and extremism.
If we fail to implement these changes, we will leave reformers in Turkey, millions of men and women, simply out in the cold.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MadamÂ President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know if the previous speech represented a personal opinion or the opinion of the committee responsible.
I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to MrÂ Eurlings for the very well-balanced report he has presented.
A good deal of the criticism expressed by one or other group today has been raised by members of the group for the first time in this report.
This, too, should not be forgotten, for example in connection with the issue of the media.
It is important to establish that the negotiations are under way and that both sides need to contribute constructively to these.
We agree that the prospect of EU membership should be extended to Turkey, but we need to make it clear â as the Commissioner also said â that the pace of the reform process has slowed since 3Â October.
It is right and necessary to point this out, and to do so on the basis of a number of specific questions relating to human rights, minority rights and freedom of expression and religion.
It is also important to make it clear that these are the preconditions for progress.
Parliament stated in a decision at the start of negotiations that the political criteria should be met at the start of negotiations and not at the end.
A number of things about this debate are bothering me â this is almost a problem of mentality â for example, that it is not permitted to mention facts in case this is taken as a criticism or misinterpreted in Turkey.
Such negotiations cannot be conducted unless the facts are indeed mentioned.
Only then can we make progress.
After all, our job is to take our citizens with us on this path.
If the conditions are not met and the facts are not clearly stated, we have a problem.
Only those who meet all the criteria, including the political criteria and the preconditions for the negotiations, can join the EU.
This means that implementation of the Ankara Protocol must be set in motion once and for all, an endeavour that has failed up to now.
The Cyprus issue must be resolved this year, as stipulated, and cannot be postponed further, as to do so would mean no one taking us seriously any more.
Incidentally, it must also be stated that the EUâs capacity to cope with enlargement is of vital significance.
This also means that the financial perspectives under the negotiating mandate do not permit negotiations on the chapters with financial implications any earlier than 2013.
That, too, should be made clear, as these provisions in the negotiating mandate show that the EU currently lacks the capacity to cope with enlargement in view of its financial possibilities.
Â Â  . Mr President, today finds us debating a topic that concerns us all, namely negotiations with Turkey and Turkeyâs future in relation to the European Union.
Turkey is a key partner in a crucial region.
It is, now more than ever, evident that we must tie Turkey to the European Union and that we must support the reformers in that country.
Turkey has committed itself to an operation by the United Nations Force in Lebanon.
In that respect, we must assist Turkey to play a positive and constructive role in that region.
We need a partner there as a matter of priority.
The negotiation process is the best way of developing a better and stronger relationship with Turkey, and, while we know that the negotiations will take some time, we remain of the opinion that a critical, yet constructive, dialogue is the best way of bringing that process to a successful conclusion.
Consequently, this Houseâs reports must be balanced and should not lose sight of the end goal, namely membership.
We must build on the progress that has been made in recent years, whilst acknowledging that delays have hampered that progress.
Our group has tried, by means of a series of amendments, to make the report more balanced in a number of areas and, in response to what MrÂ Brok said, our group should not, of course, automatically accept what the Committee on Foreign Affairs produces.
The process is not served by speculation about alternative forms of association; that is our permanent objection to ArticleÂ 71 in the report.
We should leave you in no doubt about that.
The negotiations are being held with a view to full membership.
That is, fortunately, something that is clearly formulated in the Eurlings report, on which we are agreed, and I am in no doubt as to MrÂ Eurlingsâ intentions in that respect.
What is clear, though â and I share MrÂ Brok's view on this â is that the present institutional frameworks will be unable to cope with the accession of new Member States following the accession of the two we have been discussing today.
That too has, fortunately, been clearly spelled out in the Eurlings report: without the necessary reforms in the framework of the institutional process, we will not accept any further decisions about enlargement.
I will now turn to the two key points in the report.
First of all, with regard to the Armenian genocide, I share the view which MrÂ Eurlings has adopted in this respect.
After all, the compromise that we had struck in the negotiations is namely exactly what we need.
It is an appeal to the Turkish Government to recognise this genocide, and to have a good internal debate in Turkey, but without stipulating this as a condition for EU membership.
I hope that tomorrow, we will manage to remove this section from the report.
This whole issue does not, strictly speaking, form part of the Copenhagen criteria, and that is how it should stay.
Finally, as for Cyprus, we agree that the Ankara Protocol needs ratifying.
At the same time, we also think that we should do something to help the Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus more.
This evening, our group will again be discussing the voting list and, on that basis and on the basis of tomorrowâs vote, we will pass our final judgment.
Â Â  . Mr President, I certainly agree with Mrs Bozkurt and MrÂ Wiersma that the resolution at present gets the balance wrong.
Parliamentâs special role inside the accession process is surely to promote the growth of parliamentary democracy in Turkey.
Our criticism should be constructive, designed to encourage Turkeyâs path to modernisation and not to block it.
We are correct to stress the existing impediments to freedom of expression, but we should not put up spurious blocks to the continuation of the process that we have started.
We must pace the reaction, try to be consistent and, above all, be fair, especially on Cyprus and Armenia.
Turkeyâs candidature is a defining moment for the Union.
Should there be a train crash in Cyprus there would be two trains involved.
One of them carries the efforts of Turkey to create a viable form of European Islam, where the Prophet meets the Enlightenment.
The success of that mission will drag both Islam and Christianity far away from the terrible certainties of the 14th century.
The second train carries European efforts to develop a strong common foreign security and defence policy, a task towards which Turkey will make an extraordinary contribution.
Perhaps the involvement of Turkeyâs troops under French command in Lebanon will prove to be a turning point in the life of CFSP and a welcome sign of things to come.
Membership for Turkey will be a two-way process.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have a big problem with the Eurlings report as it stands.
I am not talking about the many critical paragraphs in which the Turkish Government is urged to do more and to implement reforms more quickly.
An appeal has been made, with good reason, to the Turkish Government to remove the infamous ArticleÂ 301, which has led to dozens of trials involving writers and journalists, from the criminal law as quickly as possible.
The problem I have with the report is the few paragraphs where the report is losing total control, particularly the paragraph in which the recognition of the Armenian genocide is considered as some sort of condition for accession, and the Cyprus paragraphs, in which Turkey appears to be the only guilty party.
The original report, as submitted by the rapporteur, was critical, yet fair, and we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have managed to reach sound agreements during our discussions, which means that the report can be improved with many amendments.
Where we went wrong is that in the closing stages of those discussions, clauses were added to the report by means of all kinds of oral amendments, which brought imbalance to a previously balanced report.
Whilst this may have been a huge success for a number of lobby groups, this has considerably changed the report for the worse.
What we want, what my group wants by tabling a number of amendments, is actually to return to the original Eurlings report, which was, in our view, both critical and fair.
I am therefore pleased to hear and also read in the interviews with the rapporteur in the Turkish press that he, on the basis that âa fault confessed is half redressedâ, is prepared to support the attempts to restore the report to its original form.
I will therefore be counting on his support during tomorrowâs votes.
Why is it so important that the report should be critical and, at the same time, fair?
I very much want the European Parliament to continue to play a role in the reform debate in Turkey by supporting those groups and those people who, day in and day out, are fighting for the same things that we are.
It is those very people who in the last few weeks have come up to us and told us that this report, in its current form, is of no use to them.
It is only benefiting those in Turkey who are opposed to reforms, and I do not want to see Parliament helping those people who do not want Turkey to move forward.
If that report does not change, if that report stays in it current form, then that means that we are taking ourselves out of the equation, because then all the valid points made in the report will no longer be taken seriously, and that is not how I see Parliamentâs role.
That is why the changes are necessary, and I am counting on your support and on that of the rapporteur.
I really hope that the majority of this House is prepared to choose this path: constructive, critical, yet fair, rather than the of the report as it currently stands.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has voted in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey, but we believe that those negotiations must centre on respect for human rights and democracy, and that such respect must be indissolubly linked to the political and diplomatic solution to the Kurdish question.
Last week, I took part in the Subcommittee on Human Rightsâ visit to Turkey, and I have come back with a very different impression to the one I had hoped for.
In particular, we found a tragic situation in Turkish Kurdistan, that is, it was a completely militarised zone.
It is one thing for us all to condemn terrorism, but it is quite something else to regard an entire population as terrorists, to imprison minors merely for giving the V-sign, to persist with the logic of torture and to dismiss those judges who, for example, investigate police officers held responsible for an attack.
We, as Parliament, must support the DTPâs call for a ceasefire and we must call on the PKK to respond positively to that appeal.
We must call on the Turkish Government to begin immediate talks with the DTP with the aim of reaching a political solution, as there is no other possible alternative.

However, the problems do not just concern the Kurdish issue: we were all delighted with the solution reached regarding Elif Shafak, just as we were previously with the one regarding Orhan Pamuk, but there is a danger that this is window dressing just for the West: there are at least another 80 writers and journalists who are standing trial under ArticleÂ 301.
At the same time, the Turkish Parliament has approved the anti-terrorism law in its original wording, despite opposition not only from Europe, but also from the United Nations.
Furthermore, we have been able to ascertain that, in Hakkari Province, which is also in the Kurdish area, 7Â 000 out of the 250Â 000 people living there are village guardians, and so we have a situation where a police force â the disbandment of which the European Union has been requesting for some time â is directly answerable to the government.
The commitment that we are asking Parliament, the Commission and the Council to make is to continue down the road of holding talks with Turkey, but with a focus on human rights and not just on ideological debates or economic interests.
We believe that the future can bring a Europe that is multi-ethnic and multi-faith, but there must always be respect for everyoneâs human rights.
Â Â  â (PL) Mr President, it is true that the tone of the report on Turkey is cool in many places but that is what makes it honest.
For over 40 years, this country, which is applying for European Union membership, has had an antagonistic attitude towards its neighbours, which include European Union Member States.
It is also our right and obligation not only to demand explanations for past injustices, but also to demand that Turkey address the deteriorating situation involving infringements of the human rights of the Christian minority in Turkey.
This minority can only depend on us to take up its cause.
In this context, one cannot fail to mention the scandalous statements made by representatives of the Turkish Government in relation to the lecture given by Pope Benedict XVI in Regensburg.
By pandering to the extreme sections of Muslim public opinion, this government has taken two steps backwards.
In spite of this, we should not turn our backs on Turkey.
However, I am sure that forms of cooperation other than membership can bear economic and political fruit.
It should also be stressed that significant imbalances remain in our attitude towards future enlargements.
Significant progress has been made in the political process towards Turkeyâs membership of the European Union, whereas the process towards Ukraineâs membership has been put on hold, although it is not Ukraine that loses 250 cases at the Court of Human Rights each year.
It is not Ukrainians who apply to us for asylum in their droves.
It is not Ukraine that perpetuates tensions with its neighbours as a result of current and past conflicts.
As long as this imbalance in political relations remains, Ukraine will remain confined to the straitjacket thrust upon it 60 years ago as a result of the decrees passed by Stalin's Communist Russia.
Â Â  .
Mr President, the report that MrÂ Eurlings has written is an informative one, and prompts two questions to the Council and Commission, concerning the phenomenon of the so-called âdeep stateâ () and the complete lack of freedom of religion in the Republic of Turkey.
Anti-European forces in Turkey are teaming up in intransparent state structures, nationalistic circles in the army, police, gendarmerie and security services.
To what extent do those forces, summed up under the heading of âdeep stateâ, hamper the present accession negotiations?
There are persistent speculations to the effect that this self-same ominous âdeep stateâ is linked to the killing of the Italian priest Andrea Santoro in Trabzon in February of this year, and that brings me to the altogether humiliating position of the Christian Church in Turkey, the clergy and lay members of which are considered to be foreigners.
In fact, contact between churches and government is made via the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
I should like the Council and Commission to take action on this score.
Or does the fear of Islamic mobilisation in Turkey make you reluctant to insist on full freedom of religion in the land of AtatÃŒrk?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we are now paying the price for the fact that, in Turkeyâs case, the Commission has been turning not just one, but often two blind eyes.
Turkeyâs reforms need only exist on paper for us to celebrate supposed progress.
For example, the implementation of an obligation to adopt international human rights conventions that has been incumbent on Turkey for more than 50Â years by virtue of its membership of the Council of Europe was celebrated as a great success inÂ 2004.
InÂ 1999, the European Council decided that the Copenhagen criteria had to be met before the start of negotiations.
In addition, further political conditions have been laid down in connection with the Greece/Cyprus conflict.
As if it were not enough that the Commission has been very generous in its interpretation with regard to Turkey thus far, now the deadline for the recognition of Cyprus is to be extended once again, in the vague hope that Turkey may yet meet it.
Turkey is dismissing the demand that has now been made for it to actually meet the criteria as politically motivated and unrealistic, and seems to regard Parliamentâs decision as non-binding.
As is typical of Turkey, it is even asking MEPs to kindly show political sense and thus to continue to paper over the cracks.
Reality looks rather different, however, namely that Turkey is simply still not ready to join Europe.
There is no real recognition of Cyprus, no real sense of any wrongdoing with regard to the Armenian genocide and no real willingness to treat the Kurdish people properly.
There can be only one answer to this â which, incidentally, citizens across Europe have been giving for a long time â we should give every possible support to the forces for reform in Turkey, but say a clear ânoâ to the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to focus above all on one aspect of MrÂ Eurlingsâs report: the dialogue between religions.
This is a subject currently under the spotlight throughout the world on account of recent events, the polemics that have arisen, the attention given to Pope Benedict XVIâs words in Germany and the reactions in the Islamic world.
A very important meeting took place yesterday, which demonstrated how important a constructive and positive dialogue between representatives of different religions â between Christians and Muslims â is for all of us.
The meeting was based on the principle of reciprocity, according to which both sides have the right to uphold their own ideas, to defend their own values and to be able to manifest their own faith; this applies to Muslims in areas where Christians are in the majority, and to Christians where Muslims are in the majority.
The Turkish ambassador was also present yesterday at Castel Gandolfo for a meeting with the Pope.
They spoke at length about these issues, and therefore I believe that Benedict XVI's forthcoming visit to Turkey will be fundamentally important.
It will be an important trip because, in my view, it will encourage dialogue between Christians and Muslims, between the Muslim majority and the Christian â Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox â minority living in Turkey.
That is why, with MrÂ Eurlings and MrÂ Tannock, we have tabled an amendment and are putting it before the whole Chamber, including the other political groups.
Its aim is to encourage dialogue between Christians and Muslims, between Christianity and Islam, through a strong message from this Parliament.
Let us exclude extremism, let us isolate fundamentalists, and let us hold a dialogue with those who truly want to build peace in the Middle East and Africa.
To conclude, helping the reforms and encouraging dialogue between Christians and Muslims are in Turkeyâs own interests.
The progress that that country is making on its journey towards the European Union can be measured principally by the results achieved in the dialogue between religions, in respect for minority rights, and in respect for the civil rights of everyone living in Turkey.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to endorse what MrÂ Tajani said.
We certainly agree with him on the great importance of interreligious dialogue, especially between Christian religions and Islam.
It was for this very reason that we objected to the Popeâs statements.
Nevertheless, I appreciate both his apology for the statement in question and the initiative agreed yesterday with the ambassadors of Islamic countries to revive this dialogue.
It is for this reason, in particular, that it is so important to us that Turkey have the prospect of membership â have a path towards EU membership â as this is a means of lending support to this dialogue.
Turkey is also important to us as a strategic partner in the Middle East peace process, which can undoubtedly be promoted appropriately by means of Turkeyâs path towards EU membership.
Nevertheless â and on this point I agree wholeheartedly with the rapporteur, MrÂ Eurlings, to whom I am obliged for his efforts â we must give criticism where criticism is due.
Years ago, I myself was a Parliament rapporteur. I am delighted that the process has been continued, that we are negotiating with Turkey, that some changes have indeed been made in that country.
On the other hand, however, I am disappointed that Turkey has made insufficient progress on a good few issues.
One example is freedom of expression: although many authors are acquitted, the scandal is that they are prosecuted for their opinions in the first place.
That is unacceptable and must be prevented.
Regarding the Kurdish question, as has already been said, no one in this House has any sympathy for terrorism, and the PKK should declare its lasting support for the peace process once and for all.
The Government must do its part to promote peace, however â economically, socially and politically.
It must detach itself from those forces â the military and the security apparatus â that do not want peaceful dialogue â particularly with regard to the Kurdish question.
In this respect â even though there are a few more things we should like to change â the rapporteur has certainly been at pains to make it clear that we do want Turkey to take the path towards EU membership, but that is why we shall not dispense with our legitimate demands â including in Turkeyâs interests â as the greatest beneficiary of the process of reform is not the EU, but Turkey itself.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a mystery about the Eurlings report.
But it is not the one people say.
It is not the harshness or hardening of the report.
In fact, when you read this report you find that it repeats what we have, quite rightly, always said.
It says that human rights and freedom of expression are not adequately respected in Turkey.
It says that religious minorities do not have the right to own property, to publish and to teach that they have everywhere in the European Union.
It says that when you join a club the least you can do is to shake hands with all the members and not to behave in a warlike manner towards any of them.
Finally, it says that there has been an Armenian genocide and that nothing will be built without acknowledging that genocide, and there is nothing new in that.
We said it in 2004, we asked for acknowledgement of the genocide in 2004 and in 2005 we said it had to be a precondition.
Failure to adopt paragraphÂ 49 would be a climb-down on Parliamentâs part.
The real mystery, however, the real mystery of the Eurlings report is its consistency.
Here is an institution that continues, several years later, to say what it said before.
In the climate of general degeneration of which DanielÂ Cohn-Bendit spoke so critically a few moments ago, that is a strange thing.
It is strange that here and now we should be saying that what we said yesterday must remain at the centre of our concerns.
The mystery of the Eurlings report is that we find, for the first time in the history of negotiations, that we have a State that regresses before accession and not afterwards and that tells us accession must be on its terms and not ours.
The mystery of the Eurlings report is that, unlike the Commission in its report on Bulgaria and Romania, this institution has decided to tell the truth, to tell it as it is, to speak the facts, and while I know -Â Guy BÃ©art said it some time agoÂ â that the first person to tell the truth must be executed, I hope that will not be the case with MrÂ Eurlings and his report, which I wholeheartedly support.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his endeavours to capture the mood in this House and form it into a majority.
Nevertheless, I believe that the decision by the Committee on Foreign Affairs tends to be the enemy of the good.
I should like to demonstrate this using two examples.
The first is the point that my fellow Member has just raised towards the end of his speech: the Armenian question.
I attended and spoke at the conference on the Armenian question in Istanbul that many are now describing as âhistoricâ.
It was the first conference of its kind, discussing all questions on this subject â including ones by the harshest critics â in Istanbul.
The participants in this conference, from Taner AkÃ§am to Halil Berktay to Hrant Dink â who is currently fighting a running battle with ArticleÂ 301 â all asked me to tell this House explicitly that anyone wishing to assist the debate in Turkey should not make recognition of the genocide a precondition for membership of the EU.
For this reason, I should like to make the following appeal to my fellow Members: anyone wishing to help the debate continue, anyone wishing to make a contribution to change in Turkey, should listen to the voices of the opposition in the country.
I want to see the border between Turkey and Armenia resemble the border between Germany and France one day, but this will require our help.
My second point is that, on the Cyprus issue, too, we all agree that Turkey must keep its side of the bargain and implement the Ankara Protocol.
There is also a political aspect to the obligations, however, and this concerns the fact that the people in the north of the island of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriots, are waiting for us to keep our side of the bargain and put an end to the economic and educational isolation of the people living in the north of the island.
Turkey must implement the Ankara Protocol, but we must also help put an end to the isolation of the people of Turkish origin in the north of Cyprus.
Â Â  â Mr President, in order to proceed smoothly on its road towards accession, Turkey needs to do the same as the previous candidate countries and comply with its contractual obligations, such as opening up its ports and airports to Cyprus's ships and aircraft and lifting its veto on Cyprus's participation in international organisations and multilateral treaties.
Its continuing refusal to do all this constitutes clear infringement of the association agreement, of customs union and of the additional protocol, which are its contractual obligations towards the European Union.
As such, Turkey is wrong to link them with the Cyprus problem.
Nonetheless, the proposal by the Cypriot government for common use of the port of Famagusta under the aegis of the United Nations, with simultaneous monitoring by the European Commission, combined with the return of the fenced off area of Famagusta to its legitimate residents, may help to overcome the present impasse.
We, the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, are working for the resolution of the Cyprus problem and for respect for the human rights of all Cypriots, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots.
We are not seeking to put obstacles along Turkey's path towards accession.
At the same time, however, we cannot condone infringement of Turkey's contractual obligations towards the European Union at Cyprus's expense or accept the lack of respect for human rights of all the inhabitants of Turkey and the refusal to acknowledge the genocide of the Armenians.
To conclude, we cannot understand the thinking behind the amendments which aim to absolve Turkey of its obligations.
This sort of thinking is unnecessary and will lead us into unwanted complications.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President, the name is the European Union.
MrÂ Erdogan, do you perhaps have a map?
That is how easy it is to answer the question of whether Turkey should be accepted into the EU. Turkey is not a European country, and as such Turkey cannot be a member of the European Union.
The Heads of State or Government of the EU have promised Turkey that it can, on certain conditions, become an EU member, but those Heads of State or Government do not have the backing of their peoples in so doing.
Two thirds of European citizens do not want Turkey to become a member, and the Heads of State or Government will ultimately be compelled to defer to their wishes if they wish to maintain the trust of their electorates.
MrÂ Eurlingâs report is an excellent illustration of how the citizens of the EU base their opinions on facts and not feelings.
I would like to recommend voting in favour of the report, regardless of the fact that some of the wordings in it can be construed as meaning that we regard Turkeyâs accession as an objective, albeit one still far from being realised.
The government of Turkey has demonstrated again and again that it does not recognise European values, whilst at the same time demanding that we should respect unacceptable Turkish and Islamic values.
We saw this in the case of the famous Danish cartoons of Mohammed in the newspaper and also in the Turkish outcry against PopeÂ Benedictâs speech in Regensburg.
Turkey illegally occupies Northern Cyprus and believes that it can force the EU to accept this situation.
Turkey wishes to stifle Europeâs freedom, our freedom of speech, and membership would mean the formation of a parallel society opposed to European culture.
It is time to speak the truth.
Â Â  â Mr President, Europe has a long history of relations with Turkey.
Unfortunately, this history consists almost entirely of painful events and acts of injustice.
It is a history of constant invasions, wars, massacres and the occupation of central and southern Europe.
These were the events experienced by Europeans for centuries.
Today, little has changed and Turkey continues to threaten its neighbours.
Turkey is still enforcing an illegal embargo on Armenia and threatening Greece, questioning Greece's right to define the limits of its own territorial waters.
It is still discriminating against the Kurds and refuses to acknowledge the full independence of Cyprus, which is a Member State of the European Union.
This situation is preposterous.
Turkey poses a threat to stability in this region and we, seemingly blind to this fact, are engaged in negotiations with that country with a view to it achieving membership of the European Union.
Turkey also fails to respect values that we view as inalienable.
It violates and infringes human rights and freedoms and restricts access to them.
It persecutes political opposition groups, including the family of Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament.
Turkey also restricts religious freedom, and this led to the killing of an Italian missionary.
This is the whole truth about Turkey.
I do not agree that Turkey can play the role of a bridge between Europe and the Muslim world.
On the contrary, I think that Turkey could become a gateway for terrorism.
Turkey is part of a world that is alien to us in terms of its culture and traditions.
We have to acknowledge this fact and ask ourselves: , Europe?
Should the Union be European or Eurasian?
Accepting Turkey into the European Union will set a dangerous precedent that will spell the end of Europe as we know it today.
Accession negotiations with Turkey should cease as soon as possible.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Turkish Prime Minister, MrÂ Erdogan, has strongly criticised the speech made by the Pope at Regensburg University, a speech based on religion with a grounding in theology, not politics.
The fact that it was the Prime Minister and not a Turkish religious spokesman who criticised the Pope shows that the sacred and the secular â politics and religion â are still unacceptably mixed together in that country.
The separation to which we are accustomed in our European Union does not exist there.
This mix-up is a further reason why Turkey should not join the European Union, even though the main reason will never be eliminated, which is that Turkey must not join the European Union because it is not geographically in Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, may I start by congratulating MrÂ Eurlings on his excellent work and on his report.
I shall, of course, take this opportunity to repeat that we are in favour of Turkey's European prospects.
In essence, the Eurlings report is not only a warning, a message to Turkey about the steps it must take and the obligations it must honour in order to continue on its path towards Europe.
It is also, at the same time, confirmation of the principles upon which the European Union was built, principles from which we have an obligation not to deviate because, when MrÂ Eurlings speaks of respect for human rights and for minority rights, he is reiterating a European principle.
The same applies when he speaks of institutional reforms, the same applies when he speaks of a peaceful resolution to differences and the same applies when he calls for the signature of the Ankara protocol to be honoured and for this protocol to be applied immediately.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every country, every nation that forgets or does not come to terms with its history, will at some point have problems.
Thus, paragraphÂ 50 referring to the tragic history of the Armenians, the Greeks of Pontos and the Assyrians, does precisely that. It calls on Turkey to do so.
This paragraph is the outcome of broad agreement and must remain as it stands.
Consequently, it must not be changed in one direction or another with amendments that have been tabled.
Finally, I wish to remind all those who consider the report to be excessively strict, that there are in Turkey democratic citizens who want a modern Turkey, a developed and progressive Turkey which looks towards Europe and who are fighting for that against the well-known establishment.
They need a message which we shall give them by voting for the Eurlings report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the assessment of Turkeyâs progress in the EU accession process should focus more on the content of the assessments relating specifically to the Copenhagen criteria and the dossiers relating to the .
I shall avoid introducing distractions â new criteria that do not help a process that is already in itself difficult and requires us to be transparent, consistent and objective.
In that respect, I agree with paragraphÂ 50, as proposed by the rapporteur, on the Armenian genocide issue.
This country plays a crucial role in a geopolitical area that runs from the Mashreq to South-East Asia and the Caucasus.
That leads us to support the efforts of all those who are working for a democratic, peaceful Turkey.
Having said that, we must be strict in our judgments and demand that the Turkish Government, together with all its state machinery and institutions and Turkish society, make a serious commitment to those areas in which progress has to be more significant and constant.
Those areas include civil, political and social rights, freedom of expression and, particularly, the rights of minorities, primarily those of the Kurdish minority and of women, who are in fact in the majority.
We hope for a firm condemnation of terrorism and the implementation of the Ankara protocol by the agreed deadlines.
To conclude, let us try to keep to the point and to be credible and effective in continuing to positively influence internal developments in this country and its external role in establishing peace and stability in an explosive region where the most serious threats to peace are concentrated.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, those who have voted for opening negotiations with Turkey have already, on several occasions, explained the good reasons for achieving its accession in the near future, so there is no need for me to repeat them.
This annual debate on progress made is, however, a gauge that specifically records the reforms that have been achieved and the mood of public opinion, and I think we can all see that there has been increasing coolness on both fronts in recent times.
We are against arranged marriages: to get married you have to know each other and love each other, and that applies to Turkeyâs ambitious goal as well.
The Turkish Government must therefore work harder at its reforms and at spreading the message within its own society.
The report is very stringent in this respect, but it is only fair and right that the negotiations should be stringent and fair.
There is growing scepticism in Europe, however, about further enlargement after Bulgaria and Romania if the rules are not changed. This scepticism is also likely to involve the Western Balkans.
We must therefore not stop enlargement but rather promote reform of the rules.
The question about Turkey is, in fact, also a question about ourselves and what we want to be.
Â Â  Mr President, last week, together with other colleagues from the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I was in Akari province in the extreme south-east of Turkey, just a few mountain peaks away from Iraq and Iran.
In that region we met parents, desperate parents powerless to stop their young sons leaving for the mountains.
We were told that more than 200 young men have joined the armed bands of the PKK in the last few weeks.
We also met young girls fighting against family feudalism, fighting against economic and social isolation and everyday violence.
Many spoke of young girls committing suicide.
It was not hope, let alone enthusiasm for the future, that we found in Akari and elsewhere.
There are many extremely precise facts bearing witness to the violence of the security forces, including against farmers, but also to extra-judicial arrests and the torture of young people as in Diyarbakir this year.
The forced resignation of the public prosecutor of Van for demonstrating the responsibility of army members for the Semdinli bombing was also very traumatic.
Quite apart from the dirty war exploits it reveals, the frustration of the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable.
Everyone says, everyone knows, there is no military answer to the Kurdish question, and yet, with its checkpoints, tanks, soldiers and armed assaults it is the only one that seems effective.
The PKK must call a unilateral ceasefire.
If that call is heeded and kept, as we hope, it will have to be followed by a wide-ranging political proposal.
The attention and support of the European Union will be crucial.
The deteriorating situation in the south-east is affecting the human rights situation in the country as a whole.
The anti-terrorist legislation was unanimously criticised by the non-government people we spoke to.
It does not comply with international law.
It may even cancel out some of the progress made in the latest legislative reforms.
The situation in the south-east is also rekindling a nationalism that is clearly and sometimes violently opposed to democratic aspirations.
The writer MagdenÂ Perihan talks about a forest fire.
She speaks of hooligan lawyers.
Immediate action is required, in particular the abolition of ArticleÂ 301 of the penal code, bringing anti-terrorist legislation into line with international law, the fight against impunityÂ âÂ in 2005 only 2Â out of 305Â accused policemen were sentenced â the compensation law must be put into effect â 2Â 000 cases out of 3Â 000 have been processed in AkariÂ province â and, lastly, the 10% national voting threshold must be abolished, since it prevents popular democratic expression.
Â Â  â Mr President, we members of the Greek Communist Party will be voting against the Eurlings report.
Firstly, because we are against the accession of Turkey to the European Union for the same reasons that we were against the accession of Greece, not for cultural reasons.
Secondly, because this report â like others before it â are like rubber.
They adapt every time depending on the objections in the European Union, sometimes appearing to be stricter and sometimes more lenient.
Thirdly, because on serious points at issue concerning Turkey's stand on issues of international law, the report is no more than a wish list, repeating the same wishes without, however, proposing any specific measures, such as to deal with the presence of 40Â 000 Turkish occupying troops in Cyprus and the fact that Turkey is provocatively ignoring UN decisions and resolutions, culminating in the refusal to recognise the Republic of Cyprus.
We therefore ask: between the previous report and now, has anything specific been done in these sectors?
No, Turkey continues to provocatively ignore all these decisions and you continue along exactly the same lines.
Fourthly, because we radically disagree with the indirect reference to paragraphÂ 51 on border difficulties between Greece and Turkey and with the Helsinki conclusions referring them to the International CourtÂ ...
Â Â  Mr President, let me say at the outset that, as a member of the European Parliamentâs High Level Contact Group for relations with Northern Cyprus, I am clearly aware of the sense of isolation the Turkish Cypriots feel in light of the rejection of the Annan Plan.
In fact, I believe that the European Union, together with the United Nations, should continue to work to build peace and reconciliation on the island of Cyprus.
However, Turkey too has serious obligations.
For example, Turkey must open its ports and airports to Cypriot ships and aeroplanes. This is an obligation that Turkey will have to honour in accordance with the accession negotiations.
I also feel that Turkey must consider repealing clause 301 of its Penal Code, which is being used to charge dozens of Turkish writers with insulting Turkishness.
It is clear that significant efforts are needed in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey.
These are serious issues.
In conclusion, I must stress that they have to be effectively addressed by the Turkish Government sooner rather than later, because these policy matters are an intrinsic element of accession negotiations.
Â Â  Mr President, why on earth does Turkey want to join the European Union in the first place?
Perhaps it wants to join the mass ranks of the parasite nations that already live off the backs of the British and German taxpayers.
Perhaps it sees an opportunity to export some of its unemployed and criminals to Britain.
But the Turks should think about the impact on their own society.
Only yesterday, the Turkish Army Chief of Staff, General Ä°lker BaÅbuÄ, warned of the dangers posed by Islamist extremists politicising religion, and pledged that the Turkish army would protect the secular nature of the Turkish Republic.
But in the past the Turks have not had to contend with the European Union.
They may find that their Islamist extremists are able to exploit the EUâs non-discrimination, equality and human rights legislation to their advantage.
Perhaps the Turks will have to learn the hard way that membership of the European Union means losing control of your own destiny.
Â Â  Mr President, the commencement of negotiations with Turkey was an historic mistake, for the European Union, as the name suggests, is a European project.
Now we have to stand by idly and watch the whole thing go wrong.
Turkey is an Islamic country with a predominantly authoritarian and patriarchal culture.
The best thing for the EU to do is to demonstrate who is the boss in the negotiation process, but the fact is that, for the moment, the opposite appears to be the case.
Turkey refuses to observe its obligations in respect of Cyprus and even dares demand that Europe should break through the so-called isolation of the occupied part of Cyprus.
Turkey is calling the shots.
The Commission and Council have given the European electorate to believe that the negotiations can be suspended at any time if Turkey fails to cooperate.
They are now wriggling every which way not to have to act.
First, they tried to get the European Court of Justice to pronounce judgment on the issue of Cyprus; now they want to organise the negotiations in such a way as to ensure that the sensitive chapters do not feature until the end.
All this is being done in order to play for time and to be able to say afterwards that there is no turning back.
Where is the EUâs credibility in all of this?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is excellent.
We endorse it, because it marks a turning point in terms of Parliamentâs becoming aware of the reality of the relations between Turkey and the European Union.
The report is the most critical of all those that have been produced in this House over the last few decades.
In particular, it includes three points that are of decisive importance to us: the reference to the European Unionâs absorption capacity as a criterion; the crucial need for Turkey to treat Cyprus, a full member of the European Union, normally; and the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession.
I must point out to my fellow French Members from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that that was part of their programme for the 2004 European elections.
The adoption of this report â and we do want to see it adopted â must have political consequences.
I would begin by asking the Commission to stop playing hide-and-seek and to produce, on 8Â November, an authentic report and not a childrenâs story, as it is wont to do in this area.
I would ask the Council of Ministers to take a clear-sighted and courageous approach to the situation and to think about breaking off negotiations, as they make no sense these days to the average person.
Aside from the case of Turkey, it is the entire enlargement process that is at stake.
From now on, no further enlargement should be embarked on until we have provided the European Union with effective decision-making mechanisms and with a sufficient budget.
Pressing on in a state of illusion and hypocrisy would compromise the European project, that is to say the construction of a political union, and would further widen the gap between the common sense of the people and the blindness of the leaders.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it has been said that the Socialist Party in the European Parliament has done a u-turn regarding its position on Turkey.
Let me remind you of our position, which has been clear since the start.
Our long-term aim is to have Turkey join because we believe â and this is a genuine political project â in a Europe that is multicultural, secular but multi-faith, peaceful and open to the rest of the world.
While we, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, have sent out clear signals to Turkey regarding, in particular, human rights, womenâs rights, minority rights and the recognition of Cyprus, we have done so in the same constructive spirit.
We have done so in order to give concrete expression to a fledgling Europe that will not be the Europe that MrÂ Sarkozy, MrsÂ Merkel or probably the Pope want.
The challenge is immense and it has already come up against a problem in the shape of the Eurlings report, the new draft of which is unbalanced.
This report rightly stresses that the democratic process currently under way in Turkey is not progressing as quickly as we had hoped, but it overlooks some crucial progress made by Turkey, particularly in the area of foreign affairs. I am thinking of its role in UNIFIL and also of the fact that it stayed out of the war in Iraq.
The aim of the amendments tabled by the PSE Group was thus to make some adjustments or, in other words, to soften the tone.
On the subject of Armenia now, MrÂ Eurlings heckled me just now, and I should like to make myself very clear.
Parliament has recognised the Armenian genocide, and there will never be any revisionism in this Chamber.
We have a duty to remember the one and a halfÂ million Armenians who were massacred in 1915, that is to say before the Turkish Republic under AtatÃŒrk was born.
We have a duty to remember not only in Europe, but also worldwide, and that is why we have asked for the UN not to delay in sending a committee of international experts on this matter to Turkey.
Yet, to use this tragedy, as some people are doing, in order to thwart Turkeyâs candidature, or to half-open the door to a vulgar form of Islamophobia, is a trap that we do not wish to fall into.
That is why, after some very difficult debates, after â I can assure you â some highly sensitive negotiations within my group, we have taken the line that you have heard on various occasions and that I will make my own.
I can assure you that it is a difficult line: we will not demand the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite, but, ladies and gentlemen, it is nonetheless quite clear that, when the time comes to review the situation prior to accession, this sensitive point will weigh very heavily in the balance, and Turkey knows it.
For the time being, we expect Turkey to fulfil this duty to remember, to consolidate its stabilising role in the Middle East and to make progress in relation toÂ âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, our European Union exists because it is firmly based on strict adherence to our European principles and values.
Those principles and values are not negotiable and that must be clearly understood by all those who belong to the EU and by those wishing to join.
Turkey is welcome to join our Union and I very much hope that it does, but it must accept and abide by our European principles and values.
It is Turkey that must achieve the required accession changes, not us, and we must be honest in making our position clear to Turkey.
We should not try to trick Turkey into joining the EU.
Turkey must do so only if it really wants to and in full awareness of exactly what is demanded of it.
The Eurlings report makes that clear, firmly and honestly.
The Eurlings report is the result of much discussion and debate and many compromise amendments have been voted in by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, finally achieving a much-desired balance.
Please support it and resist attempts to introduce any amendments on key issues at this stage, which is likely to cause more harm than good.
Let me remind some of my colleagues that we will bring about reforms in Turkey by telling the Turkish people the truth and not hiding the truth from them.
Â Â  The June Listâs representatives in the European Parliament voted against the proposal to begin accession negotiations with Turkey.
Our ânoâ vote was motivated neither by a belief that Turkey is located outside Europe nor by the fact that it is a Muslim country.
We pointed out that Turkey still has a long way to go before it meets the requirements we set for membership of the EU.
We also expressed our fears that commencing negotiations would reduce the pressure on Turkey to establish a democratic state under the rule of law with full human rights for women, Kurds, Christians, trade unions and writers.
This has proven to be the case.
Earlier promising developments have come to a halt and, in some areas, have been replaced by retrograde steps.
We now find ourselves in a shameful situation in which the EU is beginning to set requirements for the design of the electoral system and a new constitution in the sovereign state of Turkey.
That is not the EUâs job.
It is up to Turkey to choose how to meet the EUâs requirements.
It is up to Turkey to choose its own solutions.
The accession negotiations should be put on hold while we await adequate reforms.
Â Â  â Mr President, our discussion on the subject of Turkey is obviously far more critical and therefore significantly more open than on previous occasions.
However, we should remember that we ought to ask ourselves where our fundamental interests lie.
On the basis of all the key membership criteria, which do not need to be reiterated, Turkey is not fit to be a member of the European Union.
We have mentioned the question of Cyprus, human and civil rights, religion and the Armenian community.
However the European Unionâs fundamental interest lies in countries such as Turkey or Ukraine moving closer to it.
In this respect, the European Union has not been entirely honest.
We have not stated openly that the accession of countries such as Turkey will, in fact, put an end to certain European Union policies, notably its economic, structural and agricultural policies.
We should state openly what effects the accession of these large countries would have on the European Union, given that this slight dishonesty is not lost on our partners, including Turkey.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Turkey is not a European country.
Its accession would overstretch, overstrain, weaken, perhaps even endanger the EU.
Anyone who says so exposes himself to the accusation of refusing to support the process of reform and push the criteria through.
Yet even a privileged partnership requires that the Copenhagen criteria be met and the reforms be driven forward, particularly in the interests of the Turkish population itself.
We must ask ourselves critical questions.
Those who want Turkey to have full membership are perhaps looking for a different Turkey, but will find only a different EU â a free-trade area garnished with political elements.
As far as Turkey itself is concerned, we must ask ourselves the following questions. Is secularism really compatible with democracy if it is just a minority, an elite project?
Is freedom of religion really compatible with state-controlled Islam in the guise of secularism?
Are minority rights really compatible with Kemalism, which is a kind of Turkish Jacobinism?
These are all serious, well-founded questions that we need to ask ourselves.
We must stop running down a blind alley at whose end may lie a rejection of Turkeyâs accession by the Member States and peoples of the EU, with dire consequences for Turkeyâs inner stability.
We owe it to Turkey â particularly because it is an important partner â to be honest and to draw up decent criteria for a sound, tailor-made partnership that accords with the interests of both Turkey and the EU, instead of constantly painting our own picture of Turkey, which bears not the slightest resemblance to reality.
For this reason, we must take care not to fall below the line taken in the Eurlings report, which I rejected in committee as I did not believe it went far enough.
This line should represent our consensus, however, otherwise the signal sent to Turkey would be disastrous.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in DecemberÂ 2004, with 402 votes in favour, this Parliament took a clear decision to open accession negotiations with Turkey.
This sent out a clear signal.
Today we are debating the report on Turkeyâs progress towards accession, a report whose intention should actually be constructive monitoring of negotiations with Turkey and of its accession process.
It strikes me, however, that this Eurlings report tends to lose sight of our objective â Turkeyâs membership of the EU.
I ask myself what we want, therefore.
Is it for Turkey to continue on its reform path â in which case we should treat it fairly â or are we saying that whatever it does it will never become a member of the EU?
Our Turkish partners are confronted with an assortment of bad examples.
The progress achieved and good examples are almost completely ignored.
This is not fair treatment.
It is true that Turkey needs to do further work on its process of reform.
It is also true that it needs to comply with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol: human rights, democracy and protection of minorities are preconditions for EU accession.
If Turkey meets the criteria already laid down and continues to drive forward its process of reform, we, too, must hold to the goal of EU membership.
That should be upheld in our report. I would consider this a very clear signal.
If the rapporteur or Parliament disagrees, that must be stated in a report on Turkey, otherwise half-truths such as these will diminish Parliamentâs credibility.
We took a decision in Strasbourg in OctoberÂ 2005 to open accession negotiations with Turkey, and we must hold to it today.
I have always said that Turkey was not yet ready for accession, but was ready to start negotiations.
Europe should show understanding and solidarity in acknowledging and supporting this.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am really surprised at this discussion.
Anyone would think that there had been only a very narrow majority in favour of the Eurlings report in committee.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament endorsed the report, however. It was adopted in committee with 54Â votes in favour.
The same Socialist Group â MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser, MrÂ Wiersma, both highly respected Members â is now completely opposing what it supported recently in committee.
That surprises me greatly.
I should like to say to MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser that this is not what I understand by âclarityâ.
We must ask ourselves some critical questions, the most important of which is whether we have taken the people with us on this enlargement tour, this negotiating tour of Turkey.
The answer is a clear ânoâ.
The people are very critical of it.
I am addressing this explicitly to the Commission and the Council, too.
Where do we think this discussion on the EUâs capacity to cope with enlargement has come from?
Where do we think this change of attitude in Parliament has come from?
All of us here discuss this issue with citizens fairly frequently, and we sense the scepticism, reticence, and in some cases even large-scale rejection of Turkeyâs accession.
This is also the reason for my warning to the Council and Commission that no new commitments should be made, no new prospects extended, until the EU has been reformed.
We all agree on one thing: we need institutional progress.
I should like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, problems cannot be solved unless they are addressed.
Glossing over the issue never does any good.
MrÂ Eurlings describes very precisely the aspects connected with Turkey that run contrary to the spirit of Europe. I should like to thank him for his report.
In fact, virtually no progress has been made there in almost all the politically relevant fields â and in some cases the situation has even deteriorated.
