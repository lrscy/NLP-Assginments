It is clear that, in order to achieve the objectives it has set, the European Union needs more properly trained researchers and it needs to be able to use its human resources by promoting cross-border cooperation.
To this end, we must combat the brain drain effectively, we must provide incentives for the best foreign researchers to come to work in Europe, we must promote scientific education amongst young people, improve the working conditions of research staff, remove obstacles to mobility and promote the conditions necessary for women to be able to take part in the scientific and technological field under equal conditions with men.
The football metaphor is of no use to us here, ladies and gentlemen: in order to make progress intelligently, the team needs to be mixed.
Secondly, I would like to refer to the need to support the research capacities of SMEs.
In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of the instruments proposed in the CIS and in the Seventh Framework Programme to improve SMEsâ access to funding, lack of which is their main obstacle when trying to improve their innovating capacity.
I would finally like to stress the proposal to strengthen the Structural Funds intended for research and innovation.
The Structural Funds have been reinforcing R+D structures on the basis of a territorial distribution of resources by means of convergence criteria.
It is therefore important to promote coordination between the different Community R+D programmes with the fundamental instrument of regional development policy: the Structural Funds.
Mr President, those are the three points I wished to stress of a document that may be very useful in our future work.
Â Â  To begin with, allow me to express my thanks to the rapporteur, MrsÂ delÂ Castillo, for her report capturing the entire scope of the issue of development in the area of research and innovation and suggesting quite a few ideas for how to improve the current situation.
In my contribution I would like to emphasise the very important role of the implementation structures that may significantly influence the future success of European support programmes in the areas of research, development and innovation, including the Seventh Framework Programme and the Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation.
The extent to which these programmes, in which we put such great stock, prove to be successful will depend on how well they are attuned to the needs of the target groups, particularly small and middle-sized businesses, universities, research centres and institutions.
If my information is correct, the European Commission, namely the DG for Enterprise, is working on aÂ new, more effective model of business support networks â Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres â with the aim of reducing administrative burdens.
It is envisaged that these networks will be restructured through the development of consortiums at the NUTS I or NUTS II level.
I regard the steps that the Commission has taken to boost efficiency and dismantle bureaucracy as being quite correct.
On the other hand, I would like to urge you, Commissioner, in implementing these steps, to take into account the need for close interaction between entrepreneurs, research centres and universities, on the one hand, and intermediary institutions on the other.
A regional level NUTS II for establishing consortiums is the minimum level required in order to provide sufficient geographical coverage for the comprehensive range of services essential to the job of successfully implementing European policy in this area.
A decision favouring NUTS I, in other words the central level, might decrease the administrative burden on the European Commission but would definitely not contribute to reducing red tape at the national level; on the contrary, it would diminish the chances of the target recipients gaining flexible access to support programmes, particularly in outlying regions.
An equally important requirement for the envisaged consortiums should be to ensure the comprehensive range and high quality of support services.
The establishment of consortiums through a shared network of Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres will encourage comprehensive and flexible service provision, while fulfilling the original aims of these Centres and generating much needed synergism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, MrsÂ delÂ CastilloÂ Vera, on her report.
I should like to broach two subjects: the issue of building the European research area and the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Building the European research area means building the single market for that most precious of commodities: knowledge.
For that reason, we must apply the same determination to the construction of this market that Europe, as a whole, applied to the completion of the monetary Union and of the single market for other goods.
We will be launching the seventh framework programme in a few monthsâ time, and the Union still presents a very, indeed overly, varied landscape of national and regional systems for research and innovation and, consequently, we are not working together as a team.
This is to the detriment of systematic cooperation and efficiency.
If we want to fulfil the Lisbon Strategy, then all of the actors involved, in the public and private sectors, at regional, national and Community levels, will each have to make a contribution through complementary and synergistic measures, and develop systems that are not merely political but consistent and mutually compatible.
As regards small and medium-sized enterprises, many sources attribute the fall in productivity, and therefore in the productivity of the Italian economy, to the fact that there is little innovation in Italy.
This is because, in many Italian companies, there is a perception that new technologies are basically pointless or superfluous.
This negative attitude is linked to the small scale of our businesses, which have an average of four employees, but, although the phenomenon is particularly serious in my country, it also concerns most of Europe.
In this connection, I propose that, over and above the various support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises provided for by MrsÂ delÂ CastilloÂ Vera's report â which I fully support â we launch training initiatives aimed specifically at small entrepreneurs, to make it clear to them that innovation has become necessary for survival.
Finally, I call on the Member States and the regions, while acknowledging research and innovation as a top priority, not to lose too much time in transposing the legislation and in starting to implement the various programmes and actions, because time is precious when it comes to innovation.
Â Â  We, Hungarians, are proud of the fact that during the last century we gave the world about a dozen Nobel prize winners.
However, we do not remember nearly as often that these outstanding intellects, almost without exception, gained this recognition far from their homeland.
Most of these scientists received this honour while carrying out research in the United States.
After some time, a team of Hungarian scientists at the famous Los Alamos research centre in the United States were referred to as Martians.
In fact, everyone in America jokingly referred to them as Martians later, because their superior intelligence made it seem as if they had come from another planet.
However, they were not from another universe, just from a different continent, Europe.
It was the better research conditions and greater recognition which made them take the knowledge they had acquired in their homeland to the United States.
This is a 20th century story, but we should not think that the 'brain drain' has stopped.
Europe still produces the most outstanding intellectual giants.
However, if we look at a summary of the statistics on research and development, the alarming conclusion we come to is that we are still at a serious disadvantage in this area, compared with the United States and Japan.
The report tabled before us correctly states that this lagging behind is due, on the one hand, to the fact that Europe is not producing a sufficient amount of research results which can subsequently applied in the business sector.
The gap between theoretical knowledge and its practical application is seriously holding back Europe's competitiveness.
The other reason for lagging behind is still the lack of resources.
Achieving the target of allocating 3% of the EU's GDP to research by 2010 already seems like an illusion.
It is clear then what needs to be done: allocate more resources, strengthen applied research and give more recognition to researchers as a profession, because without such action, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy will remain beyond our reach.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a European paradox that while we have a high level of basic research, we have a relatively low level of innovation.
In Poland, this has been influenced by the fact that many branches of industry have been taken over by foreign companies which have their research institutes, design offices and laboratories in their own countries.
In fact, our industrial research base has been shut down in recent years.
Research results have not been effectively translated into streamlined production methods and services or innovation.
This is partly due to multinational corporations choosing to compete in the field of research and innovation.
Inventors of new ideas and patents have also had difficulties in gaining measurable profits.
Other problems have included the blocking of possible competitors from the European Union by international corporations such as Microsoft with the aid of patents, limited budgetary resources and the restricted financial resources for military research.
That is why we should, first of all, simplify the mechanisms allowing inventors to gain personal profits not only from patentable inventions but also from other inventions.
Secondly, we should limit the monopolies of international companies which use their patents to block European competitors.
If a patent granted in the Union blocks the growth of innovation in a given field through deliberate non-application for a given period of time, I would suggest that the idea behind the invention should be made available, free of charge, to other users.
Thirdly, any large company should have to use their profits to create a technical progress fund for streamlining and innovation.
It is a solution that has already been implemented in Poland once before.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, however, could focus their resources with the aid of organisations such as chambers of commerce.
Â Â  Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, innovation, research and growth constitute the biggest challenge for the European Union as aÂ whole.
I therefore appreciate the optimism and efforts of the rapporteur, who has tried to identify new ways of meeting Lisbon Strategy goals in this report on her own initiative.
For Europe to be able to compete with the United States and Japan, countries taking the lead in the application information and communications technology, we need to boost the appeal of careers in research by offering incentives, an attractive environment and remuneration schemes that will motivate students to undertake research while studying at university.
Member States are expected to play a special role in promoting investment in research and innovation, while facilitating and broadening public and private sector partnerships, particularly those with universities.
Key to Europeâs success are the vital small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for 65% of European GDP.
These businesses in particular need support in the area of innovation and research, as they underpin the growth of services and markets based on new technologies.
A basic precondition for establishing the framework for a conducive business environment is the availability of sufficient funding from the EU budget.
For example, supporting the use of venture capital creates possibilities for accumulating financial resources for the development of creative ideas, ensuring the competitiveness of businesses at the start of their operations.
We must remember to nurture entrepreneurial spirit from early on, as it serves innovation and encourages demand from the public for innovative goods and services.
It is essential to make information on research and innovation available to the business community at large, and we must therefore build and support information centres at the regional level as well.
These centres may then contribute to enhancing nationwide and cross-border cooperation.
Allow me to make one final point: the year 2010 is rapidly drawing closer and it is becoming obvious that the European Union must transform the Lisbon Strategy objectives into action and must do so as soon as possible.
Â Â  â It is evident, Madam President, that the United States of America and Japan have overtaken Europe in three vital fields.
These are growth, research and production.
We know that Europe is capable of developing a lot more than it is developing at the moment.
We also know that the unemployment lines are too long.
And we have adopted an attitude where we stretch out our fingers and point them towards recently industrialised countries.
Today we talk of China, tomorrow India, and the day after tomorrow Brazil.
However, this is not the truth; the truth is that Europe has not taken the initiative into its hands, nor has it understood the importance of renovation, research, technology and informatics.
In fact, we imposed upon ourselves a target of 3% of GDP.
We are now saying that this is a difficult target to reach, and the countries â I shall conclude here â the countries which benefit from structural funds should dedicate part of this sum towards the achievement of this goal.
Â Â  Madam President, the rapporteur very aptly described the most important premise of the Communication.
She sees in it a new stimulus for the principle behind the Lisbon Agenda, which many Europeans still view as the European Unionâs âtrademarkâ.
The Communication simply recommends that the European Union should continue to favour research and innovation as vital stimuli for change in contemporary society, something it has declared to be a priority for many years, and that it should above all view economic development as a decisive instrument for stimulating the job market.
The ten new Member States staunchly support the creation of increasingly more attractive operating conditions for modern research centres in Europe.
There are clearly certain concerns, justified by the fact that there are still visible legal and administrative barriers for scientists from Central and Eastern Europe wanting to participate in this research.
The fact that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has accepted the amendments tabled to the report is therefore all the more welcome.
These amendments were tabled with the scientists from that region in mind, especially those at the start of their careers.
It should also be emphasised that the committee has shown significant interest in the problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises.
In the rapporteurâs report, we even find a proposal to take particular account of the specific situation of micro enterprises and small enterprises.
The scientific world views this as an appropriate framework for putting pressure on the European Commission to create an information database which will provide a record of the current state of scientific research.
It will also be a kind of guarantee, bearing in mind the increasing expectations of the scientific world, that intellectual property rights will be protected.
This kind of new economic policy should create new opportunities for flexible choice of economic instruments that ensure, in accordance with the message emerging from our debate, continued growth in employment.
Â Â  Madam President, six years after the start of the ten-year Lisbon Strategy, it is still difficult to call the European Union the most dynamic economy in the world.
Catching up with the United States or Japan still remains an ambition, a dream.
It is hardly surprising that actions do not follow words.
The European Union has earmarked only 1.93% of its GDP for scientific research and development, whereas the USA has allotted 2.59% and Japan 3.15% of GDP to this field.
Low investment in research and development, as well as a lack of sufficient support for innovation, will not increase the potential for growth and employment in the European Union.
That is why it is extremely important to guarantee the appropriate budgetary resources for aid instruments to small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme or the JEREMIE initiative.
As well as fostering entrepreneurship and stimulating innovation, we must also continually invest in scientific development.
Scientists should be given appropriate career opportunities and financial conditions to conduct their research.
Otherwise, institutions in the United States or Japan will continue to succeed in tempting away brilliantly qualified European experts with better offers, and it will be these countries for which they win future Nobel prizes.
Â Â  â Madam President, the use of technologies and innovation in economics, business and commerce unquestionably makes a decisive contribution to soaring increases in the productivity of labour and to the creation of new, quality jobs.
The rapporteur, whom I honestly congratulate on the composite presentation of her report, therefore justifiably points out that, despite the fact that the European institutions recognise the vital importance of promoting research and innovation, the European Union as a whole is still failing to make adequate use of its potential, either in terms of human resources or in terms of funding capacity.
National reform programmes do of course all recognise as a challenge policies on research, innovation and their applications.
For financing, it is not as important, in my opinion, to achieve a maximum target in terms of percentages as it is to reform public research systems, in tandem with the restructuring and the promotion of the efficacy of university scientific institutions and research programmes and, in general, with the spreading of interest in knowledge and research to renewed education systems and to effective lifelong learning programmes.
Facilitating joint ventures between the public and private sectors and cross-border cooperation are equally important investments for more research and the successful dissemination of innovation.
Alongside state financing, the proper management of Community financial resources and financing mechanisms by the Commission and access to loans from the European Investment Bank is expected to safeguard an increase in research activities, especially by small and medium-sized companies.
Within the framework of regional convergence in technological pioneering and development and the completion of the single job market, I consider that it would be a good idea to promote the participation of small and medium-sized companies in European technology platforms.
However, the maximisation of returns is achieved with the promotion of human resources, with excellence and with creative cooperation between higher education and lifelong learning agencies and the business and manufacturing sectors.
Thus Europe will become a global competitor in research, just as it has in football.
Â Â  Madam President, the discussion which ended a few minutes ago dealt with very similar issues.
All the speakers described the situation very well.
In order to develop, one must invest. That includes investment in scientific research and innovation.
Parliamentâs motion for a resolution features this truism, as well as a detailed analysis of the situation and the direction that future actions should take.
However, the statements that Europe does not seek to acquire new knowledge, that it cannot share knowledge and that it does not support knowledge financially all have a very ominous ring to them.
This must change!
We must begin to invest more in basic research, and we have to expand the scope of public funding for research and development.
Otherwise, we may be shooting ourselves in the foot.
Unless we take the necessary steps, we will move from being a modern and dynamic Europe, which is regarded as attractive by many citizens of other countries, to being a technical, technological and economic backwater which Europeans will not want to live or work in, let alone like.
Â Â  First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for proving that we can turn âglobalisationâ to our advantage by responding appropriately to contemporary social processes, despite the fact that this word resonates across Europe as a threat.
In particular, she has brought our attention to three areas of weakness: the generation of new knowledge, cooperation in generating and using new knowledge, and funding.
I should also like to draw attention to three areas that will, in my opinion, be crucial to the successful implementation of the Lisbon Programme: first of all, research; secondly synergising national and European policies and, finally, the European Technology Institute.
Firstly, the Commission has, in cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council, submitted a suitable proposal for the 7th Framework Programme for Research.
We must bring negotiations on this research programme to a close as soon as possible so that we can start implementing it in time.
Financial resources for this programme were pruned considerably during the financial perspective negotiations, which is why the research budget must be implemented in its entirety.
There is no justifiable reason for any further reductions in these resources.
Secondly, EUâlevel measures can encourage individual Member States to take their own measures.
We will only achieve satisfactory results if we combine EUâlevel action with that made by individual Member States.
I therefore urge the Commission to follow carefully the action taken by individual states and give public prominence to examples of successful states or successful practice.
Thirdly, it is also important to synergise areas of education, research and development, on the one hand, and economy on the other.
It is important that the Commission acts to promote such cooperation â I am referring here to the European Technology Institute.
In order that this proposal should not remain merely a political project, we must be acutely aware of the views of all interested parties.
We have to foster genuine growth within the European Research Area and prevent finances from being cut further and used for the expansion of bureaucracy.
Thank you!
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 a.m.
Â Â  This own-initiative report on the implementation of the Lisbon programme comes at the most appropriate moment now that we are on the eve of finalizing the negotiations on the new Cohesion Policy legislative package.
The revival of the Lisbon strategy's growth and employment objectives is an important aspect of this renewed legislative framework as too much delay has already been taken on the aim of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge based economy.
In this respect, I can only support the report of Mrs. del Castillo Vera and its emphasis on improving the European research and innovation environment.
More specifically, I would like to welcome the focus on the potential of small and medium size innovative enterprises for achieving Lisbon agenda's objectives as well as the demand to foster public and private funding to optimise Community's financial support.
Finally, I it is worth underlining, according to Mrs. del Castillo Vera own-initiative report, that there is indeed an urgent need to better harmonise the coordination and the cooperation between the different national strategies if we really want to raise Europe's growth and employment potential.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0206/2006) by MrÂ CalabuigÂ Rull on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy (2006/2003(INI)).
Â Â  . Madam President, before I begin my speech, please allow me to make a brief reference to the serious accident that took place yesterday in Valencia and that cost the lives of 41 people.
As some Members know, I was born in and I live in the city of Valencia and I would therefore like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences and solidarity to all of the families of the victims of this tragic accident and wishing all of the injured a speedy recovery.
The fact is that a drama on this scale is incomprehensible in the present day, and I hope that the specific causes of this accident will be fully clarified so that no other family ever has to experience such a tragedy.
With regard to the report that we are debating today, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission, in particular Commissioner Verheugen and his team, on the Communication that they have presented on the future of the manufacturing industry.
In view of the challenges we are facing, we cannot remain passive or take a defensive position, but we must also recognise that the invisible hand of the market is not going to provide a sufficient response.
An initiative that puts industrial policy back on the table and promotes the conditions necessary to safeguard the European Union's manufacturing industryâs future is therefore an appropriate one.
Europe's aspiration must be to remain a great industrial power and it must not be content simply with developing the services sector, whose future is often intimately linked to the existence of a solid industrial base.
The Member States and the regions must not therefore wait until times are critical, with the irreversible consequences for industry that that entails, before taking action.
We are not talking today about a policy of subsidies for great industrial dinosaurs; that model represented a bottomless pit for public resources and hindered the creation of new opportunities for creating stable jobs with futures.
The European manufacturing industry is facing several important challenges all at the same time, such as enlargement, globalisation and relocations.
There is no question, however, that the Unionâs greatest challenges are coming from the outside, in particular those resulting from globalisation and specifically the competition from the emerging Asian countries.
These challenges mean that we must change mindsets and take advantage of new opportunities.
The present industrial structure of the European Unionâs economy as a whole does not put us in the best position to confront the current process of globalisation.
The European Unionâs trade is still concentrated in medium and high technology and low or intermediate personal qualifications, which exposes the European Union to competition from producers from emerging economies.
Our competitive advantage must come from knowledge and quality, and not low prices.
However, that often means sectoral adjustments with social consequences.
Although responsibility ultimately lies with the private sector, these consequences must be dealt with through specific resources, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
This Communication recognises that the use of the different industrial policy instruments needs to be adapted to the context and the specific characteristics of each individual sector.
The Commission also proposes seven new extremely important cross-sectoral policy initiatives: increasing the protection of intellectual property rights and combating counterfeiting, the creation of a high-level group on competitiveness, energy and the environment and support for access to new markets for our products in a fair and reciprocal fashion.
This new policy must be complementary to the work done in the Member States and, in this regard, we have advised that it will be necessary to do more work on the problems faced by the new Members.
This new approach must seek consensus, involving key agents, social interlocutors and Member States in the process of political decision-making at an early stage.
The new industrial policy must promote investment in peopleâs qualifications and equipment so that people can adapt to change and take advantage of the new opportunities that it offers.
Training and flexibility are precisely the Unionâs most important resource and competition parameter.
We are talking about competition based on R+D, on innovation, quality and design, on infrastructures, on new ways of organising production and on investment in pioneering sectors.
These measures are urgent, since European industryâs competitors are moving quickly in that direction.
I would like to end by stressing the need to increase the transfer of knowledge and the application of the results of research to new products and processes.
Technological platforms are of particular importance for this objective, which are a model that has led to successes but that must find mechanisms to give SMEs access to the results of the technological platforms and to apply the latterâs innovations.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful to the rapporteur, MrÂ Calabuig Rull, for his report, which accurately reflects the intentions of the Commission and also gives a fair and appropriate assessment of them.
We are, then, united in our opinion that Europe must and will remain a strong location for industry.
Industry still remains a decisive economic factor for Europe, although it is no longer the only one.
Manufacturing industries directly employ 34Â million people in Europe and produce three-quarters of all the goods exported by the European Union; more than 80% of all expenditure on research and development by the private sector in the EU comes from industry, and of course a large proportion of all services depends upon it being strong and competitive.
Indeed, we in Europe have no reason to feel ashamed.
The competitiveness of European industry is outstanding in many areas, and it is not as if we had fallen behind in this sector.
There are some areas in which competition has become harder and where we are having difficulties, but in an astonishing number of areas Europe is a world leader and also a leader in terms of technology.
When we tabled our proposal on industrial policy for the 21st century, we agreed that we must not fall back into times of state control, bureaucracy and interventionism, but that we need to enhance the conditions for industrial activity in Europe to such an extent that Europe remains, or becomes, an attractive location for industry.
This implies a definite renunciation of protectionism and state intervention, but also a firm offer of help in promoting and developing more competitiveness.
The different horizontal and sectoral initiatives that the rapporteur has already mentioned bring us closer to this objective.
I would in particular like to point out that some of the horizontal initiatives that the Commission proposed last year have in the meantime become very important topics, for example, increasing capacity for innovation, defending intellectual property rights or also access to third markets a major topic that is currently being discussed in the Doha round.
I would in particular like to draw your attention to the importance of better lawmaking for modern industrial policy.
If any sector of the European economy complains about too much bureaucracy and too many long-winded regulations, then it is this one.
As you know, we have taken up this cause with great care.
I should also like to reiterate that the purpose of the current review of Community law is not to reduce any standards, for example, less environmental protection or less consumer protection; instead, it is intended to make the rules as effective and as modern as possible, in order to reinforce the competitiveness of our businesses.
I fully share the rapporteurâs opinion on the problem of qualifications, and I am very grateful that he has highlighted this so clearly.
For the future of the manufacturing industry in Europe it will be more and more important to have sufficiently qualified workers at our disposal.
In some Member States we already have a qualification problem, and part of the unemployment in Europe is due to the fact that certain qualifications are not available where they are actually needed.
On this issue, too, further coordinated activities will most certainly be necessary on the part of the European Union and the Member States as well.
Â Â  . â Commissioner, I hope this debate will make the Commission pay greater attention to the importance of the various industrial sectors in the EU, and to its vital contribution to the creation of wealth and jobs.
Consequently, investment must be made in strengthening existing companies.
Importance must be attached to the most vulnerable industrial sectors and to the consequences of the liberalisation of world trade, which are already being felt.
There can be no continuation of a policy of negotiations within the World Trade Organisation that overlooks the various industrial sectors, jobs with rights, regional development and economic and social cohesion.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sought to warn about these issues in the opinion that I am presenting and that the majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy took into account.
I wish to emphasise the need to protect the workers whenever manufacturing companies are restructured, including ensuring that the workers are kept fully informed and given a decisive influence throughout the process.
Â Â  . â Madam President, I would first of all like to thank MrÂ CalabuigÂ Rull for his fine and result-oriented cooperation, and would also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Verheugen, as the proposal submitted by the Commission is most serviceable, indicating a new direction for industrial policy.
Our group supports the draft resolution of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy; we helped to produce it and it reflects our own opinions.
On the other hand, we will be requesting split votes for some of the amendments, where the powers of the Member States are encroached on.
This is a danger we will not countenance.
The Commission does not have sole responsibility: the Member States themselves are also responsible for many areas, and they must discharge these responsibilities.
For us, modern industrial policy is a means to ensure that Europe remains an attractive location, and to safeguard competitive conditions in the context of globalisation.
Competitive industry is indispensable if the services sector is to be reinforced, as MrÂ CalabuigÂ Rull has pointed out.
Industrial policy therefore forms the basis of, rather than a hindrance to, efforts towards opening up new markets in the services sector.
Industry, characterised by high quality standards and technological advances, was and still is the motor of economic development in Europe, and all measures concerning the environment and climate protection must be judged in terms of energy policy, to see whether they contribute to improving the framework conditions.
Of course, when we say that the Member States bear the responsibility for many measures, then we must consider whether we do not go too far in certain respects.
Better coordination: yes, European responsibility: no, sectoral groups of experts: yes, competence and strategy plans for enterprises and regions: no, employee participation: yes, but general veto rights for works committees: no.
I am convinced that if we follow these examples we can further improve MrÂ CalabuigÂ Rullâs report, and, all told, that together with the Commission we can work out a serviceable instruction manual for future industrial policy in its relation to other policy areas.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks go to the rapporteur for an excellent report, which we support.
Do we really want to become the leading knowledge-based economy in Europe and indeed the world, or do we prefer to try and get by by staying with the old ways, with the help of subsidies?
That is the question.
Even the old industrial sectors can thrive and be competitive if there is financial support for their modernisation.
For example, training and innovation can help procure a good workforce for the future.
Nokia is a good example.
Did you know that many years ago Nokia was a well-known manufacturer of shoes and boots?
It is a long way from shoes and boots to the mobile phone.
In the accelerating and ever more fiercely competitive global economy, European competitiveness can only be maintained by investing in research, development and innovation.
We are all agreed on that, but it just is not happening.
However, competitiveness has also been sustained through untenable means, such as mass layoffs and sudden moves in production.
It is as if we had come to a lake and fished it empty and then moved on to another lake and fished that one empty as well.
This sort of European overfishing cannot be thought of as a wise move.
Employees in companies are flexible, and in many countries very flexible indeed, but the lack of any protection in non-manual work acts as a brake in an innovative society.
Job satisfaction and employeesâ ability to cope are important, and they can help to ensure that we have an effective and lasting workforce.
According to the latest report by Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, job-related stress has increased, and it has done so continuously in recent years.
The result is absenteeism though illness, a drop in work efficiency and even people allowing themselves to be excluded from the job market.
Especially worrying is the fact that the demands of work have grown, especially in the female-dominated sectors.
If the Chinese work themselves to death, we should at least work with a smile.
Â Â  .
Thank you Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a widely-held belief that the future of European development largely depends on the ability of society and the knowledge-based economy to deliver results, but we often sadly underestimate the fact that, as part of this ambitious outlook, we need to draft, relaunch and enhance an entire policy relating to the sectors, including the traditional sectors, of our production and of the European productive system as a whole, from agriculture to services, and from the core businesses of the manufacturing sector to construction.
There cannot in fact be an economy based solely on intangible networks, information and software without a solid foundation of manufacturing, producing primary goods, ranging from finished products to machinery, and from essential goods to luxury goods.
An economic system is solid if it enables all of its production sectors to grow economically and if it is able to provide these sectors, including traditional production sectors, with ever stronger and more robust injections of technological innovation in processes and products; if it is able to introduce huge amounts of research, diversification and the ability to keep up with new developments, thus maintaining our position in the world market and defending the size of Europe's balance of trade.
As you said, Commissioner, the support given by the Commission and the Member States to their strategic sectors is not dirigisme or public interventionism, policies that have been superseded in the integrated market and in the European and global free markets, but it is the ability to promote industrial policies that can cope with, anticipate or manage changes, that can create an attractive environment for international investments and that, in short, can manage the many crises in the European productive system and cope with future challenges.
Two new developments have been highlighted by the rapporteur and by the other speakers, which I too would point out: finally, after years in which it seemed that the sectoral approach had been largely surpassed, we are beginning to realise once again that we need to understand what is really taking place in the strategic sectors in our Europe.
As regards the other aspect, an industrial policy is understood to mean an integrated policy, which requires integrated, practical measures, but this policy must also be designed â and this is where we call on the Commission to make an extra effort â by bearing in mind all of the various aspects: purely industrial aspects, research aspects, energy aspects and commercial aspects.
We are well aware that, in order to tackle the global market, we must equip ourselves with more and more resources and give impetus to the Commission's work, too, as we have seen done for the textile sector and other sectors.
Yet, all of my fellow Members from the various countries of Europe know that what struck the textile sector, that is to say, that kind of whirlwind of extremely low-cost production originating from certain parts of the world, may strike yet other production sectors that are important for Europe.
We therefore call for an effort to be made along these lines; we call for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, too, to take account of this aspect relating to sectoral restructuring, to the ability to help workers retrain for new jobs and to the professional skills that are of use to an integrated system that is able to innovate, as my fellow Members have also said.
Next, I should like to refer to small and medium-sized enterprises: we all know that Europe's production structure is based on the reality of these businesses, which is not only a reality in terms of production but a reality that revitalises the regions and gives impetus to regional policies.
I want to say to you, Commissioner, that this Commission is the one that we value, one that is not passive in the face of Europeâs problems and changes, but able to perform a strong coordinating role.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the weaknesses in the Commission's draft cannot be laid at MrÂ CalabuigÂ Rull's door: in our view, the real weakness is the fact that this framework does not yet have a strategic outlook.
In our opinion, and in this I agree with the previous speaker, a successful strategy would need to be based on clarifying the interaction between industrial, regional, competition, trade and, last but not least, environmental policies.
In connection with our complaints about these analytical weaknesses, we are concerned by the fact that industrial policy is determined by high level groups that have recently been springing like weeds from the soil of Brussels but that are dominated by a few large industrial companies.
We see one problem with this as being that democratic controls are being weakened in this field, and another as the virtual lack of any say whatever in these high level groups for small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ 50% of all workers in the processing industry.
Where industrial businesses in Europe have failed in recent years because they were unable to innovate, that was certainly not always due to poor policies, but down to the fact that certain business leaders have completely failed to recognise their workersâ potential for innovation, or the need to innovate at all.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, on the face of it, this report contains a number of sensible ideas: it talks about the crucial role of industry in a modern economy, even though, for years, the myth of a post-industrial society focused entirely on services has prevailed.
It calls for the negotiations conducted within the WTO to take into account the specific characteristics of each sector, or the specific problems of each Member State, which is something of a cultural revolution but which will never be applied by the Commission, for which the European Union represents a single entity.
The report demonstrates confidence in the bilateral agreements when it comes to settling the problems of market access encountered by your manufacturers, particularly in emerging countries, and the application of the principle of reciprocity in respect of international trade. This runs counter to the belief in multilateralism that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions in this House.
The report is very sparing in its criticism of unfair competition and counterfeiting, against which Brussels fights so half-heartedly.
This is indeed all true but, in essence, it is just meaningless talk, and nothing has changed.
The European Parliamentâs report, like the Commissionâs communication, still proposes the same timeworn and disastrous formulas.
The standard policy of competition and liberalisation, for example of the energy market, efforts to mitigate the effects of globalisation, which is regarded as inescapable and, in essence, beneficial to shareholders, the modernisation of intellectual property law, the symbol of which is the software patent â which was rejected by users and SMEs in the sector - and the simplification of legislation, such as the REACH Directive - that 1Â 200-page convoluted text that is jeopardising the European chemical industry.
This is the usual litany of policies that have been conducted for years, with the aim of making people believe that what is required is a European industrial policy that is not provided for by the Treaties and, above all, with the aim of preventing the Member States, when faced with the resulting de-industrialisation and social disintegration, from taking matters into their own hands.
Â Â  The debate on this report is suspended.
The remaining speakers will have the opportunity to take the floor this evening.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0312/2006).
We will take the following questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . The Commission believes that the result of the Premier League media rights auction, which was carried out in compliance with Commission Decision 38173, will have beneficial effects for English football fans.
The longstanding monopoly of BSkyB concerning the broadcasting of live Premier League matches has ended as a result of this auction.
In the auction BSkyB acquired four packages â 92 live matches â and Setanta acquired two packages â 46 live matches.
Setanta has now emerged as a viable competitor and will be able to exercise both commercial and pricing pressure on the former monopolist BSkyB.
The choice for English football and sports fans has also improved.
Setanta is now in a position to offer an attractive alternative sports programme, including live Premier League matches.
The Commission acted in full compliance with EC competition rules and to the benefit of English consumers.
It remains to be seen whether costs for consumers will indeed increase.
In a market where at least two players are present, individual operators will have to consider carefully whether they can continue to raise prices for their packages without losing customers.
It is also far from certain that the acquisition by a single operator of all live Premier League rights would have led to lower costs for English football fans.
In the absence of any constraints from competition, it is not impossible that a single operator would have raised the prices for its sports services without compensating for the increase in price by increased choice, as is now available.
The Commission also notes that English football fans who last season wished to watch more than the 88 live matches offered by BSkyB in its basic sports package also had to sign up for a second subscription channel from BSkyB, Prem Plus.
The concept of two separate subscription channels is therefore not a novel one for football fans in the UK.
Â Â  This is quite an exciting question for some of us.
This is not really an issue of dealing with monopolies, because we support the Commission on this prime objective.
The issue in this case is that I have a constituent who has disability problems; he watches television and wants to watch just one subscription channel.
I put it to the Commissioner that we might have something of a law of unintended consequences here.
You have tried to do the right thing in dealing with a monopoly, BSkyB, but in fact, with Setanta, you have created a situation in which my constituents will have to pay two subscriptions to watch the same amount of football.
Is that something that the Commission could investigate?
Â Â  . The question is quite clear.
One of our principal objectives was to end BSkyBâs longstanding monopoly concerning the broadcasting of live Premier League matches and I think that this objective has been achieved.
In particular Setanta has now emerged as a viable competitor to BSkyB and will be able to exercise commercial and pricing pressure on BSkyB.
The sale of the live TV rights to two rival broadcasters already provides consumers with a greater choice than before.
How much of an impact this will have will depend on the commercial strategies of BSkyB and Setanta.
It is far too early to say whether the level of competition that this has introduced will be enough.
However, given the position of third parties and of the national authorities, if the consumer does not benefit from the FA Premier Leagueâs current process, it is inevitable that there will be more discussions at national level about these issues in the future and that would be the time to deal with the Premier League.
The Commissionâs Article 9 decision cannot and should not prevent this.
As the honourable Member is aware, not all the competition problems have been resolved, nor would I want the decision to be used against national authorities or courts should they wish to intervene further.
I am extremely grateful for the efforts, help and support of the OFT and Ofcom in this case.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner, on this auspicious evening for German â or possibly Italian â football.
Can I ask if you are serious?
Trying to break up the TV monopoly over premiership football has been a complete dogâs breakfast.
As a football fan, I still have absolutely no choice.
I have to subscribe to BSkyB another channel if I want to follow my team.
Does the Commission appreciate that buying a random collection of football matches is not what 90% of people want?
They want to follow their team.
Why have you cut up the cake in the way you have?
It should be cut up so that I can choose to watch my teamâs matches, not get a couple of them and twenty matches I do not want to watch.
Will you look at this again?
Â Â  . I shall answer the first question.
Am I serious?
Yes, I am quite serious.
I am aware that sometimes that type of decision is not welcomed by all the honourable Members, but I am also aware that I need to fulfil my responsibility.
I take the concerns expressed by British consumers and by the honourable Members very seriously, because I wish to reduce costs and increase choice for consumers, not the opposite.
However, I also believe that the result of the Premier League auction will have beneficial effects for English football fans in both the short and long term.
Consumer welfare cannot be measured solely by considering the position of a person who wants to watch all the matches of one specific team.
British sports fans will now have the opportunity to view a significant number of the live Premier League matches and other sports through Setanta, which offers seven channels at the moment, including, for example, live Scottish football, live European football and live rugby.
They will be able to do so without having to subscribe to Sky Sports, an option which previously did not exist.
It is also worth noting that, according to press reports, Setanta is considering showing matches via a pay television service on the digital terrestrial platform Freeview, which would make Premier League matches available on digital terrestrial TV for the first time, so that is really something to offer.
Â Â  â Commissioner, multinational companies have had their sights on television broadcasting rights to sports events for many years, as have, recently, subsidiaries of the large sporting federations.
The arrival of subscriber television in the life of citizens has radically changed its social role.
Now, among other things, citizens are obliged to pay in order to enjoy sporting events and mobile telephony and the Internet are knocking at the door of this new phenomenon.
How is the Commission addressing this onslaught?
Does this mean that citizens without the necessary subscription should be denied access to the Olympic Games, world cups and international events?
Finally, what is being done about the list of sports which the Member States must propose and notify to the competent committee of the European Union, for which broadcasting on free rather than subscriber television is mandatory?
Â Â  . I should like to underline once again that, when considering the application of EC law in the context of sport, it is important to draw a distinction between sport insofar as it generates economic activity and sporting rules as such.
Insofar as sport generates economic activity, it is subject to EC law, including the internal market and competition rules in the same way as other economic activities.
So far so good!
Of course, as reflected in the Nice Declaration, the Community takes account of the inherent social, educational and cultural aspects of sport when taking action under the Treaty.
The Commission has followed this line in applying EC competition rules in individual cases and this approach has been confirmed by the European courts.
When engaged in economic activity, sport governing bodies should, like any undertaking, ensure compliance with EC competition rules.
I said that not all competition problems have been resolved, nor would I want a decision to be used against national authorities or courts should they wish to intervene further.
It is clear that competition in itself creates economic activity; this makes competitors more alert and that is beneficial for the consumer and, in most cases, results in more diversity, more quality and a better price.
Â Â  . Following the referendum of 21Â May 2006, which was conducted according to international standards and resulted in the victory of the pro-independence vote, the subsequent declaration of independence by the Montenegrin Parliament, as well as the reaction of the European Union at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 June, Montenegro and the European Union are now in the process of establishing diplomatic relations.
The Commission intends to submit a proposal to the Council shortly, requesting authorisation to negotiate with Montenegro a Stabilisation and Association Agreement based on the negotiating directives of 3Â October 2005, which concerned the former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.
In the same context, I would like to inform the House that we shall present a modified negotiating mandate for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia.
Both countries, Montenegro and Serbia, have a concrete European perspective, like the other countries of the western Balkans.
Here the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first stepping stone, while the ultimate goal of this process is EU accession at a later stage, when each of the countries is able to fulfil the necessary conditions.
This European perspective of the Western Balkans was confirmed by the European Council in the middle of last month.
The Commission will intensify its monitoring of developments in Montenegro, which will now have to face, on its own, all the responsibilities of its relationship with the European Union, including implementation of the European Partnership and the need to substantially strengthen its administrative and institutional capacity.
This autumn the Commission will issue a separate annual report for Montenegro, which will include specific recommendations for the way ahead in the country.
Montenegro, like other countries in the region, will benefit from assistance under the forthcoming pre-accession financial instrument as of 2007.
Finally, the Commission intends shortly to open an office in Montenegro, which will be responsible for dialogue with the authorities and with civil society, the monitoring of reforms and the implementation of the financial instrument for pre-accession.
Â Â  I should like to correct you, Madam President.
You said that the question concerns the âproblemâ of Montenegro.
I believe it is a challenge rather than a problem.
I am delighted to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission is considering opening an office in Podgorica.
I welcome that initiative very much.
Does he feel that this would be helpful in promoting tourism in Montenegro?
I believe that the Adriatic coastline there offers great opportunities.
He spoke about possible membership of the European Union.
Has he any idea of the timescale?
What sort of period would he like to see before an application for EU membership came from Montenegro?
Â Â  . The question by the honourable Member is extremely pertinent and important, especially from the point of view of the Republic of Montenegro and its citizens.
The primary duty of the European Commission office in Montenegro will be to promote European integration and to promote the relationship between Montenegro and the European Union.
Thus indirectly it will certainly help to facilitate such economic and social development, including the development of tourism activities that will benefit the country and citizens in time.
As regards forecasting when Montenegro might be able to meet all the conditions of accession and thus accede to the European Union, I will leave that to the betting agencies.
From the point of view of the Commission and the European Parliament it is more important that they ensure the quality of the accession process rather than its speed.
We have to emphasise substance more than schedule when we talk about accession negotiations or the pre-accession phase as now faced by the Republic of Montenegro.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I would just like, once again, to ask you to make it absolutely clear that Montenegro has exactly the same prospects for accession as all the other countries in the region under the Thessaloniki Declaration, and that, with particular regard to the issue of minorities, Montenegro has an exemplary policy in this domain.
Secondly, I would just like to ask what the situation now is with regard to Serbia.
With whom are you negotiating â the former federal level, or the former republic level in Serbia?
Â Â  .
The honourable Member raises a very critical question.
I can assure him and all of you that the Republic of Montenegro has the same prospects for the ultimate goal of EU membership as the other countries of the western Balkans.
It is therefore in the same position as all the countries of that region.
Minority rights are a critical condition.
They concern all the countries of the region and we are stressing the need for minority rights to be respected in all the countries in that region, as well as in other candidate countries.
That is mentioned in our report, which will be presented next autumn, most likely in October or November.
As regards the level of negotiations with Serbia, until recently we had negotiated with Serbia and Montenegro at two levels, on the basis of the twin-track approach, with the State Union on the issues that fell within the competence of the State Union and with the two republics on the issues that fell within the competence of the two republics.
Now we want to consolidate the substance of the negotiations achieved so far.
Once the Council has adopted the new negotiating mandate for Montenegro and the modified mandate for Serbia, we can continue the negotiations on the basis of this consolidated result â in the case of Serbia, of course, once it is cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
This method minimises any technical disruption, and with Serbia, for instance, we can resume the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement immediately once Serbia is cooperating fully with the ICTY.
Â Â  . As the Commission confirmed on 17 May 2006, it has indeed recently carried out on-the-spot inspections of a number of major energy companies in Europe.
It is not possible to comment further on these ongoing investigations.
As you are aware, inspections are carried out under Articles 20 and 21 of the EC regulation and form a normal part of the Commissionâs enforcement activities in the competition field.
In general, inspections are carried out because the Commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated the anti-trust rules established in Articles 82 and 81 of the Treaty.
Article 28 of the regulation prohibits the Commission from disclosing information acquired during an inspection, except in limited circumstances.
However, as required by Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, the Commission publishes all its decisions in due course.
The Commission is also carrying out a sectoral inquiry into competition conditions in the EU gas and electricity markets.
This is a distinct exercise from the individual investigations and inspections to which the honourable Member refers, but the extensive information about the functioning of the energy markets that is gathered during the sectoral inquiry will of course help to inform any enforcement action taken by the Commission in individual cases.
The main preliminary findings of the sectoral inquiry were published in February 2006 and identified a number of existing barriers to competition.
For example, national wholesale energy markets are still highly concentrated, with few new competitors entering the sector.
There is also far too little integration between the national markets.
Infrastructure and supply functions are so closely connected that it is difficult for new suppliers to enter the market, which means that consumers are denied choice.
There is a lack of transparency, so new competitors also cannot get hold of the information.
They need to get a foot in the door.
Finally, prices do not appear to respond to changes in supply and demand.
Tackling these problems will require a combination of regulatory and structural reform and robust enforcement of competition rules.
The Commission is committed to taking any necessary enforcement action if that proves justified.
The sectoral inquiry will be completed by the end of the year.
The Commission will then decide whether any further measures are required in order to improve competition conditions in the gas and electricity markets.
The information gathered through the sectoral inquiry will also play an important role in the ongoing formulation of a common European energy policy, as agreed by the spring European Council.
The Commission is also conducting a review on implementation of the European regulatory measures in the energy sector.
This work is being led by the Commissioner in charge of energy, Mr Piebalgs, and the Commission will report to Parliament and to the Council at the turn of the year.
That report will also reflect on any further action that is needed to complete the integration of Europeâs energy markets.
All the information gathered during the sectoral inquiry and the review of implementation of the liberalisation directives, together with other information received through consultation with the stakeholders, will of course play a key part in the formulation of a common European energy policy.
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Commissioner, even though you were unable to go into any specific details about the investigations.
With your permission, my additional question will also be of a general nature.
Like you, I believe that there may be problems with the development of the internal energy market.
My question is: will competition policy instruments be sufficient to resolve these problems in the future, or does the Commission feel that it may be necessary to set up a European energy regulation body, which would obviously deal primarily with cross-border transactions?
Thank you very much.
Â Â  . The honourable Member rightly touched upon the question of whether this is enough.
I have explained to the honourable Member that the Commission has already initiated a number of investigations where it appears that anti-competitive behaviour contributes to the problems identified by the energy sector inquiry.
However, competition law cannot open markets by itself, as the Member will be aware.
We need to complement our enforcement through an improved legal framework, increasing transparency, improving cross-border coordination, etc.
Regulatory changes may be needed for us to reap the full benefits of our energy markets.
Once we have the full report of the inquiry into competition conditions in the energy sector, we will reflect further on what changes may be required.
My colleague, Mr Piebalgs, is looking at the level of current implementation of the existing liberalisation directives in the energy sector.
Depending on the results of that review, further measures to liberalise the markets will be considered.
Full structural unbundling is one option to consider.
The Member will certainly conclude that we will take measures when we can see that there is something rotten in the state.
Â Â  â Commissioner, at the moment, energy trading, and particularly energy imports, generate high profits at international level.
Discussions are currently underway regarding reinvesting these profits in Europe, which would mean OPEC, Russia, and perhaps China too in the near future, cornering the European market.
What is your view of this future situation with respect to competition?
To give a practical example, Gazprom is buying up the larger energy companies in Europe.
What action will the Commission take in this respect, in order to safeguard the security of our energy supply in future?
Â Â  . As the honourable Member rightly mentioned, there has been quite some change to the whole energy market scene.
Europe needs stable relationships with the main producers outside the EU too.
However, this does not and must not prevent us from ensuring that there is an integrated, competitive market within the EU.
An open and competitive, flexible and interconnected single EU market will guarantee a secure energy position for the future as it will make the European market attractive to external suppliers; so that is all part of the game.
Such a market will also be open to embracing new energy mixes.
It will be able to muster the internal strength needed to master the international challenges in this field.
Â Â  Question No 37 will not be taken, since it deals with a subject that is already on the agenda for todayâs sitting.
Â Â  Since they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
How does the Commission assess the situation in Russia with regard to human rights and prison conditions, in particular for the prisoners Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky?
What comment can you make to us about human rights violations in the Russian Federation and how do you assess the situation for prisoners in Russia in this regard, in particular for Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky?
Â Â  . The Commission follows the human rights situation in Russia very closely and, through the EUâs political dialogue with Russia, as well as the regular human rights consultations, we are able to raise issues relating to democracy, human rights and the rule of law with Russia.
We have raised concerns about the situation of prisoners in Russia in the human rights consultations and we have reminded the Russian authorities of the need to respect internationally recognised standards.
In that respect, Russiaâs agreement to publication of the reports by the Council of Europeâs Committee for the Prevention of Torture would be a positive step forward.
With regard to the specific situation of MrÂ Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, we are aware of the concerns expressed about the judicial process â the verdict and the sentence â and their current situation.
The European Union has repeatedly underlined the need for the judicial system to be seen to operate fairly and transparently if it is to command the confidence of both the Russian population and the international community.
We will continue to monitor the issue of the prison conditions in Russia, including the situation of those two gentlemen.
Â Â  â Commissioner, many thanks for that very detailed reply.
I would just like to follow up by asking whether the Commission Representation in Moscow has already got in contact with the families of the prisoners, or whether it could do so.
Secondly, the prisoners have clearly been subjected to unjustified punishments that also contravene Russian law: penalties that could extend their sentences and imprisonment far away from their homes are both contrary to Russian law.
I would therefore just like to ask you to draw this to the attention of the Russian authorities.
Â Â  . The lawyer for these two gentlemen contacted our delegation again just last week, and we are of course in ongoing contact.
I would be pleased to take up the issue you raised in your second question, namely whether the penalties lengthening their sentences and imprisonment too far away from their families are too severe.
We will happily take that up.
Â Â  â Do you not see a connection between the examples of contempt for the freedom of the media, the restrictions on civil society in the new Act on NGOs, the human rights violations in Chechnya and the conditions under which these prisoners are being held?
The connection is that they do not actually comply with Russian law.
These men were convicted in Moscow Oblast, so they should also serve their sentences there, but after their show trial, which I witnessed myself, I do see a connection there.
If it is possible for something to be treated with contempt here, then it will be.
Â Â  . Every one of these cases must be assessed separately, for they concern very different things, all of which, of course â as you so rightly say â have to do with universal human rights and peopleâs fundamental freedoms.
However, the issue of the NGOs, for one, is very definitely being reviewed, and the legal position on them largely corresponds to that in other countries.
What matters is the manner in which the laws are applied, and that also, to some extent, is the case with the conditions under which prisoners are held; that too is very much an implementation issue, and that has to be our starting point.
Â Â  I should like to ask you about the Khodorkovsky case.
Recently Anatoly Yermolin, a deputy in the Russian Duma, spoke in the European Parliament and reminded us of the attack on Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
He was injured recently.
MrÂ Yermolin stated that only the attention of Russian democratic forces and especially the democratic countries of the West can save his life.
Do you think that the Commission is paying enough attention to that case?
Â Â  . I can confirm that the Commission will continue to follow the issue of prison conditions in Russia, as I have just pointed out, including the situation of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev.
It will do so with a view also to considering whether the EU as a whole should raise this matter at the next round of human rights consultations.
Â Â  â It was, of course, the dispute about MrÂ Khodorkovsky that was the ultimate trigger for the current energy policy situation, since it was by nationalising the energy sector and creating a monopoly in it that President Putin exerted pressure.
What I would like to know is what shape bilateral cooperation with Russia in matters of energy policy will take in the future.
Â Â  .
I can tell the honourable Member that, where energy is concerned, we are only just beginning negotiations, but we have already â at the European Summit in Sochi â addressed in no uncertain terms the important issues of transparency, reciprocity and rules that are fair to all, and these will of course form an important part of the partnership and cooperation agreement, the mandate for which the Commission has just adopted, as soon as we start negotiating with the Russians.
These basic rules will, then, have an influence, and there will be agreements specific to each sector later on.
Â Â  . Of course we very strongly deplore the critical security situation in Iraq and the situation that makes life extremely difficult for Iraqis and for the foreigners there.
We condemn all forms of violence that hamper the day-to-day life of ordinary Iraqis and prevent the country from entering into the state of peace and stability it really deserves.
The practice of hostage-taking constitutes a serious threat to the population.
Informal reports indicate that the reasons for kidnapping range from political to purely criminal motivations and there is no excuse for that.
Kidnappings are devastating for all those involved and our sympathies are extended to families, friends and colleagues and whoever is affected.
It is, however, within the competence of the Member States to pursue the individual cases of EU nationals taken hostage.
Regarding the Iraqi nationals, it is very important that Prime Minister al-Maliki tries to stop the violence through national reconciliation initiatives, although we also have to concede that the situation is not yet stable.
This is the difficult situation we are in at the moment.
Certainly paying ransoms is not a viable solution to the problem of hostage-taking in Iraq and the Commission has made it clear that it discourages such action.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for that full substantive answer, which I fully support.
I wanted to draw your attention to the kidnapping of a Member of Parliament and minister, Taiseer Najeh Awad al-Mashhandani on Saturday.
Sadly another minister, the Deputy Minister for Electricity, Mr Raad al-Hareth, was kidnapped this morning with 19 bodyguards.
As I said in my question and as you have commented, many thousands of ordinary Iraqis out of the sight of the media are kidnapped every day.
Kidnapping is a crime that leads also to child slavery, to human prostitution internationally, and to child soldiers, as well as to the miseries you have already commented on in Iraq.
I know that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which came into being in September 2003, brought out a manual which is being published this year.
I believe that this action, which only talks about several hundred kidnappings a year, is simply inadequate in the United Nations.
Can the Commissioner call upon the European Commission delegation to the United Nations, on behalf of all of us, to make very strenuous representations to strengthen the fight by the United Nations against this particularly heinous form of crime?
Â Â  . I can only say that I would indeed immediately support such action and I will instruct the Commission delegation to the United Nations to see whether more can be done.
I completely agree with you: there really are so many heinous acts there that we must all try to do as much as we can.
However, I have to repeat that ultimately, of course, this is also the responsibility of each and every Member State; but we will certainly try to support those actions that the UN has already taken.
Â Â  â Since we know that Iraq is of immense economic importance to us, in other words that it is important not only in terms of the human rights situation but also in terms of the economic situation, what, then, can the Community do to make the country more stable?
What Community programmes or cooperation programmes can be put in place to make Iraq more stable and more secure?
Â Â  . There are masses of programmes for this purpose.
The fact is that we have, ever since 2003, been working very hard to stabilise Iraq, and we have spent to date EURÂ 513Â million in doing so.
We have also, for example, set aside another EURÂ 200Â million for this year, although I have to say that the programmes are very broadly based.
There are on the one hand programmes that are run through the World Bank and UN funds and are aimed at meeting the populationâs basic needs for such things as, for example, education, health care and water.
There are also, however, programmes the primary object of which is to build up the most important ministries, those being the ministries of commerce and energy.
Provision is also being made for efforts to make Iraqi society more democratic, such as the elections and referendums, which were held under UN supervision, and for which the Commission gave financial support; we will, of course, continue to strive to make a contribution to national dialogue and reconciliation.
Another EURÂ 200Â million â which is a lot of money â has been set aside for this year.
Â Â  .
Just today, we have approved a recommendation to the Council with draft negotiating directives for a new agreement with Russia.
Following internal EU discussions, the Commission then held exploratory talks with Russia, which have now resulted in broad consensus on a general approach.
As a result of the last EU-Russia Summit in Sochi, we were able to agree on the following.
Firstly, the aim is to conclude a new, legally-binding, very broad and comprehensive agreement, which should be durable and capable of facilitating the future development of relations.
Secondly, we would agree to avoid a legal vacuum.
That means no withdrawal from the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that exists at the moment.
We are both committed to implementing the âroadmaps for the four common spacesâ.
This agreement should adopt a strategic approach to the relationship and it should emphasise that respect for common values represents an essential basis.
It should also build on the objectives of these common spaces.
In particular, we want to include the further development of our trade relations, depending on the progress of Russiaâs accession to the WTO.
Of course, as I said before we want to further consolidate the energy relationship, on the basis of the most important principles, which are reciprocity, fairness and equality.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
There are some signs that Russia is increasing the pressure in regard to energy policy.
For example, a Polish company is now buying a Lithuanian refinery, MaÅŸeikiÅ³ Nafta, and Russia has immediately started to interrupt the oil supplies.
Would it be possible during the G8 meeting in St Petersburg to pay attention to the question of energy policy?
Â Â  . It is very important to note that this energy question shows that today we have an interdependent relationship with Russia.
That means that we are an important customer for Russia.
We buy 25% of its gas, 27% of its oil and some of its uranium.
That is also highly important for Russia.
So that will certainly be one of the major questions raised during the G8 meeting with Russia.
It was also a very important and central question during the Sochi Summit.
With regard to other questions, there will be a sort of monitoring centre, which will very carefully control and check what has been done on the other side.
But I believe it is most important that first we find the right principles.
Those principles should be anchored and then we can fine-tune these questions in sector agreements and take a very concrete approach.
Â Â  During yesterdayâs meeting with the Finnish Government in Helsinki, Mr Barroso said that a free trade agreement with Russia is possible.
However, there are some governments who think that this can be achieved only if Russia becomes a full member of the WTO.
What does the Commission think about this and what is now the way forward after this initiative by Mr Barroso yesterday?
Â Â  . I have indeed said before that, in the long term, further development of our trade relations is possible, but it depends on the progress made with regard to Russiaâs accession to the WTO.
Of course, this depends first and foremost on the WTO.
Then we have to see how we take the idea of a free trade agreement forward.
It is certainly a mid- to long-term goal, that is clear.
Â Â  â Commissioner, you described the situation as regards Russia in a great deal of detail, and I am very grateful to you for that.
What I would like to know is whether you â or the Commission â think that Russia and other states in its orbit are capable of being reliable partners in the future where the supply of energy is concerned, and â since you have yourself quoted the figures â to what degree the European Union is dependent on either Russia or Ukraine.
Can we have confidence in their reliability?
Â Â  .
On the basis of the experience we have had with Russia over many years, its reliability as a partner can be taken as read, but we also have to realise that the difficulties with Ukraine were a wake-up call for us.
That is why it is so very important that we find, in future, a solution to energy supplies that is both market-based and transparent, for we in the Commission are fundamentally persuaded that, while prices must reflect the market, the adjustment of market prices, among other things, in Ukraine must happen gradually rather than overnight, and that no pressure must be brought to bear.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, the Commission does not believe that the expression âright of permanent residenceâ is necessarily a contradiction in terms since the notion of residence, which is understood to be the period during which a person lives in a place, may be long, or even permanent.
Furthermore, this notion has not been the subject of the kind of remarks suggested by MrÂ Tarabella, whether during the preparation of the text by the Commission, during the discussions on the directive at the Council or here, in the European Parliament.
As regards the second observation, the Commission notes, as a preliminary point, that, as stipulated in ArticleÂ 18 of the Treaty and confirmed by the case law of the Court of Justice, the right of residence derives directly from the Treaty for EU citizens whose residence papers serve only to acknowledge that right.
In line with that idea, one of the major objectives of Directive 2004/38/EC was to simplify the administrative formalities attached to the right of residence.
In accordance with this text, EU citizens do not have to obtain a residence permit in their Member State of residence, as simply registering with the competent authorities is enough, and this, I might add, is only required if the host Member State deems it necessary.
In that case, a registration certificate is immediately issued to EU citizens, on presentation of their identity cards or passports and of proof that they fulfil the conditions attached to the right of residence.
After five years of continuous lawful residence, EU citizens obtain permanent right of residence, which is no longer subject to any conditions, and, if they should request it, the host Member State must send them a document attesting to this right.
To conclude, as the same Directive 2004/38/EC also stipulates, the Member States, acting in accordance with their legislation, shall issue to their citizens an identity card or passport indicating their nationality or, as the case may be, renew such documents.
It follows that a host Member State may not issue identity cards, in the strict sense of the word, to nonÂ national EU citizens.
These citizens must always have their identity cards, or passports, as issued by their countries of nationality. These should refer, as stipulated, to their identities and nationalities and, if required by the host Member State, citizens should have a certificate, issued by the latter, stating their right of residence.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that information.
I wanted to speak on behalf of the many non-Belgian citizens of the European Union who live in Belgium, and in some cases have been doing so for several decades, who have built their careers and their professional and family lives there and who â although you have replied to me on this matter â actually find the term 'residence' shocking, because they are not âresidingâ: they have chosen that country, which is their host country and will continue to be so until the day they die.
What may appear shocking, in fact, is that, when these citizens board a plane in Belgium to go to another country in the Union, the document granted to them cannot be used as an identity card, and they are asked for their passports.
Â Â  Madam President, this situation, which has been described as âshockingâ, is certainly one of the consequences of the application of this directive.
Clearly we are also pursuing what you rightly define as âconcrete casesâ; and I assure you that if we were to establish that there had been violations in the implementation of this directive â which not all Member States have transposed into national legislation â we should exercise the powers that the Commission has in such cases.
Â Â  . The Commission is convinced that the moment has come to make full use of the possibilities offered by the current Treaties and particularly bridging clauses.
That will set in place the conditions necessary for reaching our goals in the interim period before the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty.
However, the Commission can confirm that it is on the whole ready to contribute to the debate on the use of the bridging clauses as shown by covering this matter in the political review of the Hague Programme presented on 28 June.
Initial reactions from the vast majority of Member States have been very positive, and it came out from the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers of 27 and 28 May that most Member States endorse the Commissionâs approach as anticipated in the communication of 10 May on the future of Europe.
This determination to make progress was confirmed by the June 2006 European Council conclusions, which call upon the incoming Finnish Presidency to explore, in close cooperation with the Commission, the possibility of improving decision-making and action in the area of freedom, justice and security, on the basis of existing treaties.
However, this is clearly an issue that needs to be carefully prepared at the highest political level.
The Commission welcomes the intention of the Finnish Presidency to have an in-depth debate as the logical next step.
The Commission is convinced that Parliament will help to stimulate this debate as usual in institutional matters.
I know that President Borrell has recently again encouraged the Commission to take such a way forward.
I am convinced that it is a matter of the utmost importance for the Parliament and a unique opportunity to bring freedom, security and justice matters closer to the citizens, thus increasing the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the legislative process.
You will probably know that just yesterday the Prime Minister of Finland confirmed, at our meeting in Helsinki, his full determination and the determination of the Finnish Presidency to hold further discussions, starting with the informal Council of Interior Ministers, which will take place in Tampere at the end of the September.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Frattini.
In the six weeks since I tabled this question much has happened, especially the Frattini package of last week, if we can call it that.
I sincerely congratulate you and the Commission on that excellent package of four bold and ambitious papers.
Have you considered how we might reach out to citizens with a communication strategy to make sure that they understand the situation â not the arcane details, but that they understand, for instance, that Member States have not implemented the anti-terrorism laws?
Pressure needs to be put on their governments to translate the rhetoric into action, to achieve progress on fighting crime and terrorism and upholding human rights.
Â Â  . Yes, of course we are thinking about this communication strategy.
In my own view, the best way to show the public how important it is to abolish powers of veto is to give them concrete examples.
One such example is an initiative concerning a minimum standard with regard to procedural rights, where we are still in a stalemate after two years of discussion precisely because of the unanimity system.
Again, for example, when we talk about cross-border police cooperation, we are still blocked after 18 months of very difficult discussions because of unanimity.
These are concrete examples for the public.
Does the public think it is useful to have procedural rights or police cooperation at European level?
Then please help us.
Â Â  How do you propose to ensure all this cooperation and informing of the public, if the Commission is behind in preparing an information system, which would allow the Schengen Agreement to work in the new and old Member States, so that information can be exchanged?
In Lithuania, we have heard that the new Member States will not be able to join Schengen on schedule and the package you proposed just now will probably be difficult to implement because there is no information system in place which would hold the required data.
Â Â  . Madam President, I can only confirm what the Council of Europe stated just a few days ago: that is, our pledge to make every effort to meet that deadline of autumn 2007.
I am aware that there are some technical problems, but I am also aware of the political decision that the Council of Europe confirmed some days ago, which we are obliged to respect and to cause to be respected.
We are committed to this.
Â Â  . Competence concerning disability is generally a matter for Member States under the subsidiarity principle.
The needs of all people with disabilities are taken into account in all Community policies in order to achieve equal treatment.
These include disabled ex-prisoners.
The importance of employment opportunities for people with disabilities is well recognised and is reflected not only in the European employment strategy but also by the European Council. You will remember its conclusions of spring 2006.
In terms of other programmes, the Commissionâs disability action plan contained in its Communication COM(2005)604 outlines what has been done with respect to all people with disabilities in the European Union.
Concerning the possible competence of the European Union under the third pillar, there is currently no EU legislation governing the status of disabled persons in prisons.
That is mainly due to the fact that any action on judicial cooperation in criminal matters that aims at approximating rules applicable in Member States is, according to the available legal basis, conditional upon the requirement that such an action is necessary to improve cooperation between the Member States.
Many proposals made by the Commission provided for in the Hague Action Plan aim at facilitating the social rehabilitation of offenders, even if they are not specifically devoted to the rehabilitation of disabled prisoners.
There is, for example, a project presented by Austria, Finland and Sweden on the transfer of prisoners.
I will consider, together with my colleague Mr Å pidla, how measures undertaken or planned in this area of competence could be supported and complemented by measures that can be taken under the third pillar.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to ask a general question.
If, in accordance with the rule of law, the disabled are quite rightly obliged to respect the law like all other citizens â they can be sent to prison, for example â why do the principles of equal participation not apply to the job market?
Why are disabled people not given the full opportunity to make use of their qualifications?
Why can modern democracies not meet the standards expected of civilised societies in this matter?
Â Â  Madam President, I am well aware of these real problems.
I believe that action by Europe outside the ambit of obligatory European laws, which cannot be introduced in this area, can be offered in the context of the struggle against discrimination.
We are ready to look at any possibility, including measures that would help the social rehabilitation of ex-prisoners.
As I have said, I shall consider this with MrÂ Å pidla.
Such prisoners have been found guilty, but they are disabled and therefore face greater difficulties.
Â Â  Madam President, freedom of association is a general principle of Community law; the European Court of Justice has clearly recognised this.
There is an important article â ArticleÂ 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union â which envisages the right to freedom of association at all levels, in particular in trade union matters.
Freedom of association must therefore always be respected.
We also have ArticleÂ 137 of the Treaty of Rome, which more specifically states that its provisions shall not apply to the right of association.
What is the consequence?
There exists a freedom of association very clearly set out in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights; but the Treaty does not acknowledge the authority of the Commission to intervene, for example, against a private business that violates the right of association.
In these cases it is the task of the national authorities, and in particular the judiciary, to guarantee respect for this right.
This is clearly a matter to be resolved by the courts, simply because there is no concrete provision in the Treaty that would empower the Commission to intervene.
Â Â  â Commissioner, punitive dismissals of workers are becoming general practice.
The company Wackenhut, following the dismissal of the trade unionist Petros Kefalas, unleashed a new action against Nikos Besis, which is still ongoing.
A short while ago, I left a hearing of trade unionists who represent workers at the Opel car factory.
Over and above the individual differences which exist, Opel too is threatening to dismiss thousands of workers.
In our opinion, the new employment legislation being formulated is also creating and inflating the sails for the dismissal of thousands of workers.
What measures is the Commission taking in order to safeguard trade union representation and the application of employment legislation to job targets?
Â Â  MadamÂ President, you have excluded me from the list.
My question was included on the list.
If that is what the Commissioner wants, then I will bow to his wishes, but if it was your decision, MadamÂ President, then you should know that it is genuinely unacceptable to thus deny a Member of Parliament the opportunity to debate in this House with the Commissioner.
I would also inform you that you have not asked me to take the floor for six months now.
Â Â  That cannot be so, MrsÂ Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, for we have very often both been here for Question Time, and I know that I have very often given you the floor, since you are among those who â I am very glad to say â are very assiduous participants in it.
Nevertheless, the fact is that we can still only have questions in blocks of time, with twenty minutes per Commissioner; that is how it is laid down in our Rules of Procedure, and the second part, with questions to Commissioner Frattini, had taken us well over twenty minutes already.
It is at that point that I have to interrupt.
The questions will be answered in writing.
We have now moved on to the third part of Question Time, as the Rules of Procedure require.
I am sorry.
There is nothing intentional about this.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like simply to confirm to the honourable Member that the definition of trade union representatives and therefore their protection is a definition that exists in a large majority of Member States.
From this it clearly follows that tangible protection is feasible.
I share your general concern about dismissals carried out as reprisals against trade unionists.
In many countries the judiciary takes very firm and decisive action in such cases.
I believe that when grounds of reprisal have been ascertained, the judiciary should take particularly strong measures.
It is the only possible course of action, but such action may not be taken by the institutions of the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, we have replied to a previous written question.
I can only confirm to the questioner that we received the supplementary documentation from the complainant not long ago.
The subject is extremely complicated, in that it involves different areas of Community law.
This is why â as I have been informed â the Commission staff have not yet finished their study of the supplementary documentation.
I can assure the questioner that our intention is to speed up considerably the study of these supplementary observations and to give a definitive response, even though this is a matter of extreme legal complexity.
Â Â  â That is more or less what you replied about a year ago, that you are examining the matter.
I therefore ask you: when we have laws prohibiting the enforcement of judgments by the Greek courts vindicating workers in matters of insurance measures and payment orders, how does the Commission have the right to filibuster and procrastinate, thereby justifying the arbitrariness of the Greek Government at the expense of Greek justice?
A short while ago, in reply to my honourable friend MrÂ Toussas, you said that it was a matter for the courts.
When the law prevents the enforcement of court judgments, will the Commission again remain inert?
Â Â  Madam President, honourable Member, I wish to express my regret in this connection and can also understand your disappointment.
We started to study these supplementary documents the moment they reached us, that is to say at the end of last year, in December 2005.
Like you, I am perfectly aware that a long time has elapsed; but there are â according to what I have been told â legal difficulties that do not only concern the regulation that the complainant considers to have been violated.
There are other provisions that are affected; and I can only tell you that I shall pass on a request to the competent Directorate-General and to MrÂ Å pidla that this technical study should be considerably speeded up.
Like you, I am aware of the situation.

Â Â  â Madam President, my question is not a supplementary question on this matter; I too merely wish to express my surprise, because I had question number 54; this is my second term of office at the European Parliament and this is the first time in my experience that the list setting out the order of questions has not been adhered to as announced.
I too would like you to tell me if this is an invention of yours today or something you are being accustomed to, something you have the right to do because, if it is, then we too have no need to carefully monitor the order of questions in order to be ready to come and listen to the Commission's reply.
I thank you in advance and trust that this will not happen again, because it is an insult to us, given that we submit our questions in time and respectfully wait our turn.
Â Â  As you yourself said, that was not a supplementary question, but I really would ask you to have another look at what the Rules of Procedure say about how Question Time is organised.
It was conducted perfectly correctly, and the order of questions was not disrupted.
Those questions that cannot be dealt with orally will be answered in writing, and your Question NoÂ 54 will be one of those that gets a written reply.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to ask the Commissioner to organise evening classes for the honourable Members on what comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States and what comes within the jurisdiction of the Commission, so that the honourable Members do not have to keep asking the Commission to act as guardian on national matters.
Â Â  Madam President, my answer is simple: I absolutely will not allow myself either to request lessons or to give them to anybody, still less to this Parliament.
I am listening respectfully to what you are telling me.
Â Â  â It really is a serious matter when an honourable friend from Greece expresses herself in such a manner against her fellow Members in plenary.
Allow me to say the following, without political chitchat and with a sense of responsibility and a sense of the time which is so valuable to us all: the European Commission and the Council and numerous members on the opposite bank have very pragmatic sensory organs in their concern to address problems which have to do with employers, and the mechanisms of the European Commission and the Council and the Member States are quickly activated.
However, when it comes to the workers' problems, we see deliberate filibustering ...
Â Â  Since that is not a point of order, I shall not allow the honourable Member to speak further.
Â Â  . Following the Commissionâs reply to the honourable Memberâs question earlier this year, we have asked the Irish authorities for clarification as to the implementation in Ireland of Directive 96/71/EC.
The deadline for the submission of observations by the Irish authorities has not yet passed.
Once these observations have been received, the Commission will assess them and of course, if necessary, decide on a further course of action.
In the meantime, we have adopted a new communication concerning guidance on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services.
In this communication we have announced the adoption in spring 2007 of a report that will examine the situation in all Member States, of course including Ireland.
Â Â  Would the Commissioner agree that at this time, when migration throughout the European Union is increasing, implementation of the posting of workers directive is crucial in order to ensure that there is no race to the bottom and that migrant workers are not exploited by unscrupulous employers?
That is unfortunately what is happening in Ireland at the moment, as a result of the failure of the Irish Government to properly implement this posting of workers directive.
Â Â  Madam President, honourable Member, I certainly share your opinion that full and firm application of the directive on the posting of workers is essential.
I too am totally convinced that inconvenience to workers who are posted and transferred must be completely and fully avoided.
That is why, as has already been said, we are not confining our study to individual cases like the one that has been verified in Ireland, which we are assessing specifically; we have decided to carry out a full appraisal, country by country, of the extent to which the directive has been put into effect.
This is because, as you have said, we cannot limit ourselves to one specific case that has developed into a crisis: we must know whether and to what extent Member States are fully applying this directive, which is very important.
Â Â  On the issue of the race to the bottom, I should like to ask you to comment on the statement by the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, when he said that when enlargement happens in January, Ireland may not open the market to workers from Romania and Bulgaria, because other Member States are not so doing and because of the concerns as to what will happen to the Irish market in relation to this race to the bottom and the rights of workers.
Could you comment on that in particular, and would you urge other Member States to do what Ireland did in relation to the new Member States already here?
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only say that Ireland, which up till now has been one of the few Member States to recognise the full right to mobility of workers from the new Member States, has not encountered any particular inconvenience as a consequence of this decision.
You know perfectly well, honourable Member, that the Commission gives strong encouragement to all states â let us say the old Member States of the European Union â to open their labour markets to the new Member States of the European Union and their workers.
We have found â MrÂ Å pidla has done so in one of his documents â that the flow of workers between the new Member States and those old Member States that now permit it is not so great that it is likely to distort the working conditions and internal labour market of those countries, which also include Ireland.
I do not wish to comment on what the Prime Minister has said; but I will say that the Commission envisages that countries must recognise â even if after a transitional period, which we hope will be brief â that the citizens of the new Member States of the European Union have the right to free movement.
Â Â  The point I would like to raise with the Commissioner relates to the whole question of the transposition and implementation of directives.
One of the problems with the refusal by Member States to implement or transpose directives is the Commissionâs tardiness in taking punitive action against such Member States.
The whole process of taking effective action against those who refuse to implement Community law needs to be speeded up urgently.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Commissionâs attitude reflects its need to understand the situation before taking any decisions.
We are dealing with a complicated subject.
Next spring, when we shall have an overall appraisal of the stage reached in the application of the directive, we shall take action against those states who do not apply it or who apply it incorrectly.
This does not rule out the possibility that in individual cases, such as the one in Ireland that has been brought to our attention, the Commission will have specific powers to take action against the country if the responses given to us are unsatisfactory or if, despite the responses of the Irish Government, it emerges that there has been a violation or a non-application of the directive.
It is clear, however, that the Commission must know exactly how things stand before taking any initiatives, especially if such initiatives lead to action against a Member State.
We are talking here of a cardinal principle of the rule of law: if there is an accusation against anyone, for example a country, they must be put in a position to defend themselves before judgment can be passed on them.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner; that brings us to the end of Question Time.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
I have to say that Questions Nos 69 and 86 are not permissible and will therefore not be answered.
That concludes Question Time.
I hope you all have a good break and, to those who will have the chance to watch an exciting football match this evening, I would ask you not to get too excited about it, as there can be only one winner.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ CalabuigÂ Rull on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing â towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy (2006/2003(INI)) (A6-0206/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, in reality, in all of the debates on reports that have taken place today, we are discussing the same thing.
Firstly, the restructuring and relocation of industry and the impact of funds aimed at alleviating this situation; secondly, innovation; and now, once again, strengthening the manufacturing industry in the European Union.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no question that European industry is currently facing a process of globalisation of the economy that is making competition conditions increasingly tough.
As far as I can see, nobody doubts the fact that, the more competition there is, the better the final prices for citizens.
Nevertheless, jobs in certain European industrial sectors, in particular SMEs, are under threat as a result of structural problems that must be tackled.
The European Commissionâs Communication is an important step in terms of ensuring that the Lisbon Strategy reaches the manufacturing sector.
Europe has a high level of external openness, but Community exports mainly come from medium-level technology sectors, unlike US and Japanese exports, which are predominantly high-technology exports.
Furthermore, our specialisation indices differentiate us from our main competitors and make us vulnerable in a series of sectors.
We have recently seen, for example, textiles, footwear, furniture, construction and ceramics in this kind of disadvantageous situation.
Political and cross-sectoral initiatives are of course necessary in order to improve the conditions for this sector, in the fields of research, training, innovation, patents, access to third-country markets, combating unfair competition practices when they take place and reciprocity in external trade.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the other Members for the new ideas that they have contributed to this document.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Europeâs industrial sector is a pillar of the Unionâs economic system.
The manufacturing industry in the European Union, which accounts for a fifth of production, employs some 34Â million people; and three-quarters of exported goods are manufactured products.
We can therefore define manufacturing as the decisive factor for our economy.
For this reason I consider that the greater part of manufacturing production should remain in Europe.
This will not come about spontaneously; favourable conditions need to be created.
The basic requirements are therefore investment, research and innovation.
Although the manufacturing sector invests in research and industrial innovation, the total amount of this investment is not enough to sustain competitiveness with other countries.
More financial resources are required, and we need a European space for research and a single market for researchers.
Nevertheless, research and innovation are not sufficient to guarantee a strong European industry: we also need different policies, which should be synergistic and coherent.
I am talking about identifying international practices that are likely to have a negative impact on the competitiveness of European businesses.
The European Commission has recently published a document stating that there is evidence of serious distortions of the market, for example in the footwear sector in China â and, I would add, not only there â and the document speaks of direct state intervention in the management of businesses, specially favourable tax breaks and interest-free loans.
I am against dirigisme and protectionist policies.
Like MrÂ Mandelson, I support a free market â but a free market with rules for all, not just for some.
I request that this principle should underlie European policies, starting with international trade policies, especially when there are confirmed cases of unfair competition and counterfeiting.
Â Â  The challenges of the global economy also apply to European industry and need to be solved quickly.
I am pleased that the Commission has responded to the situation faced by EU industry and has put forward policy provisions to strengthen EU manufacturing.
Significantly, the Commission stresses that there are industrial policy problems which must be solved at European level.
These are matters of competition, common market regulation and social and economic cooperation.
In truth, we need a new approach to industrial policy.
With national and corporate competence, EU industry is expanding sectors, which use medium and high level technology and low or medium qualified labour, and therefore, is becoming less competitive when compared to countries with growing economies.
However, the implementation of a new approach requires long-term action.
Member States cannot reorganise their economies in a day.
This is particularly true for the new Member States.
In WTO talks on China's membership, the EU was represented by the European Commission which did not take into account future members' industrial situation.
Paradoxically, the EU has a common trade policy, but does not have a common industrial policy.
The textile, leather, footwear and furniture sector operations forecast in the Commission's communication are based only on research into competitiveness, the economic situation and place of manufacture, while, at a horizontal level it is forecast that these sectors will be reorganised.
However, the results of this possible reorganisation will be of use to those companies which have transferred production or to countries which do not see a future for industry in the EU.
This is demonstrated by the Commission's anti-dumping research, which aims to take into account the interests of businesses that have transferred production beyond the EU.
Meanwhile, Member Statesâ industry is left to face unfair competition.
Thus, the Commission should not prepare decisions, which contradict a communication that it has prepared itself, and implement protectionism of separate business representatives.
In addition, I urge the Commission to prepare a long-term forecast and guidelines for the competitive development of EU industry during 2030-2050.
Â Â  â Mr President, I consider the Commission's systematic and analytical approach to the matter to be very important.
I also consider that the report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has made some important points.
I shall reiterate some on which I tabled amendments and which form part of the text.
1.
Trade: this is an important link in the manufacturing chain and, together with services, demands suitable attention.
2.
Evaluation: systematic evaluation of initiatives, such as by high-level groups, innovation panels and working parties, can give us useful conclusions.
3.
Nano sciences and nano technologies: their role can be decisive for all sectors of European industry and this should be borne in mind.
4.
Primary wealth, research potential and any other comparative advantage of each area must be taken into serious account in local strategy plans.
Finally, I am sorry that the following two points which, I believe, are important, were not adopted:
Point one: I consider that it would be useful if environmental technologies were a separate sector in the 27 sectors being studied.
Point two: I consider it necessary to link training provided with the dynamic needs of the market both in terms of the number of trainees and the subject of training courses.
Finally, I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur on the seriousness with which he approached the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, it would be a tragedy if Europe confined itself to developing only the services sector.
As we all know, in todayâs environment there is an intertwining of different sectors, be they manufacturing, services or trade.
The document states that the manufacturing industry in Europe provides employment for 34 million people and 20% of EU output.
I do not think that the figures are ones to be proud of: they should be higher.
In fact, in my own country â the smallest in the European Union â the relative percentages are even higher.
However, we must welcome the positive side.
Firstly, the manufacturing industry is being seen as a generator of new innovative products; secondly, there is the development of a coherent industrial policy at European level.
On the negative side, the Structural Funds could go a long way to strengthening industry and, therefore, I disagree entirely with the cut in the amount to be allocated under the financial perspectives.
I believe that countries that are less rich can attain the 3% threshold we have set by using part of the Structural Funds themselves, which would lead in the direction of cohesion.
Secondly, more importance must be given to market access.
It is useless to have a shop with state-of-the-art equipment if you have no customers.
To conclude, we must believe in European manufacturing: it has potential for wealth and jobs.
However, we must also take decisions that are difficult: decisions to change and adapt to the new realities of the industrial environment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy and the ambitious objectives that it sets in connection with development and competitiveness, and taking account of the central role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in the European economic scene, I consider that some of the comments made by the rapporteur are of fundamental importance.
I refer in particular to the theme of complementarity between the global and the local approaches.
Like the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I acknowledge that local specialities and characteristic products and workmanship are the life-blood of the European manufacturing sector.
The value that they add stands out in the international trade scene.
The promotion of each countryâs specialities in terms of human and material resources will thus enable us to tackle the low level of certain competencies in Europe and the drain of know-how and skills away from the regions where they belong.
Taking these specialities as a starting point, we shall gradually be able to take more vigorous action against dumping in order to provide concrete support to revitalise the internal market.
Integrated strategies and action plans, such as those launched by the European Union and the United States against counterfeiting and the piracy of intellectual property, can be best put into practice through local strategic plans.
Starting with these, it will be possible to work hard to achieve the protection of all workers and their specific requirements.
This is a ongoing imperative in the regulation of European and world trade.
Â Â  Mr President, when we debate European industry there may be cause to ask the question, âwhere are our leading industries today?â
They are in those areas where we have opened up to a global economy.
Europeâs very strongest industry is to be found in those areas and in those companies that are active throughout the world.
In other words, I believe that there is reason to emphasise what has been said in the debate in this House today, namely that the European economy is more dependent than other parts of the world on the global economy.
Without the global economy Europe would not have the manufacturing industry that we have today.
It is against this background that I would like to state that there are three important points to make when we debate the future of European industry.
The first point is that competition is the best basis for innovation and for new industrial structures.
When we look back, it is indisputable that it is through being open to enterprising spirit and to entrepreneurs that Europe has seen its biggest and strongest industries rise and prosper.
Secondly, it is important for us to ensure that we open the way for the next generation of companies, be they in the manufacturing industry or the services industry, which will in any case come together in the future.
This says a great deal about what we have to do before the various free trade negotiations and the WTO negotiations.
We must not pursue a policy that involves us protecting old-established industry, which will not provide the new jobs of the future.
We must instead open the way for European companies to be active throughout the world. This means, in particular, in the global economy, where we will see a billion and then further billions of people develop into heavyweight consumers.
If Europe and European industry do not have full access to the market developing there then we will not be able to have the leading industry in the world.
We would then be condemning ourselves to the fate of becoming a regional economy.
We thus need an openness that ensures that Europe can be a world-beating economy.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is something that has to do with our future, and it is the Lisbon Agenda that clearly defines what that future is to be.
What we want is new jobs and growth, and in order to achieve those things, we need, quite simply, the worldâs markets, on which we need to be able to sell our products and services.
The Doha negotiations â which in fact have to do with the âSingapore issuesâ and aim at reducing customs duties and quotas and opening up markets â are currently undergoing a very grave crisis.
Quite naturally, or so I believe, much of our industrial policy is decided on the global market, and hence the great worry about whether the Doha round will be completed, and how things stand with Kyoto, about whether we have yet carried out all the economic analyses that will assure us that achieving the Kyoto targets really will contribute to growth and to the success of the Lisbon Strategy.
When it comes to the possibilities for investment and for the creation of jobs in Europe, we are talking here in terms of hundreds of billions.
We have spent years debating our budget for the years leading up to 2013 and have worked it out in very precise detail.
I have to be perfectly honest and say that what I find lacking where major decisions such as Kyoto are concerned is any debate on the substance.
We debated the Basel II package, which is now being implemented in Europe, although not elsewhere.
While we must, in particular, protect our own industryâs intellectual property, we must also, at the same time, use these same rights as a means to greater success internationally.
We had a debate this morning on how we might make structural improvements to our industries, and this is where the tradition of family firms, in which investment carries on from one generation to another, and which create markets in each succeeding generation, is so very important, and we must not forget these small and medium-sized businesses.
This ought to be a major consideration as we look to the future.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for a second reading by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and the Council laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and repealing Council Directive 82/714/EEC (13274/1/2005 C6-0091/2006 1997/0335(COD)) (Rapporteur: Renate Sommer) (A6-0208/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone has gone to watch the football, and I wish I were with them, since the match is being played in my electoral district in the beautiful Ruhr, but it must not be forgotten that there is something venerable about the directive that we are considering and it is to that that we must give our undivided attention, for the work of this House must not be allowed to take second place to football, even to a footballing event like this one.
As we now move to the second reading of the draft directive on the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, we are handling a relic from the previous century, for it was as long ago as December 1997 that the Commission submitted a proposal in respect of the previous directive, 82/714/EEC, which was superannuated even then, but is still in force today, and this proposalâs first reading in this House was in October 1998.
Then, on 1Â May 1999, came the Treaty of Amsterdam, and with it codecision on transport matters, and so the first reading had to be repeated in September 1999, although Parliament reiterated its position from the âfirstâ first reading â a never ending story!
A few months into the new century, in July 2000, the Commission came up with a modified draft, which took account of Parliamentâs wishes.
What is this all about?
It has to do with creating, once and for all, the same conditions everywhere for European inland waterway transport, the intention being that updated technical requirements should ensure that traffic on Europeâs internal waterways is safe and problem-free.
In order to do this, the Communityâs technical requirements had to be harmonised with the standards governing navigation of the Rhine, for safety considerations had previously led the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine not to recognise the technical approval of vessels on the basis of the former directive.
The directive to be revised â 82/714/EEC â also has other defects, among them the fact that it does not apply to passenger ships and floating plant such as construction vessels, and the safety requirements are, of course, as they were in the 1970s.
Free shipping on all the EUâs inland waterways is, however, dependent on the harmonisation of the technical requirements and safety standards with the highest standard, and that applies not only to the free movement of goods but also to the guaranteeing of high safety, environmental and social standards.
Until now, Community law has been capable of being applied only where the provisions of the Convention of Mannheim are not in force; that Convention, which was signed on 17Â October 1868, determined the principles that still largely apply today to the navigation of the Rhine, although the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine had already been constituted under an annex to the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna in 1815.
Up to now, then, the EU has been unable to adopt any legislative act applicable to the Rhine, even though 80% of all goods transported on European inland waterways travel on it.
Only since an additional protocol to the Mannheim Convention entered into force in December 2004 has the mutual recognition of shipsâ certificates been possible, and, in fact, the most important aspect of the new directive is the introduction of a standard shipâs certificate for inland waterway vessels within the EU.
That has something to do with legal certainty.
There were still a few problems with the inclusion of sports boats of between 20 and 24 metres in length, which might well fall within the scope of both this directive and the so-called sports boats directive, No 94/25/EC, although this latter directive governs trade in sports boats and is, then, an internal market directive regulating the access of sports boats to the market.
The revised directive on technical requirements for inland waterway vessels goes further than what is laid down in the sports boats directive only where safety considerations on inland waterways make this necessary, and so it does not contradict its provisions.
I might add that experience with sports boat traffic on the Rhine shows that the owners of sports boats have no problems with those rules applicable to the Rhine that are comparable to the technical regulations in the revised directive.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism took the line that the technical regulations in the annex to the directive, including those in Chapter 15, âSpecial provisions for passenger vesselsâ, which, because of protracted negotiations and long translation times are still as they were during the 2004 negotiations, should be covered by the comitology procedure.
The committee was in favour of an amendment to this effect, that being the only way in which it can be ensured that the harmonisation of the existing legal systems can be accomplished without delay and also that industry and trade be afforded legal certainty, and so I ask you to give your support to this one amendment at second reading too.
In conclusion, I would like to use this opportunity to express to the Council and the Commission, but also, of course, to my colleagues, my warmest thanks for their good cooperation on this dossier.
In thanking the House for its attention, all I can say now is âship ahoy!â
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ Sommer, whom I consider heroic for taking part in the debate at this hour, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that there is broad consensus today on the Commission's proposal, and this thanks to the political will of all of the parties and to the cooperation of the technical experts.
I want to thank you, MrsÂ Sommer, for your personal and important contribution to building this consensus.
The Community legislation harmonising the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels dates back to 1982.
This legislation provides for a certificate with which an inland waterway vessel may navigate on any EU waterway, except the Rhine.
However, two thirds of transport by inland waterway in Europe takes place on the Rhine.
Our proposal, which dates back to 1997, therefore has three objectives:
Firstly, to update the technical requirements with a view to bringing the safety of vessels in line with technological progress;
Secondly, to make it possible in the future for the Community certificate to be recognised for navigation on the Rhine;
Thirdly, to establish a comitology procedure for regularly adjusting the technical requirements in the future, in the light of technological progress and of the development of the rules in force on the Rhine.
This matter remained at a standstill for a long time within the Council because of the issue of admitting vessels with Community certificates to navigation on the Rhine.
Once this point was resolved, however, the Council was able to reach a political agreement.
The adoption of this directive will be a real step forward in terms of harmonising the rules, which is what we call for in the NAIADE action plan.
It will make it possible to implement a single system for the entire network of European Union waterways.
The technical requirements will be harmonised to ensure a high level of safety, particularly for passenger ships.
The future validity of the Community certificate on the Rhine will promote competition and will create genuinely fair conditions for river transport within the internal market.
We will maintain this level in the future, in cooperation with the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine.
As for the amendment adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we support it, and I am delighted that a compromise has been reached among the three institutions.
I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to assure you that the Commission is aware of the anxieties expressed by some owners of large recreational craft in certain Member States.
The text that you will adopt will make it possible for the majority of these concerns to be addressed.
Unlike Directive 94/25/EC, which provides for market access for recreational craft in the Community, the new directive on technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, for its part, provides for safety of navigation on all waterways.
A 20-metre long vessel warrants requirements additional to those needed simply for marketing.
Moreover, excluding recreational craft less than 24Â metres â and not 20Â metres â long from the scope of the directive would render the rules applicable on the Rhine different from those applicable on other Community waterways.
That could cause problems when it comes to recognising the Community certificate for navigation on the Rhine and could stand in the way of the idea of having a single certificate for vessels in the Community, namely the Community certificate.
Finally, the directive permits a number of derogations for existing recreational craft.
I am specifically responding to MrÂ Watson on this point, as he was the person who drew my attention to it: existing recreational craft may continue to operate provided that their breach of the requirements does not represent an obvious danger.
I would add that ArticleÂ 7 permits those Member States whose inland waterways are not connected to the waterways of other Member States to depart from all or part of this directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can, in any event, assure you that the Commission will ensure that it pays special attention in the comitology procedure to the chapter on recreational craft, in order both to prevent any contradiction of, or incompatibility with, Directive 94/25/EC and to clarify and shed light on any points that may seem unclear.
Â Â  . Mr President, as the rapporteur said in her introductory remarks, a happy outcome is worth waiting for, and she was not wrong in that.
The document currently before us, and, in particular, that which this House could â and did â contribute to it, is something that can help promote free inland waterway shipping, and that free inland waterway shipping is what we need.
If we want to make the flow of traffic through Europe more generally compatible with the environment, we need proper rules, consistent with each other, for inland waterway transport, and the Commission, in its midterm review, is quite insistent on that â Vice-President Barrot should take note of the fact that I was listening very carefully the last time.
What is called for, however, is not just one single regulation, but the interlinking of all rules applicable to inland shipping, and we must make improvements to the planning of routes, that is to say, the TENs, to the support frameworks â including Marco Polo II â and, not least, the technical rules and regulations, and must bring them up to present-day standards.
A happy outcome is worth waiting for, and our group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thanks MrsÂ Sommer, the rapporteur, for the valuable work she has done.
We hope there will be large majorities tomorrow, and will play our part in bringing them about.
We will have a few more things to do to the network.
As you have just said, MrÂ Vice-President, Naiades is the next draft act whereby we have to ensure that the opportunities are actually used and that Europeâs waterways as a whole can make a substantial and constructive contribution towards handling the flows of traffic.
What is important in this regard, particularly in relation to Naiades, is that we must not concentrate only on Western Europe: rather, especially now that the Danube is open, we must ensure that the whole European waterways network may grow together into a sound, proper and safe unity.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reference has already been made to the Naiades action programme, and that which we have not yet negotiated today will at last accord inland waterways the attention and support on the part of the European legislator that are rightfully due to them.
Today, of course, we are taking a less spectacular decision, but one that is nevertheless long overdue, in that this House, at second reading, will be agreeing to the harmonisation of technical regulations for inland vessels, thus bringing to an end a legislative process that has been going on for nine years now.
This directive adapts Community standards to the more extensive ones contained in the Convention on the Navigation of the Rhine, and this, as we see it, guarantees free competition on all internal waterways with the same high safety standards applying in every instance.
At first reading, and in the Common Position, this House and the Council made various amendments.
Like the rapporteur, to whom I am most grateful for her report, I, too, take the view that these amendments are generally acceptable and add to the original Commission proposal in a reasonable way.
We endorse the view expressed by MrÂ Grosch and MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool in their amendment on the subject, that certain types of vessel are subject to two sets of legislation, and, even though we have now been advised that the two sets of legislation are quite different, we do nevertheless think that the amendment is sound, and what we would welcome at the earliest possible opportunity is the revision of the technical annexes of the relevant directives in order to remove the duplication.
Apart from that, what both my group and I want is for the legislation to be completed without delay.
Â Â  . â Mr President, inland shipping is on the up and that is a good thing.
We in this House can do no other than heartily welcome such a substantial contribution to sustainable, safe and competitive transport through Europe, for it cannot be taken as granted that transport will be like that; it is important that the right conditions be created for it.
MrsÂ Sommer's report provides one of the necessary building blocks, for harmonised technical regulations for transit on internal waterways mean equal conditions for everyone and hence a fine, manageable and safe fleet.
What gives us cause to welcome this report with even more enthusiasm is the fact that it represents the conclusion to a process that has lasted for some ten years.
I am particularly pleased to note that relations between the institutions in the inland shipping sector have been no obstacle to this agreement, and I believe that this manifestly fruitful cooperation is being extended to other areas too.
This is something we will need to talk about later on.
Turning to the content, I am pleased to note the standards demanded of the vessels.
Even though the sector must make the necessary effort to satisfy these demands, this does indeed indicate that the quality of the fleet has gone up beyond any doubt.
In view of the potential for water-borne transport, that is both very welcome and essential.
I am also satisfied with the procedure for making further adjustments and improvements to the directive.
It is certainly not perverse to leave such a technical enterprise to the specialists.
I am given to understand that a number of proposed amendments are on the table at this very moment.
I hope that the specialists will find a solution to the possible discrepancy between this directive and Directive 94/25/EC, and I strongly support the amendment to that end.
In conclusion, I want to thank MrsÂ Sommer for her efforts.
I hope that this stage will make a positive contribution to improving transport on inland waterways.
Â Â  Mr President, passion for football, which has become a global and European passion tonight, offers me the opportunity to express my passion for Europeanism within the context of the transport sector as well.
I am speaking as a Member from a Member State, Spain, whose rivers stopped being navigable some time ago and which is suffering from a drought that is becoming structural, thereby making it less and less possible for that navigability to be restored.
I am therefore speaking as somebody with a healthy European envy of those countries that do have navigable waterways, both for passengers and for goods.
As the partner of a German, I well remember the admiration I felt when I saw the Rhine some years ago, because until then I had heard talk of river motorways, and I had even worked in that field, but I had never known what they were.
It was the impression of seeing the Rhine with such well-regulated, organised, stately and at the same time efficient traffic that taught me what we were talking about and how Europe was getting to grips with such important transport routes.
I am therefore delighted as a European that this debate is finally coming to a successful conclusion, thanks to MrsÂ Sommer and also to my colleague MrÂ Stockmann.
This will make it possible to harmonise river navigability, in terms both of social safety rules and of environmental rules, including the proposed non-reduction in those countries where that danger exists.
It only remains for me to express my hope that my city, which in 2008 will hold the international Expo on this very issue of water and sustainable development, can implement projects to restore the navigability of the River Ebro, amongst others, as a collective means of passenger transport, and naturally to promote its use for sporting and tourism purposes.
I am therefore delighted that the safety and social rules also apply.
My dream is that, in the not too distant future, goods crossing the Pyrenees from Spain into France via a central tunnel will then travel along the Canal de Midi and the network of French canals and finally to the Rhine, whose ideal and wise regulation we are today turning into European law.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, MrsÂ Sommer, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for this enriching debate. It has confirmed that the Commissionâs proposal, dating back to 1997 is as topical as ever.
I am particularly grateful to MrsÂ Sommer, your rapporteur.
Parliament is thus confirming its commitment to inland navigation, and this directive will make it easier to implement a single system for the entire network of European Union waterways.
This agreement constitutes an important stage, which is in line with our strategy for harmonising rules at European level, as is recommended by the NAIADE action plan, and it will thus help to increase the competitiveness of inland navigation within the Community.
MrÂ President, I wanted to say these few words of thanks to all those Members who kindly contributed to this excellent piece of work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for a second reading by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending Council Regulation No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation
(13376/1/2005 C6-0090/2006 2000/0069(COD)) (Rapporteur: Ulrich Stockmann) (A6-0212/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, MrsÂ Sommer has already, today, quoted the German saying according to which a happy outcome is worth waiting for, and I believe that might be the case when it comes to this legislation on EU-OPS.
I do not want to spend a great deal of time reviewing the lengthy process whereby we worked out what we want, which involved us in two first readings and various proposals from the Commission over a period of six years.
It has become clear to me that we MEPs are production line workers, and certainly many people have been working on this one.
I would like, once more, to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the good work that MrÂ Simpson did during the previous Parliament, and, in particular, for the constructive cooperation with all Members during this one.
I am also appreciative of the good work the Commission has done as a mediator, particularly that done by MrÂ Salvarani â since both he and I are being kept from watching the football today, I am grateful to him for being here â and not least for the Councilâs willingness to compromise.
The negotiations have produced a respectable result and one that adds value to Europe.
Following the liberalisation of the European air transport sector and the great enlargement of 2004, we have now at last succeeded in harmonising all those technical standards and administrative regulations that have a bearing on the safety of civil aviation, and now it is high time we took the continuing expansion of air travel into account.
The laying down of safety standards â ranging from construction to the rules on the transport of hazardous goods, by way of regulations on instruments â takes up nearly 500 pages.
Until very recently, there was controversy about sections O and Q, which deal with the training of cabin crew and the working hours, in-flight hours and rest periods of pilots, and that is not surprising, since this is where the safety issues also touch upon the social benefits of the persons concerned.
I do nevertheless think that we have succeeded, here too, in defining a provisional platform that, for many countries, amounts to a marked improvement in safety standards.
Before second reading, the Committee on Transport and Tourism made some important changes.
Firstly, we wanted to add a safeguard clause to prevent the situation arising in which, in countries with higher standards in law or in collective wage agreements, there would be an inevitable reduction in these standards with consequences for safety and for the social benefits of the personnel on board, and we succeeded in doing that.
Secondly, it became apparent from hearings and from numerous studies that cumulative fatigue in pilots as a result of inappropriate scheduling was a problem in need of further investigation even after the result we have achieved, and the Council has proposed that this problem be put back on the agenda in three yearsâ time.
We in this House do not think this is enough, and we have been able to secure a new scientific/medical study after only two years, relating to both sections, including Section O.
Thirdly, the cabin crew were, right up to the last minute, raising with us their concerns about the upgrading of their status, and I believe that our amendments do justice to that insofar as it has a bearing on safety.
In negotiations with the Council, we have managed to secure an undertaking that further harmonisation and better quality training will remain under consideration and that there will be a study into these issues too.
I too take the view that the safeguard clause is applicable to the very varied approaches taken in Europe to certification and the issue of licences, so any loss of status in individual countries is not to be attributed to our legislation.
Fourthly, when we started work on EU-OPS, no account was taken of the special situation of express freight services at night, and on that, too, we and the interested parties have arrived at a compromise that makes proper provision for their specific flight schedules while not compromising safety standards.
Let me sum up by saying, once again, that a happy outcome is worth waiting for; whether it actually will be a happy one is something that will emerge from further work on the transposition of this directive.
I ask all the groups in this House to give their support to this compromise that we have reached with the Council.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now on the point of reaching an agreement at second reading with the Council on a very sensitive proposal.
We owe this result above all to the excellent work of your rapporteur, MrÂ Stockmann, and I should like to congratulate him in particular.
Allow me to point out the approach underpinning the proposal for a regulation.
It is primarily a question of maintaining a high level of safety, while ensuring that there is fair competition among airlines.
The amended proposal of 2004 introduced provisions concerning, on the one hand, flight times and rest periods for crews, which are currently referred to as âflight and duty time limitation'. It thus complies with the request of the European Parliament, which is concerned about the national disparities in this area.
For a long time now, professional pilotsâ associations and several airlines have been severely criticising these disparities, which are detrimental to safety and to the normal forces of competition.
Indeed, many investigations conducted in the wake of accidents have identified crew fatigue as one of the factors contributing to these accidents.
The regulations on flight times are sometimes too flexible and allow airlines to have their staff on duty for too long, to the detriment of safety and of companies subject to stricter legislation.
The amended proposal of 2004 entails, on the other hand, cabin crew being certified on the basis of minimum requirements, as happens in the United States and as the employees concerned, together with part of the industry, were demanding.
These minimum requirements should make it possible to improve air safety by increasing the quality standard with which staff must comply.
They should also bring the conditions of competition for airlines in line with each other and make it easier for staff to move around within a fully liberalised air transport market.
It is true that the Council has had great difficulty in reaching an agreement, as a result of the Member States' very different points of view.
However, the Council finally succeeded in reaching a compromise on a common position at the end of February 2006.
The Council observes in its common position that the amendment tabled by Parliament has been fully taken on board, one or two slight alterations apart.
The Commission does, of course, accept this position on the part of the Council, which is willing to adopt the main elements of Parliamentâs proposal.
On certain points, relating in particular to the flight and duty time limitations of cabin crew, we simply need to carry out a scientific and medical assessment before reaching a decision on the matter.
This analysis would be entrusted to the European Aviation Safety Agency.
Since the Council adopted its common position, our three institutions have been working intensively to reach an agreement at second reading.
The common position has been clarified and improved thanks to the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, and I am particularly grateful to MrÂ Stockmann for this text.
The first improvement concerns airlines whose business is based exclusively on night-time operations.
The Commission, in agreement with Parliament, feels it necessary to assess the consequences in terms of safety and fatigue of the provisions concerning flight and duty time limitations and rest periods.
On the basis of this assessment, the Commission will table those amendments needed to take account of these specific operating models.
The second improvement concerns the scientific and medical assessment of the provisions relating to flight and duty time limitations and to cabin crews.
This assessment will be carried out by the European Aviation Safety Agency.
I can confirm that I have already asked the European Aviation Safety Agency to include this assessment in its 2007 work programme, with a view to preparing some draft measures for submission to the Commission.
On that basis, the analysis period can actually be reduced to two years, MrÂ Stockmann, as Parliament is proposing.
The Commission will issue a statement to shed more light on the nature of these studies, particularly in relation to the conduct and training of cabin crew in emergency situations.
Finally, my third point is that the Commission proposal is designed to lay down minimum harmonised safety standards, at a high level and applicable throughout the Community.
Nevertheless, in a number of Member States, more binding national measures may be in force.
The Commission agrees that no aspect of this regulation should lead to a reduction in the highest safety standards, where these already exist.
MrÂ President, I shall conclude.
The Commission therefore has no difficulty in accepting the amendments that reflect these three principles and therefore supports the compromise amendments, that is to say AmendmentsÂ 19 to 25.
On the other hand, the Commission does not support AmendmentsÂ 11, 16 and 17 because they overlap and because they are, in fact, covered by the compromise amendments.
The same is true of Amendments 12 to 15 and Amendment 18.
They concern technical amendments to various parts of the annex which are, in fact, going to be regulated by the comitology procedure provided for in this regulation.
Well, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this piece of work, which is welcomed by the representatives of aviation staff, bears the hallmark of parliamentary work.
I am grateful to the rapporteur and the Members of Parliament for this.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the harmonisation of the very highly divergent regulations applicable to civil aviation in Europe, particularly to the hours that flight crew work, is urgently needed.
At this time of the year, millions of Europeans are once more setting off on their holidays, and doing so by air.
There has been an explosive increase in air travel over the last 20 years in Europe, and, as air travel now knows practically no national boundaries, it is an anachronism that very different regulations should apply to air safety from one country to another.
The object of this regulation is to at least make these rules more closely approximate, and that is an aim that is, as far as I am aware, supported by all the groups in this House, so we can content ourselves with making changes in a few areas, for example to the rules that put crew on freight flights at a disadvantage, where changes really do have to be made.
We must not, however, make the mistake of adding features that deal only with social security and labour law to a technical regulation that is meant to serve the interests of safety in the air; mixing these together would make the regulationâs direction less clear and tend to weaken it.
Nor must we try to interfere in collective agreements between unions and employers, which are subject to labour law; such collective agreements cannot be the subject of action on the part of the state, not even action by the European Union.
If we do not lose sight of the fact that the regulation is intended to do no more than make air travel safer, then I am sure that passengers will, in future, be able to expect comparable technical safety standards, irrespective of the airport in the European Union at which they embark on their flight.
For that reason alone, this regulation is deserving of support.
I am most grateful for the sound work done by MrÂ Stockmann, the rapporteur.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Barrot, we are coming to the end of a long - a very long â road for those who have been in Parliament since 1999.
We have witnessed the very difficult development of this draft regulation, firstly with the report by MrÂ Simpson - who is not present in this Chamber, but to whom we must pay tribute - and then with the extremely careful and shrewd work of MrÂ Stockmann, who has made it possible today to conclude the regulation.
I believe that Parliament, as you said, Commissioner, can pride itself on having given this draft regulation a respectable social complexion.
As you said, the human factor has a major part to play in the field of air safety, as it often does elsewhere.
One problem remained to be solved, which might have appeared of secondary importance: the human factor certainly refers to the flight deck crew, but it also refers to the cabin crew.
We had difficulty in concluding because we wanted to settle the matter at the end of this second reading and not enter into a conciliation procedure.
That is why 37 of us Members from different political backgrounds â I pay tribute to MrsÂ de Veyrac â acted in what may be regarded as an untimely fashion and tabled a number of amendments aimed at clearly and explicitly integrating subpart O into the scientific assessment and revision work.
I believe that, thanks to MrÂ Stockmannâs mediation, these amendments finally convinced people that a compromise was possible and persuaded the Council to accept it without going any further.
Consequently, if the compromise amendments, as they were drafted this week, are adopted â I am thinking of Amendments 22, 25 and 19 â then, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, there is no longer any reason for us to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by 37 Members.
That is therefore my wish, expressed with a sense of our having fulfilled our duty and of our having, in the course of this week, made some decisive progress.
I am grateful to the Commission for its openness in this regard.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I think this moment represents a step forward where this dossier is concerned.
Although it is certainly true that we have been working on it for a long time, we are now close to an agreement that can enable us to raise safety to a high standard and make competition between airlines more honest.
The question now arises of whether the compromise that is on the table is a good one.
We all know â and a couple of us have already said so â that it is not ideal, but there are times when the best is the enemy of the good.
Right now, though, we have to take what we can get, for there is indeed something to be said for the compromise that is now before us: there is no levelling-down, there are rules for the cabin crew, rules for night flights by freight carriers, and results as soon as possible from the EASA study â after two years instead of after three.
We now have to seize the opportunity to move forward two steps at once.
First, we must now approve the compromise, and I was glad to hear MrÂ Savary say just now that, if the compromise is approved, we should not take matters any further.
Once we have approved the compromise, we will have a European basis on which we can work, on which the Commission, moreover, can begin to work, but then for everyone rather than for the limited number of Member States that can allow themselves higher standards.
That is the first step.
The second step will then be that, once, European rules are in place, we can improve them and work on certain aspects of them, so that â and let me repeat: not just for certain Member States who can allow themselves that sort of thing â the standard can be raised.
This is the way we have to do it â in these two stages.
If we miss out the first, if we fail to make the compromise, we cannot go any further.
I understand very well the criticism levelled by some members of specific categories of personnel and the questions that they raise, for those questions have to do with safety, but when I asked them, âwould you rather have this than nothing?â they answered every time: âNo, no, we want something!'
I think the rapporteur has done everything possible to move all the boundaries as far as possible.
The possibility that we now have of concluding a compromise and to start out with a Europe-wide regulation constitutes an opportunity that we must seize whatever else we do.
If we reject the compromise, I am convinced â as are the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur â that we will be left with nothing, and that we will be even further away from the objective that we want to reach.
I would, in any case, like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, and also to the Commissioner for the work he has put in.
I think it is a pity that the Council is unwilling to move further on a number of points and is holding fast to a sort of reasoning that I do not find readily comprehensible, but, if the compromise that we have hammered out is approved, there is no risk whatever of us ending up empty-handed and making the situation worse rather than better, so, thank you, MrÂ Savary, and thanks to all the other Members, and I think we can look forward to a good result tomorrow.

Â Â  . Mr President, this is an enormous package that we have before us, and, in the course of the last few months, only a few points have been left over for us to consider, although they are very important ones.
The Council spent six years haggling over this compromise and, in doing so, evidently ignored the problems of the flying crew.
The consequence of that was that pilotsâ flying times and the working conditions of cabin crew were open and controversial issues for our discussions in the committee.
I really do want to thank our rapporteur for the really very considerable amount of work he did to put this report on a good and sound footing.
It has to be said, though, that there was no discussion in the proposal of the problems posed by shift work and the fatigue â that is, the physical and mental effects of irregular working hours â which does, of course, have effects on safety.
The solution we have come up with, according to which a proposal has to be submitted within two years from now, is a compromise, and it would have been better if it could have been agreed on at once, but we should be glad to have achieved it at all, and glad that the Council has signed up to it.
It is now up to the Commission to do something positive by taking these factors â which are without doubt indispensable â into account and producing a new proposal.
While I am on the subject, let me say that I am not exactly happy with the exception made for personnel on freight flights, but I will agree to it for the sake of compromise, hoping as I do that the Commission will take a responsible approach to the analysis of working times.
One difficult point, of course, was the prohibition on regression, about which the Council was not willing to talk, and on which the Member States were unable to give way.
It is now up to them â and they will bear responsibility for this â as to whether working conditions, where they are better than what was proposed, improve, get worse, or remain unchanged, and whether, where bad working conditions still prevail, they can at last catch up.
Â Â  â Mr President, the policy of the European Union also functions in the aviation sector on automatic pilot, strengthening the competitiveness of the monopoly aviation companies in order to increase their profits.
In our opinion, there are two basic factors that relate directly to the strengthening of flight safety rules: the human factor and the state â the airworthiness â of aircraft.
Although trade union representatives have from time to time officially expressed their acute concern about the intensification of the exhausting working times of workers and about the deterioration in training provided for cabin crews being promoted in the relevant regulation, unfortunately these elements are not taken into account.
It is a well-known fact that the exhausting working times of cabin crews increase flight safety risks.
Another basic parameter, which was the subject of a letter from qualified Olympic Airways aircraft engineers dated 8Â October 2004 and the corresponding reply, which I have here, from MrÂ Barrot dated 18Â January 2005, concerns pre-flight checks.
At this point, I would draw your attention to a very serious matter.
In the second paragraph of MrÂ Barrot's letter, in reply to the trade union representatives who are responsible for checking the airworthiness of aircraft, it says that, as far as pre-flight inspections are concerned, the analysis of the current legal situation at European Union level (law 2042/2003) confirms that pre-flight inspections do not qualify as technical inspections.
For goodness sake.
If pre-flight inspections of aircraft are not technical inspections, then what are they?
We really consider that aircraft inspections by organised engineers in accordance with Part-66 (Aircraft Maintenance Personnel Licensing) need to be restored.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur MrÂ Stockmann for his very good work in finding a compromise between many and highly divergent opinions.
I believe that the most important matter for those present, chiefly members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, is to reach agreement after six years of work on that version of the reading that is also acceptable to the Council.
To procrastinate on amendments and regulations setting technical requirements and administrative procedures in such a fast-growing business sector as aviation is, I believe, no longer permissible or forgivable.
For this same reason, namely the development of the sector, we must insist on a two-year deadline for completing the evaluation of Section Q. With regard to the compromise reached with the Council on the so-called non-regression clause, I believe that it is sufficient and I do not give credence to the concerns that have been expressed regarding mistrust of some European Union Member States which might, so it is thought, reduce flight-capacity time-limit safety standards to the lowest mandatory EU standards.
Finally, the Community-wide recognition of steward training programmes and the possible licensing of stewards as an additional means of increasing aviation safety will also have a very important effect, one that is often discussed in Parliament and especially by the left wing: it will allow members of this profession to compete within the Community and receive equal pay and social guarantees, regardless of whether they are from old or new Member States.
I will not use the time remaining to me so as to allow the honourable rapporteur to watch his team play.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, let us just rejoice, for this Houseâs tenacity and the Commissionâs support have made it possible for this dossier to be completed after all.
We can look back on five years, on a great deal of work and a great deal of sweat, so let us just rejoice!
Secondly, Commissioner, I urge you to take your courage in your hands; what we ask of you is that you re-examine the special arrangements for night express flights.
The Council would say it saw that as an excuse for inaction, but be bold, do something, make some proposals!
I believe it to be a simple fact that there is a difference between the living circumstances of pilots of passenger aircraft and those of freight aircraft.
