We need to give them certainty and encourage development and investment.
We are not doing that.
We need flexibility of application in the rules on state aid.
When we are dealing with huge social upheaval we must also look at the costs.
I support this refinancing package, but it must not be at the expense of British workers and British jobs.
There is real concern for those in the transmission and distribution businesses that their business is likely to be transferred to Arriva.
There is real concern about the final salary pension schemes of those workers.
We must give them some form of certainty.
My big fear tonight is that we will conclude that Alstom may survive and get the support of the European Union.
What we need to say is that Alstom will survive, and we must do everything possible to ensure that survival and protect those 110 000 jobs.
We owe it to ourselves and to those people in those jobs.
Madam President, Alstom, that great and excellent undertaking, has almost been done to death on two occasions, the first time by the management mistakes of its former chairman, and the second time by the intransigence of the Commission.
Admittedly the Commission has just told us yet again that it is only applying the Treaty and I have to admit, Mr Monti, that that is true.
The Treaty itself poses a problem, because its wording, in the 'competition' part, goes back to the Treaty of Rome.
It proves that our vision of competition is now too narrow, too focused on the internal market, whereas we should be taking a more global view of the strategic, national and European interests at stake in what is now worldwide competition.
This is why, in the Alstom affair, the French Government was defending, in the last analysis, a more balanced and more global position than the Commission.
In this way it was demonstrating that a nation state, democratically responsible, was perfectly capable of assessing whether state aid should be given in order to save, in exceptional circumstances, industries that are strategically important for the economic independence or cultural identity of the country.
It would have been better if the Commission had helped it and cooperated in achieving that objective.
Any future reform of the Treaty ought to take this into account.
In the meantime, we deplore the fact that Mr Monti, in his statements just now, has continued to allow the sword of Damocles to hang over the plan to rescue Alstom, and we deplore the fact that the Commission has absolute power in this area.
On that too it will be necessary to reform the Treaty in the near future.
Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Konrad, for generously giving me a minute to talk on behalf of the constituents Mr Cashman and I share in the United Kingdom, and who are affected by the uncertainty over Alstom.
I will come straight to the point; it is perhaps a reflection of our different views that I want some answers from the Commission about the way forward.
It is clear this business has to be restructured and that it must change in its present form because of the lack of demand for its products.
However, I would like to ask the Commission, firstly, its views about the sale of the transmission and distribution division to Arriva.
Could the Commissioner confirm that this will not be subject to any further delays for competition purposes or, if that disposal or sale is to be referred to him, that he will speed up the procedure as much as possible, so that the employees and that very important division with a long-term future are not affected by any more uncertainty?
As far as the other parts of the undertaking are concerned, will he confirm that the Alstom management will be free to consider offers and to sell other parts of the business to whomsoever they choose and wherever they come from?
We know that there are businesses in Germany and potentially in Japan and America which would be interested in giving a future to employees by reconsolidating the sector.
Finally, will he look at the competition implications in the transport business, and at the fact that within the United Kingdom the majority of railway rolling stock is manufactured outside the country, whereas other countries seem quite capable of introducing into their contracts provisions to ensure that rolling stock is made in their own country?
That is a crucial issue that will affect the future of an excellent railway assembly plant in Birmingham where there is no future work.
At any rate, as part of a restructuring process, we would like to see those people employed in making trains for the United Kingdom market.
Madam President, Commissioner, we welcome with relief, even if it is only a stay of execution, the Commission's decision to allow the Alstom rescue plan to take its chances.
Let us not deceive ourselves: behind all the good reasons put forward by one side or the other, this issue will be a political test of the first order for the European Union as far as public opinion is concerned.
This issue, which concerns one of the jewels in the crown of industrial and technological Europe, on which hangs the future of 118 000 employees throughout the world, is a practical test of both the European project and the Commission.
Commissioner, we do not underestimate the extent to which the French Government, forced into a corner, making its clumsiness and its attempts to lay down the law even worse, has presented us with a fait accompli by publishing a rescue plan before negotiating with the Commission, as it is obliged to do under the Treaties.
However, Mr Mer must be aware that in the past, on the basis of the same Treaties, another French Government, that of Mr Fabius, succeeded, without any difficulty and without any vain polemics from Brussels, in saving the French steel industry in circumstances which were difficult in other ways.
Believe me, we are the first to suffer, we the elected representatives of France, when we see the Prime Minister of our country prostrating himself here in order to ask you to accept record deficits, and, at the same time, the reduction of VAT for his voters in the restaurant trade.
It is true to say that in this behaviour, on the part of a country like France towards the European Union, there is something similar to, and as unilateral and arrogant as, the behaviour of Mr Bush towards the United Nations.
Unfortunately, however, he needs a diversion and a scapegoat.
He needs the old trick of treating himself to false victories when faced with the bureaucracy of Brussels.
For all that, Commissioner, this episode, which can only be the herald of others like it, given the worrying movements towards deindustrialisation and delocalisation which are affecting the brightest jewels in our industrial crown, should make us, as Europeans, ask ourselves about the place and the status of our policy on competition within the Union.
It is becoming increasingly outrageous and intolerable that our competition policy, in a context that is quite different from that of the Treaties by which it was established in 1986 and 1992, should remain bound by the impassable horizon of being simply a policy of the European Union.
Many voices - too many, and increasingly credible - are being raised to claim that Europe cares more about the inexorable law of the market than any of the most free-market countries in the world, starting with the United States of America.
Today, faced with the inexorable affirmation of the new major powers of tomorrow, Europe needs to look at things and judge them from an angle other than that of unbridled competition.
It needs an industrial policy which is capable of protecting its national champions, of safeguarding its priceless technical heritage and its precious savoir-faire.
It needs a social policy which aims to maintain living standards and the employment of the greatest possible number of Europeans.
What is at stake here is, first and foremost, a social issue of primary importance, but also the competitiveness of Europe in the world at large.
Finally, how can we make our peoples understand that an administrative authority over which there is no parliamentary control should alone take a decision of such importance that thousands of workers' families are now awaiting it with bated breath and with anguish in their hearts?
Above and beyond the decision that you take - and I cannot imagine that it will be a second negative - the whole meaning of the European project and the structure of the current Treaties are being called into question here.
In this respect, we can only hope, if such a thing is possible, that the next Intergovernmental Conference will tackle this need to push forward, side by side and on equal terms with competition policy, a social policy of employment and an industrial policy which will enable the Union to defend its economic and social interests in the global world in which we shall be living from now on.
. (IT) Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members who have spoken on a subject of great economic, social, institutional and political importance.
I would like to start by thanking Mr Karas for expressing his full support for the Commission's work: he mentioned the new draft Constitution and the Lisbon strategy.
I believe that we must also take note of the fact that, whenever the Heads of State or Government meet in the European Council, they send out clear calls for state aid to be cut and channelled into horizontal objectives rather than into supporting any particular sectors or businesses.
Therefore, it is not just the fantasies of the European Commissioners that are taking this direction.
Mr Karas also pointed out - and I agree with him fully - that competition is, although not the only factor, of course, an essential element in the social market economy.
Mr Wurtz, thank you for pointing out the different occasions - 1999, February 2000 - on which the trade unions brought to the attention of the European Parliament, inter alia, the deterioration of Alstom's financial situation and position within the industry.
This helps us to place the issue in its historical and chronological context and to eliminate the over-simplified view - expressed by some malicious rumourmongers in recent days - that it is the European Commission who will be responsible for any unemployment problems.
I, too, Mr Wurtz, am extremely sensitive to the need for the trade unions to be fully informed and made aware of these issues, just as the public authorities need to be aware of how the trade unions are coping with them.
I therefore have no hesitation in agreeing to your request for a meeting with the Coordination syndicale Alstom and I can tell you that I have, in any case, already agreed to a request for a meeting which is to take place in the next few days with the European Trade Union Federation, to which this association belongs.
Mr Wurtz, together with almost all the speakers - Mr Lipietz, Mr Pasqua, Mr Savary and others - mentioned the need for a European industrial policy.
I hope I will not cause offence if I say that I fully agree with them.
A European industrial policy is something which has as a foundation stone, as an essential component, the promotion of a single market under conditions of competition.
Please let us not create confusion by saying that the single market and competition are contrary to the requirements of an industrial policy.
An industrial policy needs other things as well, but if you ask French, German or Italian entrepreneurs what the European Union's essential contribution is to their industrial activities and their expansion and export activities, etc., they will reply: the single market, a single market in which the conditions for competition are preserved.
Of course, other things are necessary too, and, in the Commission, I always support the initiatives of Commissioner Liikanen, Commissioner Busquin and the Vice-President, Mrs De Palacio, seeking to find other ways of boosting Europe's industrial development, but I feel that it would be an extremely serious error to think that we can further industrial policy by eating away at the foundations of the single market and competition.
Mr Wurtz said that the Commission has discretionary power in the field of competition which is not subject to control.
Mr Pasqua provided part of the answer when he pointed out that there have been cases in which judicial control, which always applies to all Commission decisions, including in the field of competition, has rejected some of the European Commission's decisions.
The Commission certainly does not claim to be infallible and still less do I. Our actions are subject to two levels of judicial control: the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice.
In the great majority of cases, these judicial bodies rule in favour of the Commission's decision; in others, they do not.
With regard to political legitimacy, Mr Wurtz, decisions relating to competition policy are taken in the individual Member States at national level by bodies which do not have the political legitimacy which the European Commission has conferred on it at European level by the European Parliament, in particular, with individual hearings for each Commissioner.
Mr Lipietz made a number of points relating to French internal politics, on which I do not believe he expects me to express an opinion.
I welcome the support given by both the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and by Mr Lipietz, personally, as he has stated on many occasions, to competition policy as an essential tool for consumer protection.
By the way, I would like to say that one of the tasks of competition policy is, without a doubt, to guarantee a secure supply of products, and there is even a specific legal instrument, what is known as 'failing company defence', which makes it possible for the potential disappearance of operators from the market, which could jeopardise security of supply, to be taken into account in competition policy decisions.
It is not, therefore, such an inflexible, blinkered policy as might be imagined at first glance.
Mr Pasqua - who appears to have left the Chamber - said that he is not prepared to place blind trust in the Commission.
I would point out, if I may, that, even if he were prepared to do so, the Commission would not want blind trust to be placed in it at all.
It is extremely important that the Commission acts in close cooperation with Parliament and in accordance with Parliament's basic guidelines and, in any case, in particular in these matters, under the strict control of the judicial authority based in Luxembourg.
Mr Pasqua, too, mentioned the need for a clear industrial policy for Europe.
President Prodi and the Commission as a whole, all the Commissioners, are reflecting on the effects of the deindustrialisation of Europe, which we all feel cannot be dealt with just by giving the Member States licence to breach competition rules or state aid legislation.
Mr Abitbol talked of the 'orgueil blessÃ© d'un commissaire europÃ©en'.
Quite frankly, I do not believe it is a matter of any particular orgueil, nor that it has received blessures.
Then, as regards to the difference between the professions of notary and huissier, I do not think it is at all relevant: they are both, in any case, occupations, professions, which deserve the greatest respect, as, I believe, does the job of European Commissioner.
Mr Abitbol's comment on European Commission decisions which have allegedly harmed the development of French industry is interesting: interesting and curious, for I always mention France in my speeches as an example of a country whose industry has benefited greatly while observing European competition rules.
Here are some examples, Mr Abitbol - and I am addressing Mr Berthu, too, here - of cases in which French companies, with the authorisation of the European Commission, have succeeded in becoming either French national industry leaders or European industry leaders or world industry leaders.
These are genuine examples, and I will confine myself to mentioning cases from recent years.
Total-Fina-Elf, the result of a merger authorised by the Commission, has become a major industry leader, to say the least, in France, as has Carrefour-Promodes.
The merger in the field of nuclear plant engineering between Maton and Siemens created Arriva, which a number of Members have mentioned this evening, a major European industry leader, and, thanks to the then Managing Director, Francis MÃšre, the Usinor group, with the authorisation of the Commission, merged successfully with other European iron and steel companies to create Arcelor, which is not the European industry leader but the world industry leader, the largest iron and steel group operating in the world today.
I therefore believe that it is possible to reconcile consumer protection, which is the primary task of competition policy, with the creation of large structures which can compete at international level.
In this, therefore, I agree with Mr Berthu that we need to have a global vision for global markets, although not, of course, where the markets are still national or local.
Mr Lange described the European Commission's attitude as 'arrogant and dogmatic' - I believe these were the words he used.
I would not presume to disagree with him if this is his opinion; I think I have explained today and on other occasions how and why we act as we do, and that we are convinced that our work is not so much based purely on legal formalism but on the need to give the European economy strong foundations and to ensure respect for rules, not least as a principle of democratic peaceful coexistence, if I may use that term, at European level.
As Mr Konrad rightly pointed out, the European Union is a community of law - I do not feel this is a pejorative term - which is founded on respect for rules in a number of fields, and since the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, I believe that it also has a duty to ensure that they are observed.
Mr Konrad pointed out that, ultimately, state aid often leads to loss of money without bringing any significant tangible benefits.
At the same time, Mr Cashman is in favour of aid to the Alstom group, provided that this does not harm the British workers.
This would appear to be a very respectable position on the matter, taking a specific point of view.
Our task is to attempt to preserve the jobs of the employees of the Alstom group by facilitating a restructuring plan and, at the same time, while preventing excessively serious distortions to trade, to stop the employees of competing firms from losing their jobs.
This is the task of state aid control.
Of course, the loss of currently existing jobs from a specific area is always going to have a higher profile than the other jobs we manage to save elsewhere in Europe by ensuring respect for the rules.
In any case, I can assure you that the preservation and expansion of employment is something to which the Commission attaches great importance.
Mr Harbour asked me some actually very specific questions, in particular whether the Commission will have to decide, I imagine in the context of concentration control, whether the sale of Alstom's transmission and distribution division to Arriva is to take place quickly.
If that task falls to us, I can assure you that we will decide quickly for, as Mr Harbour knows, the regulation on concentration control in Europe, unlike that in force in the United States, for example, lays down extremely short, unextendable deadlines for such decisions.
I have to apologise, for I am not qualified to comment on the issue of the Birmingham establishment or on the varying degrees of dependence of the different Member States on foreign manufacturers in the purchase of railway rolling stock.
I will end, Mr President, with a simple observation.
If we look back at cases of state aid authorised by the Commission for restructuring plans and at the occasions when it was employed, we see that, in many of those cases, the state aid did not help: in other words, those companies, those jobs, were not saved in spite of the state aid.
In those - numerous - cases, the end result was, nevertheless, job losses, plant closures and, what is more, increased taxation to replenish the state coffers, affecting taxpayers.
That is why the matter before us is not an easy one to resolve.
I can assure you that the Commission will endeavour to exercise due control with all due responsibility.
Thank you very much for your thoughtful contributions to this debate, both those expressing support and those expressing criticism.
Madam President, I merely wish to correct something Commissioner Monti said.
He is right that I referred to the 10 000 jobs in the United Kingdom and specifically those in my constituency, Birmingham, Rugby and Stafford.
However, the record will show that I said we had a care of duty - a responsibility - to the 110 000 jobs.
Therefore, whilst I recognise that I looked at the British consequences, I am extremely concerned about the effects on those jobs across Europe.
Thank you Mr Cashman.
The debate is closed.
The sitting is suspended until 9 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.50 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
. Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply honoured to be here today.
It is a privilege to address you in a plenary session of the European Parliament, and I am grateful to Mr Cox and all of you for giving me this opportunity.
I speak to you today at a time of great hope for my country and for its European destiny.
Almost a year ago in Bucharest, Mr President, you spoke before the Romanian Parliament and shared with my fellow Romanians your vision for Europe's future and Romania's destiny within Europe.
It is this Europe of values and principles that we wish to join.
Today I stand before the European Parliament to let you know that we have faced countless challenges.
We have overcome many of them and our political will is to overcome them all.
But my main message today is that Romania is a country that the democratic community of nations can count on.
Romania will be a consistent and reliable European Union member.
The European Union will gain much more than just a new EU Member State of over 22 million inhabitants; it will gain a firm believer in European integration, a Euro-optimist by choice.
Connected to Europe throughout our entire history, we believe in the system of positive values now underlying the European construction: democracy, respect for citizens' rights and liberties, justice and social equity, tolerance, solidarity within and among nations and accountability to future generations.
For us Romanians, sidelined by history for more than half a century, natural evolution within the European Community, whose values served as a beacon, was an aspiration which came true upon the revolution of December 1989.
Coming out of totalitarianism - both fascist and communist - was neither simple nor easy.
We had to face a twofold handicap, the first of which was institutional: the institutions of a totalitarian state are incompatible with democracy and the market economy.
The second handicap was represented by our isolation from the world and our autarchic tendencies.
All this occurred against the background of a deeply-rooted, historical delay in economic and social development.
We had to build up institutions, see them in place and functioning, confer on them power originating in their legitimacy and functionality.
Assisted by friends and partners of Romania - who are very many, and some of whom are present in this Chamber today - we have mapped out and adopted a modern and democratic constitution, we have trained people to cope with the new demands of a working democracy.
Politically, over the past 14 years, Romania has developed its functional democracy, which has twice successfully passed the test of alternative governance.
Meanwhile, civic society has emerged and asserted itself ever more strongly, thus presenting - by way of its organisations - a necessary and useful counter-power, and forming a catalyst for public debate.
The formulation of a national strategy on the relationships between the majority and ethnic minorities, including the implicit representation of such minorities in parliament, has been highly successful for this political transition.
The treatment that ethnic minorities enjoy in Romania is exemplary and meets every European and international standard.
Our country is a realm of tolerance and dialogue and of fruitful cooperation between various ethnic groups; such treatment has become a tradition and a culture of dialogue and consensus has developed.
There is an important party belonging to the Hungarian minority, just as there are parties and organisations representing, politically and culturally, the interests of the Germans, Roma, Jews, Ukrainians, Polish, and so on: citizens of Romania.
At the moment, we are focusing on making better use of the programmes for the economic and social integration of the Roma minority.
We have scored significant progress in the field of economic reforms, although most delays in our transition occur in that sphere.
Such delays are the result of a whole host of factors, both objective and subjective, as well as the consequence of a particular historical reality.
We have often been criticised for not having carried out shock therapy, and for our gradual approach to reforms, which has prevented us from scoring the results envisaged.
We consider such accusations to be unfounded.
The first days of 1990 saw the most astonishing shock in the Romanian economy: the complete and unconditional renunciation of the planned, centralised economic system, the dismantling of the institutions and mechanisms characterising the state-controlled economy.
When harking back, we realise that this brought about deeply entrenched economic imbalances, caused inflation and enhanced de-industrialisation and increased unemployment and the migration of the labour force from the city to the countryside.
All these consequences were entirely inconsistent with the mainstream world economy.
Moreover, a lack of domestic capital and the extremely low volume of foreign investment in the Romanian economy have made privatisation an even more difficult and lengthy process.
We needed more than a decade to redress the macroeconomic balances and to resume - over the past three and a half years - a steady economic growth of about 5%.
The economic reform which began in the absence of the market institutions and mechanisms has entailed extremely high and hardly bearable social costs.
As a matter of fact, the process of economic recovery is not over yet.
Poverty is our main problem in the social sphere.
We are aware that we cannot succeed in alleviating poverty significantly without continued economic reform, without speeding up the creation of new, more stable and better paid jobs.
Responses to the economic and social problems facing Romania need to be formed, first and foremost, from within the country, mainly through a concerted effort by all the accountable political forces, so that the principles and institutions of good governance can be established.
That means that we must reprimand corruption and red-tape efficiently and firmly, and give to the public servant a professional status that should no longer be used to reward political clients.
Such efforts need to result in the Romanian State's modernisation.
They must enhance its institutional and administrative capabilities and turn it into a genuine and friendly partner of the citizen.
We have made good progress in that direction, but we are aware of the many problems that still await adequate responses.
The logic applied to state modernisation and the preparations for accession to the European Union also applied to the revision of our constitution, which has been carried out through the active participation of representatives of all parliamentary political parties and through consultation of civil society.
The revision will soon be submitted for endorsement by national referendum.
Despite the hardships and flaws in Romanian society, I truthfully believe that Romania is now on the right track, that the Romanians have now come to understand that democracy is a better and more efficient political system than totalitarianism, securing higher levels of performance across the board.
Freedom of choice and freedom to set up and implement alternative political, economic and social projects provide the democratic system with better opportunities.
Conflicts can be settled by way of dialogue, negotiation and consensus.
Romanian society has grown up.
It has acquired new foundations for national cohesion and social solidarity.
It stands ready to assume the new responsibilities incumbent upon it in terms of Romania's new status as a Nato member and future Member State of the European Union.
Thank you, Mr President, for that address.
The calendar is foreseen; the pathway is known; the progress will be determined, as you have remarked, by Romania itself in preparation.
We, in this House, look forward to the fulfilment of Romania's European vocation.
We thank you for your presence.
The next item is the report (A5-0232/2003) by Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and Council establishing a general framework for financing Community actions in support of consumer policy for the years 2004 to 2007. (COM(2003) 44 C5-0022/2003 2003/0020(COD)).
.
I wish to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their very constructive efforts to reach a compromise between the institutions so that we can adopt this proposal at first reading.
As you know, an adoption at first reading is of major importance for the timely execution of the 2004 consumer policy budget.
I very much appreciate your support for the key principle of this proposal - that the Consumer Policy Strategy sets the scope, political orientations and priorities for the programming of expenditure on consumer policy.
It is essential that we spend our money on actions designed to achieve the objectives of this strategy: a high common level of consumer protection, better enforcement of consumer protection rules and the closer involvement of consumer organisations in the making of all EU policies that affect consumer interests.
Regarding accession countries, I fully share Parliament's view that the application of the acquis communautaire in the accession countries must be given high priority in the consumer policy budget.
The Commission will ensure that specific projects undertaken by consumer organisations and aiming to accelerate the effective implementation of the acquis communautaire on consumer protection in the new Member States can be eligible for a financial contribution of 75%.
As to independent European consumer organisations, you have, in your report, emphasised the need to support these organisations.
Here also, I fully agree with you.
I also share Parliament's view that the integration of consumer interests in other EU policies must be given high priority in the consumer policy budget.
Coming to grant applications, firstly, the Commission will ensure that consumer organisations are appropriately informed about the new requirements and their strict implementation.
The application procedures for grants will be kept as simple as possible, and we will offer consumer organisations seminars to explain how they work.
Secondly, in order to improve the quality of project applications and project management, initiatives are already under way to offer professionals of consumer organisations training in project development.
Thirdly, in order to assist consumer organisations in finding project partners, the Commission is putting into place an on-line forum to facilitate networking and cross-border contacts.
In response to your report, Mr Whitehead, I also wish to assure you and the European Parliament that the Commission will speed up the decision-making on grant applications.
Payments will also be made as promptly as possible.
However, I must also plead here for your understanding.
We will make every effort to complete the decision-making on grant applications within three months.
But you must be aware that in the post-accession period, the workload and translation requirements will substantially increase.
It is also probable that we will have more third-country participation in consumer policy actions than before.
Our efforts to streamline and speed up the grant application process cannot be made at the expense of proper evaluation of the proposals, and must comply fully with the rules governing budget management.
I take the sound management of Community funds very seriously.
The consumer policy budget must and will be executed in strict accordance with the rules set out in the Financial Regulation.
On that, no compromise is possible, and I trust that you share that conviction.
. Mr President, as this Parliament enlarges, Commissioner, you and I get physically further apart, but we are drawn closer together by the consequence of enlargement, which is that consumer protection is a prime concern now for a Community of 450,000,000 people.
Tonight, the House has the opportunity to carry through an agreement at first reading, which will guarantee that support for consumers' activities.
It came to us a little late but we have made good progress.
I would particularly like to thank you, Commissioner, for the effort you made to get here tonight, after the lengthy day you have had, and also for the work of your staff.
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their solidarity which includes their presence here tonight, my own assistant Laura Sullivan, the consumer NGOs and the Council Presidency, all of whom have brought us to a position where we can tonight demonstrate that the total support in Council is overwhelmingly replicated in Parliament.
We are presenting about thirty-one compromise amendments en bloc, all of which have involved give and take.
If passed, the second bloc of amendments to the fifteen original ones would fall.
That would leave about five remaining amendments which I would advise the House to vote down.
I will deal with those last.
These compromises reflect the consensus view that we need to widen the scale and the proportionate limit of support for consumer activities.
We stand on the brink of enlargement and all the diverse needs that will follow from it.
We have had to find legally sound ways to extend those provisions up to 2007, in cooperation with our friends and colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We also acknowledge that small - but equally deserving - applicants have been disadvantaged in the past by the arcane nature and length of the assessment process.
The converse also applies.
We need to be certain of the rules, qualifications and funding of all applicants, however obscure.
Events unfolding today before other committees suggest that this caution is necessary.
The Commission has told us that it accepts with good grace the requirement to supply an assessment of applications within three months.
When that is not possible, we will be told why.
I am glad that the Commissioner has stressed that his best endeavours and those of his team will go towards making early consideration of all these applications as effective as possible and that there will be seminars and other instruction particularly for those making applications for the first time and, sometimes, from a country which is itself a new Member State.
It is an anomaly that we are having to discuss the pressing needs of enlargement at a time when, technically, we cannot consider the budget that we know must be used for that purpose post 2004.
This is a first reading which can result in instant agreement between the three institutions if we all accept that none of the three have been pushed beyond their limits.
The Commissioner knows that there has been a certain exasperation over some of the committees that have been set up and the discussions that have been held about consumer protection, not just in this institution but elsewhere too.
We have to accept the limits of what we can do in saying who can meet where and do what in relation to consumer advice.
My colleagues have wisely decided on that score that they would not push some of the amendments that came before the Committee, although we support and indeed sometimes salute the principles that inspired them.
I have to say to my good friend, colleague and namesake Mr Bushill-Matthews that his Amendment No 11 is an amendment too far.
I supported it in the Committee because I felt that we needed to make this point: there is exasperation where sometimes - and the Commission I think accepts this as the case - applications have not been considered not just within three or four months, as the Commission would have preferred, but within five months and beyond.
The worst offenders are not DG SANCO.
Indeed, some of the examples Mr Bushill-Matthews gave come from other directorates-general.
The point however stands, we need to improve on it and we need to be able to demonstrate a greater responsiveness on the part of the Commission.
I hope Mr Bushill-Matthews will tell us tonight with his customary subtlety that he understands the position we are in.
In conclusion, this is a modest proposal.
The Commissioner will understand that I do not mean this in a Swiftian sense.
We are not devouring our children; we are nourishing them with this proposal.
I hope it is commended by everybody in the House.
Mr President, I am very happy to see that the European Union and the Commission, and all of us together, are supporting the consumers' associations.
They are, in a sense, the other element of the triptych which makes up democracy.
I would also, however, like to stress certain aspects which seem to me to be very positive.
In accordance with this spirit of providing incentive, I believe it is enormously important to create networks and that they are not just made up of the European consumers' associations already consolidated.
The danger with this type of aid is that we create a group of associations receiving preferential treatment which, in the end, creates an autonomous body, with no relationship with the grass roots.
To this end, we have introduced certain amendments mentioning regional and national associations, because it is extremely important that, particularly in relation to the management and implementation of the programme, the Commission ensures that the small associations can emerge, clearly linked to the scheme and the network.
Since we also have the challenge of the new democracies in the Eastern countries, it is essential to incentivise the creation of small associations in every part of the Union.
I would like to praise the efforts of the small associations located in regions far from the decision-making centres such as Brussels.
It often takes genuine heroism to create an association in these regions, in which the people feel alone and misunderstood and where they often have to touch raw nerves or denounce aspects relating to their immediate neighbours to the local authorities, bearing in mind the scant inspection the administration can carry out.
I therefore welcome this initiative and would ask that, when it comes to distributing aid, account be taken not just of the need to provide incentives for emerging associations and to strengthen the small ones, by linking them to the more consolidated associations, but that we also need to ensure that the more consolidated ones fulfil their duties and make contacts with all parts of the Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Scandinavian, I do not usually go in for flowery language, but I wish to thank Mr Whitehead and the Commission's officials for the intensive work done so that we might quickly have this proposal turned into a reality.
We have all worked in a spirit of how important it is to strengthen the consumer organisations and reinforce the objectives of consumer work.
I therefore want to say thank you to Phillip.
The previous speakers have already mentioned the situation in the candidate countries.
It is for the new Europe that we are developing the consumer area.
In this area, as in many others, I believe there is an old heritage we must combat.
I believe that strong consumer organisations are extremely important for enabling people to participate and for giving them the opportunity to exercise influence.
For those reasons too, approval is important so that the candidate countries become part of the required network.
In Parliament's amendments, we indicate the importance of genuinely integrating consumer issues into other areas.
This has been an issue especially close to my heart.
As MEPs, we see how strong the lobbying is in other areas.
We must give the consumer the power to study, inform and share best practices.
The next issues must be those of mobile telephone conversations, price fixing or the ways in which billing operates in different countries.
I therefore think it important for us to highlight this issue.
The previous speakers, especially the rapporteur and the Commissioner, spoke of the administrative procedures.
The work we have done together - and I want to emphasise the word 'together' - may be genuinely groundbreaking in bringing about rapid procedures and quick responses in place of a situation in which applicants are constantly forced to communicate when there is no need to.
I hope that the outcome of our work will serve as an example of better procedures.
We in the committee proposed that the committee, mentioned in Article 15, should be disbanded.
We knew that the Council would not perhaps accept the proposal.
I nonetheless hope that the Commissioner, the Commission and all of us are agreed about following up the question of what the committee costs.
Does it give value for money?
In an enlarged EU, it may be extremely difficult to have large committees of this kind that decide about quite small funds.
I hope that the Commission will genuinely look into what the committee mentioned in Article 15 will, in reality, cost.
Mr President, we are satisfied, on the whole, with Mr Whitehead's report and with the fact that the Council has generally taken on board our amendments.
The clarification of the detailed rules for financing consumer protection organisations was essential.
The definition of such bodies must be strict.
The report follows this line, while at the same time guaranteeing the participation of a panel of organisations.
Of course we must keep those organisations which demonstrate the necessary technical competence, but we must also ensure the independence of representative bodies.
It is absolutely essential to avoid a situation in which pressure groups - whether industrial, commercial, professional or any other kind - see those bodies as a means of indirectly influencing the Union's policy.
On the other hand, we must maintain our relations with the cooperatives, which take consumers' interests into account in their charters.
Relations with consumer protection organisations have to be developed in close contact with the public.
We cannot, therefore, be satisfied with giving preferential treatment to relations with Community or national organisations while merely offering support to regional bodies: the latter must enjoy proper representation within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as corresponding financial aid.
That committee will also be responsible for ensuring even greater representation of civil society.
The expansion in the sphere of competence is important.
The bodies in the food sector have now been joined by consumer protection organisations in the services sector and, more broadly, in the non-food sectors.
Access to information is an essential guarantee of consumer protection.
This is why we asked for, and obtained, public data banks that would be easily accessible.
The public must be able to find out about the precise history of products, their origin, their method of production etc. This means, amongst other things, improving labelling - an effective means of guaranteeing that consumers are informed.
We must go further, however.
If we want to be sure that safe products are being marketed, we not only need to be informed about the risks: we also need to see about reducing those risks.
That is only possible if we develop comparative evaluations with a view to sustainable and responsible production and consumption. That is the real consumer protection policy.
Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his kind mention of my Amendment No 11, which referred to Article 6, paragraph 5a (new).
This called for Commission officials responsible for non-payment in due time to be named in the official Parliamentary record after a three-week deadline.
The purpose of this flowed from an experience of one of my constituents in the West Midlands who had to wait for over a year to get paid his due from - I have to say - the Agriculture DG rather than your own, Commissioner, but who none the less came across two particular individuals who were not only incompetent but also unhelpful. They know who they are.
I think it is appropriate that other people should know who they are.
So this amendment was not tabled out of malice, but out of experience and a desire to be helpful, in my usual style.
I was pleased that in your opening remarks you said that, perhaps as a result of this amendment, it is your intention to speed up decision-making.
But I was concerned about your follow-up comments when you said that we have to take note of the possibility of enlargement slowing things up, that we still have to take care of evaluation, and so on.
There were too many 'buts' from my point of view.
I have to say gently, but firmly, Commissioner, that those are fine words but we shall be watching you.
It is important to say that this should go through at first reading, despite what I have just said.
I agree with the rapporteur that this is an important issue.
To help it on its way the PPE-DE Group is calling for a roll-call vote on this particular amendment but will then abstain so that the amendment will fall.
Hopefully then, the report will go through but we will have put down a marker.
As MEPs we are each held accountable for what we say, what we do and what we fail to do.
This is as it should be.
But I must say to the Commissioner that such a policy should not just apply to us; it should apply to everyone in authority and especially to those in public service.
Some Commission officials clearly believe that it does not apply to them.
They are quite wrong.
If they fail to learn, then I am confident that Parliament will put forward another helpful amendment in due course that will not be voted down.
Today and tomorrow we will have given a warning shot.
If this fails to work, we shall use live rounds.
Mr President, I also wish to begin by thanking the Commission and Mr Whitehead for the work that has been done.
It cannot be emphasised enough how important a proper consumer policy is for the EU.
Consumer policy has, of course, many important purposes.
It must contribute to sustainable development, sustainable production and sustainable consumption.
It is also necessary to change our consumer behaviour, and the small consumer organisations are very important in this context.
I particularly want to discuss the aid given to small consumer organisations and, in particular, to the new Member States.
They should not be discouraged by the fact that it takes some time for them to be informed about the co-financing projects.
Instead, it must be ensured that the procedure is changed so that they are notified quickly and so enabled to continue their good work.
.
Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members concerned for participating in this useful and interesting debate, and for the constructive position they have taken.
I personally feel that the codecision process has resulted in significant improvements to this decision.
The compromise amendments proposed have reaped the benefit of the combined expertise of all three institutions.
The Commission can accept this compromise package, consisting of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 12, 14, 15, 22, 23 and 29 up to and including 59.
As far as Amendment No 52 is concerned, the Commission notes the Parliament's wish and the Council's unanimous agreement that there should be a three-month deadline for decision-making on grant applications.
We are committed to reducing the time taken for such decisions to the absolute minimum and will work towards this deadline.
Nevertheless, the Commission wishes to remind Parliament of the importance of not deviating from the imperatives of proper evaluation and the full respect of rules on financial and budget management.
In response to the comments from Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines and Mr Rod on regional organisations, I should say that I am fully aware of the important role played by regional consumer organisations in certain EU countries.
Their proximity to consumer concerns makes them an interesting partner for implementing the policy objectives of EU consumer policy.
Regional consumer organisations are eligible for grants for specific projects and can also benefit from the capacity-building actions we offer to consumer organisations.
For example, the training courses we offer to consumer organisations to help improve their managerial capacity and the contribution of consumer representatives to EU policy development are open to the staff of regional consumer organisations.
Specific projects that promote the objectives of EU policy at regional level are eligible for cofinancing from the EU budget.
I very much hope that regional consumer organisations will make good use of such opportunities.
In response to Mrs Thors' question regarding the integration of consumer issues in other policies, I want to stress that the integration of consumer interests into all relevant EU policies is enshrined in Article 153 of the Treaty.
It should be pursued by all Commission services and by all EU institutions.
We have been making progress on this issue.
In the important debate about services of general interest, that followed the adoption of the Commission Green Paper, consumer interests are amongst the core issues on the table.
We hope that the progress achieved so far - in air transport, for example, with the charter on passenger rights and the denied boarding regulation - will serve as a reference for the improvement of passenger rights in other modes of transport.
Actions in this proposal for a decision that will contribute to the integration objectives are many; to name but a few: actions to provide consumer organisations with the technical and legal expertise to effectively contribute to policy development in EU policy areas relevant to consumers, and actions to collect data that provide an evidence base for the integration of consumer interests into other EU policies.
On the question of comitology raised by Mrs Thors, I would like to say that since 1999 the Consultative Committee of the Member States has advised the Commission, in particular concerning the attribution of grants.
It makes a useful contribution to coordinating EU and national policies for project grants.
In addition, this Committee will become the essential forum for discussion and advice on the implementation of a new type of action - those that are jointly financed by the Community budget and the Member States.
These joint actions will in particular be used for the Commission's future activities in the area of administrative and enforcement cooperation and to consolidate the existing networks of European Consumer Centres and the Extra-Judicial network.
The Committee, therefore, has a key role to play in the implementation of the proposed framework.
I took full note when Mr Bushill-Matthews said that he will be watching me: that, of course, is his job and that of Parliament.
We are accountable to Parliament and Parliament is of course accountable to the elected Members.
I noted that Mr Bushill-Matthews also said that next time he will fire live rounds.
I suppose that means that up until now he has been firing blanks!
To conclude, my special gratitude goes to Mr Whitehead, who has proved a master in negotiating at a high level to achieve a compromise with the Council.
I take note of what he said in relation to us nourishing our children rather than devouring them.
Of course you will realise, Mr Whitehead, that this proposal is not a modest proposal: it is quite a substantial proposal.
Your reference to my fellow countryman points to the title 'A Modest Proposal', which, of course, is inappropriate in this instance.
I consider this exercise to be an excellent example of how the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission can work together constructively on consumer policy issues.
I trust that the vote will confirm the orientations set out today.
I hope that other consumer issues pending before this Parliament can also, in due course, be resolved with equal skill and constructive spirit.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
The next item is the report (A5-0259/2003) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs on the Joint Report by the Commission and the Council on adequate and sustainable pensions (COM(2002) 737 2003/2040(INI)).
Mr President, we are concerned here with the Commission's Communication on Adequate and Sustainable Pensions and with an analysis of whether, in their first Strategy Reports, the Member States have complied with the three overarching aims of the common pensions policy.
The first of these is whether pensions are adequate and whether we have set future pensions at a level sufficient to prevent poverty and provide a reasonable standard of living.
The second is whether pensions are economically sustainable in the long term so that future generations do not have an unnecessarily large economic burden placed upon them.
The third is whether pensions are sufficiently up-to-date to cope with the new situation, characterised by atypical jobs and more and more women in the labour market.
We think that the Commission's communication is sound.
The Commission has carried out a sound analysis.
In Parliament, we have tried to distance ourselves from the national debates on various national changes to the pensions systems.
We have tried to stick to our task at EU level, namely that of setting up objectives for the common strategy we are to have at EU level.
The Member States must themselves deal with the purely practical proposals for the pensions systems.
We have a number of viewpoints.
First of all, there must be a balance between social and economic considerations.
It is important for economic development that we have sustainable pensions systems.
That applies especially to those countries that are involved in cooperation in connection with the euro, but also to other countries, so that we obtain sustainable economic development.
It is at least as important, however, for us to address the social aspects that affect people's living standards.
We must ensure that people have a comfortable standard of living in later years, not hugely different from that they enjoyed when gainfully employed, and that they do not end up in poverty.
Pensions systems still reveal a lack of equality.
Women's pensions are not as large as men's.
In some cases, that has to do with the pensions systems, but the main reason is women's position in the labour market.
Women have, to a larger extent, lower paid jobs, part-time work and a lower level of employment.
That means that the Lisbon process is the most important thing in this connection.
The situation for those who have atypical jobs is not satisfactory either, especially when it comes to the supplementary pensions on which the two sides of industry are agreeing.
There is good reason to address these problems.
The absolutely most important thing if we are to meet our commitments in the future is that we obtain growth and full employment.
It is therefore important for us to link these aims to the Lisbon process and to the employment and economic guidelines and for us to take a global view.
We very often talk about solidarity between our generations here and now, and it is important that there be solidarity right now between the generations.
In view of demographic development, it is, however, at least as important that we talk about solidarity with future generations so that we ourselves - and I personally belong to the generation born in the forties - do not indulge ourselves too much now with the result that future generations of earners have to contend with unreasonably high costs when we become pensioners.
We must ensure that that will not be the case with the new pensions systems.
We must show solidarity with future generations.
What caused most discussion in the committee was the actual and/or statutory pensionable age.
We are not interfering with the statutory pensionable age.
It is paradoxical that the elder portion of the population is becoming healthier and healthier - which is a good thing - at the same time as it is working less and less.
We are today working less than we did thirty years ago. There are many reasons for this.
If something is missing from the Commission's communication, it is perhaps an overall picture of how the actual pensionable age is to be increased.
We are concerned here with financial incentives, but we are also concerned with matters such as lifelong learning, the organisation of work and problems involving the working environment, so that older people can also remain in the labour market.
We must change working life in such a way that people can remain actively in work and not be excluded from it.
We shall then also address the subject of enlargement.
Finally, I wish to thank all those who have helped us obtain a broad, if not complete, consensus in the committee.
We have enjoyed sound cooperation in the committee.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate and thank Mr Andersson.
The report on adequate and sustainable pensions touches on one of the most burning issues in the hands of all the governments.
Reforms in each country are, of course, a national responsibility, but I would say that we are turning a blind eye if we fail to look at the European dimension and the need for cooperation, not only because there is a very close economic dependency between the economies of the Member States, but also because our analysis has resulted in convincing conclusions that the causes of the crisis in the pension systems are precisely the same in all the countries.
They are demographics, longer life expectancy, the new working models and the new family models.
Using the open method of cooperation was the first important attempt made at European level for the countries to cooperate with each other.
We agreed on three lines of approach.
The first concerned the economic viability of the pension systems.
The second concerned adequate pensions, meaning a dignified standard of living for pensioners, which is something Mr Andersson insists on in his report.
And the third is the adaptability of the pension systems, so that they take account of changes.
The reference in the report to the link between pension systems and the labour market is important, and I shall explain how the Commission is meeting the demands made in the report with a series of initiatives.
First, the question of increasing the actual retirement age.
It is clear, on the one hand, that it is important and necessary to change the age limit, for reasons of sustainability and, on the other hand, that this cannot be done on its own, without flanking employment policies which will help elderly workers to remain in the labour market, because today, due to the culture which exists in the labour market, the reality which has existed for many years, it is very difficult for elderly workers over 55 years of age to find work easily.
Within this framework, both the European strategy on employment and the European Social Fund are being called on to play an important role.
The second important issue is that the Commission, on the orders of the European Council, is continuing to apply the coordination method.
In 2005, we shall move to a new report on the monitoring of the systems, while the Social Protection Committee will examine the contribution of social systems to the extension of working life.
Finally, we are constantly monitoring the indicators to which we committed in Barcelona and we have agreed on the need to increase the actual retirement age by five years by 2010.
To come back to what Mr Andersson said about the gender dimension. The gender dimension is most important in pension systems, especially in the private sector.
I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in the private sector there is no equal treatment of men and women, while account is mainly taken of the gender criterion when calculating pensions.
Two more points: the issue of enlargement, on which we have constant communication with the Member States, so that they can also integrate the issue of mobility.
The report refers in detail to how we can overcome the obstacles which exist in the labour market in Europe and with mobility, which is an issue for which we have drawn up a ten-year action plan.
. (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank Mr Andersson warmly for his excellent cooperation which is, among other things, evident from the fact that he has adopted the women's amendments and inserted them in his own report.
The Commissioner has stated that the pension schemes are in crisis, and I share her view.
The costs of pensions will put pressure on the Stability Pact and, in a previous term of office, I occasionally referred to this as 'a bomb under the EURO'.
Many countries are taking measures for that reason, and because of many of these measures, women are hit harder than other groups in the population.
As a result of a lower participation rate in the labour force, a higher percentage of women working part-time, the lower incomes and the slower rise in income (due, among other things, to maternity leave), many women receive lower pensions than men, on average.
According to the report by the Commission, this difference varies from approximately 16 to 45% depending on the Member State in question.
There is also the issue of equal treatment.
In this context, I should like to make a reference to America.
There is a judgment by the Supreme Court that stipulates that calculating contributions towards, and payments of, supplementary pensions differently on the basis of gender-based actuarial factors is in contravention of the Civil Rights Act.
Hopefully, this view will be generally held in Europe too.
The fact that, according to a recent hearing, it transpired that women no longer live all that much longer than men at all, should be added to this.
I should also like to draw your attention to a regrettable fact, namely that the Commission has never implemented Parliament's proposals to force Member States to make arrangements to deal with the problem that parts of the pension rights accrued during marriage are at risk of being lost in periods when one of the partners decides to care for the other.
I should also like to urge Member States to ensure that people continue to remain part of pension accrual schemes during maternity leave or care leave for children or other dependants.
This is already the case in a number of countries, and I think that those countries set a good example for other Member States that have not done this to date.
Member States should promote the individualisation of pension rights, without abolishing the derived rights of the surviving spouse and children.
As I have stated before, it is an all-embracing problem, in fact, whereby, often, women are at greater risk of losing out than others.
I therefore agree that we should promote labour mobility and in the light of this, I should like ?
Thank you, Mr President, I notice that my three minutes are up.
Finally, I hope that the Commissioner will particularly take the position of women into consideration.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, for his endeavours and his achievement in putting together a report which received almost unanimous support in the vote in committee.
I hope that the same thing will happen in tomorrow's vote.
I am equally pleased to pay tribute to Commissioner Diamantopoulou for having endeavoured thus far and for continuing to make every effort to ensure that the reforms which the 15 Member States are attempting to carry out do not bring extreme poverty for the elderly, who are already too poor and, in many of these States, whose only source of income is their pension.
That said, I would like to advocate a different course of action to fulfil the commendable desire to provide secure, funded pensions in the future.
It is absolutely vital that we stop the wastage taking place in the different pension systems of the States of Europe.
It is absolutely vital that we reduce the cost of labour, which is so great in many of our States as to make it difficult for European States to compete on the world market economy.
In Italy, for example, each worker carries pension costs of 34%, in Switzerland, contributions of just 10% lead to pensions which are just as respectable as Italian pensions, and, in Portugal, for example, the figure is 7.6%.
This means that we must investigate where it is that the money is being wasted, where the inefficiency lies and where changes need to be made.
Moreover, I would like to say that there are two ways of paying debts: there are debtors who, when they have to pay the debt which has fallen due, do not show up and run away; then there are others who do without a summer holiday and give up their car in order to pay their debts.
The debtors are our 15 States and the creditors are people - pensioners and elderly people - who live off their pensions.
We must not bury our heads in the sand but endeavour to pay off the debts we have incurred with the elderly people of today.
Mr President, few things concern the European citizens more than the health of their pensions, few things in their family life or their social life demands such constant attention throughout their lives, perhaps because for millions and millions of Europeans pensions are the only significant asset they accumulate and the only security they have against the risks of biological life or economic life.
This excellent report by Mr Andersson is the culmination of a legislature of the European Parliament during which we have brought our agenda into line with the agenda of the citizens.
This is an important legislature because the European Parliament, also following excellent communications and excellent initiatives from the Commission, has introduced the issue of pensions into the Community agenda for the first time.
We are extremely happy that at the end of this legislature progress has been made on a philosophy which has radically increased the appreciation of this phenomenon.
It is no longer just a concern inspired by financial considerations or the balance of public finances.
We now have a doctrine, a strategy, which together with this important issue, we have enriched and supplemented with the objectives and needs of the European citizens.
We are therefore pleased that this report and the Commission's Communication have analysed the strategies of the Member States, taking account of financial viability of course!
Perhaps in this way we are also demonstrating that we are responsible politicians.
There are basically two categories of politician: there are irresponsible politicians, who only think about the next elections, and there are responsible politicians who think about the next generations.
The Andersson report is thinking about the next generations, but is also thinking about bringing things up to date so that social security, pensions, fulfil our objectives and combat poverty.
It also thinks about modernisation and categories of workers, particularly women, who face such risks in the new social order and the labour market.
What does the Commission tell us about the situation of our Member States?
We can see that there is a will, but we can also see that there is sometimes apathy and a lot of prudence; and I would also add that there is fear of reform in the Member States, perhaps because the population is afraid that reform may in fact be an excuse to talk about cuts in their social rights.
It is therefore very important that we help to overcome these fears amongst the population by presenting reforms which are not just cuts, but which are aimed at satisfying their current and future needs within a more secure, fair and equitable framework.
Tomorrow, the Socialist Group will support the Andersson report and the work of the Commission because we believe that in fact the changes proposed are not frivolous, or opportunistic, but that they respond to our social commitment to this generation of workers, to these citizens, and also to those who will live in Europe in the next generation.
Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank Mr Andersson for his very clear and well set-out report, and the Commission for a very interesting report on European pensions systems.
How countries organise their pensions systems falls within the sphere of national competences, but I think that the report, with its objectives of adequate, sustainable pensions and flexible pensions systems may provide inspiration and give rise to sensible debates at national level.
I also think that an interesting conclusion has been reached, namely that, in general, there is a high degree of redistribution and solidarity in the Member States' pensions systems, but that women are disadvantaged in many countries because of their special position in the labour market.
Something needs to be done about this, and I am pleased about the strong emphasis placed here upon the need to press for something to be done about the matter.
I therefore very much agree with the overall conclusion of Mr Andersson's report.
On the other hand, I disagree with a number of the amendments before us from the left side of the House where the investment of pensions savings in shares and bonds is clearly seen as an evil in itself.
It is true that there have been problems with pension funds, which have suffered large losses in connection with the large falls in share prices, but I do not think that the answer is to stop introducing savings schemes for pensions.
On the contrary, I think that better control of the risk in connection with pension funds' investments must be ensured and that there must be stronger supervision on the part of the authorities.
That is also something we can cooperate on at EU level in order to guarantee better risk management.
We are all, of course, getting older, and it is not too much to ask that each of us take joint responsibility for saving up for old age and help ensure that future generations do not have unreasonable burdens placed upon them, for it is also a question of distribution between the generations.
Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Mr Andersson stresses the need to take account of the poverty suffered by many pensioners and the inequalities between the pension entitlements of men and women.
With this in mind he recommends a sufficient level of minimum guarantee pensions and increasing the employment level among women in a bid to promote equal opportunities.
I and my group agree with these parts of the report.
Mr Andersson even indicates that he is anxious to ensure that a balance is struck between social and financial concerns.
Unfortunately, this undertaking is contradictory and causes the rapporteur to call into question fundamental social principles in the name of financial criteria.
Indeed the vote in the committee was not unanimous.
We did not vote in favour of this report in the parliamentary committee because it supports the Commission's proposal to raise the retirement age.
In so doing, it aligns itself with the liberal approach, manifest at many European Councils in the past, which advocates greater flexibility and increased working time.
We are opposed to this kind of reform, which imposes increased working time and yet does nothing to resolve the employment issue.
The report claims that the Member States have taken measures that are heading in the right direction, which is to say towards increased working time.
Given that a majority of workers in France, Austria and Germany have demonstrated that they reject a move towards increased working time and funded pension provision, do we wish to settle the European debate on pensions without public involvement?
With my group's support, we are tabling amendments that seek to reflect these aspirations.
In them, we of course oppose raising the statutory retirement age and extending the contributions period.
We are also opposed to funded pension provision, which provides no guarantee of an income and undermines the principle of solidarity inherent in pay-as-you-go schemes.
We propose that contributions be calculated taking into account how hard the work is and the number of dependent children.
Finally, we propose studying new ways of financing legal pension schemes.
The argument of increased life expectancy is used to broach the issue of funded pension schemes; this does little to mask the financial appetites of multinationals in favour of this option.
There are other ways to resolve the issue of financing in the long term that are more viable and characterised by greater solidarity.
We propose, for example, extending social security contributions to all revenue, with the amount adjusted depending on whether the companies are creating jobs or not.
These proposals do not appear to me to be entirely irresponsible.
In conclusion, I would say that faced with mounting criticism of the choices made in this field by Europe's Heads of State or Government, what matters now is to listen to the demands that people are making and not to go against them, unless we wish to see the people of Europe grow even more disaffected with the Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Andersson, first of all, thank you for the work of both the rapporteur and the Commission.
I welcome the fact that we are gradually applying the open coordination method to pensions.
It is not so much a debate as a beginning.
I do not know what we should do in the long term with regard to the accessibility, financability and modernisation of pensions.
The proposal offers, among other things, a number of guidelines.
In my view, the benefit of the Commission proposal is that it gives a good insight into what is going on and that it contains a first set of measures.
However, as I have already stated, they are long-term measures.
Mr Cercas may well make a comment with regard to the next generation, but that is precisely the problem that we will be facing.
In the short term, we are having to deal with a labour market that is silting up in many parts of Europe and the solution of getting people to work for longer is not effective in the short term.
Mrs Ainardi has already pointed out that there are a number of problems in a number of Member States, including France and Austria.
In the Netherlands, 20 000 people have taken to the streets in protest against the largely Liberal Christian-Democratic government that has thought out all kinds of measures to encourage the participation of the elderly in the labour market in the long term.
For example, by cutting back on early retirement, the early retirement scheme (VUT), extended unemployment benefit (WW), general unemployment benefit and similar schemes.
In this connection, it has, by the way, left no scope for circumventing these measures.
This means that people are currently protesting against a government in the Netherlands that is intent on taking measures of this kind.
As I stated before, 20 000 demonstrators have taken to the streets in protest.
Short-term policy is the missing link and, in that sense, the report by Jan Andersson is, in fact, a shallow report for problems of this type.
I am stating the facts as they are.
The report is not a disaster.
It is a first step.
In the coming period, however, something should be added.
And this will bring with it all kinds of problems.
I agree on increasing the effective pensionable age, but, at the moment, we should just see how things pan out, and alternatives will therefore need to be developed to ensure that short-term and long-term policy are balanced out more effectively.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commissioner and, in particular, the rapporteur for his work on this issue.
In one sense, we tend to forget what it was like at the end of the 19th century when the elderly, the sick or the unemployed had no protection whatsoever until a miserly amount of money was introduced in the late 1870s to try to give some protection to older people.
Fortunately we, as a society, have developed in our attitude towards giving future protection to the elderly, those in need of pensions and the most vulnerable within our society.
One thing that we have all recognised in the past is that we have not made proper provision for the future needs of changing demographics, a reducing workforce in certain cases and limits in taxation expenditure.
We are now faced with what appears to be a sudden problem on account of the large population.
But if you ask an anthropologist or anyone involved in any of the sciences, this was highlighted 15 years ago as an issue to be dealt with by 2015.
It is only now that we are beginning to take action on it.
In particular, I would point out that Mr Andersson has put forward a balanced proposal in his report.
He has looked at creating solutions to the problems that we now face.
In fairness to him - and I do not agree with everything that he says on most occasions - he has also brought forward short-term, medium-term and long-term priorities that must be carried out.
In Ireland we have a system whereby we are now putting 1% of GDP towards our future pension requirements every single year.
It gives a guarantee to those people who will need pensions in the future.
One area we must look at is ensuring that the pension is set at a proper, reasonable standard of living to allow people to have independence and freedom of choice.
Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur warmly for this work that is partly his own and partly the work of others.
This is why I should also like to extend a warm thank you to Mr Fatuzzo for his contribution.
In my view, it is a little bit of a mixture of the best that the Italian and Swedish cultures have to offer.
Milan meets MalmÃ¶, if you like.
As far as I am concerned, this work should be kept more or less unchanged.
It is extremely regrettable that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left should have tabled these amendments.
I have to say, I have listened with great interest to Mrs Ainardi, who reminded me of Louis XVIII who returned after the revolution and of whom people said that he had learned nothing and forgotten everything.
I find it even more deplorable that Mr Bouwman appears keen to associate himself with this statement.
We are facing real problems in Europe in the area of pensions.
Naturally, we could maintain the pension system, but the best way of eventually destroying it is to do what has been proposed in the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group: to act as if nothing is wrong, while the system does show up inadequacies.
After all, when this system was agreed upon, the average lifespan was 63 years, two years under 65.
Fortunately, the average lifespan is quite a bit longer now.
In the light of this, it is unacceptable for us to say that we could carry on as we are for ever.
Mr Andersson is pointing in a certain direction, and this direction receives our support.
Pension schemes are slightly different in every country and cannot be compared, but the worst thing is that some people are behaving as some did on the Titanic who, when the ship was sinking, thought that nothing was wrong.
This is dangerous.
I hope that the majority of this Parliament - and I have every faith in them - want to distance themselves from attitudes of this kind and want to commit themselves to the people who really matter.
After all, poor people will not gain in any way if there is no money left in the end.
Mr President, I join with everyone else in congratulating Mr Andersson on the production of an excellent piece of work.
I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for their joint report.
It really does provide an excellent overview of this very important subject.
I hope that you, Mr President, can pass on a request to DG I that maybe one of these days they could organise a daytime debate for an important social dossier such as this one.
We are supposed to be building bridges back to the citizens. This is a subject that matters to many millions of citizens.
It is a shame that it is tucked away in a night sitting once again.
The Andersson report really underlines the need for both the employment strategy and the Lisbon strategy to begin to deliver in several important respects: continuing gross gender inequality in terms of access to and participation in the labour market is reflected in gross gender inequality in pension entitlement.
Even if we achieve the Lisbon target of 60% for labour market participation by women, the target itself acknowledges the fact that women's participation will continue to be less than men's.
We therefore need to consider flanking measures along the lines suggested in the report by, for example, promoting the individualisation of pension rights and urging Member States to guarantee continuity of membership of pension schemes during parental leave or leave to take care of children or other dependants.
A second problem highlighted by Mr Andersson, and one that we really have to redouble our efforts to tackle, is the need to raise the effective retirement age, not the statutory retirement age.
There is some confusion in certain quarters on that.
There is now a widespread early retirement culture within the Union.
Sustained long-term efforts will be needed to change attitudes and tackle that culture.
But there are few signs that we are even beginning to make a start in doing that.
The joint employment report from the Commission for 2002 reported that only four Member States have put in place fully-fledged national active ageing strategies.
The same report showed that the efforts of most Member States to provide education and training to older age groups are still woefully inadequate.
The Commission must, in its next round of recommendations examining the achievements of Member States against the set guidelines, make the strongest possible recommendations against Member States who continue to fail to deliver in these and other important respects.
The final point of the report I should like to emphasise concerns atypical workers.
Their insecurity in the labour market - and many of them are women - will be reflected again in continuing insecurity in their later years, in the decades ahead, unless something is done to lessen that insecurity.
It is a terrible shame that several Member State governments - my own included - have set their hearts and minds against the proposed directive on temporary employment agency workers.
The longer it is delayed the more the earlier directives on part-time and fixed-term working will be undermined, as temporary agency working becomes the favoured choice for employers for whom the word 'flexibility' means squeezing the maximum out of labour for the least possible reward.
Temporary agency working would become an ever-growing bottom tier in a two-tier labour force.
In the end the whole of European society would face the consequences.
I hope even at this late stage that the governments concerned - including my own - might see sense and help us put in place a sensible piece of legislation to reinforce the point that flexibility can actually be a positive concept for both employers and workers.
Mr President, pensions schemes, administered through common and universal public programmes, are acknowledged as a fundamental means of achieving social inclusion.
Without pensions, benefits and other forms of social assistance, poverty levels in the European Union would exceed 40%.
Any modernisation of state social security systems must, therefore, take this fact into account.
This has not happened in most Member States introducing such reforms.
The stubborn resistance of workers to measures threatening their fundamental rights in this regard is well-known.
The cases of France, Portugal, Germany and Greece have already been mentioned here.
In this report, however, not enough is done to avoid these positions, which lead to the impairment of rights and welfare cover.
Hence the set of proposals we have tabled, of which I would like to highlight the following:
a reference to the growing difficulties faced by pension funds in the wake of the worldwide stock market slump, which provides ample proof that the growing risks of the financial market have an adverse effect on the adequacy and sustainability of funded pension provision;
a critique of the antisocial nature of most reforms recently implemented by certain Member States, which have reduced state pensions considerably and attempted to raise the retirement age;
a note on the importance of adopting strategies for reforming pension schemes at European and national levels, promoting full employment along with social rights which strengthen and reinvigorate state pension schemes by broadening their financial bases, by ensuring that employers comply with their financial obligations, and by enhancing pay-as-you-go mechanisms;
lastly, a rejection of all attempts aiming to weaken or replace state schemes based on the principles of pay-as-you-go and solidarity, pointing out that, in order to guarantee pension schemes in the long term, it is vital to broaden the scope of their eligibility criteria and investigate new ways of financing statutory pension schemes, in particular by extending welfare contributions to all financial returns and establishing modulation for companies on the basis of the number of jobs created.
Mr President, I also congratulate the Commission and the Council on the quality of their joint report, and especially the rapporteur on his own powerful report on this key issue.
I trust that Member States in particular will take note that the problem of adequate and sustainable pensions is a problem today, will be an even bigger problem tomorrow, and requires action now.
I particularly commend the rapporteur on the way he has worked hard to absorb amendments from colleagues from different parties, who also care strongly about this issue.
Indeed I am grateful that he has seen fit to accept five of mine: on defining the objective; to provide adequate and fair incomes to older people and prevent poverty in old age; on defining the gravity of the problem; on the importance of promoting pension portability; and, in particular, on the disgrace that certain EU institutions continue to discriminate against allowing older workers to apply for jobs - a point I have raised on several occasions with Commissioner Kinnock with, I regret to say, only bluster in response.
Because the rapporteur has accepted so much it would probably be churlish of me to lament his non-acceptance of my amendment declaring that secure, inflation-proof pensions for public sector workers, such as Members of this Parliament, are seen as increasingly unfair by those in company schemes that depend on stock market performance in the real world.
I believe we should show that we recognise this.
It is, after all, the reality.
Having said that, his report recognises much that is a problem.
It also seeks to focus attention on what needs to be done.
In the next 50 years the number of over-65s will double from 25% to perhaps 50% of the population.
In rural areas, including large parts of my own constituency of the West Midlands, the percentage could be higher still.
His report deserves support from across this House.
He certainly has mine.
Mr President, the key point that Mr Andersson made in his contribution tonight is the need to get the social and financial concerns in balance.
Clearly there is a need for both. It seems to me that one of the key issues here, at least in relation to poverty in old age, relates to women.
All the statistics show that because of intermittent work, breaks in their employment record, family care commitments etc. they by and large end up in a poorer situation than men. Add to that the fact that they also survive longer than men, and the result is greater numbers of older women than men after a certain age.
There is a need for us to address the question of funding of pensions.
As Mr Crowley has mentioned, in Ireland we have introduced a reserve fund where 1% of GDP is set aside each year, and there are some billions in this fund now; in fact there is so much money in it that people are beginning to fight over how and where it should be invested.
Nevertheless it is an attempt to ensure that there is a fund there for the future.
We are fortunate in that we have a demographic lag of about 20 to 25 years, so that the bulge that is hitting the rest of Europe at the moment will not hit Ireland for some time yet.
Nevertheless we expect it will arrive.
Another attempt to deal with this issue is the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, where individuals, with the assistance of their employer, can open an account and put money in it which will provide some pension funding for them at a certain point.
The difficulty is that the financial institutions which are given responsibility for selling these products are in many cases resisting them because they cannot make enough money out of the categories of people that they are aimed at, mainly the lower income section of the workforce.
There is a need to address that issue.
The point I am making here is that there is no need for us to be unduly pessimistic providing we make the policy choices now about what we are going to face in the future.
It is not enough for us to wring our hands, it is not enough for Member States, as Mr Hughes has pointed out, to oppose the temporary agency workers directive - which provides some degree of security for certain categories of workers - and then pretend that they are going to do something serious about pensions, when in fact they are undermining the possibility for many thousands of people to have sufficient contributions, even for a State pension.
To conclude, there really is a need for some joined-up thinking in this area.
Mr President, I and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left take the basic view that a pensions system must be based upon solidarity between the generations.
I am therefore in favour of a 'pay as you go' system, which is much more stable.
Savings systems, which are dependent in one way or another upon the capital markets, constitute a much more unstable project.
In my own country of Sweden, which has been singled out as a model in certain quarters, we have moved in the direction of a capitalisation of pensions arrangements and of greater dependency upon the capital markets.
With the victory for the 'no' side in the Swedish referendum on the euro, we have obtained slightly greater freedom when it comes both to economic and to pensions policy.
I believe it was precisely that which the Swedish 'no' voters wanted: greater freedom of action, and solidarity as a feature of development in Sweden.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
I would like to begin by saying that retirement, while still being a technical/legal and economic/actuarial issue, has become an issue of the greatest media interest and has won the status as a central issue within policy in general, and within social policy in particular.
Back in 1950, the age of sixty was regarded as the threshold of old age; the age of 65 implied retirement from active working life, and not to have a will drawn up by the age of seventy would unquestionably have been considered recklessly irresponsible.
We can conclude from this that the population of our current society, which has doubled by the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, includes many people of a very advanced age, who until recently were classified as 'old people', and those older people have a strong social image, they are real, they have active lives and have good reason to hope to continue living.
Within this context, a long-term perspective is necessary in the field of pensions and, despite the fact that dealing with pensions and pension policy are essentially the responsibility of the Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the European contribution appears to be necessary, both in the exchange of best practices and in increasing consensus, and in the common regulation of certain aspects necessary in order to ensure the possibility of transferring pension rights of all types and their viability.
Pension systems through public schemes linked to income - first pillar - through private professional schemes - second pillar - and individual retirement pension funds - third pillar - must offer Europeans the opportunities to maintain their standard of living following retirement.
A system which prevents or hinders the free movement of people must therefore be excluded, as must the European citizens' fear of ageing or physical or psychological deterioration.
In the face of the weight of the third pillar, fear must be alleviated and business interests excluded.
The viability of the pension system must be guaranteed, and it must respond to changes in society and in the ways in which production is organised: the greater presence of women, an older active population and atypical forms of contract.
Mr President, the proposals contained in this report simply relay the retrograde policy pursued by all of the European Union's Member States on pensions.
In seeking to increase the effective retirement age, in wishing to extend time at work, in proposing even to replace pay-as-you-go pension schemes with funded pension provision, the rapporteur vindicates and harmonises the attacks on workers.
The rapporteur is cynical enough to observe that the increase in the number of pensioners and their increased life expectancy will put considerable pressure on pay-as-you-go pension schemes.
Should we therefore wish for lower life expectancy and for a fall in the number of pensioners so as to save money?
If the fruits of productivity were distributed differently, with a little less being given to employers and the wealthiest members of society so as to enable workers who have spent their lives making them rich to grow old with dignity, there would be no problem in providing an increasing number of pensioners with a proper pension.
However, your economy does not serve to satisfy the needs of a majority as best possible, but to make a minority rich more effectively.
Mr President, I wish in my speech to focus attention on Mr Jan Andersson's excellent report on adequate and sustainable pensions.
It is good that Parliament is taking an active part in the pensions debate, because pensions and how we pay for them will be one of the biggest social and economic challenges of the decades to come.
Old age these days no longer means poverty, because statutory public pension schemes and the private occupational pension schemes and private insurance policies that supplement them are a guarantee to many Europeans that they can maintain their standard of living even after retirement.
The generation gap must nevertheless be narrowed by means of vigorous pension scheme reforms, so that increased pensions do not become a burden on the shoulders of younger generations.
Four factors will jeopardise state pension schemes if no reforms are made. These are the ever-increasing life expectancy rate combined with low birth rates, substantial long-term unemployment and people entering employment late in life.
The baby-boom generation is beginning to retire in this decade and by 2050 the number of those in receipt of a pension in relation to those of working age will have doubled.
In some Member States pension schemes paid for out of public funds are estimated to rise to one fifth of GNP.
In my opinion, European pension schemes have, in the main, achieved their social goals.
To strengthen pension provision, however, the priorities are that the age of retirement must be raised, the range of supplementary forms of finance must be increased, and there has to be an increase in long-term private savings.
At Community level we need coordination in the taxation of occupational pensions to make it easier for people to move from one country to another and comprehensive internal market legislation for institutions offering occupational retirement provision.
At European Union level we can play a part in defusing the pensions bomb by promoting the development of cross-border personal pensions and savings schemes.
I hope that Parliament will, on the strength of this excellent report by Mr Andersson, also play an active role regarding these matters in the future.
Mr President, the European Union considers that pensions are yet another expense which needs to be cut back within the framework of the financial discipline imposed by the Stability Pact and is indifferent to the needs of those who have retired from work.
On the pretext of the ageing population, it is promoting an increase in the retirement age, an extension of working life, cutbacks in pensions, the dissociation of pensions and wages and increased financial contributions by workers.
At the same time, the European Union and the Member States, with the recent reforms, are using pensions to support the profitability of big business.
They are reducing employer benefits and offering them the resources and reserves of the pension funds, promoting the spread of professional pension funds and forcing workers to rely on private insurance schemes, thereby exposing their pensions to the risks inherent in the financial markets.
We support a different policy, where pensions will respond to modern social needs.
We and the workers are calling for a reduction in the retirement age and working life, for pension funds to be financed from the national budget and for an increase in employers' contributions, coupled with a reduction in employees' contributions.
This sort of social insurance system can only be imposed by the workers, by fighting against the choices of big business and the European Union.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
The next item is the report (A5-0302/2003) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the draft Council directive restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (8084/2003 C5-0192/2003 1997/0111(CNS)).
. Mr President, after more than six years of negotiation the Council has finally reached a compromise on energy taxation.
Because the compromise text significantly modifies the Commission's 1997 proposal, the Commission has asked the Council to reconsult Parliament.
I am convinced that Parliament and the Commission share the same analysis: all of us would have preferred a more ambitious compromise, especially as far as the approximation of tax rates is concerned.
This is mainly due to the decision-making process and the unanimity requirements in the Council.
Co-decision and qualified majority voting would undoubtedly have led to a better result for the internal market.
However, I am very happy to see that Parliament's committees responsible for the analysis of the text - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy - have supported the compromise.
This future directive remains a positive step, both for the internal market and for sustainable development policies.
To that extent, nothing has changed in comparison with the rapporteur's view on the initial proposal in the 1998/1999 session.
As you may remember, Mr President, it was said then that the proposal was 'modest but useful'.
Now I should like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs, Mr Jonckheer and Mr Caudron, for their speedy examination of the text.
It is of crucial importance that the opinion of Parliament be adopted as soon as possible, so as to allow the directive to enter into force on the scheduled date, 1 January 2004.
I will reply at the end of the debate giving the Commission's opinion on some of the amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you yourself underlined, this proposal goes back a long way.
I will not go back over its entire history, but I would like to stress, in connection with what you have just said, that in 1999 the European Parliament adopted a report, for which Mr Pat Cox was the rapporteur, which improved the Commission's proposal, in particular in three respects: Parliament asked for an increase in all of the minimum rates stated in the Commission's proposal; it also called for these minima to be index-linked, and finally, it called for the number of derogations and exemptions to be reduced.
As you yourself pointed out, we have had to wait four years for the Council to reach an agreement and for Parliament to be re-consulted.
In general, the report seeks to support the compromise struck in the Council - acting, as you said, under the constraint of unanimity - despite the text's serious shortcomings, the Council of Ministers not having in fact taken on board the proposals made in the Cox report in 1999.
I should like to focus on two points amongst many where the position adopted by the Council appears to us to be weak.
Firstly, the minimum rates set by the Council to be applied from 1 January 2004 are, almost without exception, lower than those proposed by the Commission in 1997 and by the European Parliament in 1999.
Such a step backwards stands in flagrant contradiction to the undertaking given by the Council, and in particular the European Council, to provide instruments that seek to break the link between economic growth and energy consumption.
The second issue that we have addressed is that of derogations and exemptions.
The text of the directive is littered with them.
The Council has added an annex with a virtual shopping list of individual exemptions and derogations so that each of the 15 Member States can find what they want in the list and can therefore agree to the text.
Having referred to the position adopted by Parliament in 1999 and taken into consideration new political material such as the Gothenburg European Council's declaration in favour of a Sustainable Development Strategy, as rapporteur I therefore proposed to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we should reinforce Council's position on certain points, while retaining a moderate stance bearing in mind the different political sensitivities.
In particular, I proposed bringing forward the second step of motor fuel taxation and the revision of tax rates by two years.
I also proposed a sunset clause for all derogations, whereby exemptions and derogations could only be maintained if the Council explicitly so decided.
Finally, I proposed making it mandatory to support renewable sources of energy.
In principle all renewable sources of energy should be fully exempt.
I confess that it came as an unpleasant surprise when all of the amendments were rejected by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - and I do not share your approval, Commissioner.
It is true that in many cases they were rejected by a majority of one single vote and that not all Members of the committee were present.
I therefore think that the logical step for me, as rapporteur, is to re-table these amendments in the plenary.
In addition, Commissioner, I would draw your attention to Amendment No 2, tabled by Mrs Kauppi and adopted by the committee.
If it were to be confirmed in the plenary it would mean that Parliament was denying the very timeliness of this proposal for a directive because we recently adopted a directive on emissions trading.
In conclusion, I hope that Parliament's vote in September 2003 does not represent a retreat from its 1999 position, although this was adopted, it is true, during a different term of office.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my task this evening is a simple one: it is to give you an account of the unanimous votes in the ITRE Committee in favour of my report for opinion and all of my amendments, apart from one, in relation to the Council's common position of 3 April 2003.
As everyone has said, the Council took a great deal of time to reach this agreement, since the Commission's initial proposal dates back to 1997 and Mr Pat Cox's report to 1999.
Despite this, we agreed to play ball and treat this as a matter of urgency given that it is clearly in the general European interest to do so.
Although there are many areas with which I and my fellow Members are dissatisfied, as rapporteur, so as not to threaten the agreement in the Council, I only proposed amendments that enhance that agreement.
Although the agreement reached by the Council does not go as far as the Commission's 1997 proposal or the European Parliament's vote in 1999, it still remains a first step, in my view and that of my fellow Members, towards establishing a common framework for taxation in Europe.
The amendments adopted by unanimity improve it by providing for time limits for exemptions, so that the exemptions do not become the rule; by specifying units of measurement and by reinforcing the political signal in favour of biofuels.
I dare to hope therefore, ladies and gentlemen, that when Mr Jonckheer's report is put to the vote tomorrow the plenary will confirm an agreement that is for the time being, admittedly, minimalist, by seeing it as part of an ongoing process to serve the interests of the environment in Europe.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Jonckheer for his excellent work and I think the directive, as it was approved in the committee, is very good.
In my opinion, it is a good and positive sign that an attempt is being made to harmonise the environmental point of view with healthy competition in the energy markets.
Common minimal levels of energy taxation are needed and the polluter pays principle is important, as long as we remember to give attention to the effects on competition and employment.
Furthermore, emissions trading, which is beginning to be implemented, is an important means of regulation, and we can therefore also avoid regulation overlapping with it, as would be the case with taxation of energy products and the various exemptions proposed thereto.
In the matter of energy taxation, in general renewable natural resources should be treated favourably, and in the same way there should be tax relief on new fuels that are particularly environmentally friendly.
In this way we can use financial incentives to steer both consumers and industry in the direction of environmentally friendly energy use.
The Commission proposal on tax incentives with regard to certain biofuels is worthy of our firm support.
Although this directive does not directly deal with hydrogen, for example, it is a good, and will in the future be, an important energy source that in time could clearly replace oil for transport in particular.
It is obviously worth supporting hydrogen in matters of taxation.
We have to remember, however, that any form of taxation that deviates from neutral taxation has an impact on market activity and for that reason any such support measures as these should be temporary and exceptional in nature, in order to promote new fuels and production methods.
The troubled aviation industry has enjoyed tax exemptions on air fuel for a long time.
Taxation in this area is a problematic issue because aircraft can choose fairly freely where to refuel.
If a tax were imposed on air fuel within the EU but not outside it, this would lead to refuelling outside the Union.
That is why the international agreement on the tax-exempt status of air fuels should be respected.
The Member States have a right they must not lose to decide themselves on taxes on fuels for local use.
These fuels, such as peat, for example, which is important in my country, are of no importance to a viable internal market, but at local level they may well be very important and necessary sources of energy and employment.
In Finland and the other Nordic countries taxes on energy are already widely applied, so these countries would have no problem with even shorter periods of transition.
I, however, have yielded to the will of the majority in my group. My group is not in favour of a shorter timescale, as Mr Jonckheer has proposed.
In other words, I personally would have been prepared to go further in this.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, and I share his disappointment on the minimum solution.
Commissioner Bolkestein also made it very clear that this minimum solution is a small breakthrough, but that the European Union has not actually succeeded in a consistent approach to energy taxation.
This consistent approach remains coherent though, and after the experience with fiscal coordination we can almost be grateful because once again we had to experience how much the unanimity rule in fiscal decision-making hampers the functioning of the internal market.
It is extremely regrettable that the fourth Environment Action Programme, which envisaged that sustainable development and economy could be stimulated not only by environmental regulation but also by tax regulation, could not be implemented, and so this directive's tale of woe goes further back than just 1999.
Furthermore, the directive also has the defects - as has already been said - of low minimum rates, non-indexation of minimum rates and also the difficulty of derogations.
We have already debated the issue of derogations on several occasions in this House.
I believe that we have actually always agreed that there have to be derogations for energy intensive enterprises, but that these derogations should at least incorporate conditions enabling the situation to be tackled.
This has not happened, and so this directive is bound soon to be followed by another.
What is positive is that this directive is not only a framework for the taxation of all types of energy, including electricity, but that at the same time it also supports the promotion of renewable sources of energy and thereby will surely be able to give additional impetus to further develop these renewable sources of energy.
That is a good thing, because we know that it is renewable energy that gives not only Europe, but also world civilisation, a chance, since we all profit from the tax incentives for using environmentally friendly forms of energy.
Actual primary energy generally costs nothing, and furthermore it can be obtained and converted where energy consumption takes place.
Thus the steering effect of tax incentives for energy use is an important addition to the EU Environmental policy and, I believe, also to emissions trading.
Rather than seeing this as a contradiction, here too, I see it as adding to the instruments that steer our European economies and lives towards sustainable development.
It is also to be welcomed that this directive will make possible the final implementation of measures for preferential tax treatment for biofuels, on which we have already agreed, but the regulation of which was, of course, coupled to general taxation.
I can also see that the goals that we set can be achieved.
I would just like to emphasise once again that in the past many Member States have taken advantage of the revenue effect of environmental taxes, in particular, energy taxes.
I welcome the fact that in the meantime we can at least have the possibility of reaching a European agreement.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work.
I share his view that the proposal is a small step in the right direction.
Mr Cox wrote a similar report as long ago as 1999.
If the Council had followed his directions, the basic conditions would have been different now.
Just as the Commissioner says, the long period required for discussing this issue shows how important it is for us to obtain a sensible decision-making procedure.
Today's environmental problems must be seen in a pan-European perspective.
The EU is a unique tool for creating common environmental rules.
The EU's environmental policy must be developed by means of more stringent minimum rules and environmental charges.
It must be possible to take decisions on such rules and charges by qualified majority voting.
As is well known, this is an extremely sensitive issue.
Some of my fellow MEPs visibly shake when EU taxes are mentioned.
I nonetheless hope that the Intergovernmental Conference can devise solutions when it comes to energy and environmental taxes, together with a robust decision-making system.
The EU's and the Member States' task in the energy sphere is to formulate requirements concerning safety and the environment, to check that the requirements are being complied with and to promote research and development in the energy sphere, aimed at replacing fossil-based energy production with environmentally friendly energy sources.
We should nonetheless be very careful that, with taxes as a weapon, we do not seriously reduce competition in the energy sphere.
A rational energy policy is best promoted through free trade and the free production of energy.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will support most of the amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jonckheer, ladies and gentlemen, last week, I was in Moscow with a delegation of this Parliament, where we tried to convince the Russian Parliament, the Duma, of the need to sign, as well as implement, the Kyoto Protocol, which was no mean feat.
We are asking the Russians to make an effort to combat climate change and environmental pollution.
I personally experienced the need for this in the form of a serious chest irritation during my stay in Moscow.
Even in Russia, a clean environment has a price tag, despite the pledges of financial support and cooperation.
To bring this need to attention in Moscow is all the more difficult, given the fact that we in the European Union are already so reluctant to pay a price for a better environment.
The Council's draft directive for energy taxation is a striking example of the lack of unanimity in making efforts to bring about a better environment.
An environmental tax on energy has been the subject of discussion and negotiation for more than ten years.
Only in the past six months, under Greek Presidency, did it seem possible to agree on a compromise text.
However, it became a compromise that left something to be desired.
My first observation is that the Council is still lacking the vision and audacity to take decisive action and move the tax pressure from the area of labour to environmental pollution.
In this way, employment can be promoted and environmental pollution given a real price.
A second point of criticism concerns the many interests of the Member States and industries which are taken into account in the proposal.
As a result, the proposal contains too many exceptions and exemptions.
As such, the amendments that aim to restrict the conditions for exceptions receive my support.
I should like to bring to your attention a few other matters.
First of all, I should like to argue in favour of biofuels being made exempt from energy taxation.
In that way, the development of these clean fuels is given a fair chance.
It would be quite ludicrous to grant subsidies to promote biofuels with one hand and levy taxes on these fuels with the other.
Secondly, I should like to point out that it is important for the proposal on emissions trading to be taken into consideration.
Both instruments can co-exist and complement each other.
I should like to warn the Council to ensure that the directives do not overlap during implementation.
Finally, in his report, the rapporteur argues in favour of abolishing the unanimity rule where tax matters are concerned.
Although I consider energy taxation to be a valuable instrument for reasons of content, I cannot share the view on the unanimity rule.
This is why I will not be supporting Amendment No 13 although I support the rest of Mr Jonckheer's report.
The idea of energy taxation as a supplement to the agreements that have been reached with regard to emissions trading has been mooted before.
It is time we were serious about its implementation.
Mr President, the matter now before us has been an awkward one for the Council.
Nevertheless, the long period of time during which the Council has considered the matter - one lasting more than five years - has been a disappointment.
Now is the time to put the disappointment to one side; making headway in the debate on the directive is the next step in an inevitable direction.
I am happy to note that it is just this sort of practical approach that we also see in the report drawn up by Parliament's rapporteur.
The Council has declared a commitment to adopt instruments to be able to decouple economic growth from energy consumption.
The Commission has also committed itself to such aims, and so has Parliament.
In principle it is therefore not an obstacle to significant change.
In practice it is sorely needed.
The directive now up for discussion offers an opportunity for this and it is our responsibility to implement it soon.
In the integrated European economy the solution must be more coherent than ever.
While energy taxation satisfies the parliamentary needs of Member States, at the same time it provides the means to lighten taxation on labour and employment and is an effective and precise tool for guidance in what is, ecologically speaking, the right direction.
Taxation on energy products is the link that has long been missing which ties all the small parts of sustainable development together.
I would furthermore like to raise the matter of the connection between energy taxation and the Directive on emissions trading that was recently completed.
Independent studies show that responding to the challenge of climate change will be most favourable in overall financial terms if the reduction for sectors outside the emissions trading scheme is set at the right level.
Cuts across the board will not bring that about: we need a comprehensive energy taxation system.
We have to ensure that each branch of industry falls within the ambit of either energy taxation or emissions trading.
That way, every company, through taxation, will be looking at a maximum price that is the equivalent of the marginal cost to society.
Europe needs an ambitious energy taxation system very quickly.
It would seem that the Commission and Parliament are to shoulder the responsibility for establishing one.
. Mr President, political realism has led the Commission to conclude that it is not appropriate at this stage to modify its proposal of 1997.
A formal modification of the Commission's proposal would significantly postpone the entry into force of the Directive, and might even endanger its adoption during this legislature.
But as the Council will be examining the proposed amendments in early October, the Commission will do its best to have the relevant amendments included in the Directive.
In that context, the Commission could agree in principle with amendments 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12 and 13.
Regarding amendment 2, I would like to point out that it is my intention to make a dedicated proposal on this subject early next year.
The real issue behind amendment 4 is that of establishing a common definition for reference units in the Directive.
The Commission is pursuing this goal in the Council's working group.
Furthermore, despite some sympathy with amendments 6, 9, 14 and 15, the Commission considers that reopening these issues might endanger the whole compromise.
Therefore, the Commission regrets that it cannot support these amendments.
The Commission furthermore does not support amendments 5, 10, 11, 16, 17 or18.
Thus far about the amendments.
I should also like to make a few general remarks.
Firstly, Members of Parliament will understand that this whole business is increasingly made difficult by the existence of the unanimity rule.
The Commission has proposed very modest changes to the unanimity rule in the form of qualified majority voting in the areas of simplification, modernisation, co-operation against fraud, and the establishment of a harmonised tax basis for company taxation.
However I am pessimistic as to the possibility of those very modest proposals being accepted.
It is regrettable, but it is the reality.
Lastly, I would direct a remark towards Mrs Kauppi.
Mrs Kauppi has said that hydrogen is a source of energy, but I am afraid that is not true.
Yes, one can use hydrogen in cars and maybe in the future in aeroplanes, but in order to use hydrogen one must first get it.
In order to produce hydrogen one needs electricity.
Therefore, I am afraid that whatever the advantages of the so-called hydrogen economy - and the Commission is fully aware of these advantages - let us not forget that in order to get hydrogen one must produce it and that costs electricity, a lot of electricity.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0062/2003 B5-0277/2003) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the transfer of personal data by airlines in the case of transatlantic flights.
. (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, since March of this year, the European Parliament and the Commissioner have come a great deal closer to each other in this matter.
That is to say, Mr Bolkestein has written an excellent letter to Mr Ridge, but the upshot of this is somewhat less convincing.
During your speech to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I gathered that you are serious about having Directive 95/46/EC and Regulation 22/99/89 observed.
Despite this, Mr President and Commissioner Bolkestein, we yesterday held a lengthy discussion in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs about a resolution in which we want to convey the fact that, in Europe, certain minimum standards must be observed.
This resolution could have been approved yesterday thanks to the level of unanimity within the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
I was of the opinion, though, that you should also have the opportunity of reacting to our questions, so that we can incorporate your reaction in our resolution.
Our objective is to announce a common position that we could also take to the United States because the negotiations that fundamentally matter must be brought to a successful conclusion over there.
In the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, a number of suggestions have been made, such as whether it would not be possible after all to put an end to the existing situation earlier than within the suggested two months, for example by imposing a push system on the airlines at this stage.
I should also like to ask you - since I could not make out clearly what you were saying in your contribution in the committee - whether you agree with us that we should develop a European standard as soon as possible on the basis of the recommendation of the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data - Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC.
Do you agree with us that we should only transmit limited information, as indicated on the passport and airline ticket?
The issue of data storage also requires further attention.
In my view, the period of storage should not exceed the duration of the stay.
Six to seven years is still far too long.
During the purchase of tickets, passengers must be made aware of the fact that this data is required.
It is also extremely important to our committee that passengers be given the opportunity of having incorrect data corrected promptly, efficiently and independently and that there be a clear judicial process in the US.
It is unacceptable for citizens to get into difficulty over there.
This matter has, meanwhile, also been raised at international level.
As you know, a conference took place in Sydney on 12 September last that involved the members of the data protection committee.
A resolution was adopted on this matter, and I should like to hear the opinion of the Commissioner about the proposal to conclude an international agreement in this area.
According to this resolution, such an international agreement should in any case contain the following components:
the required conditions for data protection;
the reason why the data is collated;
a defined list of the required data, which should not be excessive;
strict time limits for the storage period;
adequate information to the people in question;
and methods of rectifying any errors in the data.
This is, in fact, more or less what Parliament wants too.
What is your opinion about this and do you consider an international agreement to be a viable solution?
Furthermore, I should like to find out from Mr Bolkestein what he expects to achieve in the next two months with the United States, since hardly any headway has been made in the course of six months?
I should also like to point out to Mr Bolkestein that the course currently taken by matters has led to unrest in the US too.
A few days ago, I read in the paper that it had become known in the US that the airline company, Jet Blue, has secretly transmitted personal data of more than 1 million passengers to a bureau of the Pentagon.
The American Civil Liberties Association deems this a highly 'un-American system of border controls'.
A US citizen who was working in the World Trade Center on 11 September, and luckily survived, says that he can understand that safety is important, but that it should not be done in this way, for that is ludicrous!
The US is lobbying for its own standards, but should we not be doing the same thing in the US?
This brings me to another point which may not entirely fall within this Commissioner's remit: would it not be preferable for organised crime and terrorism to be fought by setting up a transatlantic system along the lines of the European Schengen system for the exchange of data on potentially dangerous persons?
In my view, the solution is two-pronged.
First of all, we need to regulate data protection effectively and then look for another way of fighting terrorism.
. Mr President, as I said to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on 9 September 2003, and in accordance with the messages I received from Members of Parliament on that occasion, the Commission is pursuing its negotiations with the American authorities which receive passenger name record data transferred from the European Union with a view to obtaining improved undertakings on four major issues.
First, I will touch upon purpose limitation.
So far, the United States has refused to limit its use of passenger name record data to the fight against terrorism.
The Americans also want to cover other serious domestic criminal offences.
So far, they have not been prepared to further narrow these down.
Second, as far as the scope of the data required is concerned, the United States requires 39 different PNR elements, which it is hard to regard as necessary for or proportionate to the purpose.
The Commission is seeking a reduction in the list of 39 data elements from the United States.
Thirdly, the data storage periods are still far too long.
Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has stressed that they last six to seven years.
Fourth, American undertakings are insufficiently legally-binding, since the available extra-judicial redress mechanisms are not fully independent.
Therefore we must insist that rights are, to the greatest possible extent, legally-binding and thus actionable before American courts.
Currently, we are working with the target date of Christmas 2003, the date that I set when I last spoke to the LIBE Committee.
Ideally, an adequacy decision should be well on track by that time.
An adequacy decision will only be possible, however, if the United States is ready to improve significantly its undertakings.
I must be frank with the House and say that I am not confident that we shall be able to secure the necessary significant improvements in order for the Commission to be able to make an adequacy finding.
However, progress in the United States' commitments is in any case necessary for any kind of solution, whatever its legal form - be it an adequacy finding or, if supported by the European Parliament, a bilateral international agreement.
The most recent step in our negotiations with the United States was the meeting which I held yesterday with Under Secretary Asa Hutchinson of the US Department of Homeland Security - he is the number two person in that department.
That was a useful meeting in which we discussed all the main issues and agreed to put our officials to work to make further efforts to find a solution in the coming weeks.
When I am in Washington in mid-October I expect to meet with senior Homeland Security officials, including, hopefully, Secretary Tom Ridge.
I emphasised to Mr Hutchinson yesterday the urgency of finding a solution - and of course I also referred to the serious concern with which PNR transfers are viewed in this Parliament.
I find it difficult to accept any remark that the Commission is tolerating the situation and not doing its job as Guardian of the Treaties.
As far as the Data Protection Directive is concerned, applying the law is a job for the Member States and their data protection authorities.
The Commission's immediate role is to ensure that it is the Member States that respect the directive, not the airlines.
But the problem, in any case, is not one that we can solve via purely intra-European means.
We have a conflict of laws with the United States and that is the heart of the matter.
In my talks with the United States authorities, I hope to be firm.
But being entirely inflexible on the European side will not necessarily obtain more flexibility from our counterparts.
Regarding passenger consent, which was mentioned by some Members as a possible way out - at least in the short term - this would not, in our view, constitute a legally-secure, longer-term solution.
First, making consent unambiguous would prove very burdensome in practice.
Second, the result would be a transfer of data that - despite being legal in the EU - would still lack any significant protection on the American side.
Therefore, securing the best possible undertakings from the United States on the way in which they will treat the data collected from EU citizens is much to be preferred.
The oral question submitted by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak also refers to what should happen if an adequacy finding cannot be reached by the end of the year.
She proposes to stop the data transfers that are not in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination, prior informed consent and an efficient appeals procedure, and to begin immediate negotiations on an international agreement with the United States.
These measures reflect to some extent the options for possible courses of action that I outlined in my meeting with the LIBE Committee earlier this month.
However, as I stressed then, we should be very prudent not to shoot ourselves in the foot.
Enforcement action may be superficially attractive, but it is not clear that its consequences would be those that we seek.
Therefore, let us cross that bridge when we come to it.
Political judgments will have to be exercised at the right moment.
It is clear that the course we shall follow will fully involve the Parliament and the Council.
I am sure we can all agree on the need to unite to combat terrorism. But we equally agree on the need to avoid security concerns becoming an excuse for dismantling our civil rights and liberties.
I should like to assure the House that the Commission will continue to devote its unstinting efforts to finding an agreed solution with the United States on this important but also very delicate issue.
The solution needs to be found as a matter of urgency, and must respect the law on both sides of the Atlantic.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a number of key dates have been mentioned repeatedly in this affair.
The first is, without a doubt, 5 March 2003, when the United States asked airlines operating between the United States and Europe to make available all the data relating to passengers: absolutely all the data, not just, as had been the case thus far, the data necessary for air transport agreements.
The second date is 15 March 2003.
Just a week later, with timing worthy of an even greater cause, Parliament adopted the resolution calling for enforcement of the 1995 directive and the 1989 regulation on the protection of privacy.
The third date is 23 September, today: six months after the adoption of the resolution, it would appear that nothing has changed; the United States has not responded to the Commission's demands.
We might ask whether the Americans are deaf or whether it is the Commission that is unable to find the rights words to get through to them.
Thus, still today, travellers to the United States find themselves asked, in addition to the usual general questions, about their religion, their taste in food, where they last went on holiday and their close and distant relatives.
That is certainly going too far.
It is right that the Commission should raise its voice, that Parliament should call for more resolute endeavours such as an international agreement, perhaps, as proposed by the resolution.
It would, however, seem appropriate to mention another date too: 11 September 2001.
As we all remember, it was then that strict controls started to be enforced.
Mindful of that appalling incident, I feel that perhaps we ought to be just a little more patient and realise that, behind what is certainly an annoying breach of confidentiality, there is still a great deal of fear.
In any case, as the Commissioner said, a little flexibility might facilitate dialogue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current situation is clearly unlawful.
There is no legal basis for giving the US authorities direct, unfiltered access to the personal data of European passengers and it is contrary to Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; it is contrary to the Community provisions on the protection of personal data; it is contrary to the Community Computer Reservations Systems Regulation.
Part of the responsibility for this unlawful situation lies with the European Commission, for the US legislation requiring the disclosure of this information dates back to November 2001 and was updated in May 2002, while the system did not enter into force until March 2003.
In the meantime, the Commission failed to inform Parliament of any of this and negotiated at senior-official level with the United States to achieve the joint statement of 18 February 2003 which, in practice, allowed the US authorities indiscriminate access to the personal data of European citizens collected by airlines for completely different purposes, even suggesting that national control authorities should not take action against airlines complying with the United States' requests.
Only the firm reaction of the European Parliament and said control authorities induced the Commission, at last, to acknowledge that the conditions of adequate protection required by Article 25 of the directive were not being met as regards the transmission of data collected in the Union.
I would, however, point out that, in the case of Italy, the ban by the control authority on access to data collected by the company, Alitalia, has not met with negative reactions or sanctions from the United States authorities.
The Commission must, therefore, make more vigorous endeavours to achieve a genuine international agreement with the United States as soon as possible which regulates the matter on the basis of fundamental principles: respect for the principle of reciprocity, on the basis of which, if the Union gives US citizens the same rights as its own citizens, then the United States must do the same for European citizens; respect for the principle of proportionality; respect for the principle of informed consent and the right of the person concerned to appeal to an independent authority or judge.
In the meantime, pending the achievement of a satisfactory agreement, a situation of legality must be restored and access to data which violates Community law must be banned.
In future, then, a centralised system will have to be established at European level for the electronic collection of data relating to flight reservations, containing adequate filters which ensure that only data which may be lawfully disclosed is transmitted to third parties, with due regard for the fundamental rights of the European citizens which we, Parliament and the Commission, are under obligation to protect, not least against terrorism.
Mr President, I should first of all like to pursue in greater depth the news to which Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has already referred.
It is about the airline company Jet Blue that recently had the dubious honour of being the first American airline company to be able to provide data about its airline passengers to the Pentagon.
The latter had requested this information so as to be able to make a risk assessment of passengers based on the CAPS II programme.
When this piece of information was leaked, a huge outpouring of indignation in the United States ensued.
Apologies were made and the data tap was turned off immediately.
Especially serious was the fact that passengers had not been previously informed of the violation of their privacy, but the wrath of public opinion was also directed at the very fact of registration on a massive scale.
As already stated, the influential UCLA, the American Civil Liberties Association, qualified this as 'a highly un-American system' and condemned the fact that, in this way, every passenger is turned into a suspect.
I am giving this account of American indignation to press home to the Commissioner that he should not be fixated on striking a compromise between us and Minister Rich and company in the current negotiations with the United States, because the playing field is much wider and it is up to us to make it wider still.
Apparently, the American public does not deem the actions and measures viable, and we must therefore also raise our objections.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you to try out an alternative route using an alternative strategy.
You have easy access to the Anglo-Saxon press, and I therefore count on your written powers of persuasion, via American public opinion, to put the administration effectively under pressure.
Consider it to be a kind of hearts and minds campaign.
What are our specific problems?
It would be useful to clarify this, because I think that we will find a ready audience in this respect, also among the public in the USA.
Mr President, the second point that I should like to bring to your attention is the proposals that are circulating to develop a passport with advanced electronic chips in which biometric data, including somebody's past travelling history, can be stored.
If this travelling history is stored on this chip and somebody travels to America, then Bush will still have unfettered access to the information which is the subject of our bickering.
My question to the Commission is therefore: how can we ensure that we are not fighting a rearguard action today?
How much progress has been made with the discussion about these passports, and are you considering how this might affect the privacy of our citizens?
This is, after all, how we can avoid being faced again with faits accomplis in a year's time and being indignant on a massive scale.
Mr President, Commissioner, flexibility is highly appropriate in negotiations but highly inappropriate when it comes to respect for the law.
Article 2 of Regulation 22/99 bans the disclosure to third parties which are not party to a transaction of personal information on a passenger without the passenger's consent.
Commissioner, you stated that responsibility for enforcing legislation lies with the Member States.
This is true where directives are concerned but not when it comes to regulations.
You are vested with all the necessary authority to intervene and ensure that the law is enforced, under Article 11, which states that the Commission, when appealed to or acting on its own initiative, is to instigate proceedings in order to stop all violation of the provisions of the regulation.
Do we want to require respect for the law when that would actually be counterproductive?
I believe, first and foremost, that where there is a law, it must be respected, and that a condition of any reform - even reform of an international agreement - is compliance with procedure.
Commissioner, you would acquire greater clout in international negotiations if the Commission were to demand respect for the law without delay, for it has the power to do so as well as the Member States.
The timeframe is not for us to decide: it is - and, in my opinion, should be - the timeframe laid down by Article 232 of the Treaty, which stipulates a period of two months from our request for action.
If no action is taken, we have two months in which to appeal to the Court of Justice.
Mr President, the thirty-nine data elements that we have been dealing with today can be divided into three categories.
Firstly, superfluous data, the storing of which has already - in the GDR and elsewhere - caused intelligence services and whole states to collapse.
In the interests of the fight against terrorism this data should not be saved.
Secondly, useful data which would, on entry, be removed anyway.
This data can be used in an appropriate and legal manner.
Thirdly, however, there is sensitive data, on which we need precise rules, and which must either not be recorded, saved and passed on at all, or it must at least be deleted after a deadline, after the person leaves the USA.
Although we are all vehement advocates of the fight against terrorism, terrorism cannot be fought with anarchy, but rather in two ways.
Firstly on the basis of the law, and this - rather than arbitrariness - we should step up.
I regret to say that at the moment in transatlantic relations there is arbitrariness regarding these questions of data, and an absence of any legal basis.
Secondly we can fight international terrorism only on the basis of trust between the USA and Europe, trust that was damaged through both sides apportioning blame and must be re-established.
Trust can only arise when genuinely transparent rules are created, ones that the public can understand, otherwise we will fuel mistrust of both the USA and the European Union itself.
Commissioner, I do not think that we can wait until international rules are in place, nor can we rely on the current fifteen and future twenty-five Member States implementing the law.
It is much more a fluke that the Commission, with you as a spokesman for the European Union, which will soon have more inhabitants than the USA and Russia together and must be a partner of the USA, is acting on this important issue, but intentionally and on the basis of the law.
Therefore, Mr President, I would like to call out to the Commission: be tough in your conduct of the negotiations, Mr Bolkestein!
Be firm, or be tough on these important questions of trust and the law!
The debate is closed.
I would remind the House that the vote on possible motions for resolution will take place on Thursday 9 October in Brussels.
The next item is the report (A5-0287/2003) by Mrs Villiers, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on investment services and regulated markets, and amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/12/EC (COM (2002) 625 - C5-0586/2002 - 2002/0269(COD)).
.
Mr President, I begin by thanking the rapporteur for her report.
It certainly improves the Commission's text in some places, while ensuring that the goals of high investor protection and market efficiency are adequately respected.
We know it was a very difficult debate, but Parliament has demonstrated a great willingness to compromise and find a workable solution.
Let me also pay tribute to the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who, true to her word, has helped drive forward on time the financial services action plan.
In particular, we welcome the efforts of the rapporteur in reaching a compromise on two major points.
Firstly, as you know, pre-trade transparency was one of the principles of the Commission's proposal, in order to ensure market efficiency and investor protection.
We are very pleased that the principle is kept in the proposal, but it has been adapted in a pragmatic way.
Secondly, we appreciate the work carried out on the suitability test - Article 18.
I consider this to be a good basis for working out a solution that is adapted to the specificities of each type of service and it will help to complete our proposal in this respect.
. Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his kind words and all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who worked exceptionally hard on this.
In particular I should like to thank Mr Karas and Mr Radwan, Mr Bourlanges, Mr Katiforis, Mr Goebbels, Mrs Cazalet from the committee secretariat and my assistant, Sarah McCarthy, for all the help that they have given me on this very demanding dossier.
The goals of the ISD should be competitive, integrated, liquid, transparent and efficient markets with a high level of investor protection.
The ISD should not prescribe a particular market structure.
It should recognise and be adaptable to the diversity of the different European market structures.
It should properly distinguish between retail and professional investors.
The type of regulation that is absolutely essential for consumers can be damaging, disruptive and unnecessary if applied to professionals.
Rules should always be risk-based, they should be properly costed and they should be proportionate to the harm they seek to avoid.
I very much support the emphasis in the Commission's proposal on country of origin, with a qualification that in many cases and in many areas the host country is suitable to deal with branches.
I also agree with the Commission's overall aspiration to abolish concentration rules and open up the business of executing share trades to competition between exchanges, between MTFs and between the internal execution platforms of investment firms.
Exchanges are not public utilities and they should not be granted a monopoly.
Allowing firms to compete with exchanges will lead to more choice for investors, more liquidity, narrower spreads, better prices and lower costs.
The markets where competition is already allowed in this way are successful, transparent and highly liquid.
Competition in this context will deliver a good deal for the consumer, as it has in so many other areas.
I agree with the Commission that the best way to protect investors is through a strong combination of competition, conduct of business rules, conflict of interest rules, best execution rules and transparency.
However, there are important areas where the compromise agreed in the ECON committee has greatly improved the Commission's proposal.
I strongly urge the House to support the ECON Committee's compromise because these amendments are essential to remedy or, at any rate, reduce some very serious problems caused by the Commission's original text.
I strongly support the committee amendments and would only advocate a couple of fairly technical changes.
This compromise should be accepted as a package.
I would appeal to the House not to seek to destabilise this carefully-balanced and hard-won compromise that was achieved after many meetings, with input from different MEPs from different political groups and of different nationalities.
Indeed, at the very heart of the matter, the concept of standard market size was a concept contributed to the debate by the PSE group.
I genuinely believe that the ECON compromise would be good for all Member States.
There are many people in my country who would say that the compromise does not go far enough to meet their concerns.
I would have liked to delete Article 25, but I have conceded that it is not feasible or appropriate, and I have conceded the need for a pre-trade transparency requirement.
I believe this compromise will be good for the national interests of Luxembourg, France, Italy, the UK and indeed all Member States.
I believe it will be good for consumers.
I have had to make concessions, I have moved a long way from my initial position and I would very strongly thank everyone in the committee and in the House who have also made concessions.
I can support some of the plenary amendments: 145, 148, 151, 156 and 157, and I will be delighted to continue discussing the other plenary amendments.
We had a very serious debate in committee on the word non-professional: a whole range of interest groups from around Europe said they could accept the compromise if non-professional was deleted; now it has been.
It is now a balanced compromise which allows a significant pre-trade transparency requirement to go ahead whilst at the same time addressing some of the practical problems with the original proposal - as Mr Bolkestein says, 'in a pragmatic way'.
The original Article 25 would have severely damaged liquidity and liquidity is vital for the health of our markets and our economy.
This compromise seeks to deal with those practical problems, and reduce any damage that may occur to liquidity, by exempting the small banks and focusing on systematic internalisers, and by reducing counter-party risk.
It allows price improvement: without price improvement the compromise is not workable.
Only with price improvement will retail customers get the good prices they deserve.
The obligation to give the same price to everyone will make internalisation uneconomic.
Why should we who are charged with representing the peoples of Europe pass a law to prevent firms from giving good deals to their customers?
