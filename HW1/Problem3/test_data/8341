Indeed, MrÂ President, we have to consider the fact that we already know what the Councilâs decision will be, since the informal Council has already been held.
Â Â  Mr President, last Thursday, in the Conference of Presidents, we had the opportunity to discuss this issue.
I know that we in the Socialist Group, like most of the other groups in this House as well, do not think it appropriate to hold this vote this week.
One reason for this is the ongoing discussion in the General Affairs Council, with particular reference to the outstanding issues in relation to Cyprus, which â along with a number of others â indicates that we should debate the whole package â that is to say, the adoption of the association agreement and all the other associated issues to do with our policy on Turkey â at the second part-session in September, along with the Commissionâs negotiating mandate for 3Â October.
We therefore take the view that MrsÂ Frassoniâs motion should be rejected.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like, as rapporteur, to ask for your agreement to our inviting the Council to inform us how this protocol is to be implemented in view of the additional statement Turkey has made in relation to it, and to do so prior to any decision being taken by us and by 26 September at the latest.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that the debate on the situation of the political prisoners in Syria be replaced by the issue of human rights in Belarus.
Â Â  â The issue is a relatively simple one: the Committee on Foreign Affairs is set to adopt a report on relations between the EU and Syria, indeed next week in all likelihood.
A separate resolution on this report does not therefore appear to be the most appropriate course of action at this time.
With regard to Belarus, however, a number of MEPs were prevented from entering the country in August, this at a time when attacks on the independent media, journalists, members of the opposition and NGOs have been increasing at an alarming rate.
Furthermore, various opponents of the Belarus Government, foreign journalists and leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus have also been detained.
We therefore feel that the urgent debate on relations with Syria should be replaced by one on the situation in Belarus.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out to the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that there is a great difference between a vote on an association agreement and one on a resolution regarding two specific cases of human rights violations in Syria: these concern two members of parliament, one of whom has been on hunger strike for a long time.
We are thus facing a real emergency situation.
As regards the situation in Belarus, we are all of the same mind, and we all express our concern.
I would recall, however, that on 5Â July this Parliament debated the Commissionâs statement and on 10Â July we adopted a resolution on more or less the same topics.
I believe, therefore, that Parliamentâs authority lies not in repeating resolutions but rather in ensuring that its resolutions are properly followed up.
To conclude, in relation to the situation of the two members of parliament and the NGOs, we call for a letter from our President; as regards the situation in Belarus, we call for a new debate, perhaps in a forthcoming plenary session, so as to put greater pressure on both the Council and the Commission.
On this matter, therefore, we agree with the proposal to keep the situation in Syria among the urgent subjects for debate.
Â Â  Mr President, the vote has been held, the result is clear, and we do of course respect it, but I would like to pick up on what Mrs Napoletano had to say.
Belarus is still an important issue, and we should discuss it at one of the forthcoming part-sessions â I would suggest the second September one.
We have just had a meeting of our groupâs bureau that was attended by guests from Belarus.
The situation there is very threatening, and so I ask Members now to agree to this debate being held during the second September part-session.
This request is one that I make from the bottom of my heart and I make it to you all.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Poettering.
I am sure that the Presidents of the political groups will take good note of your request and that they will take it into account when establishing the agenda of the next part-session.
Â Â  The next item on the agenda is the requests for one-minute speeches, which we will continue to conduct in accordance with the instructions that I communicated to you by letter and which are gradually enabling us to carry out this item in a more organised fashion.
Â Â  Following the news of the attempted bomb attack on the president of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, JÃ³zsef Kasza, I went to visit the scene last week.
I was able to ascertain in person that the hand-grenade had indeed been intended for JÃ³zsef Kasza.
I could only conclude, there in Subotica, that in Serbia-Montenegroâs northern province of Vojvodina, right on the border with the European Union, the series of attacks on national minorities has not come to an end.
In fact, the situation has worsened.
In documented cases of minority and human rights violations such as this, the European Parliament has a duty to consider the facts and not the self-justifying statements made by the relevant Serb politicians, who are implicated in these incidents.
And this approach is particularly warranted in the case of a country with which the EU is preparing to open Association negotiations in the autumn.
Making use of its budgetary power, the European Parliament also has a duty to use the Community support it provides to Serbia-Montenegro as an instrument to protect that minority.
It is also the duty of the European Parliament, by conducting monitoring activities of its own on a more regular basis, to speak up concerning the kind of country the Union is entering into closer relations with.
Last, the European Parliament also has a duty not to forget that, alongside JÃ³zsef Kasza, there are some 300 000 people belonging to the Hungarian and other minorities in Vojvodina that need to be protected.
Â Â  On behalf of the nine languages of the ten new Member States, I would like to voice an objection, because once again discrimination is taking place against the new Member States.
In July of this year, the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) published a competition in which, for the first time, candidates from all 25 Member States would be able to take the tests at the same time.
Seven hundred new âpublic administratorsâ, as they are called in EU terminology, are to be recruited, but the language requirements include only the 11 languages of the 15 âoldâ Member States.
This means that a Dutch person is able to take the test in Dutch, while Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Slovenian, Estonia, Latvian, Lithuanian and Maltese applicants cannot take the test in their mother tongue, but must take it in one of the 11 languages of the 15 âoldâ Member States.
This is blatant discrimination and runs contrary to the spirit of the European Union.
Mr President, I ask you â and I have submitted my request to you in writing too â to take action against this discrimination without delay.
Â Â  Mr President, the plane crash on 14 August involving a low-cost Cypriot airline claimed the lives of 121 people.
In a small country like Cyprus, the human loss has been devastating and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and all my colleagues for the condolences offered to the families of the victims.
While an investigation into the exact cause of the crash is under way, it would appear from leaked official reports that long-standing organisational errors and administrative shortcomings may have rendered the Cyprus Civil Aviation Department incapable of fulfilling adequately its role as an aviation safety service.
Although the Government of Cyprus has committed itself to corrective measures immediately, it is now clear that the Commission has been aware of this situation for some time and has kept largely quiet and chosen to follow a slow and rather ineffective course of remedial action.
Civil aviation authorities in other Member States may have similar safety-related problems, and corrective measures may be needed urgently.
I hope that when the Commission makes a statement in this House later on tonight, it will be persuasively clear of its intention to tighten up urgently its watchdog role over the civil aviation authorities and to make sure that transparency is strictly applied.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for commemorating the recent natural and other disasters.
I would like now to address the floods affecting central Europe.
Several tens of thousands of people have been affected by the rivers bursting their banks and the huge volume of rainfall in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.
The situation is without doubt worst in Romania: following the spring floods, it has suffered catastrophic damage in July and August.
The floods, covering 34 counties and claiming many lives, have left 575 settlements, homes, several hundred kilometres of motorway, 83 schools, 29 nursery schools, hospitals and churches under water.
The financial cost of the damage caused as a result of the natural disasters affecting Romania amounts to EUR 1.5 billion.
On behalf of the Hungarian delegation, it is our moral duty to use every means at our disposal to support the regionâs inhabitants.
Romania â the poorest of the countries affected â cannot cover the enormous costs of reconstruction out of its own resources.
It therefore needs to receive assistance as soon as possible from the European Union Solidarity Fund to be able to carry out salvage operations.
I request your kind support in this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, I implore you, on behalf of Edinburgh in Scotland, to reconsider, with the Bureau, its flawed decision to hold the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg, rather than in my home city, Edinburgh.
It is bad enough that we have to come to Strasbourg, without inflicting it on innocent third parties.
Edinburgh and Scotland hosted the G8 Summit this year.
The UK currently holds the Presidency of the European Union and Scotland wants this meeting to be in Edinburgh.
The Edinburgh bid was better and cheaper.
The Scottish Government will commit 100 000 Scottish pounds to help this event take place.
We are used to welcoming hundreds of thousands of people to Scotland with warm Scottish hospitality every day.
We want this meeting to be held in Edinburgh and we are willing to play our part to make it happen.
I hope you and the Bureau will be able to play your part and reconsider.
Â Â  â Commissioner Mandelsonâs recent statements have been alarming and unacceptable.
Pandering to the interests of the major distributors and retailers in the EU, he has announced the intention to authorise the entry of tens of thousands of textile products currently held at customs, having exceeded the quotas set in the agreement concluded with the Peopleâs Republic of China.
What a pity the Commissioner did not show the same commitment in defence of Europeâs textile production, for example by activating safeguard clauses, a number of months ago when our textile sector was facing â as it still faces â a veritable flood of imports.
The current situation has demonstrated who in the EU is really benefiting from the liberalisation of the textile sector; the major importers and distributors have increased their profit margins to ever more outlandish levels.
There is much at stake: defending Europeâs clothing and textiles industry and ensuring that many thousands of companies and jobs are not wiped out, with the appalling social and economic consequences that that entails.
Â Â  â Mr President, mention was made earlier of the Minutes. However, I am not sure if everyone knows exactly what is going on with Turkey and Cyprus: Turkey does not recognise Cyprus.
This is a direct insult on all of us here; on all of us who recognise Cyprus and consider the Members of the European Parliament from Cyprus to be our peers.
And then Turkey comes along and says, âWe do not recognise the Cypriotsâ.
Consequently, it is insulting all of us who recognise the Cypriots.
This matter needs to be examined in depth and we need to make this country understand that it cannot be the troublemaker of Europe before it has even joined Europe.
It is incomprehensible.
Imagine if it did not recognise Spain, your country; imagine if it did not recognise Germany or France: would we even be discussing this?
There can be no discrimination between small and large countries.
All countries are equal here and Turkey cannot therefore cock a snook at democracy in this insulting manner.
If Europe is based on anything, it is based on democracy and respect for the other nations and Turkey cannot barge in and invade this place and insult institutions and values which Europe sorely needs.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 October, Europe will be given the opportunity of putting right a considerable mistake that it made last year by deciding not, after all, to open accession negotiations with Turkey.
The mood in many Member States today is quite different from last year.
Particularly the French Government springs to mind, now that the deadline of 3 October is drawing nearer.
The arrogance with which Ankara haughtily refused to make the slightest effort in the area of human rights â examples I would cite include the recognition of the Armenian genocide, and the recent scandalous charges brought against Mr Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish author, with regard to linguistic rights for the Kurdish minority âshows how Turkey and its culture remain incompatible with our European values.
Then there was also the ridiculous situation involving the so-called Ankara protocol and the Turkish Governmentâs persistent refusal to recognise another EU Member State, that being Cyprus.
Mr de Villepin and Mrs Merkel, like many others, are quite right when they say that in that case, Turkey does not belong, and so I hope that that is the message that this House will be sending out.
Â Â  Mr President, reflecting on my speech concerning the situation of the ethnic Hungarians living in Latvia, Mr ZÄ«le of Latvia accused me of âtelling lies to this Parliamentâ.
I come from a different political culture and do not use phrases of this kind about a fellow parliamentarian.
I am sure he is just an innocent victim of a misunderstanding.
After his intervention, I had the opportunity to talk to the leaders of the Hungarian minority of his country.
I understand that for Hungarians living in Latvia, it is nearly impossible to pass the so-called citizenship exams, despite the fact that they have been educated there.
On the other hand, those from other ethnic origins â Latvians and some other Baltic nations â have free, or almost free, access to citizenship.
That is what I referred to and is what I called an unfair policy.
Generally speaking, any kind of ethnic discrimination is against the basic democratic ideals of this Union, but in the case of Hungarians, even the historical arguments are missing for such discrimination.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to give my unreserved support to those who argue that we have to help Romania to overcome a grave natural calamity at a difficult time, one in which it also has to prepare itself for membership of the European Union.
This latter consideration, though, makes it seem to me all the more objectionable that the government is attempting, by way of a change in the law, to remove from office the presidents of the two houses of the parliament and those of the various regional parliaments, even though the current legislative period is not yet over.
I think Romania has more important things to do, such as ensuring internal consensus.
Perhaps you, Mr President, might make inquiries of your opposite numbers in Romania?
Above all, I would ask the representatives of the other political parties to bring influence to bear in an attempt to get these matters resolved consensually and without internal disruption, rather than by taking this sort of action against opposition parties.
Romania needs political consensus if it is to make a good job of preparing itself for the European Union and for life as one of its Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the case of Francisco LarraÃ±aga, a Spanish and European Union citizen sentenced to death in the Philippines.
Regrettably, a few weeks ago the Philippine courts once again confirmed the death sentence on this citizen, and the clock is now ticking; we know that the trial was plagued with irregularities and that it is clear that Paco LarraÃ±aga was not allowed a proper defence, since several witnesses have supported him, having seen him somewhere else on the same day and at the same time that the crime he is accused of was committed.
But the essential thing at the moment is to save the life of Mr LarraÃ±aga and all the institutions must do their bit in relation to this just demand.
Ladies and gentlemen, a European Union citizen is going to be killed, and we cannot turn a blind eye to this violation of every citizenâs foremost right, the right to life.
I would therefore call upon the President of this Parliament to appeal urgently to the government of the Philippines and to the President of that country and call on them to ensure that she exercise her right to pardon Francisco LarraÃ±aga so that this European and Spanish citizen is not executed.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Iturgaiz, for drawing the Presidencyâs attention to this citizenâs situation.
We shall look into the case and, if appropriate, we shall act in accordance with your suggestion.
Â Â  Mr President, last week marked the first anniversary of the Beslan massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 331 people, of which 186 were children.
Astonishingly, the self-confessed perpetrator of this crime, Shamil Basayev, was appointed deputy prime minister of the so-called Chechen government-in-exile on 25 August.
This man is a wanted war criminal and has close ties to Islamist terrorist groups like Al Qaâida.
The so-called foreign minister, a Mr Osman Ferzaouli, who resides in Denmark as a political refugee, says this will result in Basayev being more responsible in future.
The culture minister, Akhmed Zakayev, resides in my city, London, also as a refugee, and in the past has denied any links with Mr Basayev.
Surely Russia will accuse the European Union of double standards when we rightly demand that they punish those guilty of atrocities in Chechnya whilst we in the EU are giving harbour to these individuals who support terrorist action.
The governments of Denmark and the United Kingdom should revoke the asylum status of Mr Ferzaouli and MrÂ Zakayev.
Â Â  Mr President, the lower Clyde on the west coast of Scotland has a fine record for building world-class ships.
That industry has been in serious decline for the last 30 years.
Now Fergusonâs â one of the few remaining yards â sees its future threatened.
Mr President, as you know, all new orders for ships in the European Union have to go out to public tender.
Fergusonâs recently lost a competitive tender to a company called Remontowa in Gdansk in Poland.
They believe they lost it on unfair terms.
The Commission is now investigating suspected state aids to that particular yard.
I am raising this matter today because two new ships are out for tender and it is important that the next competition be based on a level playing field.
Mr President, I ask you to join me in urging the Commission to complete its investigation as a matter of urgency so that we can know that this tender process will be on the basis of equals tendering for the contract and not with one company facing competition with one hand tied behind its back.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a major industrial dispute in my constituency of London which affected many thousands of air passengers around Europe â that of the Gate Gourmet workers, 670 of whom were arbitrarily dismissed from their jobs on 13 August without any redundancy payment.
This led to a major strike by British Airways staff and caused major disruption for many passengers.
Having visited the workers during the summer recess, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the poor industrial relations records of some of these companies and the need for an amicable settlement.
All that the workers want is reinstatement, and if that is not possible, then redundancy payment.
The company is moving in the right direction, but we should send the signal that throughout the European Union we want fair and balanced industrial relations, and observance of the law, so that consumer disruption of this kind can be avoided and workers can get on with their lives, and so that people with over 30 yearsâ service in such companies receive the justice they deserve.
Â Â  Mr President,
On 28 July, the IRA made an historic decision to end its armed struggle.
Sinn FÃ©in believes that there now exists the opportunity to achieve Irish Republican objectives through purely peaceful and democratic methods.
This courageous initiative removes all remaining obstacles to real political movement and a shared future.
Those who held up the IRA as the only impediment to peace have no more excuses.
There is an onus upon the Democratic Unionist Party to engage with my party.
Thus far, they have refused.
There is also a responsibility on the British Government to implement the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement on which it has so far reneged.
Meanwhile, the summer months have been characterised by attacks against vulnerable Catholic and nationalist homes.
Bricks, petrol bombs, pipe bombs and gunfire have been an ever-present reality.
Residents feel vulnerable and powerless and they feel angry at the inaction of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the relative silence of Unionist political representatives.
The job for all those connected with the Irish peace process is immense.
Â Â  â Mr President, the recent tragic aeroplane crashes in Europe and the rest of the world, for the victims of which you too have just expressed your condolences, make it more than imperative that we redefine the dividing line between the need to liberalise and prevent distortion of competition in the civil aviation sector in Europe and the even more pressing and legitimate demand for maximum possible safety standards to be maintained.
The European Union is obliged at the very least to initiate legislation to strengthen the legal framework for harmonising technical and administrative procedures in the civil aviation sector.
Our demand should be accepted by the European Aviation Safety Agency, as should the measures which it has recommended or proposes to take.
When legitimate interests in 'liberalisation', 'the market' and 'flight safety' are compared, we call for 'flight safety' to come first.
This must be the message following the tragic aeroplane crashes.
Â Â  Mr President, since we last met, a Member State of this Union, the Republic of Ireland, has been shamefully harbouring three convicted international terrorists.
IRA terrorists Monaghan, Connolly and McCauley were duly convicted of training FARC guerrillas in Colombia.
They skipped bail â partly put up, it is said, by the Dublin Government â and now, on the back of a sordid deal with the IRA, and despite Interpol warrants for the three men, they are brazenly flaunting themselves in Dublin.
To date, Ireland has done nothing to meet its international obligations, but continues to provide complicit sanctuary for these international terrorists, making a mockery of their affirmations in this House, when President of the Council, that they were committed to the fight against international terrorism.
I condemn that duplicity, I condemn that hypocrisy but most of all I call on the Dublin Government to end the shame and to return these fugitives forthwith.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of the opportunity presented today to bring to the Houseâs attention a remarkable initiative by some of Europeâs young people.
Over 50 of them, from six European countries, took part in a workshop at a college of higher education in my electoral district in which they acted out their own âEuropean Parliamentâ, the object being to make the EU more attractive to the public.
What emerged from this was a resolution on the creation of a citizensâ Europe, a number of points from which I would like to quote.
The young peopleâs âEuropean Parliamentâ calls on the Commission to provide the citizens of Europe with comprehensive information about the Member States, European policymaking, and cultural events in all their diversity.
They call for a deceleration of the enlargement process and, in order that there should be more in-depth information about the EU, propose closer cooperation between it and the national broadcasters.
They articulate the view that EU information material must come across to the public in their day-to-day lives and the environments in which they live, and they believe it necessary that the EU should cooperate across the board with institutions involved in school education at national level in fostering cultural, historical and political awareness.
Â Â  Mr President, along the same lines as Mr Allister, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, during the summer, we witnessed the return to Dublin â to the Republic of Ireland â of the so-called Colombia Three.
As you may be aware, Mr President, the three men involved were convicted in Colombia of assisting FARC terrorists there.
In the interests of fighting international terrorism, these men should be returned to Colombia to finish the sentences they were given originally, and not be allowed to go free, as they are at present, to flout international will.
You cannot, on the one hand, pay lip-service to the fight against terrorism if, on the other hand, you overlook what is actually happening within a Member State of the European Union.
This has got to be acted upon, and acted upon positively, and the response should be made in a very responsible and effective manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to remind both Mr Allister and Mr Nicholson, and indeed Mrs de BrÃºn, that the rule of law applies in the Republic of Ireland and the law will take its course in the Republic of Ireland in relation to the case they mentioned.
Could I also remind Mrs de BrÃºn that she has no right to use the term 'Ãglaigh na hÃireann' when referring to the IRA.
'Ãglaigh naÂ hÃireann' is the name of the Irish Army, not an illegal Irish organisation called the IRA.
My reason for rising here today is to welcome those participating in the freedom drive to the European Parliament.
People with disabilities are looking to Europe to help them achieve their full freedom and dignity as European citizens.
We must listen to them and act, and indeed the Commission and the Council must especially listen and respond effectively to their legitimate concerns.
As I will not have the opportunity to do so later on in the debate, I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to all those in New Orleans and elsewhere in the United States who have lost relatives, friends, and indeed belongings, as a result of the catastrophe following Hurricane Katrina.
Political lessons should be learnt from this, but they must take second place to Europe offering whatever aid is needed and whatever aid is requested by the United States to assist the people concerned.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to draw the attention of this House to a very practical matter that is specifically of concern to Irish beef farmers, but that touches at the very heart of the recent Common Agricultural Policy reforms.
Throughout the summer months we in Ireland have witnessed the direct impact of the importation of cheap Brazilian beef into the market.
If you recall, Commissioner Fischler promised farmers less bureaucracy and better market prices.
However, what we and farmers throughout Europe are seeing is that the price for their product will be set by the lowest-cost producer outside the European Union.
We have seen what has happened with the textile industry throughout Europe.
Are we going to see something similar happen to the European Union's agriculture and food industry?
As we approach the world trade talks again in November, I urge the Commission to ensure that beef is treated as a sensitive product and that we do not eradicate our own beef producers because of cheap third country imports.
I would add that the regulations that Europe imposes on its farmers are very strict and much more difficult than those imposed on food produced outside the Union and that should be taken into account as well.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, while watching Belgian television during the summer recess, I heard members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament voice criticisms concerning the EURÂ 1Â million donated by Parliament to the World Youth Day in Cologne.
I should like to make it known that I am outraged at this waging of war on Europeâs Christian past, present and future.
It is not imperative that Europe be Christian, and there is nothing to stop it being secular.
Yet if we fail to respect the religion that has been ours throughout history, and thanks to which Europe came into being, there is a risk that our continent will one day become Muslim.
Provided that it is not already too late, we should endeavour to prevent this from happening.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, for the second time in the past six months, I should like to protest to the House at the insulting of Catholics.
I have been prompted to do so this time by the desecration of an image of the Holy Mother of CzÄstochowa at an exhibition held in the Brussels Parliament to mark the 25th anniversary of Solidarity.
The Black Madonna of Jasna GÃ³ra is the most sacred being apart from God for Polish people, and, in the words of a poet, âeven those who believe in nothing believe in herâ.
I would remind the House that according to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, everyone has the right to freedom of religion.
As well as making religious tolerance compulsory, this guarantees respect for devotional objects.
Failure to comply with this principle is nothing other than an insult to Catholics and to non-Catholics who respect Our Lady the Queen of Poland, as well as a violation of the Convention.
I would note that values based on Christianity are a fundamental aspect of European culture, and a cultural heritage shared by the nations of our continent.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, on behalf of all those who are opposed to the European Constitution, I should like to take this opportunity to greet the House at its first session after the summer recess.
I should like to inform Members that there has been a good crop of mushrooms and other forest products in Poland, despite the crisis in the European Union.
We are doing very nicely indeed, and the number of opponents to the Constitution is rising dramatically.
At the same time, I should also like to call on the European Union to apply those principles it proclaimed before the new Member States joined, namely equality, honesty and a fair settling of accounts.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, three more countries ratified the European Constitution over the summer, namely Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg, with ratification in Luxembourg taking place by means of a referendum.
I should like to say how much I welcome this development, which demonstrates that the European Constitution is far from dead, regardless of what its opponents, the Eurosceptics, might think.
I would call on those countries which have not yet ratified the European Constitution â my own country, the Czech Republic, being one of them â to endeavour to do so over the next few months.
Two thirds of people in the Czech Republic would like to have their say on the European Constitution, and 49% are still in favour of it.
At the same time, ratification presents Parliament with the challenge of strengthening its dialogue with citizens and stepping up the debate on both the ratification of the European Constitution and, of course, on the future of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I am grateful to you for drawing the attention of the House to the catastrophe in Louisiana and New Orleans.
Some of these people are of French and Spanish descent and are, of course, American citizens.
The European Commission has an ability to provide extremely good advice and support through ECHO.
All around the world in crises of a similar type, ECHO has played a prominent advisory role â in the tsunami in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, and in other instances such as the Mozambique floods.
I have discussed this matter with Commissioner Michel and am requesting this Parliament to ask the Commission to send an ECHO team to advise the United States authorities, both state and federal, on our experience of dealing with these matters.
It is our chance to give something back to the American people.
Â Â  Mr President, on 29 July, criminal indictments against subsidiaries of UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were announced by prosecutors in Milan who are investigating the collapse of the giant Italian dairy company Parmalat.
Within 48 hours, a former member of the Citibank board fell to his death from his New York apartment and a former President of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, was found dead in his own swimming pool.
Mr Duisenberg, of course, enjoyed the support of Deutsche Bank in his fight for the presidency of the ECB.
Given the curious coincidence and timing of these unusual and unexpected deaths, this House might hope that Europol and the intelligence services will look closely at the surrounding circumstances.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in mid-August Polish MEPs were prevented from entering Belarus by border guards.
I hereby call on the President to lodge an official protest about this, since the initial response of the Presidentâs spokesman was a refusal to comment on what he said was a private matter concerning only the Polish MEPs.
I was among the four MEPs prevented from entering Belarus in August, after being denied entry into Cuba in May.
Neither Fidel Castro nor the Belarussian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, pay any regard to international standards.
The two capitals of Havana and Minsk are symbols of human rights violations and the gagging of public opinion.
The reason behind my attempted trip to Belarus was MrÂ Lukashenkoâs instigation of a new wave of persecution against those of his citizens whose opinions differ from his own.
The last remaining independent newspapers have been shut down, access to the Internet has been blocked and opposition activists have been detained, arrested and sentenced.
The same fate has befallen the democratically elected leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus, which was the last NGO that had not fallen into step with the Minsk dictatorship.
I call on the President to ensure that the EU institutions set in motion measures to support activists who have been persecuted by MrÂ Lukashenko.
Steps should be taken to put pressure on MrÂ Lukashenkoâs officials, and backing should also be given to independent radio stations and programmes broadcasting to Belarus from neighbouring countries.
Such broadcasts will be the only source of independent information for Belarussians.
Â Â  In the world of today we are unfortunately becoming witnesses to various natural disasters, such as floods or fires following disastrous droughts.
IÂ may not be saying anything new here, but IÂ have the feeling that we are constantly underestimating the very real threat of the bird flu pandemic.
The head of the WHO flu programme, Klaus StÃ¶hr, said on aÂ German radio station that if the virus mutates, it will spread rapidly.
StÃ¶hr says that there are scenarios in which the virus could spread across the entire word in three to six months.
Together with many colleagues present here, I believe that the preventive measures that individual Member States and the European Union as aÂ whole have taken are inadequate, which may be partly due to lack of funding, or an unwillingness to release such funds.
In my opinion we need to refine aÂ system for releasing monies for preventive measures against bird flu and for the purchase of antiviral drugs from the European Solidarity Fund much more quickly.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on natural disasters (fires and floods).
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the extreme weather this summer has left a trail of destruction in numerous countries in Europe as well as in the United States of America and we have also seen many lives lost in the accidents of which the President spoke earlier.
I too would therefore like, on behalf of the College of Commissioners, to express my condolences and our support for the victims of these disasters and accidents.
The Iberian peninsular suffered the worst drought in 60 years and this, in conjunction with high temperatures, encouraged the fires to spread in southern Europe.
At the same time as the fires, floods inundated Central and Eastern Europe and hurricane Katrina hit the southern states of the United States of America.
Floods and forest fires occur repeatedly in Europe.
The repercussions were more serious this year, but the fact that they occurred comes as no surprise to us.
Consequently, political leaders need to anticipate this sort of disaster by planning measures which help to prevent, where possible, and using all available resources to deal with such crises in the most efficient way possible.
The Community civil protection mechanism was adopted in 2001 so that the European Union could respond in an efficient and coordinated manner to major emergencies.
This mechanism is used to coordinate the resources available in the Member States for providing assistance.
It also helps by conducting drills and planning hypothetical scenarios and simulations in order to identify possible gaps and problems in the Member States' civil protection systems and promotes cooperation and interoperability between the Member States' emergency services.
When the mechanism was activated in Portugal at the government's request, the European Union managed to organise the despatch and intervention of a number of fire-fighting vessels and helicopters from France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands within 24 hours to support the Portuguese fire-fighters and, with this assistance and more favourable weather conditions, it proved possible to check the fires within a few days.
In this way, the situation was brought under control and at midday today there were only five fires, compared with more than 50 on 22 August.
The mechanism was also used to provide help to Bulgaria and Romania, the two countries worst hit by the floods.
Several Member States provided help by despatching teams, pumps, decontaminants and other resources through the European Union's civil protection mechanism.
At the moment, the European Union is making an important contribution to and is participating in efforts by the United States to deal with the tragic trail of destruction left behind by hurricane Katrina.
Yesterday, Sunday, we received an official request for assistance from the United States and immediately activated the civil protection mechanism in order to coordinate the help provided by the Member States to the areas affected.
The European assistance package is made up of contributions from the Member States, which vary from material assistance to equipment and missions of experts and other specialists.
Teams of experts and other materials have already arrived in the United States.
The Community civil protection mechanism has now become a necessary tool for coordinating European assistance.
The response to the events of this summer, like the response to the tsunami at the end of last year, has proven that the mechanism operates satisfactorily.
Nonetheless, there is room for improvement, which is why the Commission proposed a package of measures in April 2005 to strengthen the European Union's response capability in the field of civil protection.
These measures include proposals to improve the transportation of aid and the facility for the European Union to lease specialist equipment, such as additional water bomber aircraft, from third countries.
These are precisely the sort of measures which will give European citizens â and not just European citizens â better protection against future disasters.
The Council is now examining the package of measures to strengthen civil protection.
I am certain that the European Parliament supports our proposals and will stand by us in our endeavour.
Civil protection can only cover the first, immediate stage of an emergency.
Other resources need to be used in order to deal with the consequences of disasters and to prevent them; this is what Mr Pan OuzkÃœ was talking about earlier.
The Commission has certain such resources at its disposal. Let me give you some examples.
The rural development programmes provide support to a broad range of forestry activities with funds to prevent fires and restore forests which have suffered damage.
The 'forest focus' regulation is the most recent resource which we have at our disposal for monitoring the application of measures to prevent forest fires.
The financial package for 'forest focus' for the period from 2003 to 2006 totals EUR 65 million, which includes EUR 9 million for preventing fires.
As far as floods are concerned, the Commission has proposed that a European Union coordinated action plan be prepared and applied in order to manage the risk of floods.
The Commission has taken the relevant political initiative in application of the conclusions of the European Council held in December 2004.
The European Union Solidarity Fund can provide support to countries hit by major disasters in order to help them with their restoration efforts.
Romania and Bulgaria have already asked the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund.
My colleagues responsible for regional policy, enlargement and agriculture are presently examining these requests.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, allow me to close by saying that I am certain that the European Parliament will support our proposals and will take advantage of this opportunity to put the commitment to solidarity which it has undertaken into further action.
It is our duty towards everyone hit by the recent disasters.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as the Commissioner responsible for the environment has pointed out, this summer we in the European Union have been the victims of disasters caused by fire and by water, and while some regions are seriously threatened by gradual desertification, others are living in fear of floods. This is a demonstration of European diversity and of the need to be sensitive to the realities faced by others.
In several countries of the south of Europe, the fires have led to the loss of dozens of human lives, the evacuation of entire populations and extraordinary environmental damage.
It is true that we are suffering a year of drought, but I believe that it is unacceptable to resign ourselves to fate.
On the contrary, it is our responsibility to analyse the underlying causes of the disasters that are repeated year after year, and to find out what we are doing wrong or, quite simply, what we are failing to do.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore proposes the creation of a temporary committee in our Parliament. That committee should assess which concrete measures we could adopt in Europe to complement those that are being implemented in the Member States.

Fire does not stop at national borders, and we should therefore create a European protocol for fighting fires; we should at least consider creating a specific European agency and â why not? â specialised cross-border bodies.
Commissioner, twenty-four hours is sometimes too long.
Without prejudice to the role of the European Solidarity Fund, I believe it would be a mistake to restrict ourselves to seeking funds every time we suffer a fire.
We must go further: for example, the European Commission, with the support of the Council, has removed the aid to farmers for the creation, clearing and monitoring of firebreaks, and that is something that should perhaps be reconsidered.
Mr President, these are some of the proposals we could evaluate in this temporary committee that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposes be created in our Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to begin by echoing the words of the President of Parliament at the beginning of this sitting.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to express my solidarity with the victims of all of these disasters.
Secondly, I should like to thank all of the Members of this Chamber, from north, south, east and west, and from all political groups, who have expressed specifically to us â the Portuguese socialists â their solidarity with the victims of the drought and the fires currently ravaging the western Iberian Peninsula, with Portugal very much the worst affected region.
I should like to say that what is happening to Portuguese forests is, in terms of scale, without parallel around the world, without parallel in the Amazon region, without parallel anywhere.
The deforestation that has taken place in recent decades is on an absolutely disastrous scale; we cannot ignore the scale of this disaster.
We must take account of the seriousness of the problem and consider the entire range of measures that need to be taken to deal with the situation.
We must analyse the viability of the Solidarity Fund and ascertain why it has thus far been unable, for example, to combat the fires; why, for example, has it been unable to provide financial support for the aeroplanes needed to tackle the fires?
We must look into the question of farming, as Mr Galeote Quecedo rightly pointed out, because this disaster is part of a drought on an enormous scale.
We must also look into forest policy in order to ensure that it takes greater account of the climatic characteristics of the west of the Peninsula.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to express my solidarity with the victims, although solidarity alone is not enough: we have to make a solemn commitment to the victims that we will make a serious and determined effort to prevent such disasters.
Let us begin, however, by asking ourselves why such events happen.
In my view, global warming is certainly involved, as it has aggravated extreme events, or longer periods of drought, as was pointed out by Commissioner Dimas, whom I thank for being here today.
I must also mention heavier rainfall â another phenomenon that has no counterpart in the past.
I would point out that a two-degree increase in air temperature, from 20 to 22Â°C, means a 12% increase in the water vapour content of the atmosphere and hence in the amount of energy in the atmosphere, as we have unfortunately seen confirmed in hurricane Katrina.
We have to pool our efforts to organise our civil defence response: that is truly a job to be tackled at Union level and no longer just by the Member States.
We must strengthen our commitment to intervene following disasters, but above all, particularly as extreme events are getting worse, we must reinforce a global prevention plan that includes the maintenance of watercourses.
It is clear that, when one addresses the situation on the ground, all the necessary measures need to be carried out on the ground.
Such maintenance must allow for the hydroelectric use of watercourses, as well as reforestation and the recycling of biomass for energy purposes: in short, a measure designed to implement a systems-oriented plan of work.
That is the subject that I should like to put to you, and I have yet to hear any discussion of its importance.
We must ensure that it can all be sustained with own resources so as to constitute a great resource for the European Union as a whole.
It is a scheme that should enhance our security in terms of water resources, geology and fire protection and also enable us to make use of energy generated on the ground.
It is a systems-oriented measure that I call on the European Union to promote in support of the actions taken by Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too wish to pay my respects and those of the Verts/ALE Group to those killed, injured, or otherwise suffering from the effects of these calamities, for which â although we describe them as ânatural disastersâ â human action must bear at least some share of the blame.
In particular, as I see it, the images we have seen from the USA over recent days show that we politicians have the great responsibility of doing everything humanly possible to prevent such calamities or to alleviate their effects.
I have two or three practical questions I would like to put to Commissioner Dimas.
The first has to do with protection against flooding.
We heard, particularly from Austria, complaints to the effect that there was room for improvement in cross-border cooperation, for example on the Danube.
Could you, Commissioner Dimas, say something more, and more specific, about what instruments the EU possesses to deal with this?
Turning to the forest fires in Portugal, this is the second year that we have been faced with such an extreme situation.
Last year, measures were introduced in the individual locations; do you have as yet any initial findings relating to them?
Were these measures effective this year?
If we are now to talk in terms of new funding, it follows that we have to know which measures are effective and which are not.
Another thing I particularly want to do is to take up MrÂ Prodiâs idea.
I am astonished, Commissioner Dimas, by the lack of any more proactive approach in your speech.
Climatologists are predicting extreme drought in Southern Europe, as well as flooding and extreme weather phenomena in Central Europe, not to mention that climate change will make hurricanes and typhoons even more powerful and even more devastating.
They have produced a whole range of publications on the subject.
Let me ask you, Commissioner Dimas, whether we ought not, at last, to do more about climate change, on top of all the many things that are said about it?
Where have we got to with the second European Climate Change Programme, and how do you intend to inject more life into the climate talks in Montreal this autumn and winter?
If we decide on measures to protect us against climate change and organise them in an intelligent way, these self-same measures will reduce our dependence on crude oil and help to improve the quality of the air in our towns and cities.
Perhaps the Commission should shed some light on the details of what would be a win-win-win situation.
Â Â  â We welcome the scheduling of this debate, as we proposed at the beginning of August.
Some 200Â 000 hectares of forest in Portugal and over 120Â 000 hectares in Spain have thus far been scorched as a result of the severe drought.
Dozens of human lives, including those of firefighters, have been lost; homes, farms and factories have been destroyed; protected ecosystems have been lost.
That is without mentioning the heavy emotional cost, for which nothing, nobody, will compensate.
We therefore wish to express our deepest condolences and our solidarity with the bereaved families and with the populations in the affected regions.
We should also like to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the firefighters and the people that have made efforts to combat the fires.
In light of the seriousness of the situation, the Commission must quickly step up its collaboration with the national authorities to support the populations, to help minimise the effects of the fires and the flooding, to support all national support initiatives aimed at restoring the production capacities of the affected regions, thereby creating jobs and providing compensation for the social costs involved in job losses and destruction of livelihoods.
This can be done by activating the Solidarity Fund for the regions and countries affected, if necessary by changing it.
Community administrative procedures must be facilitated, especially those relating to the need to re-programme the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
Measures must be taken to make these procedures more flexible.
Support must be given for the reforestation of the affected areas â taking account of their bio-climatic and ecological characteristics â and for forest fire prevention measures, such as firebreaks, forest tracks, access points, water points and forestry programmes.
Payment of certain direct aid to farmers under the common agricultural policy must be brought forward so as to take account of the problem of the fires and the drought on the farming sector.
Article 87(2) of the Treaty must also be implemented as a matter of urgency, with the aim of granting appropriate financial aid to all affected sectors.
A further urgently required measure is the implementation of an effective, Community-wide protection system, in order to protect farmers, especially small and medium-sized holdings, against dangers and crises such as those arising from the current drought and fires, or floods.
Possible measures include a public farmersâ insurance scheme financed by Community funds, enabling farmers to receive a minimum wage in the event of public disasters of this nature.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am myself from the Vorarlberg, one of the places affected, but am every bit as deeply affected by what is going on in Portugal and in the Southern States of the USA.
A committed European ought, after all, to look much further afield and go beyond what Members have already â and rightly â said.
We ought, actually, to be looking as far ahead as 2050.
Climate change is happening now.
That is not just what Klaus TÃ¶pfer, the head of the UN Environment Programme, says; it is also a matter of scientific observation.
Is it not high time for a master plan to be drawn up with all speed â one rather like the one that NASA drew up to address the anticipated climate change as long ago as the 1980s â which would list what we can expect to have to cope with in great detail and without taboos, not even the taboo against the evacuation of certain currently inhabited areas?
Here in Europe, we will not be able to afford to rebuild â every year or every three years â the places we are still protecting.
It is high time that we really did look further ahead.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to say that I share the words of the President of Parliament, along with those of Mr Galeote, Mr Casaca and Mr Guerreiro, who gave an overview of the situation and with which I am in broad agreement.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, to address a few remarks directly to you.
Quite apart from humanitarian and technical considerations, there is also a political dimension.
The political question is whether or not the European institutions, and the Commission in particular, have the ability to give an unequivocal example of what European cooperation can be, of European solidarity for the many populations affected.
I wish to tell you that the best thing that Europe can do at the present time for Portugal â the country that I know best â is to offer a swift and effective response to the populations affected, of which there are many throughout my country.
A response a year from now, however technically good, technically perfect even, is worse than an immediate response that has political meaning.
This is my message. I wish to express my hope that the Commission is able to translate these intentions into reality and that Parliament, in the guise of its temporary committee, applies the necessary pressure and offers the help needed for this to happen.
Â Â  Mr President, as other speakers have already said, during this summer 2005, two natural phenomena, the devastating fires and the horrendous floods, have caused destruction and the tragic loss of human lives throughout the European continent: in the Member States, in certain candidate countries and also amongst our closest neighbours, such as Switzerland.
In its Resolution, the Socialist Group wishes to pay a sincere tribute to these victims and to express its solidarity with their families and friends.
In our Resolution, we Socialists note that these disasters are not isolated events, but that they happen year after year, their repetition demonstrating structural problems, which include climate change, but also others linked, for example, to agriculture and the agricultural use of land.
In its Resolution, the Socialist Group calls for European solidarity, not just through an immediate economic commitment, asking the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, but also through other medium- and long-term measures, such as the creation of a European civil protection body or a European drought monitoring centre, or also, ladies and gentlemen, through the production of an initiative report.
We believe that this would be more effective than a temporary committee, and would seal the commitment that the European Parliament must also make, not just urging other institutions, such as the European Commission for example, to work, but also working itself as a legislator, in this case via its different committees, which could work together, as I have said, to produce an initiative report on forest fires and on the natural disasters that regularly desolate our continent in the summer.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European drought monitoring centre would naturally be a tool for promoting knowledge and reducing and monitoring the effects of drought in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, Europe under water, Europe under fire, this ought not to be inevitable, yet, unfortunately, it is a recurring theme, and every year we are forced to speak about it.
These disasters are mistakenly described as natural disasters.
In actual fact, we know that fires are nearly always, in the first place, caused by human beings, whether because they are criminal acts, because they are linked to acts of carelessness or because they are due to political choices that have led us to neglect entire areas.
Faced with these disasters, we have to join together and let solidarity prevail.
We require a genuine European public security organisation that combines human and material resources so that real European mutual aid can exist.
Commissioner, you have made proposals along these lines.
Faced with the scale of the disaster in Portugal, I was struck by the lack of resources on the ground.
This would suggest that a precise list of everybodyâs forces should be drawn up, and it is the responsibility of the Commission to take the initiative for this.
We will support it in this area.
We also need to carry out repairs, and in order to do so, we must make use of the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund.
We must, however, use these for prevention purposes.
In this area, awareness campaigns encouraging vigilance and reminding arsonists of the penalties they incur must be implemented, or, as the case may be, strengthened.
With regard to forestry policy and agricultural policy, let us acknowledge our mistakes, let us question the decisions that have led to lands being neglected and the spread of scrubland, where it is impossible for our public security forces to intervene effectively.
We also need to make better use of plant species to combat fires.
The floods that have descended on Central Europe and Alpine Europe are not inevitable either.
They are often due to the outcome of climate change and human activity.
We are equipped with instruments and a raft of measures.
We simply must call on the Member States to take on their share of the contract and to apply the national implementing measures without delay.
The Commission must also present proposals to us for 2012.
Without doubt, it is primarily human lives, those of our fire fighters and of our rescue teams, which for us are at stake, not to mention the ecological disaster and the need to regenerate the natural environment.
It is with all of the direct or indirect victims in mind that we must intervene.
In my constituency, in the Alps, we have had flooding, and in Provence and Corsica there have been fires.
It is for this reason that European solidarity must operate as a survival reflex.
Â Â  Mr President, although we have already, today, expressed our solidarity with the victims of this environmental disaster, it is at least as important that we should continue to make solidarity with the persons affected within the European Union our concern even after the television cameras have been switched off.
When people are starting again from scratch for the third time in six years, as some are having to do in my part of the world, it is not surprising that there is a lot of despair in evidence.
I believe that our definition of the Solidarity Fund is too narrow if it is not possible for Europe to intervene financially to deal with this, despite losses of the kind seen in the region from which I come, where one third of the provincial budget has â in the truest sense of the word â been washed away.
Apart from reformulating the criteria for the Solidarity Fund, what can the EU do?
Above all, I think, it can remind the Member States of their own responsibilities.
As has already been said, climate change is already happening here.
It has to be reiterated that Austria â and this I say as an Austrian â still has much to do when it comes to achieving the Kyoto target.
You, Commissioner, cannot simply stand by and say that you will see to it that there are as many aircraft as possible in place in the event of a fire; we have to take action before things get that far.
In working across borders too â as we have seen from the floods, when different Member States were affected by the same adverse weather conditions â in the INTERREG programmes, and in research projects, priority needs to be given to cross-border measures and prevention.
We have discussions on this subject to look forward to, and I see it as an area in which a rethink is called for.
It is now open to us, in the next research framework programme and in the trans-European networks, to take appropriate medium-term action in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking all those who, in highly sacrificial ways, gave help in the various disasters that are the regrettable topic of todayâs debate, getting stuck in and helping, as quickly as possible, to limit the damage by giving speedy aid wherever it was needed.
With many speakers, I can do no other than agree.
We must of course prepare ourselves for the disasters that seem to come our way with ever-increasing frequency.
I want to make it very clear, Commissioner Dimas, that the programmes that the Commission put forward resulted in preventive measures being taken.
I can tell you that that was the case in my own home region, upon which the flooding has now had an appalling impact, and where the various measures we took to deal with flooding resulted in markedly less damage being done than in the past, even though the quantity of water was greater than when the area was last flooded.
What that means is that aid is having an effect and is also being used to prepare preventive infrastructures.
It is of course very regrettable that, in my electoral district and elsewhere, the flood occurred while these were being built, with the consequence that a number of things that were under construction were also destroyed and the floodwater took another course than it would have done had the infrastructure been completed.
I would like to appeal to the Commission to make extensive use of the Solidarity Fund.
Funds for this purpose are still available for 2005.
I hope that the Member States affected will soon be in a position to give Brussels a report on what the damage amounts to and enable the Commission to make funds promptly available for the speedy rebuilding of public facilities â for that is the major problem where I come from â and to help build up protective infrastructure.
That will be the right response and will put us on the right track.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a verse, the greatest Portuguese poet once described love as âfire that burns without being seenâ.
I should like to talk to you about other fires â ones that burn and can be seen; fires that cause something very different from love, because they spread sadness, they confirm how impotent we are, they cause terror, they induce anguish, they kill, they destroy wealth and they undermine confidence in the present and hope for the future.
This has manifested itself in a great sea of grey, and a giant cloak of smoke continues to lay waste to Portugal, especially the Central and Northern regions.
The forest fire disaster has thus far given us some terrible statistics; the fires have burnt more than 240Â 000 hectares!
Yesterday, indeed, Motorway number 1, which links Lisbon and Oporto, was closed to traffic for hours, due to a fire burning near the town of FÃ¡tima.
At the same time, flames continued to devastate the districts of Aveiro, BraganÃ§a, Guarda, Leiria, SantarÃ©m and Viseu.
In my district, Coimbra, which is the worst affected, the flames have consumed 32 km2 in the municipality of Pampilhosa da Serra alone, and only 8 km2 of forest remained.
This municipality has been totally decimated and has virtually been wiped off the map.
In the city of Coimbra itself, the fire leapt over the River Mondego, penetrated well into the urban area and levelled everything in its path.
The flames travelled 20Â km in three hours.
Some 80% of the Vale de Canas National Forest has been destroyed.
Other municipalities in the region, such as Miranda do Corvo, where I am the chairman of the municipal assembly, Penela, Poiares, Penacova and Soure, have been hit in devastating fashion.
In some regions of the country, the picture is disastrous; the majority of the population has been affected and economic stability has been undermined (the forest is of key importance to the local and regional economy).
There is no doubt that the situation meets the exceptional conditions that Commissioner HÃŒbner has deemed acceptable for mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund.
This summer, Spain, France and Greece have endured the same story, suffering similarly devastating effects.
The fight against disasters must be made an EU priority.
Coming back to Portugal, in addition to the problem of the forest fires, we have the problem of the drought, which now affects 100% of mainland Portuguese territory: more than 80% of the country has suffered extreme drought and around 20% severe drought.
It is horrendous.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe that we are building is first and foremost an area of solidarity; and that solidarity must be translated into action, even if the strict letter of the law does not quite match up to the hard reality that we are enduring.
There is always more to life than can be covered in regulations.
Let us wipe out misery, sadness, impotence, terror, anguish, death and the destruction of wealth.
Let us raise the flags of confidence in the present and hope for the future.
It is a matter of urgent priority that we minimise losses of all kinds arising from the fires and the drought in Portugal.
Portuguese citizens confidently expect a significant gesture of support from the citizens of other parts of Europe, a gesture that should be given material form by Europeâs institutions.
This is the only way in which we will achieve more and better Europe. This is the only way in which Europe will fulfil its destiny.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the end of July I have been keeping a close eye on the terrible tragedy of the forest fires throughout the country.
Quite apart from the widespread destruction, it has caused panic and taken lives.
There have been 18 fatalities in Portugal, including one Pedro Figueiredo, a dedicated firefighter from Oliveira de AzemÃ©is, who was due to run in the October local elections on the basis of his extraordinary civic and community dedication.
The threat of large-scale fires has not gone away; it is still present.
As recently as last night, coming from the interior of the country to make the journey here, I passed the great fire of Sardoal, which was still burning.
We knew that this was going to happen this year, not only because of the experience of previous years and the weather forecasts, but also because our forests had become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the drought, the other plague ravaging my country and its countryside for a number of months now.
In April, during the debate and in Parliamentâs resolution, which I was involved in tabling, the risk was already clearly forecast and clearly apparent.
This is why I was taken aback by the apparent initial surprise that characterised the response and by the hesitation in some countries.
I was similarly surprised by the decision taken by the Council of Ministers in June to scrap the firebreak subsidy.
This decision was entirely incorrect in and of itself and especially absurd in a year such as this.
The dire problem of the forest fires has created a deep sense that the Portuguese countryside has no hope, that it is unsustainable, and that it has been abandoned and neglected.
Our forest is one of our greatest national treasures.
There are many reasons why it is so vulnerable, and we must address all of them.
Consequently, as chairman of the party, I have tabled a proposal to set up a national agenda for the defence of the forest.
Our desire is to work with others to ensure that this agenda is implemented rigorously and consistently until such time as we achieve security.
It is also necessary, however, to look into the European-level implications of the issue and the reasons why Europe must step up its involvement in these activities.
One of the reasons why the Portuguese forest is so vulnerable is the desertification of the country, the sudden, radical change in the demography of the countryside and the sudden abandonment of farming and traditional practices across large areas.
In other words, let us not forget that there is another side of the common agricultural policy, which was never designed to address the realities of the Mediterranean.
Consequently, we must look increasingly towards mobilising European solidarity in the tasks of rebuilding and managing the forests.
The resolution that we have tabled represents a step in this direction and that is the way forward.
We must also set up a temporary committee of inquiry in order to raise our awareness of these realities.
I wish to thank the President of the Commission for the way in which he responded in writing to the letter that I sent to him, in which he offered guarantees that the Commission would not fail to help my country and those worst affected.
On the other side of the coin, I regret the Councilâs absence, which sends out a pitiful message in response to such a large-scale tragedy in Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, natural disasters cause both pain and unhappiness, but they give the European Union the opportunity to show its solidarity and human face.
They give us the opportunity to demonstrate that we are prepared in difficult times to support each other.
I congratulate everyone who spoke earlier, especially on the unanimity which they expressed.
We too are with them.
We all support both the Portuguese with the fires which have affected them and the central Europeans with their floods.
However, I would like to make one point.
Fires and floods have happened in the past and will always continue to happen.
However, the majority of the scientific community states with certainty that, nowadays, these extreme weather conditions have increased in intensity as a result of ecological disaster, as a result of the climate change which we have brought about.
Let us take advantage of this opportunity to sound the alarm and increase everyone's awareness of environmental protection issues.
We know that the European Union sets great store by this issue and quite rightly so.
Other major industrial powers, such as the United States of America, India and China, also need to understand that, unless we protect this environment, sooner or later it will fall on our heads.
One other point I would like to make is that blanket tree-planting both before and after fires must take greater account in future of the advice of forestry experts so that we plant more trees which do not burn easily.
One last point I wish to make â and the previous speaker made the same point â is that, over recent years, over recent decades, our mountain villages have been deserted.
When people leave our forests, it is like guards leaving the army, it is like guards leaving the borders.
We need to re-examine our rural policy so that mountain areas are not deserted, so that people stay in mountain villages.
Â Â  I have been following this debate closely and with pleasure.
It is not the subject that is pleasurable, but the attitude demonstrated by the Commissioner and my fellow Members with regard to this grave matter.
The reason I have been following this debate is not only because the region I represent â for example the village of MÃ¡d, an important area for Tokaj wine production â is one of those that suffered severe damage, and because in Romania, a neighbouring country to my homeland, the damage has reached devastating proportions.
It is because I feel that here, in the European Union, we have to do a bit more than we have done so far.
As regards the extent of the damage in Romania, let me tell you about the case of a village that was inundated by a two-metre-high wave of water in a twenty-minute cloudburst.
I do not think this needs any further explanation.
In such cases immediate rescue operations are required.
If there were a civil protection force that could be deployed for rescue purposes at a European level, then even eurosceptic citizens of the Union would realise that the work we undertake together is worthwhile.
Rescue operations are followed by reconstruction, and this requires money.
We have funds for this purpose, but I agree with the previous speakers who have said that we should probably review the regulations relating to the way these are used.
It is unacceptable that support should take more than a year to reach the beneficiary, or even that it should take nearly a year, as is now happening in the case of Slovakia.
Lastly, many speakers have referred to the question of prevention.
I think that EU resources should be used primarily for this purpose, as this is where they can be most effective.
I agree with the previous speaker, for example, who gave particular importance to reviewing the situation as regards forestry from this perspective.
However, this must be decided on the basis of thorough analysis rather than a bright idea from the Members of this House.
For this reason, I support the proposal of my group to set up an ad hoc committee to deal with this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I want to express my solidarity with all the victims and to thank particularly the many who gave voluntary help.
We have had terrible fires in southern Europe, dreadful floods in the USA, in China and, in particular, in the European Alps.
The Vorarlberg, the Tyrol, Switzerland and many areas in Bavaria were seriously affected.
The damage in my own homeland, the Tyrol, was massive.
Let me quote you a few figures: the damage done to the public road network, to the system supplying drinking water, to the building of commercial roads and to communications amounted to hundreds of millions of euros.
In total, over a thousand houses were damaged, and the destruction of factories and business premises meant that many people lost their livelihoods.
It is obvious to all of us that we now need to act quickly, and, in particular, to be thorough in examining what caused this.
Commissioner Dimas has already highlighted a number of measures that have been taken.
Although they amount to a good start, they must be followed by others, especially in view of the deficiencies in cross-border cooperation.
The EUâs Solidarity Fund will also play its part, and we should adapt its rules to enable a proper response to major events of this kind, which affect whole regions.
Priority must, however, be given to thorough analysis.
Let us not lose sight of the unfortunate fact that these natural disasters have become more devastating over recent years and that they are also occurring with far greater frequency.
There is no doubt that the greater impact has to do with the more intensive exploitation on our part of confined spaces, particularly in mountainous areas, and also with the settlement of vulnerable areas.
It follows that we have to give close consideration to what areas are amenable to settlement.
Likewise, there is no doubt that the greater frequency is closely connected with global warming, but the way to address this is through continual research promoted by European programmes, particularly in exploring the possibilities of prevention.
What is important, though, is that the results we obtain be given practical expression, and this will mean the Member States and regions taking their obligations seriously if we are to be able to prevent such terrible occurrences in the future.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the disasters that have hit certain EU Member States have been a source of distress to all of us.
I saw at close quarters the fires in Portugal and Spain while they were still raging, and also the widespread devastation they wreaked.
Assistance cannot be denied to countries that have been struck by misfortune on such a large scale, and it is for this reason that I am naturally in favour of the motion for a resolution.
A more general consideration comes to mind in this context, however.
Europe is being hit by a great many disasters, and their number is increasing.
Such disasters include fires in southern Europe and floods in central Europe.
My country, Poland, is also frequently affected by floods, the worst of which occurred eight years ago.
Other disasters to have hit Europe include hurricanes, as was the case not long ago in Slovakia, and even earthquakes.
We must be better prepared, firstly to prevent such disasters, and secondly to provide each other with assistance in dealing with their aftermath.
I believe that a general debate on the functioning of the system for preventing disasters and providing aid in the event of such disasters is needed.
This debate would also deal with the joint measures we could take to improve this system, and should take place in a calm atmosphere and be unrelated to any specific event.
I propose that such a debate be held in the not too distant future, or in other words over the next few months.
The European Commission should also put forward comprehensive proposals to ensure that this debate is not merely held whenever there is a fire, flood or disaster.
Disasters know no borders.
We must therefore act together to develop cross-border disaster prevention systems, and provide each other with cross-border assistance to deal with their aftermath.
We must work in a methodical and organised manner, however.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed a great many natural disasters in Europe over the past few years.
As mayor of Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©, I had first-hand experience of the floods which hit the Czech Republic, and which led to a number of our towns being inundated and many people being left homeless.
Floods result all too often in the loss of life and property throughout Central Europe, for example in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Romania.
Southern Europe, on the other hand, suffers from oppressive heat waves and ferocious fires.
As we heard a short time ago, forest fires are still raging in Spain and Portugal, and I saw for myself the devastation they wreak during a trip to observe this summerâs regional elections in the Algarve region of Portugal.
We should also not forget the windstorms that left a trail of destruction in the Baltic States and Sweden in January of this year.
Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is engaged in discussions on its future, there is no better way for its institutions to win over the hearts and minds of the citizens of its Member States than by placing an emphasis on prevention and on the mobilisation of genuine aid, while also reducing the impact of natural disasters of this kind.
I vividly remember the positive response of Czech citizens to the practical financial assistance provided by the EU following the floods that hit our country.
The motion for a resolution due to be debated tomorrow, concerning the release of just under EURÂ 6 million from the Solidarity Fund to deal with the aftermath of the devastating hurricane that hit Slovakia last November, will also be a practical contribution.
Back in January, I held in-depth discussions in Brussels with representatives of Slovak local authorities on the possibility of EU aid for the highest-lying regions of Slovakia, having organised the meeting in my capacity as an MEP and as President of the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic, in order to provide the representatives with information on the opportunities available and the way in which the European institutions work.
At this time, Slovakia also asked the European Union for help in covering the costs of hurricane-related damage.
Over seven months have now passed since this request was made, and yet the areas affected are still waiting for money.
We are far from happy at these delays, and Members of this House should not be either.
We therefore hope that an appropriate decision will be adopted and implemented as soon as possible, hopefully before the first anniversary of the hurricane that raged through the Tatra Mountains.
We should not shirk our responsibilities, and we should lend our support to practical measures.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like first of all to express my support for the victims of the forest fires, which, this summer, set ablaze certain regions in Southern Europe.
Unfortunately, the problem of forest fires is not a new phenomenon.
For over 13 years, the issue of preventing these fires and repairing the damage has been the subject of an action framework at Community level, and for years now the tragic consequences of these fires have met with sorrow in this House at the first part-session after the recess; it is high time that action was taken.
The European Union needs firstly to strengthen cross-border cooperation.
Very often, the Member States use incompatible equipment.
There is also an urgent need to propose Community action programmes for civil protection that are worthy of the name.
More generally, and without substituting for the Member States, the European Union must accord forests the status they deserve both at political and institutional level.
The Commissionâs proposal on forestry strategy, which we are currently examining, seems to me to be slightly half-hearted.
Forests make up 40% of the surface of the European Union.
They generate significant economic activity and have environmental and recreational capacities that I will not point out here.
They deserve better than a minor role between the environment and agriculture.
For these reasons and in order to be even more effective, we must give serious thought to creating an Agency for Forests, not to mention â it is not a crime to dream â a Directorate General specifically focused on forests.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to express my solidarity, as a European, with all those areas that have been struck by natural disasters.
With particular reference to two areas of European policy, namely rural policy and forestry policy, I should like to invite the Commissioner to consider whether we can deploy these policy measures more effectively in those regions that are being hit by drought or other climate-related disasters in the long term.
I refer primarily to southern Europe, southern Spain, but in particular southern Portugal and its cork oaks.
The situation there shows that drought â not a man-made disaster therefore but long-term drought â constitutes a real threat, with all the consequences that this entails: drought stress in trees, including cork oak.
We must see what we can do to offer those governments the opportunity of using either rural policy or forestry policy in order to combat stress diseases in those trees effectively.
This is done far too little at the moment and I am convinced that if measures are not taken promptly, this will lead to climate change in those regions.
The same applies to forestry policy, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and it would be good if in future, this policy could be used more to maintain traditional crops and indigenous tree species.
They may not always be of great economic value, but they are vital if the nature and climate of the areas involved are to be maintained.
In those areas, we could do a great deal by deploying rural and forestry policy to tackle those problems.
Finally, the South is being hit by a drought.
In my own country, many fruit growers were badly affected by frost damage in February.
It would be good if you were to make contact with your agricultural counterpart to assess to what extent the funds for rural policy can be used to pay compensation for extreme damage suffered in a specific year.
In other words, it sometimes pays to be more resourceful with the money you have than to ask for more.
Â Â  Mr President, over the last 100Â years the temperature of the planet has increased by 0.6ÂºC and in Europe, in particular, we have had an increase of 0.9ÂºC.
That is why several Members â Mr Maat, Mr Prodi, Mr Turmes and others â have mentioned the connection between climate change and the recent phenomena and catastrophes.
Over the last few months, the tragic catalogue of natural disasters has tested the European Union's civil protection response to the limit.
Using the Commission's civil protection mechanism, the European Union has dispatched field hospitals, search and rescue teams and forensic experts to help to deal with the aftermath of the Asian tsunami.
Pumps and medical supplies were sent to the flood-affected areas of Romania and Bulgaria.
Water bomber aircraft and specialist helicopters were sent to deal with Portugal's forest fires.
Today, the first consignments of European Union assistance arrived in the United States, following the destruction caused by hurricane Katrina.
Over this period, it has been demonstrated that the European Union system works, and works well.
By pooling the civil protection resources of Member States, we were able to provide a common response that is more effective than any Member State can provide on its own.
A well-coordinated response is always more effective.
In the natural desire to show solidarity with the victims of natural disasters, many nations spontaneously offer support, but without clear coordination there is a risk that assistance will be duplicated or that what is sent will not meet the real needs of the affected region.
The Commission's monitoring and information centre provides a real-time service matching resources with requirements.
In Romania and Bulgaria the crisis had passed by 24Â August, when we received the message that no further international assistance was needed.
Nevertheless, the situation could deteriorate quickly, and the Commission is continuing to monitor the overall flood situation in Central and Eastern Europe.
Romania was immediately offered assistance by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom â almost all the Member States.
The assistance took the form of intervention teams, highly specialised material and financial support.
Assistance in the form of highly-specialised material was immediately offered to Bulgaria by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Malta, Sweden and Slovakia.
Portugal was offered assistance by France, two water bomber aircraft by Italy, one water bomber aircraft by Germany, as well as three Puma helicopters and four other helicopters, and Spain offered one water bomber aircraft in addition to bilateral assistance.
The Netherlands offered two helicopters, Slovakia one.
Norway also offered assistance, but those offers were not needed, so were not taken up.
Today, in Portugal, there are only five fires.
The Dutch helicopters will return tomorrow to the Netherlands and the German helicopters are still operating today but will be going home tomorrow.
I should like to refer to what Mrs GrossetÃªte said about arson.
In Portugal, 98% of the fires were caused by humans.
Twenty percent were caused by arson and the rest by negligence.
Many people have been arrested.
In the United States, the European Union's mobilisation is only just beginning.
Following yesterday's request from the United States Government, the first European Union assistance arrived within 24Â hours from Italy and Germany.
It is important to note that, even though the rules of our civil protection mechanism prevent it from being activated until a formal request is received, Commission experts had contacted their US counterparts last week to explore areas where the European Union could provide the most help.
We received the request yesterday morning.
It is too early to have a final picture, but it is clear that thousands of lives may have been lost.
According to the United Nations, the cost of the damage is likely to be several times that of last December's tsunami.
Even though the request for help was only received yesterday, a large number of states have already offered assistance, including medical teams, water purification equipment and heavy-duty pumps.
I am aware that other Member States are in the process of preparing additional offers.
Some of the assistance is already on site, whereas the rest is still being considered by the United States or is in the process of being dispatched.
The civil protection mechanism response to this year's natural disasters has provided a clear example of European Union added value.
It is important that all Member States channel their assistance to the United States through that mechanism in order to avoid overlapping.
We will use the United Kingdom Presidency as the contact point.
That has worked very well up until now.
Mr Pinheiro and others raised the question of whether the mechanism could work more efficiently.
The mechanism has worked excellently up until now and help from the Member States has been coordinated immediately.
Of course, there is still room for improvement.
That is why, in April this year, the Commission made proposals which would effectively create a European civil protection force, more or less along the lines suggested by Mr Prodi and others.
Having heard the comments today, I am confident that Parliament will support these proposals.
Finally, on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners, I would like to express solidarity with the continued suffering of the victims of hurricane Katrina.
We are standing by to provide any assistance that might be needed.
Â Â  â The debate on this item is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC [16075/1/2004 C6-0128/2005 2003/0107(COD)].
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the serious background to the proposed directive on waste from extractive industries.
It is still only a couple of years since we saw huge accidents involving collapsing tailings dams in Spain and Romania.
In the case of Romania, the accident meant that important river systems were poisoned with cyanide.
These accidents show the huge environmental risks that arise from mining waste not being handled correctly, as well as the subsequent international consequences.
In addition to these major accidents, there has also been a series of minor ones and a kind of continuous poisoning of the environment from improperly handled waste from many years ago, dotted about the countryside and causing, for example, heavy metals to leak out into the water systems.
At present, the European Union has no effective rules for dealing with these environmental problems.
The regulations governing waste have not been adapted to cover this type of waste.
With the proposed directive, something can be done about this.
The cyanide method that was used in Romania would be banned under the proposed directive.
We would make tough demands on the safety and supporting capacity of tailings dams.
We would require mining companies to be serious in their approach, to return the countryside to the way it was and to be able, in economic terms too, to guarantee that the countryside is restored to its former state following mining.
Many of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading have been included by the Council of Ministers in the common position, and that is of course excellent.
Other important proposals have, however, been rejected.
It is therefore important for us to adopt those amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety whereby we are now trying to put back what was adopted at first reading.
I want to give a few examples of such changes.
We do not just want an inventory to be drawn up of old mining waste.
We also want something to be done about the situation, and this, in Parliamentâs proposal, involves obligations.
We also believe that the environmental problems that arise in excavation voids following extraction of minerals should be covered by the directive.
In the Councilâs common position, large groups of waste are exempted from essential parts of the directive, for example the financial guarantee.
If this is to be prevented, we must adopt Amendment 13.
It is important to remember that waste that is not dangerous in the chemical sense can also cause very serious environmental problems.
That also applies to inert waste.
We also propose that there should be greater stringency where exemptions are concerned.
It should not be possible to grant long-term exemptions whereby waste can be put to one side.
Instead, proper waste-processing facilities should be built.
Such long-term exemptions now form part of the Councilâs position.
These are some examples of amendments through which we in Parliament want to see a significantly more far-reaching, effective and progressive directive than is the case with the Councilâs common position.
Voting against these amendments would be tantamount to lowering our environmental ambitions.
A stringent and constructive directive in this area will not only be of benefit to the environment but will also favour the best, most modern and most environmentally aware mining companies that are also most serious in their approach.
It will bring about speedier improvement in the industry.
Commendably, it will also penalise those which do not accept their environmental responsibility.
It will favour environmental technology and research.
It may also make the EU a world leader in the area of environmental technology where mining is concerned, which would be another positive factor and might mean our being able to help other regions of the world.
With the proposals put forward in my report by Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have an opportunity to prevent serious accidents, similar to those in Spain and Romania, from happening in the future.
We can ensure that we do not have to see more such accidents.
We have the opportunity to reduce the amount of poisons released into our water systems.
We also have the opportunity consistently to do something about damage wrought upon the environment in the past and to obtain better water status.
Let us take advantage of these opportunities.
Last but not least, I wish to thank my fellow MEPs for their constructive cooperation.
A number of fellow MEPs from a variety of political groups have put forward amendments that have improved this report.
I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and I want to thank the Commission for its very constructive cooperation so far.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, more importantly, its rapporteur, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, for their painstaking preparation of this recommendation for second reading.
With the consequences of the serious accidents caused by mining waste in Aznalcollar in Spain in 1998 and in Baia Mare in Romania in 2000 still fresh, the aim of the proposal for a Commission directive was to introduce rules at European Union level in a bid to minimise the repercussions which storing waste in tailings dams or heaps has on the environment and on human health, both under normal operating conditions and in the event of an accident.
In conjunction with the revised Sevezo II Directive on the control of major industrial accidents and a document on best available practices, the proposed directive will safeguard the proper management of waste from extractive industries throughout the European Union.
At first reading, the Commission accepted in full, in part or in principle 46 of the 74 amendments tabled by the European Parliament, in that they clarified and improved the text, while remaining consistent with the format and approach of the original Commission proposal.
Forty-one amendments have now been incorporated into the common position either verbatim or materially.
The Council discussed the proposal during the Irish and Dutch Presidencies; it soon became apparent that a significant majority of the Member States considered that the scope of the Commission proposal was excessively ambitious and implied spending which they felt was out of proportion with the probable risks.
The Commission considers that many of the changes adopted in the common position improve its initial proposal.
Most importantly, the provisions relating to inert waste have been extended, licensing procedures have been detailed, references to Community standards have been increased, especially to the standards adopted in the framework directive on water, demands for the long-term stability of waste facilities have been reinforced, stricter limit values have been set for cyanide compounds and an inventory of closed, abandoned sites has now been demanded.
At the same time, the Council, which is interested in the principle of proportionality, has granted the Member States the facility to exempt non-hazardous, non-inert waste from certain provisions of the directive, especially from the need for a financial guarantee.
The Commission would prefer the wording of its initial proposal, which did not allow such exemptions.
However, the Commission has decided to support the common position, taking account of the fact:
first, that no general exemption from the basic provisions of the directive is allowed and the competent authorities in the Member States will decide on a case-by-case basis and,
secondly, that no exemption is allowed from the main environmental safeguarding clauses in the directive relating to the safe design, operation, closure and after-closure of waste facilities.
However, I would like to point out that the Commission is willing to examine in a positive spirit any other possibility for compromise which may arise.
I trust that we shall complete the procedure for this proposal as quickly as possible.
We need the new directive, which will safeguard the environmentally correct management of mining waste both during the day-to-day operation of waste facilities and in the event of a major accident.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, in this Common Position, many of the amendments adopted by this House at first reading have been taken on board.
Improvements include the definition of waste, which has been made clearer, and a more precise description of the financial securities and the inventory of closed sites, along with the rules applicable to them.
I can also go along wholeheartedly with what Mr SjÃ¶stedt has just said; good work has been done, with a good cooperative approach, but there is one point, and a crucial one, on which we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats take a different view, and that is where the differential weighting of waste is concerned.
We have to take account of the fact that mining waste has a different potential risk, and, as the Common Position does just that, it is right that the Member States should be able to distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous waste and reduce â or annul â the conditions placed upon non-hazardous, non-inert waste other than that very precisely defined as hazardous and included in Category A. There is a wide spectrum of mining waste, extending from such harmless materials as playsand, salt and topsoil at one end to the toxic cyanide derived from ore mining at the other.
We cannot apply one single measure to everything.
Particularly where non-hazardous, non-inert waste is involved, the imposition of excessive burdens on small and medium-sized businesses in the quarrying and earth-moving sector is indefensible.
As you, Commissioner, pointed out, a quarry, or a sand or gravel pit cannot be regarded in the same light as a landfill for hazardous waste; all they are doing is meeting the demand for building materials.
I ask that the amendment to Article 3 be adopted.
It is intended to extend the scope of this directive to the burning of chalk.
People are willing to buy and use the waste products resulting from this, of which chalk dust is one; they are not hazardous and the Landfill Directive is not meant to apply to them.
This would avoid unnecessary costs associated with landfill.
In all that we do, we must not lose sight of our objective, which is to keep people and the environment safe with the minimum of red tape and expense.
This is intended to achieve that end.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall now, for once, use my three minutes to say something basic.
I do not propose to go into the vast number of points of detail that many in the House find incomprehensible but which those of us who are involved in this debate understand as a matter of course; I am sure that there will be other Members who will want to discuss them.
This directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is a piece of legislation that does not exactly evoke much interest on the part of most of the European public â at any rate, not from those who live in my own country â but that has done nothing to save us from energetic lobbying on the part of interested parties â on the one hand, the unions, the industry and its associations and, on the other, the various environmental and consumer groups.
Our drafting of a resolution has been made no easier by the fact that none of them want the same thing all the time â sometimes, indeed, the precise opposite.
All the same, I do believe that the Environmental Committee has presented the plenary with a balanced piece of legislation on which to vote, particularly as this Directive is supplementary in character.
The Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive largely exclude the extractive industries, the types of waste produced by which do not in fact fit the regulations exactly, in that many of them present no problems in terms of the environment.
Legal certainty, though, is a necessity â not only for people and their environment, but also for trading enterprises and for businesses engaged in the extraction of such raw materials as oil, coal, metals, clay, gravel or sand.
There are two things that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament always bear in mind: first, the protection of people and the environment, with a sustainable way of doing business, and secondly our enterprisesâ need for a proper framework and conditions if they are to be able to do business and create jobs for the people whom we â as I said in my first point â want to protect from harm.
Our rapporteur, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, has been perceptive and rigorous in taking both these principles into account in this proposal for a resolution, and for that, many thanks to him.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I welcome the Commission's initiative requiring the best practice of some Member States to be applied to all.
It is certainly the case that an impressive number of Parliament's amendments have already been adopted and I think congratulations are due to the rapporteur.
I am sorry that the Council has introduced a number of loopholes.
I rather prefer the Commission's more ambitious proposals.
Well, let us see how the votes go.
But even if some of the more controversial amendments before us are accepted, I think that the Council and industry should understand that Parliament's representation on the Conciliation Committee will be positive and pragmatic.
It is not in any of our interests to require steps to be taken that would hinder the efficient and economic operation of this industry.
We must accommodate some of the concerns expressed, for example the need for a proper transitional period to ensure that problems with mines closing prematurely in order to avoid the obligations of this directive are circumvented.
But the Council should understand that Parliament must insist that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the natural environment is properly protected from commercial interests otherwise tempted to think only of short-term gain.
As the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out, the sins that have been committed in the past need to be avoided in the future.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also fully supports the report by MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt and congratulates him on his work.
It is true that at a time when political Europe is searching for its identity, Europeans are, for their part, demanding that health protection and the preservation of the environment remain a priority for the European Union.
This draft directive is directed to this end and it will also provide legal clarification.
This directive is justified by the amount of waste created by mineral extractions, which we know produce each year nearly a third of the waste generated in the Union, some of which is toxic, indeed very toxic.
As it is inadequately treated and stored, it can seriously threaten the environment and peopleâs safety.
We all recall the consequences of the Baia Mare and Baia Borsa disasters.
This directive must also ensure that the new accession countries have the means to eradicate pollution from waste produced by extractions in the past.
Furthermore, the industrialists concerned own operations throughout the world, and in order to prevent further disasters, the European Union must set an example by implementing operating rules guaranteeing the safety of workers and better protection of the environment.
If you will allow me, I would like to offer three examples: the first concerns the operation of the uranium mines in Niger by European businesses.
I have some knowledge of this â they are French businesses.
The issue of contaminated waste has been raised time and again, during the Irish Presidency, for example, but even now questions remain unanswered.
The second example concerns the very controversial project of the opening of a gold mine at Rosia Montana, in Romania, a project that provides for the construction of a tailings pond for waste of highly toxic extraction, with a dam â brace yourselves â measuring 30 metres high.
Finally, the last example calls to mind the destruction of the coral reef in New Caledonia, for which we were responsible, by extractive waste from the nickel mines.
This last example, Commissioner, illustrates the need to prohibit direct discharges into continental, coastal or marine waters, unless, of course, they are compatible with the Water and Waste directives.
For all of these reasons, we support the work carried out by our rapporteur and we hope that you will support these amendments.
Mr President, although mining is less widespread in Ireland now than it once was, some mining companies have left a legacy that continues to pollute our land and water due to a lack of proper checks.
A case in point is the situation in Tynagh Mines in Co. Galway in the West of Ireland, which, since its closure in 1981, has continued to be an environmental hazard.
Throughout the European Union, hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated by mining and many sites left in a condition which poses grave dangers.
It is important, therefore, to deal not only with waste generated following such a directive but also to deal with historical waste arising from facilities that have been abandoned or which were not shut down properly.
We should also reverse the Council's lifelong exemption from some of the key provisions for certain existing facilities.
The rapporteur's proposals, as one of my colleagues has already said, are balanced; they should be welcomed by responsible companies within the mining industry, as well as by people whose lives and livelihoods have been damaged by irresponsible mining operations.
I commend this excellent report by Mr SjÃ¶stedt and thank him for his work.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this report and encourage the rapporteur to keep fighting for as strong a directive as possible.
In Ireland, as in many other places, we cannot begin to deal with the problem of deteriorating human health or clean up our environment without tackling the problem of old mines and the waste that was left behind when the mines were closed and the mining companies dissolved.
In Silvermines, County Tipperary, a 147-acre, 40-foot high plateau of fine red toxic tailing pond blights the area and in dry weather the dust blows across several counties.
Mud lagoons dissolve the mercury, arsenic, cadmium, antimony and many other toxic minerals, and channel them via neighbouring streams straight into the Shannon River, only metres away from where the water supply for Limerick City is taken.
Animals and, most importantly, people in the area suffer from an incredible range â a tragic range â of diseases, the kind that demonstrate an environmental attack on the immune system.
That is a sin from the past; the company concerned has gone and the mess needs to be cleaned up.
A further problem is that one of the biggest industries in the west of Ireland is a company that ships mining waste into Ireland.
It is on an island and has its own docks.
It brings in bauxite to make alumina.
It claims that it is safe and it creates big red mud tailings ponds.
That industry wants to expand this year, next year and the year after.
The rate of animal death in the area was so alarming that it sparked an investigation a number of years ago, which documented unprecedented animal deaths.
It was not uncommon for farmers â and these are not large farms â to have lost 150 animals per farm in the area around the industry.
Also very startling was the amount of human death from cancer and the amount of learning disability among children.
We need very strong âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, âone size fits allâ is one of the curses of EU legislation and, if the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety gets its way, we will have under this directive another classic illustration of it in action.
Although not all extractive industries have the same environmental and safety impact, if the Committee on the Environment succeeds, then this legislation will make them all needlessly subject to the same restraint.
Legislation to fit the need is one thing, legislation not tailored to need is invariably oppressive and destructive of competitiveness.
So it is here, with the rapporteur trying to require all sites â regardless of size, product and complexity â to comply with all articles.
There is no sound reason why the shallow sand quarry should be subjected to the same legislative demands as the large, deep mine producing hazardous waste.
The requirements for non-hazardous or inert waste should remain proportional and not, as proposed by the committee, be largely subjected to the same stringency as Category A hazardous-waste sites.
The framework directive on waste and the landfill directive make adequate provision for non-hazardous waste quarries.
There is no convincing or compelling reason for these further burdens to be placed on this important sector of our economic production.
Â Â  I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for continuing in the second reading to fight for strict regulation that takes human and environmental assets and interests into account.
We desperately need this directive, which covers mining waste containing cyanide and heavy metals, and other waste that presents a risk to the environment, for example due to its physical volume.
Let us recall the disaster, dubbed simply by some the âcyanide-tsunamiâ, that took place in the Romanian town of Baia Mare (NagybÃ¡nya) in 2000, or the contamination incident in Spain in 1998.
In both of these cases, large volumes of dangerous substances spilled into rivers, causing enormous damage to the natural environment, even in neighbouring countries.
The legislation now before us has some very good qualities.
It tightens licensing procedures and places greater emphasis on prevention; it makes it compulsory for operators to draw up a detailed waste management plan and makes information on mining waste more accessible; its extends the areas to which financial guarantees relating to such operations will apply, and obliges mining companies to ensure complete rehabilitation and monitoring of areas where they have ceased operations.
As far as I am concerned, however, the most important and most forward-looking aspect â in view of the impending accession of Romania and Bulgaria, and the large-scale mining projects currently in preparation or under way that present a risk to the environment and to neighbouring countries â is that the new directive must also be taken into account by newly acceding Member States from the date it enters into force.
For this very reason, I call upon my fellow Members to vote in favour of these rigorous amendments aimed at achieving environmental protecting objectives, and in doing so to take a major step towards safeguarding our environment and preventing disasters.
Â Â  Mr President, five years ago there was an appalling incident of cyanide pollution on the River Tisza caused by a gold mine in Baia Mare, Romania.
Before this incident, the term âenvironmental policyâ had been nothing more than a strange phrase for many ordinary people living on the two banks of the river â for peasants, shepherds and fishermen.
After 30Â January 2000, they understood the meaning of âenvironmental policyâ: to prevent pollution of this kind, in which 100Â 000Â m3 of hazardous sludge leaked into the River Tisza, destroying its flora and fauna.
I do not like to speak in terms of money when we are talking about the value of nature, but the Centre for Environmental Studies estimated that the loss of revenue suffered by commercial fishing and tourism was around EURÂ 18Â million in Hungary alone, not including the loss of natural heritage or environmental damage.
That is why I welcome this report.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt did an excellent job: as well as writing a good report, he went to Baia Mare, Romania, where he visited the site of the pollution.
He met the people living, working and suffering there, and his local experiences are integrated into the report.
This legislation should be strict and well integrated into other Community policies.
I have tabled three amendments which were supported by the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I hope they will also be supported by this plenary session.
My aims were to clarify the requirements of the directive by giving references to the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive, to prevent the discharge of environmentally harmful mining waste into any body of water and, last but not least, to promote waste prevention as the primary means of waste management.
I hope this legislation will give us a 100% guarantee against any kinds of mines producing cyanide or other pollutants, either in Member States or in applicant countries.
Â Â  The directive is aimed above all at mines that will begin to close in the future or at those abandoned mines that have been closed down without the proper and appropriate procedures.
I would like to draw your attention to a specific problem that is highly important for a number of countries.
This is the issue of mines that have already been closed down and have therefore stopped taking mining waste, while rehabilitation work is being carried out in line with valid European permits.
Because of the length of time needed to close mines down, this rehabilitation will still be in progress when this directive enters into force.
In order to avoid the duplication of procedures and an increase in the costs of rehabilitation as a result of the possible requirement for new permits, it would be sensible to make special provisions regarding these cases for a transitionary period under conditions of transparency.
This was done in the third paragraph of Article 24 of the joint position of the Council.
The aim of the directive, that from the moment of its entry into force no further damage should occur in the process of closing down mines, would not be in jeopardy if in mines where the rehabilitation process is almost complete, that process could be completed without hindrance.
I support this part of the joint position.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, it is true that the aim of the directive on the management of waste from extractive industries is to prevent and minimise any harmful impact of waste on the environment or public health.
The aspects of the directive relating to environmental protection require further work, however.
In places the directive is also irrational, and it will create more red tape.
Historically, the extractive industry in Poland has been a mainstay of the national economy, and this continues to be the case today.
It was for this reason that, during pre-accession negotiations, Poland pressed for the relaxation of certain provisions making it mandatory for operators of waste treatment facilities to provide financial guarantees.
Even highly hazardous industrial sectors do not comply with such requirements.
After the draft directive had been submitted to Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted amendments that ran counter to earlier decisions made regarding the draft.
These amendments are extremely disadvantageous to the Polish extractive industry, since the additional burdens they entail will result in it becoming uncompetitive, as well as posing a risk of bankruptcy for the brown coal industry.
This would present a threat to energy security in Poland.
The draft directive transfers too broad a range of responsibilities to industrial entities.
Furthermore, it places hazardous waste on the same footing as inert waste.
The end result of all this will be a sharp increase in operating cost, and the need to allocate huge sums of money from state budgets to cover the costs of drawing up inventories of facilities and adaptations to the latter.
It is for this reason that some indication of funding sources is urgently needed.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the proper management of waste from the extractive industries has a significant impact on the environment.
This is especially true in areas of high mining activity, where it is not uncommon for various raw materials to have been mined for several hundred years.
In many cases the raw materials in question were exploited wastefully, with both deposits and the environment being destroyed, and little regard being paid to the management of waste.
The draft directive under debate, and above all the numerous amendments that have been tabled, fail to do justice to the current state of affairs.
They deal with the issue in an arbitrary fashion, and take no account of the situation in regions where deposits are mined most intensively.
The proposed inventories of existing waste and waste generated during routine operations will only serve to identify waste management requirements and the related technical possibilities.
In view of the limits placed on the EU budget, it is unrealistic to expect large amounts of EU funding to be earmarked for implementation of the directive.
By and large, it will be regional and national budgets that bear the burden of implementing the directive by rectifying the shortcomings that have already been identified.
The current owners of facilities will also incur greater costs through no fault of their own, and more money will need to be spent on guarantees and suchlike. This will mean bankruptcy for facilities that are suffering financial problems, and their waste will then be left unmanaged.
I propose that certain amendments should not be incorporated into the draft directive.
These include amendments that point out the obvious, those that set unrealistic deadlines, those that give rise to unjustified increases in costs, of which there are several, and those that limit the opportunities available to Member States to adapt the given requirements to regional and national needs.
Â Â  Mr President, this draft directive, a sensible and necessary one, was welcomed as such by the business community as a whole.
We should establish proportionate and loophole-free rules to apply fairly and uniformly across the whole of European business and industry.
We also have an acceptable compromise report before us.
Our aim has been to prevent accidents and the consequent damage to the environment and human health that can result from the handling and disposal of waste materials from the mineral oil-extracting industries, and we have sought to do this by laying down minimum standards to improve the management of this sort of waste.
Waste from the extractive industries amounts to some 400 million tonnes per annum, equivalent to 29% of the waste produced by the Community as a whole.
Managing it does of course involve risks; we are all familiar with the accidents in such places as Baia Mare and Aberfan, among others.
The fact is that ecologically-responsible rules for waste management not only reduce the quantity of waste, but also give businesses an incentive to invest in research into environmental issues associated with the extractive industries and thereby acquire from the world market know-how that they can analyse.
There are many examples of this: let me give you one from Austria, where one firm has managed to avoid depositing some 100Â 000 tonnes of minerals used in construction in landfill sites.
Despite that, there are weak points, one example being the lack of clarity as to the directiveâs scope.
I find it regrettable that a majority could not be found to support the amendment I tabled on this subject.
I would also like to point out the need for provisions to be enacted to deal with non-hazardous or inert waste, and that these must be proportionate.
I therefore believe that Amendments 11, 13 and 47 should be rejected and that we should come up with alternative proposals for provisions relating to non-hazardous and inert waste, with separate consideration for these concepts.
The use of landfill sites for non-hazardous or inert waste should also be allowed for a limited period of time.
Â Â  Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening.
I am extremely concerned about this issue, because once again Europe is trying to bring in and implement a draft regulation that tries to make one suit fit all.
I do not think this can work and that is where I have a problem.
We should not be so dictatorial with our directives.
As someone has already pointed out in this debate, not all quarries that are extractive industries are the same.
I have no doubt that some of the very large industries will be able to cope with this and take it in their stride, but the small entrepreneurs trying to develop small industries and get them off the ground are probably going to be hit very hard.
I have no objection when we are talking about hazardous waste, because that always has to be controlled.
But it will be the smaller businesses where jobs will be lost; they are the ones that will go to the wall.
Nor do I believe we should bring in directives that are not implemented in the same way in each Member State.
I have personal experience of this.
I come from Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and across the border, in the Republic of Ireland, the waste oil directive is interpreted differently.
In quarries six miles apart, one in Dundalk and the other in Newry, a European directive is being implemented differently in two Member States.
Waste oil is considered hazardous in the United Kingdom, whereas in the Republic of Ireland it is not.
This is forcing quarry owners to move from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland in order to compete, because otherwise they cannot.
I do not believe that we should be producing European directives that can be interpreted in different ways.
I believe that will happen with this one as well, and quarry owners are not happy about that.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their very constructive observations and to give a number of answers relating to waste from processing bauxite, which was referred to earlier, in order to make alumina: this waste is covered by the directive, which will ensure that repercussions, especially on water, are minimised.
As regards Mr Nicholson's last remark, which differs from what previous speakers said, about old abandoned waste facilities, the Commission and the Council agree in the common position that an inventory should be prepared.
Nonetheless, it is better for restoration to be left to the Member States, given that the framework directive on water continues to apply in parallel.
In addition, as far as the facility to grant exemptions for non-inert waste is concerned, this does not concern the main environmental demands, which continue to apply.
We need the new directive, which will safeguard environmentally proper management of mining waste both during the day-to-day operation of waste facilities and in the event of a major accident.
I trust that we shall complete the procedure for this proposal as quickly as possible, so that we can safeguard better protection of human health and the environment, as Mr Davies also said, in a way which really will be pragmatic and will respond to the demands of the various interested parties.
Now to the amendments: the amendments relating to the scope of the directive are particularly important.
Amendments 2 and 13 delete the permissible exemptions for non-hazardous, non-inert waste.
The Commission is unable to accept them for the reasons I explained in my first intervention.
For the same reasons, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment 11 increasing the breadth of the provisions which apply to inert waste, or Amendment 15 deleting the various permissible time periods before a waste storage area qualifies as a 'waste facility'.
The common position has already been worded to reflect the relevant amendments which emerged at first reading and safeguards the necessary proportionality.
As a result, Amendment 47 amending the criteria for classifying facilities under category Î cannot be supported.
As regards the financial guarantees, Amendment 37 requiring the Commission to approve the relevant national procedures is unacceptable, because it adds bureaucratic formalities without any added value.
Amendments 7, 38 and 39 are also unacceptable, because the initial text contains a practical method for calculating the amount of money required.
A number of amendments refer specifically to the protection of water.
The Commission considers that this issue is already adequately covered by the relevant provisions of the directive supplementing the general provisions of the framework directive on water and by other Community legislation on water which already applies.
Nonetheless, I am able to support Amendments 29, 30, 32 and 33 clarifying the obligations which apply and referring directly to Community legislation on water.
On the other hand, we are unable to agree with Amendment 36 bringing ordinary voids under Community regulations in order to prevent water pollution.
I understand Parliament's concern, but I believe that this issue is adequately covered by the framework directive on water.
Similarly, Amendment 42 introduces obligations which will need to be applied during the transitional period granted to existing waste facilities, especially the obligation to comply with the framework directive on water.
I believe, for the reasons I explained earlier, that this is unnecessary.
Another source of concern to Parliament was the important legacy from the past in the form of closed and abandoned waste facilities causing pollution.
Even though the need for an inventory of these closed sites has now been included in the common position, I have the impression â as I said earlier â that the additional demands imposed by Amendment 40 and the related Amendment 41 can be covered more effectively at national level.
A number of the remaining amendments proposed by Parliament are acceptable: Amendment 10 may help to promote the integration of the environment into other policies.
Amendments 17, 18 and 21 explain the content of waste management plans in greater detail.
Amendment 27 expressly refers to protected areas.
The Commission supports these amendments, which pursue the same objectives as its proposal.
To close, I am happy to announce that the Commission can accept eight amendments in full and a further six amendments in principle or in part.
I shall file a complete list of the Commission's positions on the amendments with the Secretariat(1).
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at 12 noon.
The Commission can accept the following amendments in full: 14, 17, 18, 21, 29, 30, 32 and 33.
The following amendments are acceptable in part or in principle: 4, 10, 12, 23, 27 and 39.
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 31, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 or 50.
Â Â  .
I welcome the clear response of the Commissioner on behalf of the Commission.
I am particularly pleased that the European Commission sees Declaration 11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam as an incentive to dialogue with churches and non-confessional organisations and is not restricted merely to a narrow legal view of the declaration. I believe, of course, that in this House there is no need to explain that dialogue is something different from the process of joint decision-making.
I am also pleased with Article 52 of the as yet unratified European Constitution, which explicitly talks about a dialogue that the Union would maintain openly, transparently and as a matter of course.
In the work of the Convention I have also called for an open, inclusive and public dialogue in the belief that such a dialogue is both necessary and important because it also entails a closer relationship with citizens with religious or other convictions as they reflect on a common European future.




In any event I would like this dialogue to contribute to a responsible and unfettered development of new ties and new proposals relating to our future, and to be far removed from the seductive ideological intolerance that we have witnessed on numerous occasions in European history and from which even today we are clearly not entirely immune.

In the spirit of the declaration and the as yet unratified Constitutional Treaty I expect the Commission to proceed according to transparent rules of the game and transparent procedures, and that it will continue to take a broad approach in the understanding of inclusiveness for participants in the dialogue.
I am aware that the fact that there are so many old and new religious and non-confessional organisations makes it difficult for the Commission to make a choice, and such a choice may be impossible without some consideration given to the number of followers of each organisation.
It also seems to me reasonable that, in view of the theme of the discussion, the Commission should be flexible in its choice of participants in the dialogue.
I would like to add that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have long been aware of the importance of a dialogue of this nature and have therefore organised such dialogues for a number of years. We also believe that with new challenges at a European and global level this dialogue is becoming even more important.
I am thinking in particular of a dialogue with Islam, which is particularly alert to the religious dimension of those with whom it is in dialogue.
Â Â  . Madam President, three matters of principle are being overlooked in this debate. First of all, churches are public-law establishments and are not the same as private associations.
That is why church services are public and accessible to everyone.
The relationship between state and church has played a major role in the history of western constitutional law. What is all-important is that good public administration is inseparable from sound public morals.
Procedures alone are not enough.
Anyone who rejects this basic notion strikes at the roots of our democratic societies.
Secondly, when inviting bodies to participate in this dialogue, the Commission would do well to draw a distinction between religion and ideology. Religion is transcendent in nature, while ideology is immanent.
It is a God-less religion, a quasi-religion that is motivated and dominated by human desires.
Ideology does not allow people any freedom and leads to all kinds of slavery.
I would warn the Commission and the Liberal and Socialist Members of this House against lumping these two very different notions together, as history shows that this results in social disaster.
Finally, the law that applies in this case is the Amsterdam Treaty, declaration No 11, which the Commissioner quoted just a moment ago.
It may have slipped your minds, but since the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the Constitutional Treaty really is old hat.
Â Â  . I support what has just been said.
For the Commission, it is not a question of playing hide-and-seek in this matter.
Any dialogue, which by definition is an exchange, must be made public for those who wish it to be.
That altogether adheres to the spirit of our European institutions.

Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.

Â Â  The next item is a statement by the Commission on air safety.
Â Â  Madam President, it would be true to say that August 2005 was a black month for civil aviation, and it is a good thing that we are again giving our attention to air safety. The Member who has not been following the debate has to be told that â as the Commissioner said â Europe is not reinventing the wheel.
It has to be said that the Commission presented us with the regulation under discussion even before the accidents. It is evident, though, that it is only the one speech that interests him; the matter in hand is of secondary importance.
We have to work towards guaranteeing the citizens of the EU, and the air passengers among them in particular, safety in every conceivable respect.
To put it the other way round, that means that there is no room in European airspace for airlines that do not take safety seriously. That is why it is important that we should, while addressing this regulation on airlines with the utmost seriousness, pass it into law as quickly as possible.
The rapporteur has explained it.
The proposals are excellent, and, if we combine our efforts, we really can get it over and done with very quickly â at first reading, indeed. We have established the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is meant to guarantee a high standard of safety, but must also be given authority over aircraft from third countries.
We will of course need a list of the black sheep, a blacklist â and not 25 lists, but one single list with standard criteria.
I already have one for it. Last week, a pilot with the company FlyAir took a defective aircraft back to Paris-Orly airport, but, instead of giving him credit for this, the airline gave him the sack.
That means that we already have one candidate for the blacklist, and I hope that the Commission will do something about this.
To the Commissioner, I would say that he and his fellow-Commissioners should, in their deliberations, also consider the idea that, not least from the point of view of safety, the bargain airlines might perhaps be tackled a little harder than they have been in the past. Apart from that, we are side by side on what is very much the right road.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the decision was taken to lift restrictions on air transport, very many of us predicted what, unfortunately, is happening today: the decline in safety and the appearance of high-risk carriers, a kind of equivalent to the system of flags of convenience in the maritime transport sector.
In any case, rules need to be laid down urgently, and, unfortunately, it is not the first time that our Parliament has insisted on this.
Yet, the Member States have often turned a deaf ear.
I would insist on four requirements.
The first: rules banning high-risk aircraft and carriers, and even the introduction of prior authorisations to be able to take off from, and land on, EU territory. The second requirement: the strengthening of checks in terms of number and quality.
The third: the obligation to provide users with information and transparency. Finally, the fourth requirement, which I hope can be included by the Commission, is to improve the level of protection offered to employees who oppose the hazardous operations of their carrier and who should also have the right to withhold their labour.
It has taken a large number of tragedies for the Member States to publish black lists. I believe that everyone here is in agreement in saying that the black lists must be European, and that each time a Member State decides to ban an air carrier, the other Member States must be able to automatically enforce the same ban.
I believe that we must go further, however, by calling for a genuine principle of authorisation enabling the European Union, with the European Aviation Safety Agency in particular, to establish whether or not the carrier and the aircraft used comply with our safety rules.
I emphasise this point because a large number of circumventions can occur through a change in name and statutes, even when black lists are drawn up.
As for the rest, I would emphasise the need to mobilise the Member States, as it has often been Parliament and the Commission that, together, have tried to improve the situation. May the unacceptable and dreadful tragedies that we have witnessed serve as a lesson to those in power in our various countries.
Â Â  â Madam President, we still do not know the exact cause of the recent tragic aeroplane crashes in recent months. However, they do not appear to have been caused by the sort of terrorist action or attack which we have been focusing all our attention on preventing here over recent months.
On the contrary, it would appear that they were caused by a fatal combination of human error and mechanical fault.
I therefore call on the European Commission to immediately extend its independent investigation to an examination of all airlines in Europe, to include two additional aspects:

First, the very serious matter of the intensification of the working hours of both flying and ground airline staff over recent years, which certainly affects flight safety.




Secondly, the ratio between flying time and maintenance time for aircraft which has come about in each airline over recent years again, I suspect, at the expense of safety.
Commissioner, people are more important than profits.
If, unfortunately, Europe has a tendency to forget this in numerous sectors in Europe for the sake of unbridled competition, it is time it was reminded of it, at least where human lives are at stake. We must not wait for tragedies to happen in order to act; we must act before they happen.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0212/2005) by Mrs Etelka Barsi-Pataky on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the European programme of satellite radionavigation (COM(2004)0477 â C6-0087/0156(COD)).
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Galileo Programme is both very ambitious and extremely challenging in scientific and technical terms, which is why it is so costly. As well as attracting a great deal of interest, the programme has therefore also provoked a variety of opinions and reactions.
On the one hand, there are those who believe that the project makes Europe more competitive compared to the rest of the world, including the United States.
In most other respects we are lagging behind the latter, for example in scientific and technological fields, but Galileo is superior to its American counterpart, or in other words GPS, which was originally conceived as a military system.
What is more, at a time such as this, when the European Union is competing for public support against a background of debates on the fate of the Constitutional Treaty, this is an opportunity for us to develop a project that will enable the creation of thousands of new and much-needed jobs, to say nothing of its other benefits.
On the other hand, however, I entirely understand the concerns that have been voiced over the enormous financial costs of the Galileo Programme, and the risk that this money could be wasted.
It is not only members of my own group that have raised such concerns, and they are entirely legitimate, given that worrying examples of money being wasted in this way can be found in the day-to-day practices of the different Member States.
It stands to reason that the European Parliament must ensure that it has opportunities and instruments for monitoring, and that it must ensure that money is spent transparently and effectively.
Questions have also been asked over whether it is appropriate to exclude the Galileo Programme from funding cuts, in view of the debates being held on across-the-board cuts to the EU budget.
The Galileo Programme is currently moving out of the development and testing phase, which has been a success, and into the implementation phase.
Heeding calls for savings, and imposing arbitrary cuts in order to make savings at any price, would be akin to expecting a rocket carrier that originally consisted of three stages to carry an object into space, even if you remove one of its stages. The end result will be that we are left with nothing.
One final comment;Â I am delighted that the bodies responsible for such matters in the Czech Republic share my views on the future of the Galileo project, namely that it should be seen in terms of a wide variety of possible civilian applications.
I am also delighted that they are not only in favour of the system being built, but are also taking the relevant practical steps to implement it.
Â Â  Â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0249/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation) (19th individual Directive within the meaning of ArticleÂ 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (05571/6/2005 â C6-0129/2005 â 1992/0449(COD)) (Rapporteur: MrÂ Åry).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly, on behalf of the Commission, to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Åry, on his excellent report and his commitment to carrying this difficult matter through to a successful conclusion, the subject being the optical radiation section of the proposal for a directive relating to the protection of workers against the risks arising from physical agents.
The Commission continues to attach the greatest importance to all measures aimed at ensuring better protection of workersâ health and safety, for these are factors essential to the quality of life in the work place.
The latest scientific data indicates that excessive exposure to optical radiation, whether the sources be natural or artificial, may have serious consequences for health, particularly for the health of workers exposed to it in the course of their professional activities.
Given that the harm caused by exposure to optical radiation does not depend upon whether the source of that radiation is artificial or natural, the proposal includes all cases of professional exposure to optical radiation.
Nonetheless, the Commission has accepted the approach adopted in the Council common position, which consists of introducing differential treatment to reduce the risks arising from exposure to natural sources such as the sun or to artificial sources such as lasers or ultraviolet lamps.
Regarding exposure to artificial sources, the proposal lays down exposure limit values and provides for a series of preventative measures, including risk assessment carried out in advance with a view to removing the risks or reducing them to a minimum.
To avoid placing pointless burdens upon companies, the proposal also points out that the assessment may take account of data provided by the manufacturers of equipment that produces optical radiation when such equipment is covered by a relevant Community directive.
Regarding exposure to natural sources whose presence and intensity are beyond manâs control, it has not been deemed appropriate to apply exposure limit values.
In this case, the directive nonetheless emphasises the importance of informing and training workers, as well as of carrying out a prior assessment of the risks, taking account of simple protective measures adapted to the situation on the ground.
MrÂ President, I shall shortly have the opportunity to state the Commissionâs position on the amendments, but I need to let the debate take place.
I would also point out that I am dealing with this matter in the absence of MrÂ Å pidla, who has gone to the EU-China Summit.
I am well placed to deputise for my colleague, all the more so because the subject is that of working conditions, on which I myself have had plenty of opportunities to work.
I would thank Parliament in anticipation of its letting us have all the information and observations available to it.
Â Â  Creating a legal environment that ensures theprotection of the health and safety of European employees has been an unequivocal obligation of the European legislative process for decades.
This obligation is set out, , in Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome.
A âframework directiveâ of the European Economic Community, adopted in 1989, constitutes the basis of the legal environment.
The provisions of this directive stipulate that, in order to ensure workersâ health and safety, employers have a general obligation to evaluate all possible risks that could have an adverse effect on workersâ health while carrying out their occupational activities.
The framework directive, then, sets out this general obligation to ensure that workers can be protected from all adverse effects.
Specific types of risks are not listed in this prescriptive text, because the range of risks constantly changes and expands depending on changes in the occupational environment.
The employer, however, must be attentive to all risks, regardless of this.
As far back as 1989, the legislators already intended drafting appropriate legal provisions, tailor-made to fit the different risks, and this was the reason why a specific piece of legislation was drawn up concerning physical risks.
Following its first reading in 1992, Parliament decided to divide it into four parts, thus giving rise to the different risk-related directives on noise, vibrations and electromagnetic fields.
The last component, on optical radiation, is now on the agenda for its second reading.
On issues relating to radiation from artificial sources, a fairly broad consensus was achieved in the course of Parliamentâs work and the conciliation process that took place with representatives of the Commission and the Council.
On the other hand, the question of solar radiation, in other words radiation from natural sources, proved controversial, so I would like to say a few words about it.
It is a fundamental principle that the employer is responsible for any harm arising to an employee from occupational activities.
This is incontrovertible, and the earlier legislative provisions still in force today clearly stipulate this.
Obviously, a distinction must be drawn between different countries, different circumstances and even in terms of radiation, and therefore a great deal of detailed and complicated consultation was necessary before we were able to arrive at a compromise with the majority of our fellow Members.
The essence of this compromise is that, on account of the extremely varied circumstances prevailing in relation to solar radiation, it would make sense for detailed provisions and specific measures to be elaborated at the level of the Member States.
In the spirit of subsidiarity, this compromise proposes that, in the case of radiation from natural sources, the task of setting out appropriate provisions should be the competence of the individual countries.
It is obvious that the situation is very different in Sweden and in Greece, in Spain and in Germany.
The traditions are different; the culture is different.
It therefore makes sense to give individual countries the opportunity to define the obligations that employers will be expected to meet.
At the same time, however, I also consider it an important achievement that broad agreement was reached on numerous issues relating to the report; for example, the Council indicated that it was willing to accept the proposal supported by all political groups in Parliament: to draw up a practical technical guide, which we are now awaiting from the Commission.
This would help businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to understand, apply and simply to manage the often quite complex actions they must undertake, especially as regards radiation from artificial sources.
It would be a great result if this guide were also part of the directive.
I ask my colleagues and Parliament to support the version of the directive, and those proposed amendments to it, that create a balance between European-level provisions laying down minimum obligations and the practical possibilities and responsibilities of the Member States.
I therefore ask you to support these compromises.
Lastly, I would like to thank the âshadow rapporteursâ of all the political groups, my colleagues and the representatives of the Council and the Commission.
We have worked very hard in recent weeks, and I think we have worked well together.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to Mr Csaba Åry, for he had to work on this very tricky issue under extreme pressure, not only from fellow Members but also from the media. I have less appreciation for the Council and Commission representatives.
I regret that you, Mr Barrot, are unable at the start of the debate to indicate the Commissionâs position on this issue and that you are unable to say whether the Commission is prepared to defend the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Moreover, I do not appreciate the fact that the Council representatives have so far not been in contact, particularly because the politicians in the Member States say that we should actually take a different course in Europe, while the Commissionâs bureaucrats who pore over this topic say that we must remain faithful to what we have.
That goes against the grain with me.
What we have done is to take a decision about a first reading that dates back to 1992 â that is 13 years ago â and we have not reached second reading until now!
A great deal has been written about this topic.
As far as artificial radiation is concerned, we have to be strict when it comes to working conditions; after all, workersâ health is at stake.
As for solar, or natural, radiation, we would like to take a different approach, which can be done by means of the subsidiarity clauses that we have at our disposal.
The sun shines for varying lengths of time and with varying intensity from one location to another.
We therefore consider minimum unit requirements in Europe to be taking matters too far.
I am therefore delighted that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairsâ response to our amendments has been very positive.
I believe that the report that is now before us will receive broad support in this House.
How do we intend to tackle natural radiation?
We admit that there is a danger, but Member States, along with employers in conjunction with the Member States, should decide for themselves whether, and when, measures should be taken.
This principle has been incorporated in the approved report and I would make an urgent appeal to all groups, including the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to give this report their backing.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank Mr Åry for his excellent work as rapporteur.
He worked very closely with all the shadow rapporteurs, improved an already pretty good common position and produced a good draft report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
It is only a pity that that good work was put in jeopardy by the stance taken by his own group, the PPE-DE, and a faction in the Liberal Group on one aspect of the proposal: the provisions relating to the occupational risks arising from exposure to natural radiation.
Sadly, we have come to expect totally misleading and sensational press releases from the right, misrepresenting important pieces of health and safety legislation.
When we worked on the issue of industrial noise, we were accused of trying to ban bagpipe playing in Scotland.
Our work on the risks of whole body vibration was evidently to stop farmers from driving tractors after only three or four hours, even at the height of the harvest.
Now our work on this proposal is presented as an attempt to force citizens to carry umbrellas.
This is absolute nonsense.
The Commissioner himself said that the original proposal envisaged a far lighter-touch approach to natural radiation than artificial sources.
However, this time I sense something more than an attempt to grab cheap tabloid headlines, something more ideologically driven.
I believe that those sitting behind Mr Åry and trying to undermine his work think that, with the stalling of much of Europe's social agenda, they have a chance to push for deregulation and the renationalisation of important elements of the social legal base.
If that is so, then let me tell them that they should think again.
We will do all we can to stop them in their tracks and continue to improve, and not undermine, worker protection.
In reality, our amendments on natural radiation have nothing to do with the ridiculous stories fed to the media.
