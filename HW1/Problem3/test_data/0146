A risk of breach of fundamental rights is very difficult to define.
I advocate a broad definition, to include, for example, a Member Stateâs failure to deal with human rights violations (racism, anti-Semitism), the discriminatory impoverishment of population groups, serious restrictions on the freedom of the press.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of MrÂ Voggenhuberâs report (A5-227/2004) on fundamental rights in the EU.
We support the basic idea behind this report, but reject, however, the wording of paragraph 11(a), stating that âUnion intervention pursuant to Article 7 of the EU Treaty must therefore be confined to instances of clear risks and persistent breaches and may not be invoked in support of any right to, or policy of, permanent monitoring of the Member States by the Unionâ.
We believe that the EU must be able to monitor a Member State for a period in the event of fundamental rights in the EU being violated.
If, for example, a country grossly violates human rights, it is necessary to be able to monitor that it is remedying the situation in question.
Â Â  . MrÂ Voggenhuber has been arguing on behalf of the Group of the Greens for an EU Constitution for years.
Meanwhile, such a constitution is in preparation, in which free competition pure and simple, more and more arms and the undemocratic authority of the Council are permanently established.
This constitution, and also Article 7 of the present Treaty on European Union, allow measures against Member States that cease to be democracies and seriously and persistently breach the rule of law of the constitutional state.
That is important for the undemocratic Spain under the recently defeated Aznar Government and the potential future Member States of Romania and Turkey.
Neither these provisions nor the Commissionâs communication on them make clear whether they also cover a serious failure to act against violations of human rights.
I appreciate the fact that, in his resolution, Mr Voggenhuber wishes to give it an interpretation based on openness, equality, plurality of opinions and confidence that the Union is not going to engage in permanent monitoring of the Member States.
I also agree with him that Parliament must play an important role in the event of suspensions and this must not be left to the power politics of the Council.
What disturbs me, however, is the idealistic sauce being poured over his resolution.
The real values of the EU, alas, are the market, currency, free competition and armaments, rather than democracy, human rights, the environment, peace and solidarity.
Â Â  . I voted against this report because it takes a maximalist and centralist, almost persecutory approach towards respect for and promotion of the values on which the Union is based and â neglecting its role, which is to complement the States which it comprises â it has opted to ignore the nature and reality of national democracies, casting an unfortunate pall of suspicion over them.
At a time when the European Union is preparing for the largest wave of enlargement in its history and particularly in light of the degrading spectacle that the annual debate on the report on human rights in the EU has become, it would be worrying, to say the least, if the European Parliament were to grant itself the task of âpolicingâ Member Statesâ adherence to democracy and values, whilst ignoring the role of States and Nations in a multifaceted definition of what it is to âbe Europeâ and putting forward a disciplinarian and perverse vision of this reality.
I agree with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market when it recommends that the potential Interinstitutional Agreement on Article 7 of the EU Treaty should only be addressed, if at all, after the accession of the new Member States.
The proposal to extend the âvaluesâ on which the Union is based, incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into this field, and ambiguously and disproportionately to extend the list of phenomena to be considered serious risks are, in my view, both mistaken.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
â Before turning to this afternoonâs work, I owe you a brief explanation for being late.
As you know, voting took more than two hours this morning: real political efficiency is required at the end of a legislative period to conclude the work of Parliamentâs committees.There is something else, however: I was involved in a very important ceremony outside our Parliament early this afternoon to mark the deaths in Rwanda ten years ago, with the speaker of the Rwandan parliament and a delegation of parliamentarians who had come from Rwanda to be with us here in Strasbourg today.
I therefore apologise for being late.
It was, however, a shocking fact that must be acknowledged and even commemorated, as we did today, since, in addition to our other responsibilities, we for our part have at least a duty to remember.
Â Â  â The main reason why I am in the Chair at the start of this afternoon is to mark the visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic.
Welcome to the European Parliament, Minister.
Mr Barnier worked with us here for a long time, in particular as commissioner with responsibility for the European Unionâs regional policy.
He is highly regarded in this House, but he recently escaped, and he was not able to say goodbye to us any more than we were able to say goodbye to him.
It is therefore my very great pleasure, Minister, fellow European, to be here, yes, better late than never, to welcome you and tell you how much we appreciate the work you have done for Europe.
In your new position as a French minister, you will be continuing down the European road, a large part of which you travelled here.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Cox, for coming here today and for allowing me, with the kind permission of the Council presidency, to occupy the Councilâs benches temporarily for a few minutes and say a few words to you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to have spoken to you a few days ago, but that was not possible because my appointment as Franceâs Minister of Foreign Affairs happened very quickly.
I wanted to say a few words to you and I am very grateful to Mr Cox, the President, for allowing me to do so.
Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, Voltaire liked to say that his motto was: short letters for long friendships.
The brevity of my address will likewise bear no relation to what I hope will be a long and enduring relationship.
My first words have been for you, Mr President, to thank you for allowing me to say them to you; I know that you have made an exception for me.
Now that another task has been entrusted to me in my country, I am pleased to be able to pay tribute to you and take my leave as is customary between partners and between friends, because I cannot forget â and have no wish to â that the battles I had for nearly five years here in Strasbourg and in Brussels in the service of the Commission were battles shared by and with this House.
First, the battle for the Constitution, which, we hope, and we are working to that end, will reach the decisive stage of adoption in June at the latest, thanks to the skill and efforts of the Irish Presidency; it is based on a project in which we can all see the work we have put in, because that project is our own.
When it came to designing it, Commissioner Vitorino and I found ourselves working in the Presidium with Mr HÃ€nsch and Mrs MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
When it was fiercely debated, article by article, comma by comma, and finalised, we were again side by side with many other members of the Convention whom I see again here: Mr Brok, Mr Duff, Mr Duhamel, MrÂ Lamassoure, Mrs Van Lancker, Mr Voggenhuber and others I am thinking of who will not take it amiss if I do not mention them by name, Parliamentâs delegates to the convention and their deputies, who were always active, uncompromising and intelligent.
I have no doubt that when the time comes to defend this text and explain it to the peoples of Europe â I remember the concern that Mr Dell'AlbaÂ had and still has to explain it âÂ we shall all be back together again as a team, whatever our positions, doing so together.
Mr President, all along this exciting and difficult road there was someone who helped me greatly with his guidance and advice, and that was Mr Napolitano, who is here today.
In spite of everything, he believed above all in the possibility of that Convention and of the Constitution.
I would like to thank him for his advice and to pay tribute to his work and his vision, by quoting the French writer AndrÃ© Maurois, who once said that âprogress is made by doing the impossibleâ.
As you know, my other battle was and will continue to be economic, social and now territorial cohesion and its future after 2007.
Cohesion, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the European Unionâs finest policies.
Together with the entire team at the Commissionâs Directorate-General for Regional Policy, who were a tremendous help to me, I wanted to ensure that the regionsÂ â your regions and, first and foremost, those whose need is greatest because they are the poorest or the most remote, such as the outermost regions andÂ others â are really partners and never spectators of European projects and European progress.
Decision time is approaching.
When it adopts its position on the financial perspectives and cohesion policy in a few hoursâ time, this House will be taking an important step towards that final decision in 2005.
This gives me an opportunity, and I have almost finished, to thank some of you more personally â the three chairmen of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with whom I had the good fortune of working: Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Caveri, and today Mr Costa; the successive rapporteurs who helped me unstintingly in shaping the future of this cohesion policy: Mr Musotto, Mrs Schroedter, Mr Mastorakis and Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz; and finally those whose similarly unstinting vigilance and advice enabled me to base that policy on sound joint budget management: Mrs Theato, Mr Wynn, Mrs Pittella and Mr Kuhne.
I do not want to hurt the feelings of others I have worked with; I am thinking of them and include them in my thanks.
Mr President, this is the first time in a long time â I was once a minister â that, with your permission and that of the Irish Presidency, I have spoken to you from the Council benches.
The responsibilities that I have today are, of course, different from those of the Commission.
You may be sure of one thing: neither my ideas, nor my method, nor, in particular, my availability or my friendship with this Parliament and those who sit here will be affected or changed now that I am Minister of European and Foreign Affairs of the French Republic.
We met because of a particular idea of Europe and I am quite sure that in the near future we will meet again for the same reason.
There are so many things on which we need to work together.
Ladies and gentlemen, for the great democratic and civic moment of exchange and dialogue that awaits you and this House in a few weeksâ time, I sincerely wish each and every one of you good luck, whatever your opinions and convictions.
Mr President, because I know this was not customary, I want to thank you for allowing me to say these few words, because it was something I very much wanted to do.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I take the floor for just one minute to thank the Commissioner, MrÂ Barnier, not just for the comments that he addressed to me, which moved me deeply, but also for the cooperation that he has been able to establish with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and with Parliament as a whole over these years.
Thanks to him, the dialogue, the cooperation, the shared commitment and the alliance â as has sometimes been said â between the Commission and Parliament in the field of institutional affairs, have not remained pure rhetoric but have become a working reality.
We are sure that our friend the minister MichelÂ Barnier will be able to worthily occupy the position that Robert Schuman once held, of interpreting the Europeanist traditions of France, that great founding Member of the European Community.
Â Â  â Thank you everyone, especially you, Minister.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0268/2004) by Terence Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on 'Building our common future â policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013'.
Â Â  . Mr President, when I first came in and looked around I thought people were actually here for this debate, but then I suddenly realised that former Commissioner Barnier was about to make his speech!
Members have in front of them a report not just from the Committee on Budgets, but one that has attempted to take on board the opinions of the other committees.
In doing so, we have tried to include at least three or four priorities which they consider to be paramount priorities, and then ask the Commission and the Council, in paragraph 31, to at least look at all the Annexes to get a feel for what the other committees are trying to do.
I say that because I have had a letter from one of my fellow chairmen actually complaining about this procedure, but we thought it was a fair way of proceeding and one that would give everyone a chance to have their say.
The thrust of the report is not to make concrete proposals, but to lay down guidelines for the next Parliament.
The idea is that we in the present Parliament should not do anything definitive, but should at least give an opinion how we think negotiations should proceed in the next Parliament.
My job as rapporteur for this report, rather than as chairman, is to defend the position of the Committee on Budgets.
As a result, I am not here to recommend acceptance of any of the 22 amendments that we have before us, although I feel Amendments Nos 3 and 5 do help in the wording.
I will leave such decisions to my political group.
I am fascinated by the amendments from my British Conservative colleagues in the name of Mr Bradbourn and others, especially Amendments Nos 17, 18 and 19.
Amendments Nos 17 and 18 ask that there be a maximum of 1% GNI for the Community budget, and Amendment No 19 is about renationalisation of the structural funds.
As a British Labour Member I very much welcome the approach of my Conservative colleagues, who are now endorsing Gordon Brown's proposals.
I am sure this will please him!
I am still confused about Amendments Nos 20 and 21, but will speak to Mr Bradbourn about those later.
However, whilst I may welcome them as a British Labour Member, I am here not as a British Labour Member but as a rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, and cannot support them.
As I said, Amendments Nos 17 and 18 asked for a maximum 1% GNI for own resources.
My preference is for the existing paragraph 17, which states that we should evaluate our political priorities, then their needs, and only then should Parliament decide on what the level of own resources should be.
When President Prodi first presented the Commission's proposals I made the point that between 1988 and 2002, under the existing financial perspective, the amount of payments had indeed averaged out at 1% of GNP.
Of course, if the average is 1% there will have been times when that 1% was exceeded.
If you look at paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the report, it actually says that we should be looking at the priorities and then deciding what that average overall should be.
It could well be that after making the evaluation and looking at the political priorities we end up with a figure of 1% of GNI.
Paragraph 19 would seem to indicate a higher figure, but looking at this sensibly and pragmatically, we could get any figure and 1% cannot be ruled out.
However, that is a decision not for this Parliament, but for the new one, as is the timeframe. The reason for this is to ensure the involvement of the new members from the ten new Member States, along with the ten new Commissioners.
As I said earlier, this report does not aim to take decisions, but to enable the new Parliament to do so while also, along with the new Commission and the Council, to at least take note of what we are saying.
To repeat one other point I made in the first debate on this issue, I would remind the Council that the Interinstitutional Agreement is only an interinstitutional agreement when the institutions keep to it between themselves.
In other words, Parliament is a key player in this.
It is not a bit-part player in the process.
It is a major player and I hope the other institutions recognise that.
This is probably the last time I will address this Parliament as chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
I would like to say what a great privilege and what a great job it has been.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank MrÂ Wynn and his committee for their work.
I welcome the opportunity today to participate in this debate on the future financial perspective, and I note the points made by Mr Wynn.
The report and the work undertaken by Parliament constitute an important contribution to the process of working towards the agreement on future financing for the period from 2006 onwards.
The nature of the agreement on the next funding round will have a critical impact on how the Union equips itself to tackle forthcoming challenges, including those most relevant to the quality of life and economic prospects of our citizens.
Each of the Union's institutions has a responsibility to ensure that we achieve a balanced and fair outcome that supports our policy goals in a financially efficient and financially effective manner.
As we are aware, there are no easy answers to the challenge that the negotiations on future financing will have to address.
We must address the need to boost growth throughout the Union so as to capitalise on the economic recovery that is now evident.
We need to target resources effectively so that we build a growth-enhancing infrastructure throughout the Union that contributes to the improvement of transport links, with investment in communications and new technologies.
Similarly, the provision of support for human capital â in particular in terms of education and training â has the potential to complement our investment in infrastructure.
Upgrading the skills of Europe's workforce will contribute significantly to improved productivity.
Equally, support for innovation will provide added value in the demanding global marketplace, thus enhancing the competitiveness of the Union and its output.
The policy of solidarity is critical to the success of our Union.
The European Union must consider how best to support those regions of the new Member States that will lag behind the Union's average in terms of development and access to growth opportunities, including access to employment opportunities.
Equally, certain regions of existing Member States are still engaged in the convergence process, and the Union will need to consider what continued assistance is appropriate to support our shared objective of enabling all regions to converge on the EU average level of prosperity.
Similarly, our debate on future financing will have to address the differing needs of urban and rural populations and regions and consider how best to create a balanced outcome that will promote greater prosperity for a wider range of Europe's citizens.
Our debate on future financing must also consider how we can enhance the priority which we attach to promoting the principle of sustainability in respect of future growth and development.
Equally, we all recognise the importance of providing appropriate resources for increased Union actions in the areas of freedom, security and justice and in support of the Union's external relations role.
In short, the challenges facing us as we look at the future financial perspective are very significant indeed.
As Parliament is aware, we are still at the very early phase of our deliberations on the future financial perspective.
The Irish presidency's approach is to build a solid foundation for the detailed work that will need to be undertaken under succeeding presidencies to achieve agreement on the level and on the focus of future financing.
Its related objective is to provide Member States with the opportunity to consider the Commission communication as a whole and to outline their initial response.
This process is intended to enable us to identify areas of agreement and also areas of potential divergence.
Parliament will have seen the European Council conclusions welcoming the work of the Commission on this issue and endorsing the presidency's approach to handling it.
In line with these conclusions and analytical exercises currently under way in the Council to examine each of the areas addressed in the Commission communication, this work will form the basis for the report which will be prepared for the June European Council, outlining the outcome of the deliberations thus far.
The Wynn report is therefore an important contribution to work on an issue in which each of the Union's institutions will be involved.
I welcome the constructive manner in which the European Parliament, as usual, has approached the issue of future financing.
While there may be differing viewpoints on specific aspects of the issue, I am pleased to see that there are many areas of shared analysis and a common recognition of the importance of focusing on issues such as sustainable development, growth, freedom, security and justice, and the Union's external role.
We have much work to do, as I have already said.
That will determine how the Union acquits itself to meet the challenges ahead.
Obviously, there will be points on which we will differ as the negotiations proceed â that is the very nature of politics and political dialogue.
However, I am confident that our shared commitment to achieving a fair and balanced outcome to negotiations will help us to work towards a final package that will promote effective use of resources in support of greater prosperity for all the Union's citizens in the years ahead.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we politicians who deal with budgetary affairs can look back today on five years of successful cooperation.
The budget for the year 2000, the first for which we were jointly responsible, was also the first budget to be drawn up under the current system of financial planning.
After five years of shared experience of the financial perspective as a planning instrument, we now have a welcome opportunity to discuss this experience in terms of its implications for the next planning period.
Our experience shows that the planning instrument has proved well able to guarantee the orderly development of expenditure and its funding.
In particular, the instrument of the interinstitutional agreement, with its consultation and cooperation mechanisms, has also managed to ensure that the discussion process is efficiently conducted and is concluded in good time.
On the other hand, experience has also shown that a greater degree of flexibility is desirable, that the ceiling for expenditure on foreign policy was simply set too low and that the capping of administrative expenditure is liable to create its own problems.
The beneficial effects of the Financial Perspective derive from its capacity to foster mutual trust between the institutions and to promote compromise.
In this respect I fully endorse what the Chairman, Mr Wynn, has said.
This very point is also an argument in favour of synchronising the duration of the Financial Perspective with the mandate of Parliament and the Commission â in other words, limiting it to five years.
The Commission agrees in principle with the Committee on Budgets here.
The Commission, however, has proposed a further seven-year period as a transitional phase for many reasons, which I do not wish to recapitulate here.
Perhaps there is room for a compromise, such as an arrangement whereby the support programmes for which the Commission is currently drafting the legal basis would not have their budgets fixed at this stage for all seven years.
If we want to ensure that all the legal bases can be adopted in 2006, there is simply not enough time to wait for the new Commission to create them.
It goes without saying, however, that the new Commission will be able to assert its own priorities in the consultation process.
The Financial Perspective establishes the financial framework for the policies that will be pursued over the next few years.
It is a highly significant political project, which is why the consultations must be preceded by an agreement as to which tasks the Union intends to perform collectively in the future.
That, indeed, is the way in which the Irish Presidency has addressed this matter, and I should like to take this opportunity to offer a most emphatic vote of thanks for the manner in which you are dealing with this dossier and with the Commissionâs proposal at the present time.
Our common aims are ambitious: sustainable growth, greater competitiveness through enhanced support for science, research and education, the development of a European Union area of freedom, security and justice for our citizens, the assumption of more joint responsibility in the world and the successful integration of the new Member States.
The new framework will apply to an EU of 27 Member States.
The Commission proposes that all of this be funded within the present ceiling for the Unionâs own resources.
We are not proposing an increase in the ceiling, even though the present limit has remained constant since 1999.
We are even proposing a far greater flexibility margin below this ceiling of 1.24% of gross national income than the one proposed by the previous Commission for the present planning period.
If we compare the figures from the current financial plans with those in the Commissionâs new proposal for the years 2007 to 2013, it emerges that our proposed ceiling for this next planning period works out at an average of 1.14% of gross national income, while the current average is in the order of 1.12% if the EDF and the Solidarity Fund are included.
If the European Development Fund and the Solidarity Fund were removed from the equation â as they are in the figures for the new period â and the values for the present period were recalculated on the basis of 25 Member States, the result would actually be a slight reduction in the percentage of gross national income to be levied in the coming years under the Commissionâs new proposal compared with the present planning period.
How has it been possible for us, in spite of this ambitious agenda, to remain below the said ceiling?
The only reason, of course, is that the Commission has reallocated funds from old to new tasks.
For example, the percentage of the budget devoted to agricultural expenditure will decrease, while the allocation to sustainable growth will increase.
Reallocations are proposed between the old and the new Member States.
If we examine the Commissionâs proposals for the forthcoming planning period for the old Member States alone, we see that they fall well below the ceiling of 1.0% of gross national income requested by some of the Member States.
If, however, we were to set a ceiling of 1.0% for the enlarged Union of 27 Member States, we should have to forego the pursuit of entire policies, and the catalogue of objectives adopted by the Council and ourselves would then become unattainable.
Over the past few years, we have done much to consolidate the budget, far more than has been done in the Member States.
The budgets of recent years, the budgets for which we have been jointly responsible, may be regarded as the lowest in the history of European financial perspectives.
The amounts of expenditure flowing to the current Member States have been reduced in order to create, within the limits of the current ceiling, sufficient financial capacity for the accession of new Member States.
In the realm of budgetary policy, we are well prepared for enlargement.
We have a new up-to-date budgetary system, and we have a new budgetary structure which is far more transparent and far more political.
Thanks to very close cooperation among the institutions in recent years, our record has been good.
And you, MrÂ Wynn, have been a magnificent chairman of the Committee on Budgets and have led the committee very, very successfully.
You were, however, also fortunate in having very good committee members, who have been professional, competent and â an essential attribute in any politician involved in budgetary matters â extremely hardworking.
The same applies to the bureau of the committee.
We have achieved a lot, thanks to excellent cooperation.
It was a very good experience in every way.
I am extremely grateful to you.
Â Â  Mr President, with telegraphic brevity then, first of all congratulations to MrÂ Wynn on his report.
On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I have four points to make.
The first point is that we fear that too restrictive a budget may actually prevent the European Union from playing its part on the international stage.
The second point is that while we supported a transparent, flexible and simplified budget, we also very much want the European Parliament to retain control of it before any decision is taken.
So far as external relations are concerned, we therefore call for a budget breakdown that is both thematic and geographical.
The third point is the fight against poverty.
It seems to us that one of the ways, albeit not the only way, of preventing terrorism in the world today is to eradicate poverty.
That is therefore one of our priorities.
The fourth point is that, with enlargement, we want our relations with the Arab world to be maintained and expanded and the Barcelona process and neighbourhood policy to be relaunched.
That is also our last priority.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control has published, to give you the main points, the following suggestions on the resolutions of the Committee on Budgets.
In the first place we would like the budgets to be more realistic in the future than they have been in the past.
We note that large amounts remain unspent every year.
There is nothing against that as such, but then why did that money have to be in the budget in the first place?
The second point, that is very important to us, concerns the fact that about 80% to 85% of all the money is spent by the Member States.
As a way of exercising extra control over this, would it not be possible for each Member State to issue a declaration each year, stating that the money had been well spent.
If things turned out later to be wrong, then the Commission would be in a stronger legal position to deal with the Member State concerned.
In other words, national declarations of good conduct.
The third point is that we would like, but that is widely known, that a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS) be produced once every so many years.
On the eve of the elections, it is really difficult to explain why, after nine years, the Commission is still unable to extract a positive declaration of expenditure from the European Court of Auditors.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, you said that the medium-term financial plans also determined our policies for the next few years, and indeed they do.
In the realm of agriculture, unless the worst comes to the worst, we shall obtain codecision, and our system of financial planning has a substantial agricultural component.
We in the European Parliament want to be involved; we have no wish to accept the implication in the draft constitution that all power over money matters tends to rest with the Council, and we shall play our active role here.
You also said that expenditure on agriculture would fall, while expenditure on sustainable business activity would rise.
That is all very well, but if you consider the second pillar, to which rural development belongs, there is no real increase once you take account of the fact that there will soon be 25 and then 27 Member States.
This needs to be rectified, particularly since the proposals formulated in the agricultural domain did not provide for capping.
The third point is that we want to be more heavily involved in research.
In the framework programme for research and development, only five of the individual programmes relate to agriculture.
There is therefore a need to focus more sharply on the economic development of agriculture in rural areas.
Allow me to conclude by returning to the discussion that took place on gross national income and to the contributions on that issue.
I see little sense in the letter proposing a limit of one per cent.
The proposal that the Commission has now made is an offer â let me just call it that, although I would personally have preferred a rather more sharply defined line to follow.
We must, of course, succeed in narrowing the wide gulf between authorisations and disbursements by means of better policy â and this is naturally a matter for Parliament too.
One final thought: you have formed a reserve for a Growth Adjustment Fund, but there is no provision for a specific reserve to deal with crises in areas such as foreign policy or the environment.
This, I believe, is something that ought to be rectified.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, we are undoubtedly confronted by formidable tasks as we try to determine the future shape of the EU, and setting the right priorities for this purpose is not easy.
Top priority must attach to the real Community policies.
One of these is unquestionably the common fisheries policy, which continues to need a solid financial basis â a need which is now greater than ever before.
Allow me to enumerate briefly the main points which I identified in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and which were explicitly and emphatically reaffirmed by the future Commissioner from Latvia, Mrs SandraÂ Kalniete, at her hearing.
Firstly, adequate funding of the CFP in the forthcoming financial perspective is imperative.
Secondly, the areas that depend on fishing, most of which are structurally weak regions, are in particular need of the solidarity and support of the Community.
Moreover â and this is my third point â we need more socio-economic measures; fourthly, we need greater diversification and, fifthly, we need the development of new activities.
I am convinced that fisheries in Europe have a future but only if they are adequately funded.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, on behalf of my committee, I wish to thank the Committee on Budgets and MrÂ Wynn for having given very substantial consideration to our committeeâs views on the future financial framework.
It is crucial to cohesion policy that the funding it receives should be 0.45% of GDP, especially as the challenge of enlargement is to be taken into account.
There must also be adequate funds for developing the weaker regions of the current Member States.
I am also grateful that the report is calling for there to be verification of how compatible state aid policy is with regional development.
This was a key message going out from our committee.
Parliamentâs message regarding the simplification of administration and the monitoring of implementation is unequivocal.
To its credit, the draft report also mentions the need for financial support for regions with special problems.
As someone from a sparsely populated region, I warmly support this.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I wish to thank the rapporteur sincerely for having given substantial consideration to the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
I would also like to say thank you to the Commission for emphasising the importance of education, culture and youth in building an expanding Europe.
The Commission deserves full support in this.
The educational exchange programmes are a success story.
An even more vigorous effort will have to be made in the future to ensure that they are also within the reach of those with meagre funds.
The culture industry is a growing sector, which has to be invested in.
To ignore it is to forget cultureâs wider importance for sustained growth and increased mutual understanding.
I am pleased that the report stresses the importance of simplifying the administration of cultural and educational programmes.
On the other hand, I hope that the Committee on Budgets will not then create legislation that complicates the procedure.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Wynn on an excellent report.
As the Development Committee's draftsman, I would like to stress that our Committee's most important condition with regard to the financial perspectives, that of reaching the Millennium Development Goals â the most prominent of which is to halve world poverty by 2015 â has to remain one of the principal objectives of the category for external action.
Money allocated to poverty eradication must be safeguarded from being transferred to meet the Community's other objectives.
Therefore clear distinction has to be made between those areas of external action which have different characteristics: pre-action aid, enhanced cooperation development, cooperation humanitarian aid, relations with ACP countries, peace and security and, finally, reserves.
New aid and development assistance is almost invisible.
The other agencies we use to deliver our money, aid and assistance take the public credit for our taxpayers' endeavours.
This must change: it must stop and stop quickly.
The plan to the budgetise the European Development Fund must not result in a reduction in the overall development finance for ACP countries.
These funds must be focused by means of sub-headings, or ring-fenced in their financial perspectives.
I must reiterate that we must keep poverty eradication at the forefront of our development assistance.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
I seem to remember saying a few weeks ago that I regretted that would be the last time he spoke as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and yet he is still here.
Who knows what will happen in our new Parliament, assuming of course that we are both re-elected?
This debate highlights how the EU institutions seem to rush into debates before fully preparing the ground.
In the brief time available, I would like to reflect on the period in which the financial perspective has been in operation.
A few of us were Members of this House in the 1980s, when we had turbulent budget debates that were not over-affected by the limits imposed, and then had the financial perspectives from 1988.
Since then we have witnessed an enormous rush in European history, from the disintegration of the Soviet Union to German unification, followed by the rush to include countries from central and eastern Europe, which will be complete in a few days time.
We have noticed over this period that the financial perspective, as MrÂ ColomÂ iÂ Naval pointed out in one of his working papers, is indeed somewhat rigid and requires certain changes.
Since we are now on the brink of central and eastern enlargement, it seems to me that this period should be one for reflection as we bring in new countries, although possibly not a united Cyprus.
It is slightly odd that we have had this debate without the full participation of the representatives of the central and eastern countries, when we realise there are huge problems and challenges concerning the absorption of those countries, as regards not only institutional operation but also policy making.
In this debate we are looking ahead to the distant date of 2013, and although useful policy documents exist we have yet to see them.
We are therefore right to call for these documents so that we can see exactly what basis has been used to assess how to ensure the European Union will work for 25 countries and how to ensure that Europe will become more competitive, and indeed meet its international obligations â the members of the European Council take decisions on our behalf, but very rarely provide us with the requisite budgetary framework.
There are therefore three points which we should include in our message to the incoming parliament and the incoming administration of the European Union.
Firstly, there must be a coherent strategy for the European Union in the years ahead so that we know what the Union's priorities are to be, both internally and externally.
Secondly, we should avoid trying to stretch the political credibility of the Union too far in taking on ambitions that the institutions themselves are incapable of handling at the present time.
I refer in particular to future enlargement for a country like Turkey, as things stand.
Lastly, we need a period of consolidation during this financial perspective period, to make the European Union not only an effective operator internally and externally, but also an operator that is seen to be truly democratic and smooth-functioning.
If we try to take on too many of the ambitions harboured in certain quarters, our institutions will be incapable of fulfilling them.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the Wynne report we are currently debating represents an initial response to the Communication from the Commission on the new Financial Perspective.
There is no intention of arriving at a definitive response during this final plenary.
That said, I believe the response provided by the CommitteeÂ onÂ Budgets is too ambiguous.
I feel the EuropeanÂ Parliament is missing yet another chance to make a clear statement on its positions concerning key budgetary issues.
Parliament already missed the opportunity provided by the Convention.
We Socialists always advocated deepening European integration because we believe it is beneficial to all the citizens.
More Europe means more benefits in everything and for everyone.
In our view, being part of such a Europe is a win-win situation.
The Socialists favour a citizensâ Europe rather than a MemberÂ Statesâ Europe.
This is why we have argued repeatedly that citizens should pay the contributions, not the MemberÂ States.
Members of this House will remember JoanÂ Colom.
He was forever saying that he felt it was unfair for a rich Spaniard to pay fewer taxes to Europe than a German manual labourer.
This is what actually happens under the present system of own resources.
We also believe that the fiscal principles applied in our countries must apply also at Union level.
I should like to make it clear that for both the reasons stated we shall be voting as a Spanish Socialist delegation in favour of the amendment tabled by the French Socialists.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, first of all I wish to congratulate MrÂ Wynn on producing a very balanced report.
At the same time I would like to thank you, Terence, for the constructive work you have done as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
Yours has been an amicable and constructive approach to the job, with the result that the work of the committee has been harmonious and effective.
The value of the financial perspective proposed by the Commission depends on what the balance of power between the budgetary authorities will be in the future.
If the end result is that the financial perspective creates a jointly agreed framework in which Parliament can participate fully in drafting the budget, it will be of great value.
If, on the other hand, the EU budget is to become merely a set of small-scale appropriations, as the Ministers of Finance recently proposed, that does not bode well for consistency in budget policy in the years to come.
The Commissionâs proposal to review the financial perspective is a step in the right direction.
The number of headings has been reduced.
Nevertheless, heading 1 covers an unnecessarily large area compared to the others and it might be a good idea to divide it in two.
Similarly, the allocation of appropriations for agriculture and environmental protection under the same heading raises questions.
The priorities with regard to future policy are the right ones.
EU competitiveness will only improve by promoting entrepreneurship and by investing in research, product development and education and training.
The intention is to treble the figure for appropriations currently being spent in the next seven years.
My group is in favour of this.
There has to be investment, particularly in education, training and trainee exchange programmes, so that we will have better educated youth with a more international outlook that can take responsibility for its intellectual and material development in the future.
The other important priority is cohesion policy.
It is now vitally important to promote cohesion, as we are about to be joined by new Member States whose combined GDP is just 5% of that of the old Member States, although they make up 20% of the population.
One of the EUâs main objectives is the promotion of economic, social and regional equality.
The EU bureaucratic machine is vast, and not only does it pose a threat to efficiency but it especially threatens to tarnish the Unionâs reputation in the eyes of the public.
That is why there has to be less bureaucracy and more administrative efficiency.
Power and responsibility must be devolved downwards and personal accountability clarified.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the first questions that must be asked in this debate is whether the financial framework proposed by the Commission is up to the task of guaranteeing economic and social cohesion and of guaranteeing the redistributive nature of the Community budget and the commitments to the less advanced countries in a European Union enlarged to 27 Member States, in which Community GDP will be reduced by more than 12% and whether economic, social and regional disparities will increase, as stated in the third cohesion report.
My answer is no â this perspective is clearly not up to the task.
One only has to look to the past.
The financial perspectives for 1988-1992 and for 1993-1999 increased the ceiling for own resources from 1.15% to 1.27% of Community Gross Domestic Product.
In both cases, the Structural Funds were duplicated in the packages nicknamed âDelors Iâ and âDelorsÂ IIâ.
Agenda 2000 maintained the ceiling for own resources and for funds, when enlargement to encompass a further six countries was already on the horizon.
The Commissionâs current proposal, however, maintains the ceilings set in Agenda 2000, despite the fact that the current round of enlargement involves a further ten countries, plus another two, with incomes of less than 40% of the Community average.
I refer to the pressure exerted and the lack of solidarity shown by the main cash contributors to have signed the Letter of the Six, who are seeking to limit the budget to 1%.
Nevertheless, Commissioner Schreyer acknowledges that her proposal, which is low, is only possible due to the process of budgetary consolidation that has taken place in the current 15 Member States: to the Stability Pact and to the reallocation of funds.
But what and who will suffer as a result?
This framework shows the risks both for the countries that are about to join, and for the cohesion countries, such as Portugal, given that the value of the Structural Funds for the current Member States will fall from 0.31% to 0.21% of Community income.
This situation really needs to be changed, the ceiling on own resources must be increased and a response must be given to the serious problems of cohesion, poverty and of protecting greater economic and social cohesion between all the countries of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, from an agricultural and rural development perspective, the delivery of EU policy objectives, taken in tandem with the most recent CAP reform, means that EU farmers can now plan to meet the challenging agenda of food security, quality and high environmental standards.
I have every confidence in their ability to do so.
Farmers and rural communities have legitimate expectations, to which Parliament has responded in a positive way.
It is my hope that the most dramatic reform since the CAP was first introduced will lead to greater stability and provide a much-needed stimulus for young people to take up farming as a full-time career.
There are some encouraging signs that this may happen.
Finally, as this is likely to be my last contribution in this House, I want to acknowledge the success of the European project.
Ireland, perhaps more than any other EU Member State, bears witness to the practical realisation of the aspirations and dreams of the EU's founding fathers.
There can be no doubt that Ireland's economic success would not have happened, and could not be sustained, outside the framework of EU membership.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very well-balanced report and provides a sound basis for the work of the next European Parliament without seeking to prejudice our successorsâ decisions, which it could not do anyway.
Many of the questions that will have to be discussed with regard to the budgetary policy of years to come can only be answered by the enlarged European Union, and we must also give due consideration to the adoption and implementation of the constitution.
For this reason it should be re-emphasised at the present juncture that, while the Union must, of course, provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies, as prescribed by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, it must equally ensure that contributions and appropriations are fairly distributed and that budgetary processes are open to scrutiny.
It is certainly true that, under the new headings, the Commission is concentrating on growth targets, employment and sustainability, but I must say that we should be all the more credible if this were not confined to the allocation of budgetary resources but were also reflected far more clearly in the application of the Community acquis and if we focused far more sharply on this aspect in the adoption and consolidation of European legislation.
Let me also say at this point that it is too soon to talk about figures today â whether 1%, 1.24% or somewhere in-between â because we must first deliberate carefully on these things on the basis of the constitutional discussion.
To this extent, the letter from the six leaders was neither helpful nor in any way expedient in its timing or its content.
I also insist on the need for synchronisation of the financial perspective with the legislative term of Parliament and the Commissionersâ term of office, and let me make one last point, Mr President.
On the basis of our experiences and the turbulence that is often part and parcel of political life, adequate budgetary flexibility within each financial perspective is surely one of the major objectives that will have to be discussed, and we in Parliament shall play our part in that discussion.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I concur with all the previous speakers who have said that the debate on the future financing of the Union is still in its infancy, and indeed we may stand on the threshold of some rather hard bargaining.
It is therefore, as my fellow Member MrÂ BÃ¶ge said, far too soon to talk about figures, ceilings and minimum allocations, but what do we actually think of the Commissionâs basic approach?
Let me begin with what we perceive to be good points.
The Commission is proposing a different set of budget headings from those to which we are so accustomed.
It is also proposing a somewhat different aggregation structure for the individual EU policies.
One of the new categories is to be sustainable growth, and another will be conservation and management of natural resources.
This is the result of the Commission having paid very careful heed to Parliamentâs frequent discussion of budgetary priorities.
We want to become the most competitive economic area, and we want to preserve a decent world for our children and grandchildren.
About four fifths of our budget is to be devoted to this aim.
âWonderfulâ is all I can say to that!
A German saying, however, tells us that there is no light without shadow.
The main shadows are in those areas where the Commission has kept its own counsel.
I cannot find any reference to its ideas and proposals as to how the European budget is supposed to acquire the funds we intend to devote to the pursuit of our policies.
It would have been better if the Commission had accompanied the financial perspective with its ideas on how to reform the Unionâs own resources.
That would have forestalled several squalid discussions about Member Statesâ contributions, but perhaps the Commission can still plug these gaps.
I hope it does.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0272/2004) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission Communication: the Third report on economic and social cohesion.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I must say that today's debate on the third cohesion report, for the fourth community support framework, is basically much easier than previous debates which we have held on the same matter in the European Parliament, and I think that one basic reason for this is the personal contribution to it by Commissioner Barnier, in the sense that he started the dialogue on the new 2007-2013 programming period very early, making it possible, thanks also to the assistance of the European Parliament and thanks to the fact that he also listened to the views of the European Parliament, to achieve a broad consensus on this very difficult issue.
We therefore need to give him credit and to note, of course, that Commissioner Fischler, who is present here, and Commissioner Diamantopoulou helped him in this.
I should also add that this endeavour was complicated by impending enlargement, with many new countries covered by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and by the fact that the regional policy of the European Union basically needs to be reprogrammed from its foundations.
I think that both the third cohesion report, as presented by the European Commission, and the position of the European Parliament clearly demonstrate the usefulness of this policy.
I also think that the first message which needs to be made clear from this debate here is that the European Parliament and the European Commission are against any thoughts of renationalising this policy.
This policy has European added value, it has visible results in the regions, especially in the regions which have problems, in the poorest regions, and it must continue.
Another thing I should like to add is that this policy, especially with enlargement coming up, must be given material support from the point of view of funding, which is why Parliament is also reiterating once again its position that funding for it cannot be below 0.46% of gross national product.
Consequently, we agree with the European Commission which, in all events, has adopted a European Parliament proposal on this.
The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the lion's share from the point of view of funding is going to what has been known so far as Objective 1, the 'convergence objective' as it is to be known henceforth, and we consider that the problem created in areas which fall victim to statistics needs to be addressed effectively.
These areas also need to be integrated into Objective 1 and to receive substantial financial coverage and, furthermore, we consider that the areas which fall victim to statistics â and here we disagree with the European Commission â should be integrated from the point of view of state aid into the provisions of Article 87, paragraph 3a of the Treaty.
The European Parliament also considers that it is right to simplify the approach to Objective 2 and we also consider it right that the initiatives we have known so far â Equal, Leader and Urban â are being integrated into the basic programmes of the European Union and that the only Community initiative left, as a new Objective 3 if you will, is the Interreg initiative on cross-border cooperation, which we see as an addition to cooperation and development at European level.
I should also like to say that particular importance is attached in our report to individual sectoral problems, such as the problems of rural areas, on which we accepted numerous proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and of towns.
As an MEP from Greece, I want to focus in particular on the problems created by permanent geographical structural disadvantages and refer to areas such as islands, mountain areas and, of course, the sparsely populated areas of northern Finland and Sweden.
We consider that there should be special policies not only within the framework of regional policy, of cohesion policy, but also more generally in the other sectoral policies of the European Union.
We welcome the European Commission's efforts to simply procedures with the principle of 'one fund per programme', but we shall wait to see the details and we want the role of the European Parliament from now on, especially as regards the drafting of the European Commission's strategic documents for the new programming period, to be substantial and for the European Parliament to have a right of codecision.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, my colleague Michel Barnier has been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic and has consequently had to leave the Commission.
Until his successor is appointed, President Prodi has asked me to look after the structural and regional policy portfolio.
I therefore welcome the opportunity presented by Mr Hatzidakisâ report today to debate the principles of future policy on the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union.
Let me also thank you, Mr Hatzidakis, for your interesting report.
The Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion was adopted by the Commission on 18Â February and was presented to Parliament by Mr Barnier on that same day.
The presentation of that report is to be seen in the context of the proposal for the financial perspective, which we had also adopted in February before the cohesion report.
The Commission is calling for a new partnership for cohesion.
It must be our common will not only to build a Europe based on the common market but to build a Europe characterised both by a keener competitive edge and by more solidarity, a Europe that is more capable of achieving the aims set at Lisbon and Gothenburg, namely sustainable development and a knowledge-based economy.
The imminent enlargement on 1Â May, which will integrate many economically weak regions into the European Union, makes it even more urgent and even more crucial that Europe should pursue a robust policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion.
The Commission has made strenuous efforts to respect the wishes of the various European institutions and regional and local authorities as far as possible in its proposals for the next planning period from 2007 to 2013.
The report, in other words, does not simply reflect the ideas of a single Commissioner but is the product of a comprehensive broad-based debate, to which the European Parliament has also made significant contributions.
I refer in particular to the two major reports by MrÂ Mastorakis and MrÂ PÃ³mes Ruiz which you adopted in September 2003 and to which Mr Hatzidakis also refers explicitly in his report.
In addition, the debate, particularly among the Finance Ministers and the Heads of State or Government, as to how ambitious our cohesion policy should be has only just begun.
Since these deliberations will undoubtedly be difficult, the report you have presented today provides valuable backing for the sort of ambitious cohesion policy that the Commission is also proposing.
How specific are our proposals?
Firstly, there is a convergence target for those regions with a GDP of less than 75% of the Community average.
Secondly, account is to be taken of the particular situation of the regions hit by the so-called statistical effect deriving purely from enlargement.
Thirdly, the Cohesion Fund is to be integrated into both of these measures.
Fourthly, a new target is to be introduced for the improvement of regional competitiveness and employment.
The fifth and last proposal is that the measures for the promotion of interregional cooperation should be restructured on the basis of our experience with Interreg.
In general terms, I can only agree with the rapporteur when he calls for radical simplification of the administration of the cohesion funds.
Here too, we have already drafted precise proposals, which we intend to pour into a legal mould in July.
This applies to all areas, not just to MrÂ Barnierâs portfolio.
For example, in the realm of rural development, for which I am responsible, we want to do some pruning too.
We shall press, firstly, for the creation of a single fund for rural development which would consolidate all the resources that exist at the present time.
Secondly, there should be a single regulation in which all the measures for the development of rural areas are defined, and, thirdly, due priority should be assigned to rural development in the financial perspective.
The same applies to the sphere of responsibility of my former colleague, MrsÂ Diamantopoulou, and to the portfolio for which Mr Barnier has hitherto been responsible.
We have reached the level at which the aim is to develop a single instrument for the planning and funding of programmes with an appropriate set of common control mechanisms.
I believe that would constitute major progress.
I also agree with MrÂ Hatzidakisâ view that 0.41% of Community GDP â 0.45% if we include the resources for rural development â ought really to be regarded as a minimum for an effective cohesion policy.
MrÂ Hatzidakis also expresses certain fears and concerns in his report.
Some of these relate to the thorny issue of the definition of cohesion policy and to the system of regionally targeted state aid, to which he referred in his speech.
I also have a personal interest in the question of the contribution made by rural development to a policy of compensatory regional planning, and this House can rest assured that we shall continue to focus on the necessary measures in their entirety and that, as I have said, we shall be working on specific proposals for a regulation that we can present to Parliament during the month of July.
Â Â  . â Mr President, having first warmly congratulated the rapporteur, I should like on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to emphasise the importance in this third report on economic and social cohesion of the contribution of industrial policy, especially research and innovation policy.
It is obvious that economic and social development, which is now geared to the notion of a knowledge-based economy, depends on overcoming the syndrome of peripherality and making full use of the regional comparative advantage, innovation and research.
In order to find their way, the regions need to stop treading the traditional path and focus on the increased economic importance of new branches of industry, such as the eco-industries and cultural industries, which can provide new jobs and, at the same time, overcome geographical limitations.
Economic and social cohesion requires new ideas, inventiveness and innovative methods, not just funding.
Â Â  . Mr President, we welcome the Commission's approach, the broad thrust of which we fully endorse.
We also thank Mr Hatzidakis for his excellent report.
We have specific concerns relating to the European Social Fund under the competitiveness objective.
First, the wider approach to social inclusion appears not to be supported to any substantial extent.
We fear that many valuable projects will be lost.
We hope that there will still be room for such projects, provided that they support the employment strategy.
Second, national planning of programmes could prove counterproductive to addressing regional and local circumstances and involving local stakeholders.
We call on the Commission to ensure genuine decentralisation in the development and implementation of programmes.
Third, the disappearance of the Equal programme may lead to a loss of impetus and we wish accordingly to see a requirement for gender mainstreaming at all programming stages.
Similarly, we hope for continuing availability of innovative measures as currently allowed under Article 6.
Finally, we look forward to structures that will allow us to address genuine areas of need wherever they may be located.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, because I do believe he has summarised very well the content of a highly realistic proposal from the Commission.
The biggest-ever enlargement of the European Union is about to take place, and in two weeksâ time we shall have ten more Member States.
If economic and social solidarity is to be achieved, an efficient cohesion policy will be indispensable.
The structural support provided by the European Union contributes substantially to the development of rural areas.
The common agricultural policy alone, even with its second pillar, is not able to perform all the tasks on the agenda.
For this reason, it remains essential that we have adequate resources at our disposal over and above the CAP budget.
We really must ensure that the rural-development programme is a sharply delineated instrument and that it is tied to the CAP and hence to active, productive agriculture.
Rural areas will account for most of the territory of the Union in the enlarged Union too.
I believe that rural areas must be active and appealing if they are to be capable of creating new jobs, more output and income opportunities.
Â Â  Mr President, the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities has given a positive opinion on all the proposals made and we want to thank the rapporteur for agreeing to include in his report certain aspects of the gender dimension that were missing from the documents.
That seems to us absolutely essential because progress remains totally inadequate despite an avowed willingness to promote equality between women and men all these years past.
There are two points to be made.
Firstly, the situation of women in the new Member States, which requires special attention.
The second point is a regret, Mr President, Commissioner, that our recommendations on methodology have not been followed.
If we are really to achieve the gender mainstreaming we want, however, we need genuine local appraisals of the situation of women.
We need to have people who are working for gender equality sitting on the Structural Fund monitoring committees.
Finally, all the specific actions deployed must incorporate these conditions so that women are involved in employment, in training, but also, Mr President, in decision-making.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by thanking former Commissioner Barnier for his comment on how well the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism worked with him.
We pooled our efforts to defend the EuropeanÂ Unionâs principles on regional policy and territorial cohesion.
I would like to thank MrÂ Barnier for mentioning my name, and I wish him every success at the helm of the FrenchÂ ForeignÂ Ministry.
I should also like to thank the former President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, MrÂ Hatzidakis.
His excellent term as President is crowned by the report he is presenting today on economic, social and territorial cohesion in Europe.
I feel it appropriate to take him back to the basics of cohesion.
The latter is a long-standing principle. It can be found in the Treaties.
Nowadays, we refer to territorial cohesion as well as to economic and social cohesion.
Economic cohesion may be achieved in a number of ways.
It can be achieved through fiscal policy, by making those who have more pay more.
Social cohesion is achieved through other methods.
One of these is combating social exclusion. Another is establishing the principle of equal opportunity for all citizens.
Territorial cohesion has long been the subject of debate.
There has been much discussion of areas with permanent structural difficulties that make it difficult for them to compete in this market.
It has been stated that such areas should receive aid and solidarity from the remainder, regardless of the level of their GDP.
This applies to agricultural policy, as CommissionerÂ Fischler is well aware.
When we help agriculture we do not enquire whether a particular farmer is rich or poor.
We simply help agriculture.
We wish the whole sector to be competitive.
Territorial cohesion policy must be based on this approach too.
Islands have to be helped.
They find it difficult to compete on equal terms with large urban areas, because the latter always attract those people with the highest level of income.
The sparsely populated areas of northern Europe have to be helped, as must the mountain areas.
The latter need a wake-up call, to ensure the Pyrenees do not become depopulated.
People living in areas with geographical difficulties must not be forced to emigrate.
For all these reasons, it would be appropriate to send out an appeal to the new Europe created by the accession of ten new MemberÂ States.
It has to be borne in mind that our contribution to general cohesion must remain at 0.46% of GDP.
Parliament and the Commission have reached agreement on this.
It is incumbent of the Council to do so too.
A number of initiatives have been very successful.
I have in mind programmes such as Equal, Leader, Urban, Interreg and especially the CohesionÂ Fund.
To date, four countries have benefited from the latter, namely Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.
These four countries have proved that when they grow, the whole EuropeanÂ Union grows too.
It is essential to keep in mind that the extra effort needed to receive the ten new MemberÂ States should not be borne entirely by the four countries that have benefited from the CohesionÂ Fund so far.
Solidarity is called for.
We must all work together to support the newcomers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have a high regard for MrÂ Barnier, as does the whole of my group.
We value his work greatly. I should like this to go on record.
I therefore formally endorse the statements made by previous speakers.
Essentially, we agree with the basic approach drafted by the Commission further to MrÂ Barnierâs proposal.
We agree with the minimum 0.45% for the three objectives.
We agree with bringing Lisbon-Gothenburg and employment under cohesion.
We also agree to the CollegeÂ ofÂ Commissionersâ 1.24% proposal.
The rapporteur represents the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
It is regrettable that he is not prepared to defend the 1.24% proposed by the Commission.
Our proposal is therefore lower than the proposal made by the CollegeÂ ofÂ Commissioners. I find this most disappointing.
I simply cannot understand why this is the case, when we tabled so many amendments on this subject.
There is agreement in principle with the Commissionâs proposal.
I should like to emphasise two key issues.
The first concerns the ultra-peripheral regions.
It is important to try to ensure these regions retain substantial aid, regardless of their per capita income.
Seventy-five on mainland Europe does not mean the same as 75% at a distance of 3Â 000 km from the mainland.
Finally, I should like to emphasise how important it is for this House to stand up for fair criteria.
A case in point is the need to ensure that the statistical effect does not have a negative impact on any institution in receipt of European funding.
We have argued this strongly.
Indeed the CollegeÂ ofÂ Commissioners made a proposal along these lines for the regions.
Parliament has no objections.
Anyone who maintains the opposite is not speaking the truth and is sending out the message that the statistical effect cannot affect MemberÂ States reducing the CohesionÂ Fund either.
I know of one country at 83% of average income.
This is set to change to 92% because of the statistical effect. The limit is 90%.
I urge you to be flexible between now and when the vote is taken, MrÂ Hatzidakis.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I too, on behalf of my group, wish to thank MrÂ Hatzidakis for his commendable report.
I also want to thank the Commission for having drafted its proposal along the lines Parliament requested earlier on.
Our group supports the committeeâs line, that there should be adequate funding for cohesion policy and reviews made of state aid policies, that there should not be any renationalisation of regional policy and that areas with permanent difficulties, islands, sparsely populated and mountainous regions, and regions subject to the statistical effect should receive special treatment.
An effective regional policy, however, means that other policies have to support its aims alongside aid policies.
A certain freedom is also required in regional development, for example in state subsidies, without competition necessarily becoming endangered or distorted.
I am pleased that progress is being made in the simplification of administration.
Let us make the Member States responsible for functioning effectively.
It is especially important to maintain the good practices we have learned from the Leader, URBAN and EQUAL Community initiatives.
To justify the work of the EU there is an urgent need for a certain regional approach to issues and an understanding of the userâs point of view.
Â Â  Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wishes to add its thanks to the rapporteur, who has really taken pains to produce a balanced report, a particularly difficult task in view of the short time at his disposal.
The report largely endorses the Commissionâs proposal. It does not, however, go beyond that.
Essential aims for which Parliament has been campaigning are underemphasised, aims such as sustainable development or consistency between structural policy on the one hand and environmental legislation and the Commissionâs environmental targets on the other.
The Commissioner distinctly emphasised â and I certainly registered this â that Gothenburg ranks alongside Lisbon.
I consider that very important, and I would be pleased if the Commission actually succeeded in having it enshrined in the regulation on the structural funds.
To give but one example, the common policy on climate change must be a component of the future cohesion policy, and this must also be reflected in the choice of projects.
The increase in unemployment and emigration from disadvantaged regions must be halted.
Here too, clear differentiation is essential.
The regulation on the structural funds must not be organised from above â and this is particularly important, in my view â but in cooperation, on a basis of equality, with local players.
Lastly, I very much hope that the Commission will really keep the Commissionerâs promise and enshrine binding rules on partnerships in the regulation.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this third report on cohesion undoubtedly rounds off Mr Barnierâs activities now that he is leaving office as a European Commissioner.
We owe it to his tenacity and his great powers of persuasion that we can justifiably say that the logic of a policy of mere renationalised charity confined to the poorest has not carried the day.
While recognising the need to give priority to the least developed regions, this progress report and the Hatzidakis report largely agree that all the EUâs regions potentially have a need for convergence, competitiveness and cooperation.
A policy of achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion by 2013, as required by Article 3 of the draft constitution, therefore seems within reach.
This policy is part of the idea of the EU bringing old and new members together in a common project.
Even on the territory of the present Union of the 15, there are still areas deserving of aid from the Structural Funds and they must still be shown such solidarity.
The Structural Fundsâ involvement in the French overseas departments until 2013 strikes me as generally encouraging, but I await the forthcoming report that the Commission is to adopt on the implementation of Article 299(2); this will provide greater detail on the specific funds and the action plan for the , which ought to benefit the outermost regions.
The battle of figures that some are beginning to use polemically in fact masks a fundamental debate about our ambitions for Europe, something which requires a constructive and rational interinstitutional dialogue.
That debate cannot be confined to setting a particular ceiling for Community resources; we must calmly reach agreement on the European Projectâs actual purpose.
Our common objective must therefore be to commit the EU to a sustainable regional policy, as opposed to one which is strictly in response to economic circumstances.
Â Â  Mr President, from 2000 to 2006, my Member State, the UK, will have received over EUR 9 billion in direct EU structural fund support, topped up with match funding and private sector support.
No-one can deny the benefits funds have brought to poor communities in industrial, urban and rural areas.
The Hatzidakis report and the Commission proposals prove that the Jeremiahs who say that enlargement is bad news for UK regions have got it wrong.
I want to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with proposals which, in a spirit of solidarity, provide funding for those areas of the EU-15 â including the UK â that are still in need.
The devil will be in the detail, of course, and we still have a long way to go to agree a new round of regional aid programmes.
However, this report and these proposals indicate that our poorest regions could win twice over from enlargement, with a bigger internal market and a continuation of regional aid.
Labour MEPs have worked closely with our regional representatives, with local councils and with trade unions to identify our priorities.
We welcome proposals for the convergence fund, in particular the inclusion of so-called 'statistical effect' regions, and we hope that regions being phased out will not be left high and dry, but will find a soft financial landing.
We welcome the proposals to assist regional competitiveness in former Objective 2 areas and we look forward to hearing more details on how this will be allocated and on the indicators used to identify those areas.
I would ask the Commission to further elaborate on its proposals, as requested in the Hatzidakis report on state aid.
It is important that we have equality in the provision of state aid for all convergence regions, including the statistical effect areas.
We need a reform of state aids which enables more public private partnership activity in regeneration, particularly of urban areas, of derelict land sites and of buildings.
I wish today to endorse Mr Hatzidakis' proposal.
I hope that Member States, the Commission and Parliament will now come up with a comprehensive budget and a regional aid package which will be a good deal for taxpayers and a good deal for our poorest regions.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to use the short time available to me to express my surprise and dismay at the lack of interest and the contempt shown in the debates in this Parliament to the harsh reality that, in a Union of twenty-five States, cohesion policy will lose its character.
It will be drastically impoverished.
Indeed, following enlargement and if the financial perspective imposed by the Council for the period after 2006 remains in place and even if the financial perspective submitted by the Commission is implemented, the funds earmarked for education policy per capita in objective 1 territories will be only 50% of those applied in the Union of Fifteen.
I would recall that, with the enlargement to ten new States, the population living in territories with a per capita income of less than ...% of the Community average, will rise from the current 73Â million people, or 19%, to 153Â million people, or 32%, of the Union of twenty-seven Member States.
This round of enlargement will increase the population by 28% whilst GDP will increase by only 6%.
For those of us who believe in the need for a Social Europe, and for me, as a Galician, this is totally unacceptable â all the more so because income in the enlargement countries stands at only 40% of the average income per inhabitant of the Fifteen and because in the current Member States there is still a clear need to maintain the Structural Funds levels of previous years.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, in the third report on economic and social cohesion, the right path has been chosen, leading to a reformed European cohesion policy with a new architecture and targeted interventions.
The fact that 78% of the financial resources for the reduction of disparities and the improvement of competitiveness factors have been earmarked for the least advanced regions shows that this is a move in the right direction â away from the scattergun approach to support funding towards the targeted use of resources.
Equally right is the decision to accord equal treatment to the regions that are subject to the statistical effect in the framework of the new convergence objective.
We particularly welcome this proposal, provided that it also guarantees adequate funding as envisaged in the communication from the Commission for the period after 2006.
For the sake of fair treatment of the areas subject to the statistical effect in relation to the traditional Objective 1 regions, there must be no further budget cuts or dilution of support.
I therefore wish to refer at this point to last Septemberâs parliamentary resolution based on the Mastorakis report.
The resolution not only emphasised the need to pay special attention to the level of support given to those regions suffering from the statistical effects of enlargement but also stressed that the Commission should focus the same attention on the administration of aid to these regions.
Parliament voted by a large majority in favour of aid under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, and that should be taken into account.
We therefore expect the Directorate-General for Competition, even before presenting the drafts for the regulation on the structural funds, to present its proposal for guidelines on regionally targeted aid, which should take due account of the parliamentary vote, for we must beware of narrowly focusing aid and support measures on the acceding countries, which would ultimately subsidise tax dumping in those countries and would only lead to job losses in the existing EU Member States as companies moved their production facilities from the West to the new Member States in the East.
It would be unacceptable to invest European resources if a one-sided aid regime meant that the only return was the relocation of existing jobs.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Fischler, I am convinced that people have good reason to look forward to enlargement.
It remains true, though, that they also harbour many fears, and we must take those fears seriously and allay them wherever we can.
Regional policy is an important means of dispelling such fears.
It can and must help to prevent or eliminate inequalities, injustices and anomalies within the EU.
It must not, however, encourage or sow the seeds of new injustices.
For this reason, we take a similar view to that expressed by the previous speaker, Mr Berend, in opposing any European regional policy that simply induces companies to relocate.
People will not understand or support a Europe that rewards companies for shifting jobs from one region and then only providing the same number of jobs elsewhere because we are subsidising the relocation.
Another point we have to bear in mind is that EU support funds must not be used to subsidise drastic tax cuts in recipient countries.
Solidarity is a noble value, but it must be mutual, and some of us will quickly recognise that, by promoting tax dumping, we could well besawing off the branch on which we sit.
Â Â  Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I would like to congratulate you once again on your report, MrÂ Hatzidakis.
You must be aware that we are 99% in agreement with you.
In particular, I must thank you for keeping your word and ensuring that ageing will be taken into account somehow in connection with the development of funds.
It has yet to be determined exactly how this will be achieved.
I see MrÂ PomesÂ Ruiz is at your side.
This issue is mentioned in the latterâs report also.
It appears, therefore, that you are both fully aware of what ageing and low population density can entail.
Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no cohesion without development.
There can be no development without a productive population.
There cannot be a productive population if there is low population density and ageing.
Ageing is not a territorial problem.
It is a horizontal problem affecting all regions of Europe.
It affects all MemberÂ States too, and will become ever more significant in the years to come.
It is a major contributory factor to lack of development in regions where this is the case.
I therefore call on the GroupÂ ofÂ theÂ PartyÂ ofÂ EuropeanÂ Socialists to withdraw AmendmentÂ NoÂ 8, as this amendment could make it difficult for ageing to be taken into account as a negative factor as far as development is concerned.
Â Â  â Mr President, especially as the former mayor of a regional island town, I too wish, from this position, to thank the outgoing Commissioner, Mr Barnier, for his efforts to serve the idea of economic and social cohesion in the Europe of the regions.
Of course, I also thank Kostas Hatzidakis, my colleague and fellow countryman who acted as rapporteur for the report being debated, for his work which, as we all know, is manifested in more than just this report.
It is very positive to note that our Parliament accepts by an overwhelming majority firstly, that any renationalisation of regional policy would be devastating even to the very existence of the European Union, of which it is a basic connective fabric, secondly, that the so-called statistical effect of enlargement â of any enlargement â would be addressed in such a way as to ensure continuing support for the regions for which it was considered necessary before enlargement, in order not to interrupt their progress towards development, thirdly, that the special regions from the point of view of natural disadvantages will also need to receive special treatment and finally, that the cohesion policy, which is indeed an essential tool to enable the Union to achieve the Lisbon objectives, has provided important results to date.
It is therefore worth our while to continue this balanced, balancing, reliable and effective policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by thanking MrÂ Hatzidakis for his usual constructive cooperation.
Firstly, a European cohesion policy is necessary.
In the enlarged EU, we need a distribution policy that shows solidarity, in order to reduce disparities and to compensate regions situated far from the large markets.
Secondly, on the matter of the budget, we must come up with the resources that are required to make EU enlargement a success and make headway with growth in Europe.
The funds must be used wisely.
Thirdly, the sparsely populated regions in the extreme north of Sweden and Finland lose their Objective 1 status under the proposal, and this must be called into question, as their geographical disadvantages exist regardless of the situation in the rest of Europe.
We must ensure that these parts of Europe obtain the aid they need.
Fourthly, the Commission must ensure that the extreme, sparsely populated regions take their rightful place in the future Structural Fund Regulation.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, as you know and as you see, the European Parliament remains very vigilant about the future of regional policy, one of the most important policies in the eyes of the citizens.
Despite the work done by our rapporteur and our committee, one crucial point is still outstanding: the amount of funding to be allocated to this policy.
It is essential that the future expenditure ceiling should allow this policy to be strengthened after enlargement.
There is a very great difference between the Commissionâs proposals for 1.24% of gross domestic income (GDI) and the 1% proposed by six States, and regional policy runs the risk of being used as a balancing item for European politics.
We remember the commitment shown by Mr Barnier, who steadfastly opposed the six countries that want a reduced European budget.
Now that Mr Barnier is a government minister, I therefore hope he will continue to show in the Council the commitment he had as Commissioner and that he will be able to get all his colleagues to change their position with regard to the Commission proposal.
The Structural Funds are in fact essential to European solidarity.
The Union needs a real cohesion policy, the financial resources to implement it and therefore income equivalent to at least 1.24% of GDI.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my sincere thanks for this debate and particularly for the many constructive contributions I have heard here.
We shall certainly endeavour to ensure that, when we formulate the specific legislative proposals we have undertaken to deliver in July, various additional points will be taken into account if possible.
I intend to be brief and address only a couple of points, one being the question of how we propose to deal in future with the so-called Community initiatives.
The idea is that the number of these Community initiatives is to be reduced, which will naturally mean that various specific programmes, such as Leader or others, will no longer be available.
This does not mean, however, that the measures covered by these programmes will no longer exist.
The intention is that measures previously implemented in the framework of individual Community initiatives will be integrated into the mainstream programmes.
In this way, we can ensure, for example, that the Equal programme or measures designed specifically to promote equal treatment of both sexes are given their rightful place in the main programmes.
As far as the outermost regions are concerned, there are, of course, specific treaty provisions of which due account must be taken in the implementation of the relevant measures.
I know that Mr Barnier always attached great importance to the task of looking after the outermost regions, and I can guarantee that they will continue to receive the same level of attention.
The question of the territorial aspect of state aid and the necessary definition of areas eligible for support is indeed a highly sensitive issue, and then there is the concern in some quarters that there could be difficulties in areas bordering on supported regions.
The Commission will devote particular attention to this matter.
On the other hand, however, I cannot subscribe to the view expressed by one Member that our policy will lose its cohesive character after enlargement.
That is quite simply untrue.
Care will still be taken to ensure that the cohesion target we have set ourselves is actually achieved.
Indeed there will also be more funds available for that purpose.
It is not as if all the resources were to be taken from the present 15 Member States and given to the new Member States.
There will be more money.
I fully agree with you that we still need a European â and I emphasise European â cohesion policy.
A mere financial adjustment of the type that some are seeking or have mooted will not, in my opinion, achieve our aim.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  . â The report acknowledges enormous disparities between regions, which will inevitably worsen as a result of this round of enlargement, that strengthening economic and social cohesion is an obligation under the Single Act, and that structural investments in the cohesion regions benefit the Unionâs other economies.
It does, however, deem 0.41% to be an acceptable minimum level for the allocation.
The report insists on retaining the 'expenditure target' system and on the N+2 rule, it issues warnings about industrial restructuring and relocation; it states that companies that have benefited from Community aid should not be entitled to receive new funds when they relocate, and that State aid should not be an incentive for companies to relocate.
It also calls for more effective monitoring of the ways in which the Funds are used and for a more focused strategy with regard to industrial restructuring and its social impact.
It confirms support for regions that have suffered as a result of the âstatistical effectâ, it has adopted amendments that we tabled to eliminate the expression âtemporary phasing-outâ and to provide phasing-out support for current Objective 1 regions; it calls for the special status of the outermost regions to be preserved and for specific programmes to be kept on, even if they are no longer in Objective 1 regions.
It has adopted our proposal for regions that suffer permanent handicaps.
It seeks to ensure specific proposals and suitable funding for employment as well as support for small and micro-businesses and for training, particularly for adults.
We insist that the âstatistical effectâ should be extended to the Cohesion Fund.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0269/2004) by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2005 Budget: the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy report (APS).
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the start of the final budgetary procedure in plenary in the current legislature.
The composition of the House due to vote on this report tomorrow will not be the same as that of the House that will vote on final adoption of the 2005Â budget in December, assuming that stage is reached.
I trust that at least my colleagues on the CommitteeÂ onÂ Budgets and I will be able to vote in December along with our new colleagues from the new MemberÂ States.
I would like to thank all colleagues and officials for the spirit of cooperation they have demonstrated towards me thus far.
An innovative step forward has been taken with regard to modernising the budgetary procedure.
Further to the debate on stock taking and the change to activity based budgeting, the EuropeanÂ Parliament is doing away with the former budgetary guidelines.
These are replaced by a resolution on the AnnualÂ PolicyÂ StrategyÂ Report.
One objective is to render the legislative procedures more appropriate. It is also hoped to influence the drafting of the Commissionâs preliminary draft budget.
We therefore urge the Commission to take account of our political and budgetary priorities when negotiating with the various Directorates-General.
We set out to draft a shorter resolution this year.
Unfortunately, I fear we have failed in our endeavour, as we did in previous years.
Nonetheless, I am delighted with my colleaguesâ contributions.
I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising that the opinions of the other parliamentary committees will be taken into account at first reading of the budget.
Commissioner, this draft 2005Â budget is characterised from the outset by a special feature.
I refer to the budgetary restriction affecting categories 3, 4, and 5.
This budgetary limit will affect many programmes and will call for a particular effort to improve the distribution of appropriations between ongoing functions and new priorities.
We believe that the new needs will require additional resources.
Concerning agriculture, we call on the Commission to make a statement on the pilot projects and on the initiatives launched in the 2004Â budget.
With regard to the StructuralÂ Funds, we point to the improved implementation of appropriations in 2003, despite retaining a very high RAL.
Your rapporteur intends to set the final figure for appropriations by reference to MemberÂ Statesâ forecasts.
Turning to internal policies, the EuropeanÂ Parliament is concerned about meeting the mid-term objectives set at Lisbon.
We therefore request that budgetary resources be focused on the key actions in 2005.
Special attention will be paid to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the drivers of growth and employment.
Parliament is also concerned about implementation of communication and information policy.
The new FinancialÂ Regulation must not hinder the development of the latter.
This budgetâs main aim will be the consolidation of the European area of freedom, security and justice.
It will pay particular attention to the common immigration policy and to speeding up implementation of the integrated Schengen and VIS Project systems.
Substantial budgetary resources will be required in both cases.
Parliament must deal quickly with these priorities, however, if it is to be seen to respond to concerns expressed by European citizens.
We shall stand shoulder to shoulder with you on this, Commissioner.
We shall also respond appropriately to the challenge posed by terrorism, particularly in the wake of the terrible attacks perpetrated in Madrid on 11Â March.
All our efforts to ensure no such outrage can ever take place in Europe again will be dedicated to the victims.
This is why we shall endorse the pilot project for aid to the victims of terrorism.
We shall also support strengthening Europol and Eurojust.
In addition, we are in favour of your directive on compensation for victims of crime.
We shall support similar initiatives brought before the House also.
To summarise, in the case of the fight against terrorism, the House will go beyond supporting the Council and the Commission. It will actually try to take the lead.
With regard to external affairs, Parliament will become ever more involved in the reconstruction of Iraq and the consolidation of democracy in Afghanistan.
The traditional priority areas for the House will not be neglected either.
New additions for this year are the neighbourhood policy, the creation of a European diplomatic service and of a European external action service.
The general principle applied throughout will be that new external needs must be financed with new resources so as not to detract from our traditional priorities.
Lastly, we have taken note of the 700 posts you request from us, Commissioner.
We very much hope that you will in any case try to arrange some redeployment.
I shall conclude by saying that we will be very vigilant as far as the various agencies are concerned.
We shall ask them to provide a mid-term programme.
The Commission should be able to include this in the draft preliminary budget in May on the development of these agencies.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget for 2005 will be the first budget for the enlarged Union to be adopted by an enlarged budgetary authority.
The Commission will adopt the preliminary draft for the 2005 budget within the next few weeks.
At the first reading by the Council in July, under the Dutch Presidency, 25 Member States will be represented, and the MEPs from 25 Member States will take part in the first parliamentary reading in October.
The budget of 2005 will thus be presented to a host of new faces, not least within the Commission.
There can, however, be no doubt that the budget will be dominated by enlargement, and this is also emphasised by the general rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, in his report.
May I offer you my very sincere thanks for your report, Mr Garriga Polledo, particularly since you were under pressure to produce it within a very short time because of the postponement of the communication from the Commission on the policy strategy for 2005.
One of the aims of the 2005 budget is to implement the agreements contained in the Treaty of Accession.
In concrete terms, this means that direct payments to farmers are to be entered in the budget for the first time.
It also means an increase in the financial commitments from the Structural Funds, as agreed in Copenhagen.
The Structural Funds are the main instrument with which the European Union gives financial assistance to the new Member States in order to narrow the prosperity gap, and they should remain the principal instrument of cohesion policy in the future too.
At the consultation before the first reading of the budget for 2005, I shall report to you on the latest progress in the programming of the Structural Funds for the new Member States.
The political priority attaching to enlargement is also reflected in administrative expenditure: the Commission will, as stated in the communication of 2002 and reiterated a few moments ago by your general rapporteur, apply for the next batch of additional posts for enlargement.
This will involve the establishment of 700 new posts, about half of which will be assigned to the language services.
As far as administrative expenditure is concerned, special efforts and particularly close cooperation will be required from all the institutions if we are to operate within the ceiling which is set in the financial plans and which has turned out to be lower than previously calculated because of the reduction in the appropriation for exchange losses.
MrÂ Kuckelkorn, of course, has dealt with that very thoroughly, and may I extend my thanks to you too, Mr Kuckelkorn, for your report.
Lastly, for the priority task of enlargement, the Commission is also proposing an increase in pre-accession aid to Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, as decided by the Council with the support of Parliament.
Lending new dynamism to economic growth in Europe is a task for the Member States and the Union, a task that will help to shape the next few years.
Enlargement itself will generate economic impetus.
Additional efforts are, however, needed to tap the full potential of the enlarged single market.
These efforts receive financial backing from the EU budget, not only through the Structural Funds but also, for example, with the funds allocated to the trans-European networks, and provision has been made for an increase in these funds next year.
The funds earmarked for measures such as the creation of a chemicals-testing agency are essential expenditure if we are to ensure that the new approach to chemicals policy, which involves testing old substances for their impact on the environment and public health, does not become a bureaucratic impediment to the chemical industry but should actually speed up the innovation process.
The dreadful events of 11Â September 2001 and the savage terrorist acts in Madrid have clearly emphasised the danger emanating from terrorism.
In the European Union we need more cooperation, more effective cooperation, in order to protect our citizens from such dangers.
The measures envisaged in this domain are another priority for the 2005 budget, and I note that all the institutions are in agreement on this point too.
The internal security of the European Union and its role in the field of foreign policy are inseparable.
As far as the foreign-policy budget is concerned, we face another significant challenge in 2005. The adjustment entry is lower than the rate of inflation.
This means in practice that the budget for the common foreign policy will be reduced in real terms.
This is in stark contrast to all the political pronouncements as well as being glaringly inconsistent with the spirit of the draft constitution, which we hope will be adopted within the next few weeks.
There is simply no escaping the fact that the ceiling on the foreign-policy budget was set too low.
This mistake must not be repeated in the next round of financial planning.
Nevertheless, we must safeguard the appropriations for the main priorities, such as combating poverty and honouring our commitments in Afghanistan and in the Balkans too, commitments to which Mr Garriga Polledo also referred in his speech.
For next year we need a contingency reserve again to enable us to make funds available for Iraq.
Let us hope, and let us all play our part in ensuring, that next yearâs Iraq agenda really can be devoted to reconstruction.
2005 is the sixth year of the Financial Perspective that is now in force.
When a planning period nears its end, the room for manoeuvre becomes increasingly limited as more and more funds are tied up in advance by decisions made in previous years.
Next year will be particularly tight, because the adjustments, as I mentioned, have turned out to be smaller than originally envisaged.
For 2005 the current financial plans provide for EUR 119 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 114 billion in payment appropriations, which corresponds to 1.09% of gross national income.
The cost of implementing decisions of previous years â those taken in the framework of Agenda 2000, the Accession Treaty, the multiannual programmes, the roadmaps or even the agricultural reform package, the full impact of which will be felt next year as its cost rises to about EURÂ 1 billion â swallows the bulk of the funds within each of the ceilings.
There will be a need for close and fruitful cooperation among all participants if we are to reach a timely agreement on the budget for 2005.
As in past years, the Commission will cooperate closely with the rapporteurs and the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets and with the Councilâs Economic and Financial Committee under the Dutch Presidency.
On a personal level too, I shall naturally make it a point of honour to cooperate very closely and effectively, as in the preceding years, so that we can draw up and adopt a budget that will help significantly to achieve the aims of the enlarged Union.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I should like to begin by thanking the general rapporteur for his report.
I must also make the Commission aware once again of the long-standing position of the Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I am glad MrÂ GarrigaÂ Polledo has also endorsed this position, inasmuch as we cannot continue financing new priorities to the detriment of other parts of the world such as TACIS, the Mediterranean, LatinÂ America and Asia.
This is simply not possible, Commissioner.
I have in mind new commitments such as those made to Afghanistan and Iraq.
I should like to run briefly through the priorities of the CommitteeÂ onÂ ExternalÂ Affairs. These are to combat poverty and promote human rights.
The committee also shares the priorities of the European security strategy, namely combating terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and preventing organised crime and regional conflict, as well as dealing with failing states.
I have noted with some concern the adjustments needed to bring the 2005Â Budget into line with the requirements of the FinancialÂ Perspective.
Commissioner, I trust the offer of cooperation you just extended to the CommitteeÂ onÂ Budgets and to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council can also be extended to the CommitteeÂ onÂ ExternalÂ Affairs, as we are all working together in the interests of effective and visible European external action.
Â Â  . Mr President, our main goal should be to be successful for our small and medium-sized enterprises.
I believe the main point is that we must safeguard existing jobs and businesses and create new ones, and to this end we need, more than anything else, the small- and medium-sized enterprises.
These enterprises are experiencing fairly serious concerns at the present time with the introduction of the Basel II package.
There is quite simply an urgent need for the European Commission study on the implementation of the Basel II agreements, including a detailed impact assessment.
It is also a matter, ultimately, of creating new financial and guarantee instruments for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
These SMEs should be operating successfully on behalf of Europe in the global marketplace, which is another reason why I believe that the WTO assembly and parliamentary conference proposed by the European Parliament are a matter of the utmost priority, and I ask the Commission to incorporate this proposal from the European Parliament into the programme too.
Â Â  . Mr President, we of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are very pleased with Mr Garriga Polledoâs report.
He has the most difficult period of tenure as rapporteur that we have, because it falls in the period that Parliament is in temporary recess.
There are always all kinds of forces at these times, especially in the Council, that try to draw matters within their own sphere of influence, but I think Mr Garriga Polledo can be trusted to withstand these assaults.
We had three main priorities in our committee.
One of them has been fully adopted in the report and that is Lisbon.
Lisbon is the solution for better competitiveness, better employment and a better economy.
We need to put even more emphasis on this than we have in the past.
For Lisbon to succeed, we also need to name the social partners.
This will involve a very small sum, but it is really extremely important.
It would be good if that were still to be brought up for debate in some way or other in the resolution.
Another point is health and safety and that is going to be very important in the near future, especially in relation to the new Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, the budgetary year of 2005 will essentially be characterised by two issues from an agricultural point of view: on the one hand, a European Union of 25 Member States from the beginning of the budget, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, and, on the other, by the implementation of certain provisions adopted in the reform of the common agricultural policy and which will now enter into force, such as, for example, direct aid to milk producers, or aid for rice without the former penalties, and aid for dried fruits, the quality of durum wheat and energy crops.
It has, therefore, become necessary for the Commission, in the preliminary draft budget, to anticipate some of the consequences of this enlargement, providing for sufficient funds, for example, for intervention measures for certain products, such as butter or beef, in the event that the new Member States cannot bring their prices into line quickly or, for example, veterinary funds to combat animal diseases, which could increase following the disappearance of the current borders.
I would finally like to stress that the Committee on Agriculture, in its opinion in this report, has expressed its firm support for the introduction of a pilot project for the funding of Community insurance intended to alleviate the consequences of disasters caused by extreme climatic phenomena.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, two hours ago, in my role as spokeswoman for the Committee on Fisheries, I expressed my confidence that European fisheries do indeed have a future.
I shall now continue where I left off by emphasising that these future prospects depend on systematic pursuit of the reform efforts and on the implementation of decisions.
I therefore call for due consideration in the 2005 budget of at least the main areas of action of the common fisheries policy.
Firstly, we need better staffing of the relevant services if the aims of the CFP reforms are to be achieved.
Secondly, we need the provision of a solid financial basis for the planned creation of the regional advisory bodies, and, thirdly, we need a solid financial basis for the establishment of the Community Fisheries Control Agency.
Fourthly, we need sufficient resources for the new fisheries agreements as well as for EU participation in international fisheries organisations and, fifthly, we need adequate funding to compensate the coastal regions hit by the effects of recovery plans and emergency measures.
Our decision to reform the CFP made good sense.
In the budget for 2005, the aim must now be to build a robust and sustainable financial substructure that will finally enable the fishing industry to become profitable again.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the new annual policy strategy instrument allows the legislative and budgetary cycles to be combined and makes a political reading of our budget easier.
We believe it is essential that policies that have been codecided should really be entered in the budget without sacrificing other European policies; this will require a higher income than proposed.
I will, however, stress that more funding needs to be budgeted for the Lisbon objectives.
At the half-way stage we have not reached our targets.
It is therefore imperative that budget resources be concentrated on employment, innovation and social cohesion policies.
We must in that way ensure that the social partners take part in modernisation talks.
All the budget lines allowing progress to be made with the Unionâs economic governance must also be funded.
We are agreed in recognising the essential part played by small firms in modernising employment.
They play a recognised part in the creation and preservation of jobs.
We must continue to help them by improving their environment, however.
It must be made easier to support non-governmental organisations in the social sector and we shall have to find a way to put an end to their financial insecurity.
Finally, I agree with our rapporteur that information and communication are areas to which the Commission needs to give greater priority and on which it must take action.
Not only must these budget lines be funded, but more especially the Commission must fully realise what its role is in this information policy because all policies must come back to and finish with the citizen.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Schreyer, âgender budgetingâ must become more than a mere linguistic monstrosity.
I ask and urge you to ensure that the principle of gender equality permeates this budget.
Gender mainstreaming must be put into practice and must be made quantifiable in terms of euros.
In the European Community, more women are victims of violence within the family than are victims of terrorism.
For this reason, we call for 2006 to be declared the European Year against Violence.
We want the Beijing +10 review to be used as a means of fleshing out the Beijing Platform for Action, and we want the results of the World Conference on Women to be implemented by a European Conference, for example, which would develop additional strategies.
We also call for a European Gender Institute, which would compile reliable data as a basis for our political decisions.
We expect the Commission to apply gender mainstreaming in all areas of political activity, and the 2005 budget, the first in the greater European Union, should provide us with the main indicators of its application.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, who has presented an excellent report in difficult circumstances, given that all of us are already either preparing or waging an electoral campaign.
The report does this House credit.
Allow me to pick out a few points from the report for brief comment.
I should certainly like to express my astonishment that the Commission has apparently agreed with the Council â or so the documentation seems to suggest â on a cut of EUR 100 million in the special programme for the removal of bottlenecks in the framework of the trans-European networks.
I find that procedurally and politically unacceptable.
On the procedural side, the Commission is not the budgetary authority.
Budgetary authority is vested in other institutions, and our Parliament is one of them.
The Commissionâs task is to take account of the will of the budgetary authority.
With regard to the substance of this apparent agreement, it is evident, particularly in my own region, that we are not prepared for enlargement as far as the transport infrastructure is concerned and that there is an urgent need for funding here.
It is therefore unacceptable that an important project proposed by the Commission under parliamentary pressure should now be ditched.
I wish to emphasise that clearly and may I also say that the Commission should rethink its political approach to the adoption of preparatory measures in connection with its visa policy, the Schengen information system and its refugee policy.
Various directorates-general have adopted very different political approaches in this matter, and the Commission is surely duty-bound to pursue a coherent overall approach.
What various parts of the Commission are putting out at this time cannot be accepted and is, in some cases, self-contradictory.
Lastly, allow me to refer to the establishment of new posts.
Let me forewarn you clearly that we shall be examining very carefully whether 700 posts are really needed.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, in discussing the budget for 2005, we have, of course, merely set the ball rolling.
It will be a matter for the next Parliament to bring the process to a conclusion.
In this respect it is an unusual budget.
It is also unusual in that it is heavily influenced by the particular context in which it is being prepared.
On the one hand, we want to make enlargement work and must therefore create the appropriate conditions.
In addition, everything to do with enlargement is all about the future and about the availability of financial resources too.
We shall also discuss the budget in the light of the debate on the financial perspective, because this 2005 budget will be the last but one before the new financial perspective.
It goes without saying that the figures we estimate represent choices for the future, and they will also be one of the foundations of the debate on the financial perspective, whether we like it or not.
At the same time, Europe is not an island.
We Europeans must engage in international politics, whether in the field of foreign policy, where we must work to prevent conflict, or in the sphere of internal security, to which you have referred, where we must play our part in a concerted effort to combat international crime.
Lastly, we must rise to the challenge of global competition and ensure that our businesses and our economy can hold their own.
As in the preceding years, we shall try to ensure that the budget on the table in front of us is a tight one, even in the conditions I have just described.
It must, however, also be adequate.
We shall not let anyone cry âmiserâ at those who advocate great prudence and thrift, nor shall we tolerate any accusations of extravagance against those who point out that more money is needed in particular areas.
In the process of drawing up this budget in the conditions I have described, which make it no easier to reach agreement, we shall continue to adhere to the line we have always taken in the past, pressing for the adoption of a tight but adequate budget, so that the public know that they can rely on the European Parliament to deal responsibly with budgetary matters.
Â Â  âMrÂ President, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Garriga Polledo, for an excellent report.
Next yearâs budget will be a difficult one, with the accession of ten new Member States, bringing with them nine new official languages.
This will be a very hard test for EU administration.
The new Member States have to be included in the work of the EU as a whole.
This means they also have to receive their rightful share of employees and officials to work in the EUâs different institutions.
This is a massive recruitment and training exercise.
The Commissionâs request for 700 new posts is right, even if it is a huge number.
At the same time, however, we have to guard against too much bureaucracy with regard to administration.
The downward devolution of responsibility and power should continue, as should the clarification of personal accountability.
Administration must move more in the direction of activity-based management, where what is most important is better productivity and cost-effectiveness.
There should be special attention paid to improving internal security.
This will mean, among other things, stepping up the fight against drugs and other international criminality, as well as illegal immigration.
This will bring pressures for budget heading 3, âInternal Policiesâ, in particular.
Regarding structural policy, we must once and for all be in a position to reduce the figure for outstanding commitments.
Regarding the structure of the budget, we have to improve its degree of informativeness: it must be clearly evident what the costs and achievements of individual policy areas are.
Members of Parliament must be able to see clearly what EU money has achieved or can achieve.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Mr Garriga Polledo for his work and I also look forward to fruitful cooperation in connection with the budget for 2005.
The comment I would like to make is of a more general nature, as both Terry Wynnâs report on the financial outlook and also the report before us now speak of the Lisbon process, the need to achieve greater economic growth.
I ask myself why there is no mention anywhere of the promises made in Gothenburg?
Then the issues were the quality of the growth that we are bringing about, sustainability and biodiversity.
There must be more investment in clean sources of energy and energy saving and that must also manifest itself in the budget.
The Member States seem to want to achieve the objectives of Lisbon mainly through a kind of management by speech, as money and real social policy are not being put on the table.
Hollow statements are made, but we hear no more about sustainability and the promises that were made about that, they are being forgotten.
I want a Europe of people and the environment, not of the market and currency.
In other words, not only a Europe of Lisbon, but also of Gothenburg.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too would like to thank MrÂ Garriga for the work that he carried out and also for the cooperation that we had in the Committee on Budgets.
My thanks also go to MrÂ Wynn, for the whole period that we have worked together, to MrÂ Walter and all the Members of the committee.
2005 will, perhaps, be the first full year for the new Europe of 25 Member States â and I believe that the Commissioner, whom I thank, must not forget this.
It will, therefore, be the first year in which the EU budget will be fully drafted taking into account 25 Member States.
We are faced with new challenges, given that spending levels must, anyway, be maintained in order to guarantee a certain level of growth, while taking into account new requirements, always and in any case on the basis of financial discipline that must be respected, above all through parliamentary control.
We hope that all this is realised and in the near future too, even more so in an enlarged Europe of 25.
Â Â  The debate is closed;
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0236/2004) by Mr Wilfried Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2005.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's preliminary estimates for 2005 have been deliberated in detail by the Committee on Budgets and the groups have reached agreement, by an overwhelming majority, on the report before you.
I would like to extend my warm thanks to everyone involved for this good cooperation.
I will therefore only focus on a few specific aspects here.
The 2005 estimates are based on the following key parameters: full 12 months of enlargement-related expenditure with nine new languages, and of course, if the outcome of this week's referendum in Cyprus is positive, a tenth new language will be added; 44 working weeks, of which three constituency weeks, 12 ordinary part-sessions and six additional part-sessions; a 2.7% salary adjustment, and a 7% standard abatement for posts.
Due to the specific situation arising in the drafting of the estimates for 2005 this year, with the forthcoming enlargement on 1 May and the European elections in June, a number of issues and uncertainties are still outstanding which cannot be resolved until shortly before the first reading in September this year.
Political priorities: the priority is to satisfy the needs relating to enlargement despite the financial constraints in Heading 5 in 2005.
I view the main objective for 2005 as achieving sound financial management and budgetary rigour and providing value for money for the European taxpayer.
The estimates for the 2005 budget, taking into account the budgetary constraints and uncertainties, must therefore be based on sound assumptions and real needs.
The general framework: the preliminary draft estimates have been set at 20% of Heading 5, namely EURÂ 1Â 272Â million. Of this figure, an amount of EURÂ 1Â 007.6Â million is foreseen for standard operational expenditure and EUR 173.4 million for enlargement-related needs.
In light of the positive experiences with capital injections and accelerated repayment of buildings, which have produced major savings in recent years, it would seem sensible to use a part of the appropriations available in the budget for an advance payment for the D4 and D5 buildings in 2005.
Expenditure related to Members and political groups: no appropriations, on the line or in the reserve, are foreseen for a Member's Statute, but chapter 102 (Reserve for the Member's Statute) is maintained with a token entry (p.m.).
This House should continue to support the adoption of a Statute for Members' assistants.
Furthermore, the level of the Secretariat allowance should be assessed, and a Code of Conduct governing the use of the Secretariat allowance should be produced.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn now to one of the four amendments which have been tabled.
Unfortunately, my fellow Member, MrÂ Balfe, whom I greatly respect, is not here.
I would therefore ask our fellow Members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE-DE Group) to bring their influence to bear on him once more so that he withdraws his amendment.
The reason is that there are still a number of financial issues to be clarified.
We can reach a consensus on the matter itself, but it is ultimately inopportune to take a decision based on a report which does not show all the appropriations.
That is the reason why I would ask you to bring your influence to bear so that this particular amendment is withdrawn tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my warm thanks to the rapporteur who dealt with the issue of Parliament's preliminary estimates for 2005 with his customary flair.
I wish to thank him particularly for his efforts, from the outset, to achieve a consensus across the groups.
It is very important that on the one hand, we jointly contribute to ensuring that in terms of its administration, the European Parliament is able to master the challenges of enlargement fully.
After all, we are the institution which is most affected, because all the languages must be available from 1 May and we have very different working methods from the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice or the Court of Auditors.
On the other hand, we must also make a contribution to strengthening the European Parliament itself, and the public's 'ownership' of it, on a long-term basis.
To this end, the rapporteur has put forward a number of sound proposals â he has just outlined the various points â and I would like to thank him particularly for that.
Mr Kuckelkorn, as regards Mr Balfe, I would point out that the amendment concerned was not tabled by the group, which is why the group is unable to take any action here.
The amendment comes from at least 32 Members â I am not sure of the precise number of signatures â who have tabled this motion.
That is permissible under the Rules of Procedure and I would ask you to respect that.
Let me, however, also make it clear that I am one of the Members who has opposed MrÂ Balfe's proposals most vigorously.
Let me be blunt: it is not the European Parliament's task, faced with a situation in which healthcare in some Member States â I shall phrase it very carefully â is not entirely satisfactory and legal restrictions apply, to solve problems in this area for a few specific and privileged Members at the European taxpayer's expense.
I say this quite frankly, and I have said the same thing to Mr Balfe himself.
At the moment, we are being bombarded with e-mails explaining why we should definitely vote in favour of this amendment.
Members from three Member States are involved.
What these Members should be doing, quite simply, is helping to ensure that the health system in their own countries functions effectively, then they would not need any over-provision at European level.
Let me be blunt about that too.
I hope, Mr Kuckelkorn, that after the European elections â I am assuming that the voters will be merciful and draw the line at number 30 on your party list so we still have the pleasure of your company, whereas I am in a position where I can be rather more confident â we will be able to adopt this budget jointly, for it is extremely important that in our capacity as the representatives of Europe's citizens, we address this task very seriously and thus help ensure that Europe does not drift away from its citizens.
That is this Parliament's honourable task.
We are committed to it, and we intend to remain committed to it after 13 June as well.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statement on Eurostat, followed by the following six reports, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for 2002:

Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission would like to thank Parliament for the opportunity to clarify once more the actions that it has taken after being informed in May 2003 about the serious events at Eurostat and at some of its contractors, most of which had occurred â as investigations have shown â in the period up to 1999.
As soon as the Commission had evidence of the problems in Eurostat, it took action.
The Director-General and all the directors were moved to advisory posts while the Commission conducted a thorough investigation into who was directly involved.
The Commission launched an Internal Audit Service examination of Eurostat contracts and grants.
Following the reports by the IAS and the special task force, contractual relations between Eurostat and other Commission departments and certain organisations were brought to an end.
OLAF (European Anti-fraud Office) was encouraged to conclude, as soon as possible, outstanding enquiries there.
The Commission was determined to rectify and strengthen its relevant rules and practices, and to fully implement the staff and financial reform begun in 2000.
As the House will know, on 25 September 2003 Commission President Prodi presented his action plan to a meeting of the Conference of Presidents, enlarged to include members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
This action plan had three basic components: first, thorough restructuring of the Eurostat Directorate-General; second, consolidation of the reform regarding relations between Commissioners, their private offices and services, and centre-periphery relations in the area of control and audits; third, revision of OLAF's legal framework, with the presentation of new legislative proposals.
Mr Prodi provided further clarification of his undertakings when, in November 2003, he presented the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2004 to the European Parliament.
In the meantime, the Commission has further discussed matters concerning this case with Parliament and its bodies and has expanded on its plans.
One main forum for these discussions involved the Committee on Budgetary Control when the follow-up to the 2001 discharge was dealt with and when information was provided on the Commission reforms.
However, the continuing concern of the Committee on Budgets as to the progress of the reform has been of considerable help, most recently at its meeting in early April this year.
The Commission welcomed the efforts made by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, MrsÂ Theato, to help ensure better understanding of the causes for concern.
The work undertaken by Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, Mr Casaca, Mr BÃ¶sch and other members of the committee helped the Commission to implement suggestions that have improved our action.
On 1 October 2003, with these proposals in mind, the Commission adopted the new Eurostat establishment plan.
That plan was put into operation, as planned, on 1 November.
On 21 January 2004, the Commission was informed of the action plan for Eurostat's activities in 2004, put in place at Mr Solbes' initiative.
On 9 February 2004, the Commission adopted the communication providing a progress report on its financial and administrative reform, which includes a specific section on the measures that the President had presented on 18Â November 2003, as well as proposals for two regulations amending the legal framework of OLAF.
The Commission acknowledges the careful and thorough monitoring work undertaken by Parliament and its bodies in the discharge process, and in its other monitoring activities, with regard to the Eurostat case.
It is grateful for the concern and commitment that the Committee on Budgetary Control continues to demonstrate in relation to the implementation of the Commission reform.
Both are essential.
With comprehensive modernisation of structures, systems, internal controls and management and personnel policy now in place, the Commission will continue to review actions taken and improvements made, so as to maximise the safeguards against any repetition of the practices detected in Eurostat or any similar conduct.
We are being aided by the sustained and shared commitment of Parliament to that end and we are grateful for that support.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are all very well aware that we are dealing with a task â the discharge of the budget â which, as stated in the Treaty, falls within the exclusive competence of Parliament.
I would also like to point out that at the moment the jobs of thousands of officials in the Commission and other institutions are at stake, but this is also an opportunity to highlight the most significant events which have taken place in the field of financial management.
I would also like to point out that the issue before us is financial management and not each of the specific issues arising from that management and, furthermore, any potential irregularities are dealt with by the various courts or judicial authorities.
For all of these reasons, the report for which I have the honour of being rapporteur consists, as usual, of three important documents.
On the one hand, the discharge of the accounts is submitted to this plenum and, secondly, what is proposed is that the management should be discharged, rather than postponed, accompanied by recommendations which make up a resolution covering very diverse aspects, some of which I will comment on very briefly.
Firstly, we have the problem of shared management.
In accordance with the Treaties, the Commission has exclusive responsibility for financial management, but it is also the case that eighty per cent of that financial management is in the hands of, or carried out with the crucially important cooperation of, the Member States or third States.
It is therefore proposed that the Treaties be interpreted as granting and recognising the Commissionâs primacy and pre-eminence in this area, in order to provide it with instruments which may require particular action on the part of the Member States.
Furthermore, the report deals with the issues of Commission reform.
This concerns substantial reform in the field of financial management which involves its decentralisation and the allocation of responsibility to the Directors-General which is reviewed every year in the annual statement of activities.
This mechanism has been updated over the years and this report suggests further improvements.
Within the reform of the Commission, the issue of Eurostat is raised.
We have just heard a statement from the Commission and unfortunately this issue is not closed.
Instead, it is in the hands of the judicial authorities, which could raise issues of political responsibility in the future, and we must therefore remain vigilant.
It is also the case, however, that Eurostat has also served as an incentive for certain important reforms undertaken by the Commission, including detecting some of the defects which existed, such as the relationship between the Directors-General and the Commissioners, which has been considerably enhanced in the Commissionâs third progress report and in relation to which we must expect further substantial improvements.
Within the context of this general reform of the Commission, we are also seeing a reform of accounting procedures, an important reform which must reconcile a dual system of budgetary management based on both cash-based and accrual-based accounting.
We believe that the general approach which is being applied and proposed to be satisfactory.
We must wait until 2005.
Improvements have been made, such as the invoice register or the contractorsâ database.
The report also addresses problems of coordination between the various control structures and, fundamentally, the establishment, within the Directorates-General, of the relationship between the internal audit service and the Commissioners.
The internal audit service is the responsibility of the Presidency and it is proposed that it remain with the Presidency.
It is also proposed to link, to some extent, the Internal Audit Capabilities with the Internal Audit Service.
Furthermore, it suggests a separation of the functions of the budget and those of budgetary control.
With regard to the various policies that are analysed, in the field of own resources a more direct connection is proposed which reduces the tension that exists between net contributors and the other countries.
The existence of a tax, the existence of a direct link between the European citizens and the Commission and the European institutions would promote awareness of the European Union and would reduce that tension between what some people give and what others receive.
In the field of agriculture, a critical view is taken of the prefinancing of exports, which represents free financing, and, with regard to the Structural Funds, underutilisation, which is the result of the Member Statesâ overestimations in their calculations is criticised.
With regard to external measures, it is requested that external audits are undertaken on the basis of objective criteria and that food safety and aid not be subsumed into the framework of a general development programme.
Finally, in relation to administrative expenditure, the report addresses the problems of invalidity pensions and sick leave.
I would also like to thank Bent Adamsen and Marianella MartÃ­nez, who have helped me, and the Executive Commission and the Court of Auditors for their cooperation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I drafted the report on the discharge for the European Development Fund.
In our discussions on this in the committee, we had a broad consensus on our analysis of the development of the European Development Fund, and also on our decisions regarding the report.
I have also enjoyed very constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Court of Auditors, and I should like to thank the institutions for that.
Looking at the Court of Auditorsâ Statement of Assurance on the European Development Fund, we can say that the expenditure has been approved, but only with reservations, as the Court of Auditors is not prepared to give the green light with regard to direct budgetary support, which in 2002 constituted approximately a quarter of aid.
This is important because, according to all plans, more and more aid will in future be given in the form of direct budgetary support.
If these funds are used correctly and if we are to be given the opportunity of examining whether or not they are being used correctly, there must be a sea change in the quality of budgetary control and monitoring in the beneficiary ACP States.
A great deal of work remains to be done in this regard by the Commission before we can be given proper accounts for this.
This is a key factor in the future auditing of the European Development Fund.
The Court of Auditors is also very critical regarding the annual declaration of the Director-General of the competent Directorate-General.
The Court of Auditors does not believe that he was in a position to make this declaration on the basis of the information at his disposal.
The Commission should take this criticism on board, and my judgment is that it is very serious.
It indicates that the control system is still not working properly.
When we asked the Commission for actual reports evaluating various projects in various ACP States, it took a very long time to procure these reports.
This confirms much of what we feared during this work, namely that Headquarters in Brussels has an inadequate overview of the work in the Delegations.
If it does not have the reports and cannot give them to us, even though they are on the lists, it is hard to imagine that there is proper monitoring in place.
We are of the opinion that this is something that the Committee on Budgetary Control must continue to examine and look at next year.
As a whole, then, we recommend granting discharge in respect of the European Development Fund.
I should also like to say a few words about the other reports, which have also largely caused more controversy than mine in this debate, chiefly the reports by MrÂ vanÂ Hulten and MrsÂ Stauner.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and I shall not be voting in favour of granting discharge to the Council or the Committee of the Regions and, in our opinion, the votes on discharge for these two institutions should have been postponed.
The main issue with the Council is its attitude and unwillingness to cooperate with Parliament.
The Council was sent a schedule, a questionnaire, which it is in effect refusing to answer.
Such requests for answers to questions are in fact fully in line with the Financial Regulation in force.
In reply, the Council refers to a kind of gentlemenâs agreement from the 1970s, which is completely obsolete.
In reply, the Council of Ministers deigned to give answers to certain selected questions to certain selected Members; this is in no way binding and is secretive.
I think that this runs counter to the spirit of this discharge process as a whole, which should be open and transparent.
Nor can we vote in favour of discharge in respect of the Committee of the Regions.
As much as a year ago, the whistle was blown on very serious cases of maladministration in the Committee of the Regions, especially regarding travel expenses and a great many other points.
It is quite evident that the Committee of the Regions still has not taken this in hand in earnest: quite the reverse.
The committee still rejects several of the main conclusions from OLAFâs investigation.
As OLAF had expected, it has failed to put into operation the disciplinary procedures that it should have instituted.
It is quite clear that the Financial Controller who blew the whistle on the maladministration has been badly treated and has not received the apology he was due, as his actions were fully in line with his duties.
Concerning the report by MrÂ vanÂ Hulten, we are of the opinion that this is a very good piece of work.
It is of high quality, thorough and very specific.
On the subject of Parliament itself, it is time to push for the abolition of the Strasbourg sittings.
There is no excuse from the point of view of budgetary control for spending nearly EURÂ 200Â million extra per year commuting between Brussels and Strasbourg.
Now is the time, before the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, to put forward this point of view, and we have the opportunity to do so tomorrow.
The matter of reimbursement to MEPs will be an issue in these elections whether we like it or not, but Parliament only has itself to blame.
There is no way of justifying to the man in the street the various systems of reimbursement we have and the fact that it is we who have granted ourselves them.
Instead, we must bring in a new system of reimbursement and salaries that is justifiable and transparent.
For this reason, together with MrÂ Blak of the GUE/NGL Group, I have tabled a number of amendments intended to clean up the system of privileges.
This relates in particular to our belief that travel expenses should be reimbursed on the basis of the actual costs incurred rather than the distance travelled.
We are also of the opinion that the existing system for taxi fares should be revised.
Parliament has free cars at its disposal, and thus there is no reason to also have a system for reimbursing taxi fares; we can pay these ourselves out of our subsistence allowance.
We have also put forward a number of proposals intended to tighten up the system for obtaining the daily subsistence allowance so that it is more closely linked to the meetings we actually attend.
Finally, I wish to comment on the Eurostat affair, and also on the Commission statement, even if the Commission seems to be leaving.
I think that the proof is overwhelming, as the whistle was blown on the maladministration within Eurostat long before the Commission chose to act.
The whistle was blown by Parliament and the internal audit service, but the Commission was too slow to act.
This is a matter of political responsibility.
At the start of the Commissionâs term of office, its President emphasised that the Commission should require individual Commissioners to accept political responsibility, and now, when it finds itself in a situation where it should have done so, it is saying it is not necessary.
This is a great disappointment given the aspirations the Commission had when it took office.
In our opinion, this is not good enough.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I must now make the following point with regard to the agenda.
The Commission's statement on Croatia is due to start at 6Â p.m.
I propose that I call the two speakers at the top of the list as well â which means that we will overrun slightly â in the hope, and with the request, that these Members will be brief so that we can then proceed according to the agenda and deal with Croatia.
The timetabling has been extremely tight recently and we are having to improvise a great deal.
I would ask for the indulgence of the three Commissioners who are now present so that we can overrun slightly and take the two speakers on the list.
Then we will pause for Croatia.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the following comments to make on my report concerning discharge for the other institutions.
As Mr SjÃ¶stedt has already pointed out, the Council has indeed largely withdrawn from control and cooperation with Parliament, in contrast to the other institutions.
We cannot accept this situation. It also cannot be justified on historical grounds or in terms of a 'gentlemen's agreementâ.
That is why we have called, in my report, for a response no later than 1 July 2004 to the outstanding questions contained in our questionnaire.
The increases in remuneration resulting from the system of 'weightings' which the Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors are granting to themselves must be condemned.
Whereas the Commission was sensible enough, in this case at least, to vote in favour of suspending this illegal practice for its Members from 1 January 2003, the Court of Justice has reintroduced these increases in remuneration retrospectively on the basis of an internal administrative ruling.
This cannot be regarded as a ruling in its judicial capacity, which means that these payments are still illegal.
This gross violation of basic rule-of-law principles is especially regrettable when it is committed by the supreme guardian of European law, namely the European Court of Justice.
The Court of Justice should set an example and be particularly scrupulous in the conduct of its internal affairs.
The same applies to the provision whereby Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors can use official cars for their private purposes to a quite excessive degree.
However, as the Court of Justice and â in its wake â the Court of Auditors, unfortunately, have failed to come into line, we are calling for any transfer of funds to the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors to be suspended until these practices have ceased.
Only under these circumstances can I genuinely uphold my recommendation that discharge be granted to these two institutions.
