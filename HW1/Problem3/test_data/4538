It appears to me that this is ample proof that this issue will have further consequences, and that some of these consequences will undoubtedly be the subject of much heated discussion.
I would now like to turn to the issue of genetically modified rape, as I know that the European Commission is currently working on a proposal to authorise such rape.
Could the Commissioner please also give her opinion on this matter?
I know that my government, the Polish Government, is opposed to any authorisation.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Czarnenecki, it is a pleasure for me to be able to contribute to the debate here in this Parliament.
The fact that the previous debate on Belarus and this one on genetically-modified organisms have coincided is testament to the fact that you are doing a good job of defending your views, MrÂ Czarnenecki, and that is your job.
I would like to say to you that the current Community legislation, which is the result of the negotiations between this Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission, finally granted the Commission the power to authorise a genetically-modified organism by means of a legislative procedure know as the comitology procedure.
This procedure â as the honourable Member is aware â is used in many areas of Community legislation, and is provided for in the current legislation, and allows the Member States of the Union to play an important role and the European Parliament to participate.
This procedure does not authorise the Commission to act against a majority in the Council.
Nevertheless, when there is no sufficient majority in the Council â when there is a majority, but not a sufficient one â in favour of or against the proposed measure, the Commission can and must act.
In authorising this NKÂ 603 line, therefore, the Commission will simply be fulfilling its obligation to apply Community legislation, and I would like to point out that the companies legitimately trust that their applications will be dealt with fairly and objectively, in accordance with the Community legislation in force approved by this Parliament and by the Council.
With regard to the new varieties, they will all be analysed in a fair manner, with the two essential objectives: their traceability and the verification that they are harmless to health and to the environment.
To this end, each new variety proposed will have to be analysed in the context of an individualised approval.
There will be no generic approvals.
Â Â  â Would the Commissioner agree that any GM product that is going to be put into the food chain will be adequately labelled so that consumers can see exactly what they are selecting and that it will have been properly tested and be safe for human consumption?
Could she also respond to the original question, in which the questioner says that bringing these products into our market might in some way result in unfair competition with products within the European Union?
Is this not essentially a betrayal of the point that our farmers and our industry should take up this new technology and use it if they are going to compete in the future?
Â Â  Madam President, as the honourable Member knows, all the industries and all the elements in the chain are obliged to label and indicate the existence of genetically-modified organisms in the composition of a product.
Fraud may take place, but it will be the responsibility of the various European Union authorities to ensure that it does not take place.
So the important thing is that the authorisation of a genetically-modified organism involves its traceability, that is to say, there must be systems for detecting it, if it is used in any product.
We are all aware, for example, that there is also fraud in the use of hormones.
As a former Agriculture Minister I can tell you that we must be extremely vigilant in order to prevent this fraud and tackle it if it takes place.
The important thing is that the consumer can make the choice.
With regard to the second issue, you have mentioned unfair competition in relation to farmers.
Unfortunately, we are not talking about unfair competition.
If there is any unfair competition, the competition will relate to the traditional varieties of the various products.
Any possible unfair competition from NK 302 will be with the traditional varieties of maize which have been cultivated in Europe and throughout the world.
Farmers may choose to use them or not.
They can use any of the varieties.
Competition, if there is any unfair competition, will, moreover, be between laboratory varieties and natural varieties.
I believe that citizens and politicians have a responsibility here as well.
We have the possibility of choosing what we want: traditional varieties or new laboratory varieties.
Consumers themselves will ultimately be free to choose how this issue develops.
Â Â  â Commissioner, at the meeting of Ministers for Agriculture on 19 July about this specific maize, only one Member State in three voted in favour, following which the Commission decided that one in three wanted it.
Are you perhaps considering reviewing the procedure used to take decisions on this particular European legislation, so that it is more democratic?
I have a second question.
Measures have already been taken in Denmark and Germany for the benefit of farmers who farm organically and conventionally, in order to protect them from the danger of contamination from modified organisms.
Are you perhaps considering promoting similar measures at European level?
Â Â  Mr Papadimoulis, I do not know if I made it clear earlier, but I will say it again: my sympathies are with natural products, with traditional varieties.
I like apples which, though they may sometimes be uglier, have more flavour, more aroma and, in my view, are of a higher quality.
This is not just true of apples, but of a whole range of foodstuffs.
That is the reality.
Furthermore, I defend farmers who opt for traditional agriculture, with selected, traditional and natural products which, furthermore, uses traditional fertilisers which prevent the introduction of chemical substances or genetically-modified organisms.
This must not prevent the cultivation of these products, which â according to all scientific analyses â do not cause any harm to human health, which may in some cases resolve problems and difficulties â very obviously in certain regions of the world â which improve the performance of agricultural production and which furthermore are completely detectable â traceable, as I said earlier.
There are problems such as cross-pollination and the contamination of natural products through pollination by genetically-modified products.
This has also been studied and, in fact, in the cases we have authorised, these risks are absolutely minimal or quite simply non-existent.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 27 and 28 will be taken together.
At the informal Transport Council on 9 and 10 July in Amsterdam, Commissioner Loyola De Palacio said that she intended to submit a new proposal for a directive on port services before the end of her term of office.
Can the Commission inform us exactly how this new proposal will take account of the fundamental objections of the European Parliament with regard to self-handling and the liberalisation of pilotage services?
What organisations and bodies have been consulted in connection with the drafting of this new proposal?
Some time ago, concern arose in port circles when it became known that the Commission was planning to submit a new proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services even before the inauguration of the new Commission.
As is well-known, the European Parliament rejected the proposed compromise at third reading (conciliation procedure) during the last parliamentary term.
Can the Commission indicate what plans it has for submitting a new proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services, and can it already say what the substance of these plans will be?
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, access to the port services market is an issue which the Commission as well as this Parliament and the Council have been actively working on over the last seven years, specifically on the basis of the Green Paper on ports and maritime infrastructures of 1997, a document which stimulated the first intense debates on this subject.
The discussions intensified with the proposed Directive presented by the Commission in 2001, and the in-depth debates which took place in relation to it led the Commission to introduce various modifications to the text, particularly in response to the opinions expressed by Parliament at first and second readings.
Nevertheless, having adopted a text in conciliation, at the last vote this Parliament rejected it.
The margin was minimal, but as we know, one vote is enough.
With the new wording of its proposals on port services, the Commission is trying to reflect the legitimate concerns of all parties.
Likewise, in the new proposal we are preparing, we are, moreover, trying to respond to the objections raised to self-assistance from the points of view both of safety and of social protection and the environment.
The new proposal will probably require all port service providers to be subjected to a system of authorisations which guarantees compliance with the applicable safety, employment and environmental rules.
This approach differs fundamentally to the proposal of 2001 and is intended to respond to the concerns expressed by those who called for greater attention to be paid to these points.
Bearing in mind that the necessary authorisations will guarantee equal conditions for port services, there will not be any reason to stop companies carrying out self-assistance from using their own land-based staff.
With regard to pilotage, the proposal being prepared will probably incorporate a specific system, with a view to taking account of maritime safety aspects, and will provide for the application of public service obligations.
Finally, I would like to stress the importance of developing the role to be played by ports in transferring the growth in goods traffic by road to short-sea shipping.
In order to guarantee a competitive transport system in the European Union, I believe it is absolutely essential that a significant proportion of the new demand, which we expect to grow by around 40% in ten years for goods, be channelled towards maritime cabotage within an enlarged Europe.
This will prevent other types of congestion problems which are already beginning to appear in other types of infrastructures, such as roads or railways, which also require significant modernisation and must be made more dynamic.
Â Â  Â Commissioner, I assume that you will agree with me that this is a very sensitive issue that has been the subject of much debate and has caused much upheaval, because it can obviously have grave consequences for a large number of people within the Union.
These days, there is also a certain level of distrust in port circles with regard to the proposals you will shortly be tabling.
I would therefore like to ask you quite specifically whether you are planning another thorough consultation with all those involved from the sector â workers and employers â in order to reach a mutually acceptable compromise in the next few weeks, before the issue is presented to the Commission.
I should like to ask you what timeframe you have in mind.
Â Â  Mr El Khadraoui, I am aware that this is a very sensitive issue â those of you who were here will remember the demonstrations and traffic hold-ups which took place at the time of the debate on the previous text.
Having said that, we must be clear: do we or do we not want to promote maritime traffic and transport?
If we want to promote maritime transport, we have to make it more dynamic and more competitive, without reducing the safety aspects or producing any kind of social dumping, naturally.
Neither, however, must we make it obligatory â as in some ports of the European Union today, for example â when loading or unloading a lorry onto a roll-on roll-off transport system to employ a specific driver from port staff or pay somebody â although they are not employed â as if they were employed.
That would clearly mean imposing obstacles and unjustified costs for maritime transport.
Instead, if we really want to promote maritime cabotage, we need to make it as fluid as possible.
To this end, we have put forward a series of proposals â some are already operational â relating to administrative simplification, the use of new technologies and the harmonisation of forms, thereby making it possible for the maritime sector to enjoy the same facilities as, for example, TIR road systems.
That is not enough, however.
Ports must also be promoted as multimodal hubs and made more dynamic.
Throughout all this time we have held discussions with the sectors.
During previous discussions I met on repeated occasions with all the representatives of the piloting, docking and loading sectors.
I have met all the sectors.
We have continued to hold meetings with them â myself in some cases, such as the last one I held in Puerto de Amberes, and in other cases the Commission services.
I am sure that, during the coming discussions, my successor â who will be responsible for promoting them â will continue to hold fluid talks and contacts with all the sectors.
What is certainly the case is that there are certain types of situations which could perhaps be called privileged â I am not sure whether they are â or which simply involve closed elements, which cannot be maintained.
We must move towards greater openness, which, I would emphasise, is going to mean more work, more activity, greater possibilities and greater wealth for all the European Unionâs port areas.
Â Â  Â Madam President, I still have a few additional questions.
Commissioner, although I am grateful for your openness and for the candour with which you have spoken, I still wonder what the compelling circumstances are for you to table this proposal in the dying days of your career as a Commissioner, when your mandate has only six weeks left to run?
You have told Mr El Khadraoui that you have consulted all those involved and refer in this respect to your visit to the Antwerp port.
I live in Antwerp and if you ask me, the last time you visited the Antwerp port was when the debate about the previous directive, which was rejected by this Parliament, was in full swing.
I therefore see no signs of consultation about the new text.
Like Mr El Khadraoui, I would emphatically ask you what your timeframe is.
You have failed to give a response to this question so far.
Finally, Commissioner, surely you must realise that what you stated a moment ago with regard to the statute of the Belgian and Flemish dockworkers is nothing short of a declaration of war, and that you will certainly not solve the issue with this kind of approach.
Â Â  Madam President, I am still a fully-fledged Commissioner and I intend to act as such until my last day in the job.
It does not matter to me that I am only in the job for another month and a half; I am going to present what I believe I must present if it is ready for presentation.
I do not intend to fail to present anything and leave outstanding issues for my successor just because I am leaving.
I have been employed, and this Parliament has put its trust in me, until 1 November.
And I intend to carry out my duties fully until 1 November.
Secondly, if anybody has declared war, it is certain sectors.
I am not declaring war on anybody.
Quite the opposite, what I have been holding over all these years has been a series of debates.
In fact, there has been a slight mistake: my last meeting was in Rotterdam, in a port city, and I met there with all the representatives of the port unions.
It is true that in a very civilised and correct manner I was shown certain placards and banners asking me to go away and other less friendly things, I know.
We were, however, discussing all the issues.
I am not, moreover, waging a war on anybody whatsoever.
All I am doing is offering clear support for maritime transport and furthermore I am talking about maritime cabotage.
Are we able to ensure that the lorry I referred to or the trailer in other types of transport can move around as freely as possible and at the least cost in this form of transport and transfer in ports, with costs that are truly justified and not artificial such as, for example, the one to which I have referred?
I could also point to the case of the captain who sails the same route once or twice per week and enters the same port once or twice per week: does he not know the problems involved in bringing the ship â his ship â into that port as well as any pilot who has been doing so for a while?
These are the issues we must deal with and if we are to talk about promoting maritime traffic, we must bear in mind that this must be incorporated.
I am not against anybody, but rather I am in favour of certain things: in favour of port activity, of wealth in ports, of the development of port cities and areas and in favour of the European economy, competitiveness and living conditions.
Finally, many of the elements of the proposal we will present will be restricted to cabotage.
It is not a question of a captain of a ship suddenly entering any old port without a pilot.
That would make no sense from the point of view of safety.
Rather we are talking about a captain who enters a port each week, who knows the port and who furthermore has authorisation, granted by the port authority itself, guaranteeing that he has the appropriate qualifications, knowledge and skills.
I am told we can continue to talk.
We can always carry on talking.
If I were to suddenly come up with some legislation without having spoken to anybody, then I would understand your concern.
I have, however, been a Commissioner for five years and I have spent these five years talking to the port sectors on various occasions.
And not just me, but also the Commissionâs services have spent seven years since the Green Paper was approved, and beforehand during its preparation, speaking to the various bosses, players and protagonists in the European ports.
So there have certainly been consultations and talks.
I am going to earn my salary up until the last day and respond to the trust which you, this Parliament and the Council, have placed in me, and that means doing my job, which consists amongst other things of presenting this proposal for a Directive, if it is ready.
Â Â  â The workers and their trades union have expressed their categorical opposition to the liberalisation of port services.
Ports are of strategic importance to economic development and national defence.
Specialist workers in ports are connected with the loading and unloading of ships, the strain on ships and, by extension, the safety and protection of life at sea and environmental protection.
How does the Commissioner evaluate these criteria with respect to the new initiative for the new arrangements?
Is she taking account of the workers' proposals?
Â Â  Mr Toussas, when airports in Europe were liberalised there were very similar arguments to those now being put forward in relation to ports.
Workers were concerned that it would lead to job losses, a decline in social conditions and lack of safety.
None of that has happened.
What has happened?
The opposite: unprecedented dynamism in European airports.
Mr Toussas, what I want is what is best for economic growth and for the jobs and living conditions of workers.
I have taken account of the concerns of the unions and I have modified some of the initial proposals â as I pointed out a moment ago â and I have introduced generalised authorisations, which means that there is public responsibility for guaranteeing that all aspects relating to safety are respected and that standards are respected.
It is also a guarantee that employment legislation is respected.
I therefore believe that these concerns are unfounded.
I would emphasise that this proposal represents an opening up, but, above all, what it must mean is more activity for the regions you have referred to.
Â Â  Questions Nos 29 and 30 will be replied to in writing.
Â Â  Madam President, the two other Commissioners each have only one question to answer, which will certainly not take 20 minutes.
I believe we could therefore follow a different procedure to that which we usually follow, as there is no point in taking 20 minutes for one question.
Â Â  Madam President, I have been in this Chamber since before Question Time began.
I presented my question in July and I have been waiting and listening to every question.
Members are not to blame if Commissioners exceed their speaking time.
I would like to put my question and, above all, to hear the Commissionerâs reply.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry, but we will follow the usual procedure for Question Time.
We have further questions now for the other Commissioners.
I am afraid that you are mistaken, MrÂ Posselt, as we have a great many other questions, especially for Commissioner Dimas.
All I can do is to inform you that you will receive a written answer to your question.
I am very sorry that you have waited in the Chamber, but this was unavoidable.
Â Â  Madam President, the question concerns the conclusions drawn by the Commission in the light of that abolition of international textile quotas that will come into force as of 31Â December of this year following a decision taken ten years ago at multilateral level by the World Trade Organisation.
Ten years ago, we jointly set the date for the abolition of quotas for the end of this year.
The day is almost upon us, and â understandably, even though we have had all the time we needed to prepare for it by means of progressive liberalisation - it has provoked a certain amount of anxiety, together with fears and difficulties to which the Commission has endeavoured to respond.
The overall strategy that we have adopted consists of considering the European textiles and clothing sector, as the questioner himself has done, not as an industry of the pastÂ âÂ whose gradual disappearance would have to be managed, more or less decently, from a social and political point of view â but, in sharp contrast, as an industry of the future.
Textiles and clothing in Europe is a competitive, modern, innovative and productive industry.
Europe is the continent in which there is no more modern and productive sector than that of textiles and clothing.
Against this backdrop, the fact remains that finally abolishing the quotas presents us with a challenge in terms of competitiveness to which we must be capable of responding, and this is what the Commission did last June by proposing action lines.
We worked on this matter with a high-level group representing the Commission, the Member States, various actors from the sector, producers, distributors and trades union representatives. I myself also took part personally in the groupâs work, and a number of conclusions were reached.
In essence, what we are proposing is firstly to start monitoring international trade â and in particular our imports â a little more closely.
We shall therefore put in place at the end of this year a monitoring system in more or less real time, so that the figuresÂ â and, in particular, possible sudden rises in importsÂ â can be spotted more easily, and we can draw our own conclusions as necessary, as the WTO entitles us to do.
We shall also pay increased attention to questions of international competition and, in particular, to illegal practices such as dumping, fraud and the protection of intellectual property, each of which are, of course, cancers that must be monitored extremely closely.
The second element is conquering foreign markets.
This, as far as we are concerned, remains the most effective weapon for ensuring the future of the sector, whether the markets concerned are major ones that remain protected, such as the US market in several cases, or potentially significant markets for us, namely a number of markets in some, but not all, developing countries which, in the textiles and clothing sector, are now potential importers of high added value products, including European products.
This entire discussion, essentially focused on tariff issues and on non-tariff barriers, is the result of the Doha round of trade negotiations.
We are therefore at the heart of these international negotiations.
I should like to add a regional perspective to this multilateral work concerning the Euro-Mediterranean zone, on which we have been working with our partners from around the Mediterranean region, namely (and naturally enough) the countries of the Europe of 25, together with the candidate countries or potential candidate countries, such as Turkey. The idea is to set up a kind of pan-European integrated âtextiles and clothingâ zone, with the help, for example, of accumulated benefits of pan-Euro-Mediterranean origin, about which we have been negotiating, up to and including this year.
Lastly, a brief word about China, which is, of course, the most formidable competitor in this area, in view of that countryâs efficiency, productivity and salary levels.
We have set up a system of bilateral dialogue with the Chinese as regards the textile trade to look into ways of ensuring that trade is not disrupted too significantly as a result of quotas being abolished.
In addition to this government-level and administration-level dialogue, we have set up a dialogue within European and Chinese business circles, and the first meeting in this connection took place recently.
All of these measures, which were fostered by the Commissionâs initial communication last October and which were approached within the framework of this work done by the high-level working group, will be the subject of a fresh Commission communication, currently scheduled for October.
We shall therefore approach the end of the year deadline in full knowledge of the facts, but also with a toolbox that has recently undergone significant improvements.
Â Â  â Madam President, despite the fact that I am wasting valuable time, I should like publicly to congratulate Commissioner Lamy on the work which he has accomplished on the portfolio which he has managed to date as Commissioner.
My supplementary question concerns what general measures, reciprocal measures and measures to abolish non-trade barriers the Commission intends to take at both multilateral and bilateral level, as well as within the framework of trans-regional cooperation.
Reference was made to them, but there needs to be a transition from words to action, which is always difficult.
I should therefore be grateful for further clarification from the Commissioner.
Â Â  There are, of course, several levels.
Once the quotas have disappeared, there will still be both the tariff level â which, as I have mentioned, is to be the subject of fresh multilateral negotiations, the principles of which, moreover, were set in Geneva last July â and everything we refer to as non-tariff barriers, in other words technical barriers that are also on the multilateral negotiation agenda.
I am referring here to a series of technical measures as regards the composition of materials, protection against certain risks and specific characteristics that are imposed from time to time, in particular in the USA or in certain important developing countries, such as Brazil, South Africa, Egypt and India.
These effectively amount to trade barriers which, under the pretext of protecting some specific local feature or other, have the effect of banning imports and protecting local producers.
This whole area of ânon-tariff barriersâ, of which I have just mentioned a few examples, falls within the framework of the multilateral negotiations that we have been pursuing in the Doha round, and what is true for textiles similarly applies to other sectors, such as the car and electronics sectors.
This area of non-tariff barriers is therefore also part of the negotiations that we are pursuing within the World Trade Organisation.
Â Â  Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the textile industry is facing major changes.
The European market is being opened up and trade barriers mean that many markets are not accessible to our exporters.
I would therefore like to ask what progress has been made on the Singapore issues of competition, government procurement and investment.
The export strategy we need for the European Union is of course of immense importance, and so I would be interested to hear your opinion on this matter.
Â Â  The Commission is aware of MrÂ RÃŒbigâs interest in issues relating to international trade and in particular to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is true that textiles and clothing issues affect SMEs more than multinationals, hence his sensitivity on the issue.
In my response to him, I shall add to my previous answer to the main questionerâs supplementary question by focusing on the only Singapore issue remaining, given that we had to let go â in any event for this round of negotiations and even if they do not leave the WTOâs table â of Singapore issues such as investment, competition, public procurement and public procurement transparency.
What remains, MrÂ RÃŒbig, is a subject that is dear to you and that we decided in Geneva to negotiate formally this time, namely trade facilitation, which entails a complete review of some of the procedures, paperwork, authorisations, licences and administrative decisions that all too often still confront people as they take goods across borders.
The entire issue of trade facilitation is currently under negotiation and, of all the Singapore issues, this was probably the most important one to the SMEs.
I am therefore pleased that our schedule and Mr RÃŒbigâs priorities have managed to coincide at this point.
This was not the case, once again, for investment, competition and public procurement transparency, but what was most important for SMEs, and therefore for textiles â leaving aside tariff negotiation of technical barriers â was trade facilitation and, in this regard, your wishes have been granted.
Â Â  . I would like to thank the honourable Member for raising the issue of the family in the context of the social agenda.
One of the conclusions of the Irish Presidency Conference held in Dublin in May 2004 was that family and family life remain among the top sources of individual well-being.
Therefore, they contribute to the social capital, although the Treaty does not provide legal competence to pursue family policy as such.
However, given that the issue of family cuts across many different policy areas in which the Commission is active, it has already contributed to an evaluation of the interactions between various employment and social policies and the changing nature of families.
These interactions are already having an impact on European Union policies and will continue to do so in the future.
For example, the objectives underpinning the Union's social inclusion process, the open method of coordination on poverty and social exclusion, stress the need to ensure access to housing, healthcare and education for all and to develop policies designed to preserve family solidarity.
The elimination of poverty amongst children is also emphasised.
In this context, it is noteworthy that child and family poverty has gained increased prominence within the social inclusion process in recent times.
For instance, one of the six key priorities agreed by the Commission and the Member States in the 2004 Joint Report on Social Inclusion is to develop a focus on eliminating poverty and social exclusion amongst children.
Also, in the recent Commission Staff Working Paper on Social Inclusion in the New Member States, one of the key social inclusion challenges identified is to strengthen policies to support families and social networks, and to protect the rights of children.
Another important policy area in which the Commission gives prominence to the family is in its emphasis on developing family-friendly policies in such areas as employment and childcare.
More specifically, the European employment strategy, in line with the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council in Barcelona, addresses the problem of reconciling work and family life and provides quantitative objectives for increasing the availability of child-care provision.
As to the future, the Commission envisages that the family will continue to be an issue of concern in the European employment strategy and in the Union's social inclusion process and thus for the further development of the Union's social policy agenda.
Â Â  â I should like to thank the Commissioner for his reply.
It is encouraging.
One of the key issues for the future in the debate on employment is how to balance work and family life.
What issues has the Commission identified in this important debate and how does it intend to promote discussion on them in the future?
Indeed, how does it link this to the Lisbon agenda?
Â Â  . Reconciling work and family life is one of the main concerns of social policy.
Most of our legislative measures or our policies attempt to achieve this.
As an example, we are shortly to have a revision of the working time directive, the provisions of which are designed to ensure reconciliation between family life and work.
Flexible working hours is another instance of such a policy.
We are working hard on this and I hope that we will have a more detailed policy in the coming months.
Â Â  . I should like to thank MrÂ Papadimoulis because his question allows me to clarify certain matters relating to employment contract holders in Greece, which is one issue which has arisen and, of course, to clarify matters relating to the directive on fixed-term employment.
This directive requires the Member States to take measures to:
one: improve the quality of fixed-term employment by ensuring the principle of non-discrimination is applied and
two: prevent the abuse caused by the use of successive fixed-term contracts.
The way in which the Member States achieve this depends a great deal on the Member States themselves.
For example, they may define objective grounds which justify the renewal of such contracts, the maximum overall term of successive contracts and the maximum number of times such contracts may be renewed.
There may be different solutions for different industries or for different categories of workers, provided the rules adopted suffice to prevent abuse.
It should be noted that this directive does not require Member States to take measures to convert fixed-term contracts to permanent contracts.
Numerous countries have such rules within the framework of a package of measures to prevent abuse; however, the directive does not introduce the right for workers on fixed-term contracts to become permanent employees.
As far as the new Greek presidential decree is concerned, article 10 on transitional arrangements makes provision for certain successive contracts to be converted to open-ended contracts of employment.
However, as the Community directive does not order such conversion, the method and criteria used to achieve the number and categories of employment contract holders which it covers cannot be the subject of control by the European Commission.
The first legislative act transposing the directive in Greece to which Mr Papadimoulis refers was indeed unsatisfactory as regards measures to prevent abuse from successive fixed-term contracts.
The European Commission services and the Greek authorities liaised at the time so that solutions could be found more quickly and legal recourse avoided.
Greece, as I mentioned earlier, has since passed a new presidential decree which changes the position in the previous presidential decree as far as the public sector is concerned.
Apart from the conversion of certain fixed-term contracts to permanent jobs, the rule of thumb in the new presidential decree is that fixed-term contracts which exceed the maximum term of 24 months, as laid down in the presidential decree, are invalid and may constitute grounds for payment of compensation to workers and the imposition of sanctions, including criminal sanctions, on employers.
According to the Commission's preliminary examination, the rules for successive fixed-term contracts in the new decree do not contradict the directive on fixed-term employment.
Nonetheless, given that the decree in question only covers the public sector, the situation also needs to be addressed in the private sector.
As soon as Greece notifies the Commission of any additional relevant legislation transposing the directive, we shall ascertain if it complies with Community law and if it adopts the measures needed in each case.
Â Â  â Commissioner, if we assume that Greece, our common homeland, had applied the Community directive which we are discussing on time, even after the extension which it was granted in 2002, thousands of people would have ensured their contracts were converted to open-ended contracts under the provisions of the presidential decree to which you refer.
My question is this: Why should thousands of workers exposed to abuse by employers, be they public- or private-sector employers, pay for this two-year delay by the Greek authorities?
Â Â  . Of course, the question is more an internal question relating to Greece and its various governments and departments but, as MrÂ Papadimoulis has specifically touched on a provision relating to the question of active contracts, because that is the meaning of the previous phrase, I should like to say that, first, this specific provision in the presidential decree â and I am talking about now, I am not referring to what happened in 2002 â does not infringe the directive, given that no obligation to convert contracts to open-ended contracts derives from it.
The conversion terms for which provision is made in the presidential decree come within the jurisdiction of the Greek Government and any disputes which arise from the application of these terms may be resolved before the Greek courts.
The term whereby there must be an active contract for these people to whom you refer, and who were not recruited during the period in which the directive had not been transposed into Greek law, relates to the mechanism for converting contracts to open-ended contracts.
The Commission does not therefore have jurisdiction to take measures to abolish this term, in that no such obligation to convert contracts derives from the directive.
As Mr Papadimoulis correctly observed, the Commission raised questions in the past concerning the measures taken by the Greek Government in order to prevent abuse from the use of fixed-term contracts during the delay in transposing the directive into national law.
The question to the Commission concerned the previous presidential decree which, on the one hand, was late in transposing the directive and, on the other hand, transposed it incorrectly.
Had this situation not been corrected in the meantime under the new presidential decree, the Commission would in theory have been able to institute the proceedings for which provision is made in articles 226 and 228, the purpose of which is to proclaim that the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and to force it to comply.
In addition, as Mr Papadimoulis referred to civil rights, the Commission could in fact take action against the Member State in the event of damage caused by late and incorrect transposition of a directive.
The relevant case law exists for such action.
In this way, citizens are protected from damage which they might sustain as a result of culpable and illegal delay in the transposition of a directive by a Member State, in which case the national courts have jurisdiction and may rule on compensation provided that, first, the Member State has engaged in illegal, infringing conduct, such as the delayed or incorrect transposition of a directive into national law and, secondly, there is a link of cause and effect between the Member State's conduct and the damage sustained.
As far as the case under discussion is concerned, given that the new presidential decree does not appear to contradict the directive and, subject to completion of the Commission's process of examination, there are no measures which could be taken against Greece.
Â Â  . The deadline for the transposition of Council Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin was 19 July 2003, and the deadline for Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation was December 2003 with the possibility of an additional three years to transpose the provisions on age and disability discrimination.
For the new Member States, the deadline for the transposition of both directives was 1 May 2004.
In its role as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission has launched infringement proceedings against Member States which have failed to transpose the race discrimination and employment framework directives into national law by the abovementioned deadlines.
Five Member States have been referred to the European Court of Justice for their failure to transpose the racial equality directive into national law.
For those Member States which have already transposed the directives, the Commission is currently examining in detail the national legislation to check that it accurately reflects the requirements of the directives.
Should this not be the case, the Commission will take the appropriate measures.
Â Â  I want to commend the Commissioner and his predecessor for the seriousness with which they have taken enforcement action on these directives.
However, given the sheer number of European citizens affected by these directives concerning age, disability, race, sexual orientation and religion - this is not about minorities - does he find it surprising that there is such a contrast between the speed with which the Commission and this Parliament pushed through this legislation and the way that the Council and six Member States in particular have treated these directives in their failure to implement them?
Â Â  . There are five Member States which have either transposed only certain parts of the directives or have failed to transpose them in full conformity.
For these Member States, as I said earlier, the Commission was quick to initiate infringement procedures.
In the case of the employment framework directive, a reasoned opinion - which is the second phase of the infringement procedure - was sent in July 2004 and we are expecting an answer within two months.
If no reply is forthcoming, the matter will be immediately referred to the European Court of Justice.
We will use all the enforcement measures at our disposal in order to persuade these Member States to move ahead with these very important directives.
Â Â  As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 35 to 58 will be replied to in writing.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the humanitarian situation in Sudan.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, let me start by saying that the situation in Sudan continues to be a matter of grave concern for the international community.
Reports on atrocities indicate the Government of Sudan's inability â and possibly unwillingness â to take the required measures.
The world is gradually losing its patience with a government that appears reluctant to assume full responsibility for all its citizens.
This applies to Darfur as well as to the North-South process.
The EU remains firmly committed to assisting Sudan to return to peace and stability as a matter of urgency.
Sudan should as soon as possible become a country in which all citizens are free and safe, not dominated by violence and discrimination.
The government in Khartoum should be a true government for all Sudanese and assume full responsibility for the well-being of all its citizens.
A stable and democratic Sudan is also a requirement for peace and stability in the region as a whole.
The continued tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the problems in Somalia, the war in northern Uganda and further afield, and the ongoing crisis in the Great Lakes area are all indications of instability on the African continent.
Peace in Sudan would create promising prospects for peace in the wider region.
The EU should be ready to support and engage in the Darfur conflict.
In this respect, we welcome the active role of the African Union in the Sudan crisis.
As much as is possible and realistic, the ownership of the solution to the Darfur crisis should rest with Africa itself.
Therefore, the EU's support and engagement should, in the first instance, be through coordinating its policies with the African Union.
Furthermore, the European Union should align and coordinate with other important players, such as the United Nations, the United States and other international parties, including the Arab League.
Against this background, the EU's policy on Sudan is focused as follows.
First of all, support to the African Union mission in Darfur.
Second, support for the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Pronk. Third, pressure on the government and the SPLM to conclude the Naivasha peace process.
Fourth, pressure on the Government and the SLM and the JEM to conclude the Abuja peace process.
Fifth, coordinating policies and actions with the other international actors.
Sixth, provision of humanitarian assistance.
Finally, active consideration of further measures to increase the pressure on the parties, including sanctions.
Support for the African Union constitutes a simple element to the EU's Darfur policy.
The Dafur crisis has shown that the African Union is prepared to provide leadership in meeting Africa's challenges.
The EU is fully behind the African Union.
A strong and able African Union is crucial for Africa's future.
This applies in particular to conflict prevention, management and a solution of the Darfur issue.
The African Union has taken two major initiatives. First of all, it has fielded the ceasefire commission which is monitoring the N'Djamena agreement and developments in Darfur and second, it has initiated negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the rebel movements.
The AU mission is currently staffed by 125 monitors, including monitors from the EU and the United States, and has completed approximately 20Â investigations into ceasefire violations.
The AU monitoring staff is supported by a protection force of 305, made up of Rwandan and Nigerian troops.
At the request of the African Union, the United Nations has prepared a comprehensive plan on how best to enhance the effectiveness of the AU mission on the ground.
The plan envisages an enlarged AU mission to Darfur, with increased numbers of military observers, increased military personnel in the protection force, in the civilian police and civilian support staff.
More staff will also be deployed at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa.
Depending on how these plans are further elaborated, the EU will consider supporting an enhanced AU mission in Darfur.
In Abuja, the Government of Sudan and the rebels have agreed on a humanitarian protocol and a new round of discussions on the security protocol is also envisaged.
The European Union has been represented during the first round of negotiations and urges both the government and the rebels to resume the talks with great urgency.
Together with the African Union, the United Nations is an important player in resolving the crisis in Darfur.
Secretary-General Annan visited Sudan in July.
He reached an agreement with the Government of Sudan on a series of benchmarks laid down in the communiquÃ© of 3 July.
These benchmarks serve as a basis for the work of the Joint Implementation Mechanism, which is co-chaired by Special Representative Jan Pronk and the Sudanese Foreign Minister Ismail.
On 6 August, Mr Pronk reached an agreement with the Sudanese Government on a plan of action.
The EU supports the action plan but sees Resolution 1556 as the main framework to maintain pressure on the Government of Sudan.
I believe that the message to the Sudanese authorities should be consistent and straightforward. The more so since in his report to the Security Council of 2 September, Special Representative Pronk acknowledged progress in safety in camps and in humanitarian access, but stressed that the situation in Darfur continues to be very serious.
Recent evidence of continued killings of villagers in Darfur in attacks by armed forces and the Janjaweed illustrates how serious the situation remains.
Since the presentation by Mr Pronk to the Security Council on 2 September, there have been ongoing discussions on a new Security Council resolution.
The European Union is in favour of a strong resolution to maintain pressure on the parties in the Sudan.
At the meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, we discussed preliminary options for sanctions.
For the moment, the threat of sanctions is probably the best means to press the Government of Sudan to comply with its commitments.
The United States supports this line also.
In a public hearing in the Senate, Secretary of State Powell announced support for the expansion of the AU mission and for the idea of curbing Sudanese military flights over Darfur, and raised the possibility of introducing sanctions.
At the same time, he urged the Government of Sudan and the SPLM, as well as the SLM and the JEM, to intensify efforts to conclude negotiations.
This coincides with the EU point of view, as stated in our conclusions last Monday.
Finally, a word on humanitarian assistance and the way forward.
While access for humanitarian assistance has improved, the humanitarian situation is still critical.
Violence may have decreased but the notorious Janjaweed and militia remain active.
The security situation is absolutely unsatisfactory and an important indicator for this is that hardly any of the IDPs and refugees are returning to their homes.
We once more urgently call on the Government of Sudan to curb the violence, disarm and bring the Janjaweed to justice, and guarantee the safety of civilians outside the camps.
The EU is an important contributor to humanitarian assistance and so far has provided EUR 288 million.
Much more is needed and, as Special Representative Pronk indicated in his report, only 50% of the funding requirements of the United Nations response to the Darfur crisis has been met, leaving a funding shortfall of USD 255 million for the Darfur crisis alone.
The EU should also make a major contribution to this shortfall.
In the meantime, we should prepare for reconstruction in Darfur to be started as soon as the crisis has ended and a comprehensive peace agreement has been signed between North and South.
Finally, the way forward.
The international community should continue to press for an early political solution to the conflicts that are destroying Sudan. Pressure on the parties to continue both the Naivasha and Abuja processes, support for the AU and the United Nations, humanitarian assistance and the preparedness to apply further measures, including sanctions, are key elements in the EU policy on Sudan.
The EU is committed to helping to bring peace and stability to Sudan.
The EU works shoulder-to-shoulder with the African Union and the United Nations, but will take its own responsibility based on the Council's conclusions of 12 and 26 July, and of 13Â September.
Peace in the Sudan is of enormous national significance but it will also have a crucial influence on peace in the region, as I have said.
Peace in the Sudan is therefore a central objective of our African policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to address the crisis which has developed in Darfur and for the interest shown by Parliament and the Committee on Development in making this its first mission of this new parliamentary term.
The mission has returned with a clear picture of a complex situation and has expressed indignation at the terrible events which continue to unfold in Darfur.
The Commission had been actively engaged in delivering humanitarian aid to the western part of Sudan before this crisis became what it has.
Things are so terrible now that we have mobilised to date EUR 105 m. This has mostly been spent on basic humanitarian food aid, but we are also trying to support the political process.
This amount corresponds to some 37% of what the EU as a whole has contributed.
Normally, the Commission's share of support in these humanitarian crises is about 20% of what Member States give in total.
I would add here that we see quite a spread when we compare what different Member States have contributed.
I mention this because I find the qualitative value of what the EU as a whole is doing in a given situation is related not only to what the Commission is doing or the total amount of what we do, but also to the genuine character of commitment across Europe as a whole in support of our activity.
We are also directing money and effort to the situation in Chad, by providing shelter for an estimated 200 000 refuges from Darfur.
In mobilising aid we have been facing persistent administrative blockages from the Government of Sudan and major logistical problems resulting in substantial additional costs.
More than 25% of the costs of this operation relates to the logistical problems.
The administrative problems are progressively being solved, in my view thanks to a large extent to the international community's pressure on the Sudanese Government.
As to logistics, ECHO is opening a technical antenna in Darfur and another in Chad to improve coordination in the field.
They will be operational by the end of this month and we are planning for an initial period of 12 months.
However, there is still a lot more to do.
It is estimated that about 40% of the affected population still has no access to humanitarian aid and, in spite of improvement in some areas, violence, including systematic rape of women, is still being reported.
I am aware that the mission has returned with accounts of terrible violence and great fear.
It is important for the international community to remain mobilised, as the humanitarian needs will continue for another year, even in the best-case scenario.
As we have seen, the effects of these crises continue to be felt and we must organise ourselves to handle them better in future.
In parallel to humanitarian aid, the EU has been very active in the political sphere.
We have mobilised for the first time the EDF-funded African Peace Facility, providing the bigger part of the budget of the mission of the African Union. This has allowed a rapid response from the African Union Peace and Security Council via a decision taken at its first official meeting and following the humanitarian ceasefire agreement in N'Djamena.
It has sent some 150 observers and a 300 strong military protection force to monitor the ceasefire.
In spite of the limited scale of this operation, results in the field have been positive.
I firmly believe that only an African Union initiative will have the political weight and relevance to oblige the belligerents, and in particular the Government of Sudan, to comply with their commitments.
This does not mean that others should not and cannot play a very important role.
Partnership and ownership are not incompatible, especially when the partnership is carried out in a professional manner, reflecting the sound principle that visibility is fine but feasibility is better.
It is clear that some of the existing weakness of the organisation experienced by the African Union could, and should, be addressed by an enhanced partnership with the United Nations and with the EU as such, including our Member States.
However, I appreciate, as the presidency has also today clearly stated, that the African Union has to be in the driving seat.
They have to initiate and drive this mission.
In this respect the Commission is ready, in liaison with the Member States and if the AU so requests to envisage additional support through the peace facility to a well-planned extension of the AU mission in Darfur.
The most urgent objective is clearly to ensure maximum protection for the civilian population.
The whole problem of whether or not to return, and what to return to, essentially depends on people's feeling of security in that situation.
We have to be ready to discus with the parties in appropriate fora a possible amendment of the current mandate of the AU mission, if the Government of Sudan is unwilling or unable to effectively protect the population of Darfur.
This is a must.
It is also important to note that we are facing a real conflict. There is more to this than some disorganised violence.
There is not only the problem concerning the Government of Sudan, there are rebel groups fighting for their agendas they do exist.
For that reason, all this has to be dealt with through a serious effort to mediate, putting pressure on all the parties.
It is also important to emphasise that a sustainable political solution for Darfur necessarily has to be articulated and worked out in parallel with and in relation to the global Naivasha process.
A solution for Darfur alone will not solve the wider problem.
In fact the problem in Darfur did not come out of the blue, it was a result of the problems in Sudan.
A measure of political agreement has been reached in Abuja and that is a good start, but we have to support all forces working to push this in the right direction and at the same time focus on the enormous task of improving the humanitarian situation in the field.
Â Â  Mr President, I was a member of a fact-finding mission of the European Parliament to Darfur.
My conclusions are as follows: the security situation there is alarming; the political situation has not changed; the Sudanese Government is not willing to take any steps beyond those forced upon it by international political will; the humanitarian situation has improved only slightly.
I am very sorry to state here that only a very short time after 9/11 we have tens of thousands of very poor people living in camps.
There is no future for them, nor any way back.
Fifty per cent of the population in the camps is under 15 years of age, so we are creating a new generation of deprived people who can only take up Kalashnikovs and become new fundamentalists and new extremists.
We have to be very precise in the measures that we take to ensure our individual and common security.
What are the points to be discussed?
The first is the ethnic context.
We have seen that there are no Arabs in the camps.
Ninety per cent of those to whom we have spoken do not have Arabic as their mother tongue.
In Arabic they are called âSudaâ, the black population.
There is massive sexual violence.
One sheikh told us that they have to send women out of the camps for food and water because they at least come back, whereas if they send men, they are killed.
There is mass killing and a mass expulsion of the population from its camps. This should be stopped immediately.
The situation is even more alarming in security terms than in humanitarian terms.
With regard to humanitarian aid, it reaches up to 60% of IDPs in the camps.
The situation has improved because the Sudanese Government allows NGOs and certain humanitarian organisations to reach the territories under its control.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say at the very outset that everything I saw in Darfur confirmed the view that what we are seeing there is a genocide.
The evidence and the testimonies that we took from the people we spoke to all referred to collaboration between the Janjaweed and the Government of Sudan.
What the people talked about was coordinated violence against them.
It was not random violence, it was coordinated by the Janjaweed with the assistance and collusion of the Government of Sudan.
We heard of decapitation, burning, brutality, terror and awful suffering from the people that we spoke to.
It was only in 1994, when I was in Rwanda, that I ever saw the degree of terror in people's eyes that I saw in those camps in Darfur and in Chad.
We need to see an effective global arms embargo, an international commission of inquiry; we need targeted sanctions against those, both in government and business, who have been connected with these atrocities and I believe that there should be an oil embargo.
320Â 000 barrels of oil are produced each day but the benefits of those barrels of oil never reach the people of Sudan.
To both the Commission and the Council I would say that in Al Fasha the African Union expressed no enthusiasm for an increased protection force.
They had little coordination with the United Nations or discussion on the plan of action.
They called for more monitors and for an international policing and human rights monitoring force.
They said they were not able to deal with the current challenges they faced, never mind having to deal with a substantially increased force.
They were very clear and very adamant on that.
To both the Commission and Council I would also say that the plan of action agreed by the UN is leading to the Government of Sudan now deploying forces towards the safe areas, into the rebel areas, and causing immense instability and difficulty.
They are contravening the no-fly zone.
When we landed in Al Fasha, an attack helicopter was hovering overhead.
On our visit to one village, we saw the rockets that had been fired at the people, destroying the village and sending the people scattering into the bush.
We want to hear no more of 'never again' from anyone in the international community.
We have to challenge the Government of Sudan and stop its relentless Orwellian denial of what is happening in its country.
The pattern of violence must stop.
Â Â  Mr President, I was a member of last week's delegation to Darfur and I want to focus on the humanitarian situation there.
As a result of brutal attacks by the government of Sudan and its allied militia, a quarter of the population of Darfur had fled their homes in terror.
Two hundred thousand had crossed over the border into Chad and 1Â 200Â 000 are internally displaced within Sudan.
Humanitarian access has improved as the Council stated but we were told that one in three is still cut off from assistance because of the rains and the lack of capacity, and because of ongoing clashes between government and rebel forces. This adds up to a situation of enormous fragility.
All displaced persons need access to humanitarian aid and they will need it for at least another 18 months because they have not been able to grow crops this year.
The worst possible scenario would be for humanitarian assistance to be cut off by renewed fighting or political obstacles. That would leave 1.2Â million people facing starvation.
When the delegation visited Darfur, all the people we spoke to in the camps told us the same thing: they wished to return to their homes but they were terrified of further attacks.
There will be no end to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur until people feel safe to return home.
That will only happen if there are no more violations of the ceasefire, and if there is a comprehensive political solution to the conflict.
I should like to make a plea that in our discussions we do not get too bogged down on issues such as whether this is or is not genocide in Darfur.
Let us concentrate on the actions that this Parliament can take to support the African Union ceasefire monitors and the peace negotiations.
If we fail to be practical in this crisis, then we will let down more than one million Sudanese people who are dependent upon us for their survival.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we naturally share Parliamentâs stated desire to come to the aid of the civilian communities of Darfur and to put an end to a civil war that has been appalling from both a humanitarian as well as a political perspective, and to do so, as has already been mentioned, with the support, for example, of the African Unionâs initiatives. While it is useful and essential, however, to be a good fire-fighter, I feel that it is even more essential for us not to lapse into starting fires of our own.
I should therefore like to address the subject of access to oil resources, which is becoming increasingly difficult and beset by conflict. It is an issue that has, to terrible effect, been fanning the flames of the situation in Darfur for a number of years.
It is a familiar scenario: tensions and wars intensify as access to oil resources becomes a source of conflict and a major issue both for a number of international powers and for the local powers.
Not only are the USA and Europe â particularly France, which has a major influence in the region â implicated in this situation, but so are China and a number of Asian countries.
We are also all aware of the scandal of the misuse of oil revenue, which often serves only to fuel the personal enrichment, corruption and arms purchases that we see today, not to mention the worsening breaches of the human rights of the communities affected, all of this against a backdrop of successive dictatorships that are, in turn, sometimes supported more or less openly by the same people who are today expressing outrage at the situation.
Faced with this situation, I feel that the EU has major responsibilities and is duty bound, at world level and thus within the UN, to launch an entirely different energy policy, one that is fair, sustainable and genuinely intended to serve the citizens, and to do so with the help of politicians, oil companies and civil society.
We must also step up the fight against financial crime and against tax havens; we must block the financial accounts and the profits of dictators and profiteers of all kinds.
We must, of course, offer our solid support for alternative energy policies both at home and in countries such as these, and Europe must also be much more demanding and much more vigilant as regards the support offered by the major providers of international funds to certain oil projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline.
We must support civil society and the democrats in these countries and, in short, must be able to act diplomatically, politically and economically in a coherent fashion.
I feel that this could constitute an essential and even priority task for the future representative of a strong common foreign policy â a policy that we all wish very much to see.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the displaced persons camps in Sudan and the refugee camps in Chad our parliamentary delegation came across an extraordinary, woeful section of humanity: civilians, women, children, men, the new damned of the earth, fleeing from violence and death and living in fear of being attacked and of having to flee yet again.
They want to go back to their villages, hundreds of which have been destroyed, but they want to go back in safety.
They are therefore asking the international community for a greater presence.
They do not trust the Sudanese Government and are calling for justice to be done and for the crimes against them not to go unpunished.
We are facing an immense tragedy â a million displaced persons, 200Â 000 refugees, 30Â 000 dead â faced with which the international community intervened very late in calling for a cease-fire and the opening of peace negotiations.
In the camps we visited we did not see anyone dying of starvation.
Emergency aid has arrived except in the rebel-held areas, which the humanitarian aid convoys cannot reach because of the rains, which is why there is no complete check on the conditions there.
Even in the areas that the war has not touched, however, we saw immense poverty.
Many Sudanese or Chadian citizens are registering as displaced persons or refugees in order to get food and medical care.
Indeed, the Darfur democratic opposition groups that we met, whether they were African or Afro-Arab communities, agreed that the armed conflict begun by the SLA or JEM forces was rooted in underdevelopment and a policy aimed at marginalising the region, specifically the African communities.
The danger that violence might break out again is always present.
If the causes are not removed, it may not just be Darfur that explodes.
I therefore think it is essential for the European Union to push for positive results from the Abuja negotiations.
We must put pressure on the Sudanese Government and the SLA or JEM forces to observe the cease-fire and, as you yourself said, we must cooperate especially in strengthening the presence of African Union forces and human rights observers.
We must also help those parts of civil society that uphold human and social rights to put across their message more strongly.
I also believe it is vital to take the Naivasha agreements forward and to support them.
As many people in Sudan told us, the only possible solution is a political one; it cannot be by military means.
That is why I believe a strict arms embargo needs to be imposed on Sudan not only by the European Union but also by the United Nations, just as strong pressure also needs to be put on Eritrea or anyone who sells arms to the rebels.
These are difficult times, because war and terrorism are destroying our lives.
I believe we have to act wisely and with determination so that the people of Sudan can move on towards development and justice.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, a humanitarian disaster on an almost unimaginable scale is taking place right now in Sudan.
According to the UNâs international organisation, WHO, approximately 10Â 000 people are dying every month in the refugee camps in Darfur in Western Sudan.
Most of these are children.
The surrounding world is aware of what is happening in Sudan but, in spite of this, is powerless to act faced with this humanitarian tragedy.
We agree that the surrounding world must act immediately.
The issue is, however, that of how the conflict is best to be resolved.
It is important to bear two principles in mind.
Firstly, that of broad international support and, secondly, that of respect for international law.
Intervention in Sudan must be based on a UN mandate, affording the greatest possible international support.
The UN should act in cooperation with the African Union.
The action would thus have the support of the African countries, which would facilitate a lasting solution.
One UN organisation that could be used is, for example, the multinational force, SHIRBRIG.
This intervention force was one of the UN actors in the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Military intervention by the EU would be in danger of making it more difficult to conduct a successful UN intervention.
The plans for an EU intervention in the Sudan conflict also give the impression of being a springboard for the creation of an EU army able to act without a UN mandate.
The EU Constitution makes it possible for the EU to intervene in conflicts without UN support.
This would be in danger of weakening international law.
Action within the framework of the UN is the best prior condition for creating broad international support for resolving the conflict.
In that way, the intervention would also take place within the framework of international law.
The solution to the conflict would thus be more legitimate and more sustainable.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
Â Â  Mr President, the Sudanese Government has failed to carry out its serious international obligation under UN Security Council Resolution 1556 of last July.
This is the opinion of many international human rights organisations, including International Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
It appears that many camps in the western region of Darfur in Sudan are still in control of both the Janjaweed armed militia and the Sudanese Government.
That is simply an intolerable situation.
The agencies must be given free and unencumbered access to these camps.
That is not the case at the moment.
Many aid agencies are working in very difficult situations.
This too is the view of members of the Committee on Development who recently travelled to the Darfur region on a fact-finding mission on behalf of the European Parliament.
We heard this afternoon from many of those who were on that mission.
I congratulate them for undertaking it and for bringing their reports back.
I look forward to the next meeting of the committee.
I am sure we will hear in more detail about what they heard and saw.
I believe that one of the best ways forward is to engage more African Union troops to act as peace-keepers in the Darfur region. That would also help to ensure that we could put in place an African solution to an African problem.
Up until now we have not been able to achieve this because there are not enough African Union troops on the ground who could enforce a ceasefire.
The Sudanese Government has, for the most part, imposed stalling tactics, which has resulted in the small numbers of African Union peace-keepers being denied access to all regions around Darfur.
The Sudanese Government has said that there are enormous difficulties and that it needs more time; but as one of the earlier speakers said, is the government unable to carry out what we have asked it to do, or is it reluctant?
The more one listens to people - whether it is aid agencies or members of our Committee on Development or other groups - who have been out there and have seen first hand what is going on, one has to say that there is a total lack of commitment to do anything about the violence that is happening on the ground.
I support the strong role that the European Union has played in providing humanitarian aid to the people of Sudan.
Its value is in excess of EURÂ 400Â million this year.
The European Union will continue to be the largest donor of international aid to Sudan for some time to come.
The Sudanese Government must now realise the clear challenge that it faces.
It must fully meet its international responsibilities and its responsibilities to its own people, or face further international condemnation in the form of sanctions.
The European Union, together with the United Nations, should seriously consider imposing a global arms embargo on Sudan.
This would play a constructive role in helping to cut off military supplies to both the Sudanese Government and the Janjaweed armed militia.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President.
I shall try to make good use of the time.
I should like to thank the Minister for also coming to the Committee on Foreign Affairs to tell us about the steps about to be taken to help in this situation.
After listening to all this, I shall anxiously await next weekâs Security Council decision and the decision of the UN plenary session with respect to this situation, so that the European Union will then also be able to make its own independent decisions as regards its own further measures.
I believe that the horrors of which we have heard cannot be resolved by simply increasing the aid resources allocated to these people in order to provide for their basic needs for survival, but that there is a real need to attempt to settle these matters through economic pressure on the government.
A joint approach by all the organisations which might be able to help here involves treaties with the African Union or the UN and also with the United States.
I shall keep my fingers crossed that a decision will be taken as soon as possible on behalf of these unfortunate people.
Â Â  Mr President, in Darfur genocide has unfolded before our eyes.
It demands immediate action.
It is the world's largest current humanitarian crisis. It has led to the displacement of 1.4 million people inside Sudan, over 200 000 people into neighbouring Chad and the number of civilian deaths has risen to almost 50 000.
The government in Khartoum has armed the militia group, the Janjaweed, to attack the non-Arab-speaking civilian population and supported them with rocket attacks by helicopter, Antonov and MiG planes.
The bombardment of villagers and systematic rape have terrorised the population and caused a serious humanitarian crisis which will escalate with the arrival of the rainy season.
The international community has accepted that genocide is now being committed and this brings into place a whole new series of legislative measures for us, including activating the United Nations Security Council to authorise the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to Sudan to arrest and punish the perpetrators of these terrible war crimes, whether or not Sudan fails to exercise its sovereign jurisdiction or sign the Rome Statute.
Despite humanitarian aid, refugee camps are currently witnessing around 100 000 deaths per month due to dysentery and the atmosphere of insecurity.
The crisis could lead to a further genocide.
We must show that this is not Rwanda, that we now know how to react to this type of crisis in order to save human lives as we demonstrated in Congo.
Every day the situation worsens.
For this reason, we must pressurise the Sudanese Government to honour its commitment made on 3 July to enable the flow of humanitarian aid.
Khartoum also needs to accept the deployment of international observers from the African Union and the European Union.
The cease-fire agreement should be respected.
Military aircraft should be grounded in Darfur and the disarmament process of the militia speeded up.
The UN should impose a global arms embargo on Sudan.
The government, Chad, Libya and the Central African Republic should rigidly control the trade in small arms in the region and the African Union should establish an international police force.
We must finally act to put an end to this situation.
Â Â  Mr President, the Darfur humanitarian crisis has political origins.
The people of Darfur have been involved in an uprising, not for separatist claims, but against the under-development and political and economic marginalisation to which they have been subjected by Khartoum, which has been fomenting inter-ethnic conflict since the 1980s.
We are not dealing with a government that is reluctant to carry out its responsibilities, but with a dictatorial government that spends over half of the State budget on âMigsâ and other military supplies, and does not invest the profits from oil in helping the Sudanese people.
It is a regime that is accustomed to living with sanctions, adept at exploiting the rivalries within the international community and capable of mobilising countries to which it sells oil or from which it purchases arms, such as China and Pakistan, under the protection of the Security Council.
It is a government that realises that there is no political will, when permanent members of the Security Council use words like genocide to describe what is happening in Darfur and do not act immediately with adequate resources to stop it with anything more than words.
The Sudanese Government is therefore only partly meeting its obligations under Resolution 1556, but has not met the key obligation, which is to put an end to the war that it is waging on its people in Darfur.
The African Union is undertaking a mission that is worthy of the European Unionâs praise and support.
More must be done as regards logistical and military capability; more needs to be done to assist coordination between the African Union and the United Nations; more needs to be done in terms of the rapid support provided to the humanitarian organisations and to the humanitarian agencies on the ground.
It is essential that we increase the international presence on the ground, with both African Union ceasefire monitors and peace-keeping forces, and the humanitarian agencies, human rights monitors and an international police force.
There must also be a clear mandate from the Security Council to protect the civil population at risk.
This is what all of the refugees and displaced persons with whom Parliamentâs mission spoke asked us to do.
EU governments both inside and outside the Security Council have a particular responsibility to deliver a coherent message to the Sudanese Government, which, at its core, is weak, ridden with rivalries, dictatorial and corrupt.
If Parliament and European governments think that the situation âamounts to genocideâ, then the very least that they can do is recommend an arms embargo and an oil embargo.
This is the only language that the Sudanese Government understands.
The EU and the entire international community must demand that the ceasefire be enforced and must demand that the present agreement be extended to all regions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are reacting to a crisis that was sparked off and exploded in March 2003.
We are in September 2004, and this delayed reaction is not due to the fact that we did not know.
Let us just think of how few doors we have knocked on in all these months.
We have reacted late because of a political calculation that proved to be wrong, which was to focus everything on the Naivasha process, and therefore Khartoum thought it had to intervene elsewhere.
I am merely trying to draw attention to the fact that major tensions are exploding in eastern Sudan, and I should not like us to react in a yearâs time once it has turned into an inextricable crisis.
It is a complex problem which, in my opinion, should be tackled as a whole.
In conclusion, with regard to security, there is the problem of a real atmosphere of impunity.
I should like to remind the Presidency and the Commission of the existence of an instrument, namely the International Criminal Court and in particular Article 7 of the Statute, on the basis of which the Security Council can ask the Prosecutor to initiate an investigation.
I mention this because, alongside the Commission on Human Rights, this is an instrument on which Europe has worked so hard that I believe it can and must be brought into play in this particular crisis.
Â Â  Mr President, we have in fact known about the tension in Sudan for many years, not just one year.
Once again we are witnessing a humanitarian drama which, in truth, disguises a political drama.
It is this drama which must be dealt with: a humanitarian emergency, which could be even worse, is yet to come.
According to the calculations of many NGOs, between 100Â 000 and 350Â 000 people may die as a result of a generalised famine.
We must therefore take quick measures and I am therefore also happy that both the Council and the Commission are taking measures in this regard.
We must continue with humanitarian aid, we must put pressure on the government of Khartoum to disarm the militias and if this means sanctions are needed, they must be imposed.
The number of international observers must also be increased, and they must specifically be African.
I would like to draw attention to the importance of emphasising the need to deal with the causes, of political origin, which relate to the poverty of the country, which relate to having allowed the authoritarian regime in Khartoum to exist for many years and which furthermore have allowed, amongst other things, while we remained silent, European countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain and Cyprus to export arms to that country, violating the code of conduct on arms, and we must therefore meet the need to review this process and once again demand that the United Nations enforce a complete embargo in relation to this issue.
Â Â  Â Mr President, the President of the United States has described the violence in Sudan as genocide and he is undoubtedly not far from the truth.
The number of people killed in and around Darfur is currently estimated at 50Â 000, and more than a million people are on the run.
The Arab militiamen who are responsible for these atrocities are given free play by the Islamic Government, which has a crushing responsibility for the events that are now unfolding.
According to MrÂ Pronk, the UN special envoy in Sudan, the Sudanese Government is cooperating in good faith, but, and I quote âthe agreements on the ground are not yet applied in Darfurâ.
The question is what should actually happen in order for there to be clear condemnation of the Islamic regime in Sudan.
The Commission is similarly grappling with this politically correct diffidence.
So far, the Council and the Commission have been extremely reserved, not to mention lukewarm, in their reactions to the events in Sudan.
It is therefore time that bold sanctions were taken, such as for example an oil embargo, together with all other necessary measures, in order to put a stop to the violence in Sudan.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a humanitarian disaster of alarming dimensions is taking place before our very eyes in Sudanâs western province of Darfur.
Although I have not been a member of the committee, and do not have relevant experience in this area, one thing that has become clear to me so far from this debate is that the crisis is following the same pattern as all such crises.
We react too late and not forcefully or coherently enough.
This makes it possible for genocide to continue unpunished, and for a government which bears responsibility for this ongoing massacre simply not to take us seriously.
Even if there could be no question of conflict prevention, it is still essential for damage limitation to take place at least now, and for international pressure to be stepped up by the coordinated action of the EU, the USA, the UN and the OAU, so that a stop is put to this genocide.
The deployment of more African Union troops should be made possible, the International Court of Justice should be able to take action, and, above all, I believe that we should not only toy with the idea of sanctions, but come to see them as a genuine alternative.
This means sanctions of any kind, which will force the Khartoum Government to abandon the cynicism which they show in their dealings with us.
Â Â  Â Mr President, 50Â 000 have been killed in the last 18 months, there are a million refugees and the Government in Sudan, a dictatorship dating back to 1989, is still in government.
A government which nods diplomatically in agreement with the international community and politely listens to its requests, but meanwhile accepts the Janjaweed militiamen in its own army, while the killing and raping continues as before.
It is apparent that this government is prepared to conclude real peace agreements only if there is a real threat, and the willingness to realise this threat is being illustrated.
In southern Sudan, we saw that the oil boycott threat worked with this government.
Last week in the European Parliament, Mrs Van Ardenne stated that she considers the oil boycott as one of the measures to put the government under pressure.
In the Security Council, Europe, together with the African Union and the United States, must continually and unanimously press home that either the Sudanese Government must observe the agreements with Kofi Annan or else that a specific oil boycott will be introduced which is irrevocably proclaimed via the Security Council.
The question that many are left with is: will these remain just words, and does the Sudanese Government meanwhile have little to fear, or are we prepared to actually see this matter through via the Security Council?
I truly hope that there is strength in unity in this respect.
Â Â  Mr President, almost undoubtedly the Darfur humanitarian crisis is the worst in the world today, with approximately 1.4 million people displaced, many to camps in Chad, and an estimated 50 000 killed, and, according to WHO estimates, 10 000 dying monthly from disease and violence.
The USA is now accusing the Khartoum Government of genocide by its proxy Janjaweed Arab militiamen against African local tribes, who rose up in February 2003 against the government.
The government is said to be dominated by only two ethnic Arab tribes, who have excluded the Sudanese Africans from power and the sharing of Sudan's oil wealth.
This a complex dispute, with the Justice and Equality Movement through its 'Black Book', circulated in Khartoum last year, calling for more democracy but from a radical Islamist perspective.
The hands of Dr al-Turabi seem to be at work in Darfur, settling scores against President Bashir, responsible for expelling Osama Bin Laden from Sudan in 1996.
It must also be said that the rebels have been brutal in their attacks on Sudanese Government workers, in particular policemen.
The UN has now promised a review and Washington is calling for a UN commission of inquiry and for consideration of trade sanctions, including arms and an oil embargo.
The EU will probably follow suit.
Understandably, no one in the EU wants direct military intervention, but only supports the continued presence of African Union troops as monitors and possibly as peacekeepers.
The UN and EU sanctions may be very difficult to enforce in such a vast country as Sudan, especially with the recent large investments in the oil sector by China and India, which would be negatively affected.
Recent reports of the Janjaweed, who have razed 405 villages to the ground and continue to wreak havoc, including the systematic raping of women, claim they have been disgracefully integrated into Sudan's military.
Something must be done, as Sudan is just emerging from the long civil war in the south.
However, with the lessons of Iraq in mind, no western power, to my mind, will contemplate military intervention.
I call upon the African Union to show the world what it can do.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the figures and numbers that Mrs HybaÅ¡kovÃ¡ and Mrs Morgantini have given us need no comment but just deserve our absolute respect.
I shall be more cautious in seeing the shadow of al-Qaeda behind every conflict that breaks out on this earth.
I am not particularly interested in President Bushâs definition of genocide or in deciding on a point of law as to whether we are dealing with genocide in this case.
I am much more interested, as other Members have said, in what we can do and what we must not do.
What we certainly can do is envisage direct, rigorous sanctions, such as an arms embargo or an appeal to the International Criminal Court, as Mrs Bonino has suggested, in order to seek a political solution.
Of course, we must at all costs avoid creating the preconditions for a military intervention, even though it would be justified on humanitarian grounds.
Mr President, we are all aware that the history of recent years, from Bosnia to Iraq, has been that of the arbitrary and often counterproductive use of force to resolve crises.
That is an option to be avoided, most of all because we would risk turning this region into a never-ending war zone.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I personally am not inclined to use the word genocide too freely.
Nevertheless, the situation in Sudan is extremely serious and requires a radical change in the European Unionâs position.
It is not enough to provide aid, but the populations need to be able to have access to it in complete safety.
It would therefore be helpful if Parliament took a harder line in condemning the actions of the Sudanese Government, which is continuing to arm militias with the aim of terrorising the civilian population of Darfur.
The Sudanese Government is cunningly playing for time in order to gain a unilateral advantage, while also benefiting from the difficult international situation that sees the supranational institutions and the whole of public opinion concentrating on the fight against global terrorism.
Parliament therefore needs to pass a new resolution, which must include a demand for a total arms embargo as well as selective sanctions that can put pressure on the government and the armed forces without hurting the civilian population.
From now on the Sudanese Government needs to feel the eyes of the world upon it every day.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Union and the Council of Ministers are deeply conscious of the worsening situation.
We are following the situation very closely and I share your concerns.
I have listened very carefully to the suggestions you have made and to your calls for action.
I also agree with those speakers who have stressed the fact that what we need is a political solution, not a military solution.
Military force would only lead to further bloodshed and we want to avoid that.
It is in that context that we believe that the African Union, which has taken the lead, should continue to be in the driver's seat.
At the same time, however, we see how important it is that a cohesive and coherent effort be undertaken so that the African Union, together with the United Nations, the European Union and the United States, exert increasing pressure on the Sudanese Government as we have done from the beginning - notably as the Dutch Government, but also as the European Union over these past months.
We will also continue to push the African Union to implement the suggestions that have been made by the United Nations.
I listed a number of possibilities: increase the number of observers, increase the military force supporting these observers, increase the civilian presence, send a police force even a European Union police force, if the African Union asks for one.
It is very important that we cooperate very closely and that the African Union tries to find an African solution to an African problem.
We must lend all the support we can muster.
I believe that we should follow a twin-track approach on the calls for action.
On the one hand, I share the feelings of all those who have said that continued, strong diplomatic pressure on the government of Sudan is an absolute requirement.
We have done this and will continue to do so in the context of the meetings we have.
For example, next week we have a meeting the United Nations.
I have also met with ministers: at the end of July I invited Minister Ismail to the Netherlands.
There was a strong exchange of words on the situation.
Promises were made, but as we have seen they were not kept.
That is why there should also be another track, and that track, as many of you have said, consists of sanctions.
The European Union is currently examining all the possibilities for imposing sanctions very carefully, but we think that sanctions should be effective.
They should really hit the government and they should also be all-encompassing, so, together with the Commission and the Council secretariat, we are drafting a comprehensive review of which sanctions are possible.
Among those sanctions, we are considering an oil boycott, an arms embargo and many other possibilities to make it crystal clear to the Sudanese Government that we mean business.
On the other hand as Commissioner Nielson mentioned we should not forget that humanitarian aid is of the essence.
If one talks to Mr Lubbers or Mr Pronk as I have recently it is very obvious that one aspect is the situation in respect of the Sudanese Government. The other aspect pertains to the humanitarian aid situation, which is terrible at the moment.
There too, the European Union is doing everything it can.
As far as Mrs Bonino's suggestion on the International Criminal Court is concerned, you will understand that I wholeheartedly agree with this.
The International Criminal Court with its seat in the Hague is something we endorse whenever we can.
However, we should not forget that what we need first, in the United Nations, is to discuss the situation on the basis of Mr Pronk's report.
Subsequently, the United Nations Security Council should make a request, and then we can act to initiate proceedings in the International Criminal Court.
I can only repeat that we are very concerned about the situation.
We take everything you have said into account and take it very seriously.
We are deeply aware of the suffering of the people there and of what has happened.
Whether you call it genocide or not, the situation is very serious.
We have to be willing to take action.
In the meantime, we are waiting for the outcome of the discussions that are to take place shortly in the United Nations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would warn against jumping into the terminology of genocide.
At the moment there is no authoritative evidence that this is the correct way of characterising the events in question.
This is an impossible discussion because, once the word is there, any attempt to clarify and analyse it is only seen as an attempt to cover what it looks or sounds like, an attempt to make it easy to understand.
This is very serious: rushing to use certain words, and acting and speaking as if these words are the actual facts, is not the way to clarify to the public that what we see is unacceptable and has to be stopped.
Taking that step and using certain terminology at this stage can be, in my opinion, problematic.
We need to establish the facts, and I expect this to happen.
There is a risk here that myself and others are seen to be taking this matter too lightly.
Even with that risk, I would like to make the point that in relation to the tradition of impunity in these matters, I find it important that the African Union has been encouraged to do something and is not sitting passively waiting for the government to comply.
The African Union is totally publicly committed to putting pressure on the government, and at the moment is making an effort to increase its engagement in Darfur, both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the mandate.
This needs to be supported.
It is a new experience for the so-called international community to be able to relate to and support something like this, which we have never encountered before in an African crisis.
We need to do more.
The UN's role is absolutely essential.
The commitment throughout Africa, via the African Union, to use the newly created Peace and Security Council has created a basis for the UN to act.
Without this there would have been little grounds for optimism.
Even that word is perhaps out of place in this instance.
What can we do to exert maximum pressure?
I still have not signed the country strategy paper for Sudan.
More than EURÂ 400Â million is available via unspent funds â which could not be used for normal development cooperation activities during the many years of fighting between north and south â and new money from the ninth EDF.
This large amount of money cannot be made available until we see a comprehensive peace agreement.
It is a political fact of life, which comes as no surprise anywhere not here and not in Khartoum that the situation in Darfur must be seen as part of any definition of peace in the country.
This pressure is a major element in our effort to push things in a better direction.
In the coming year we will face not only the demands relating to humanitarian aid, but we will also have to prepare to secure the livelihoods of the people whom we hope to assist in returning to their homes as soon as possible.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at noon. (2)
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission Statements on the seizure of hostages and massacre in Beslan and the fight against terrorism.
Â Â  . Mr President, last Saturday we commemorated the fact that the world suddenly changed three years ago.
In this presentation, I would first like to look back and explain the basis for our policy, then address the current situation in the fight against terrorism before going into the work programme of the Dutch presidency. I will end with a few words on cooperation with Russia.
Since 11 September 2001, it has become clear that terrorist attacks are closer to us than we wanted to believe.
It is a threat that we cannot neglect.
We have all seen the horrific terrorist attacks on television.
We are witnesses to these attacks and are also jointly responsible for ensuring that they do not happen again.
What we have seen, both outside the European Union â in Jakarta, Beslan, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East â and inside the European Union â in Madrid six months ago â requires action now and in the future.
Every attack poses new questions which require new answers and pose new challenges that we have to address jointly through concrete action.
We need to protect our citizens better.
We need to continue to look at our policy instruments in close cooperation with others.
There are no quick fixes for terrorism.
In the long battle against terrorism, two key words spring to mind: protection and cooperation, as well as the idea of protection through cooperation.
On protection, the European Union has done a lot in the last three years.
We have improved our legislation and widened our policy instruments.
We have drawn up and implemented new measures to protect borders, aircraft, etc. We have started to put security first, also at international level.
On cooperation, the terrorist attacks have taught us that internal and external security cannot be separated: they are two sides of the same coin.
There are two basic reasons for this: firstly, terrorism does not stop at borders and, secondly, terrorism is a global threat: it can happen â and indeed has happened â anywhere in the world.
True protection can therefore be realised only through international cooperation.
We also have to look carefully at whether our approach matches those of our partner countries in order to create sufficient possibilities for close cooperation.
National and international action should be dovetailed for their mutual strengthening.
Terrorism is an attack not only on our political and economic freedom, but also on our norms and values: liberty, democracy, tolerance and the rule of law, values that we have to defend.
Terrorism is also not just an attack on western values, it is an attack on universal values which form the foundation for the United Nations.
The only way to defeat terrorism is to confront it.
We must therefore be strong and active to fight this many-headed monster.
There might be a temptation to believe that any measure could be used in this fight.
But here, we have to be cautious. In our common fight, we should uphold the norms and values that terrorism is seeking to destroy.
Terrorism to a large extent boils down to security, which is the core of our existence.
A new approach to security has been developed, through various processes, with a view to taking more conclusive action against terrorists and preventing new attacks.
The UN is at the core.
UN Security Council Resolution 1373 has forced countries to improve their policies on terrorism, not only in word but also in deed, not only by improving old legislation or by drafting new legislation but also by implementing it.
The resolution contains measures to combat the financing of terrorism and promotes efforts that should lead to the prevention of terrorism and the punishment of terrorists.
The counter-terrorism agenda, incorporated in UN Security Council Resolution 1373, should therefore be considered to be the most important global point of reference for action â action that has to be taken by all United Nations Member States.
Within the European Union, the European Council and the General Affairs Council â as well as other Council formations such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council, the Transport Council and Ecofin â has actively worked, from 9/11 onwards, on setting up, implementing and refining an extensive EU action plan. Amongst other things, this involved a European arrest warrant, joint investigation teams, Eurojust and legislation on terrorist financing.
We have also been active as regards external policy.
The key issue of security is at the centre of the European Security Strategy, which should contribute to a stronger multilateral system.
It should address various threats â including terrorism â through active, more coherent internal and external action, with stronger capacities and in close cooperation with our partners.
We have also decided to include a terrorism clause in new contractual relations with third countries, similar to the human rights clause.
This will allow us to hold serious consultations with third countries which are not fully observing their international obligations in the fight against terrorism, including with regard to the implementation of Resolution 1373.
By adopting the carrot-and-stick approach â carrots taking the form of assistance â we use the political and economic power of the European Union in the fight against terrorism.
I turn now to the presidency programme.
The work programme of the Netherlands presidency in the field of counter-terrorism is extensive and wide-ranging.
In addition to a strong focus on implementation of EU measures and legislation, it entails new initiatives in many fields.
An important tool in this matter is the EU Counter-Terrorism Action Plan.
It was adopted by the European Council after the horrendous attacks in Madrid last March.
The presidency works in close cooperation with the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr Gijs de Vries, to implement and complement this action plan.
Key areas in which we, as presidency, want to take substantial steps forward are Justice and Home Affairs, improvement of cooperation between intelligence services, prevention of terrorist financing and strengthening of the EU's external policies and counter-terrorism.
On Justice and Home Affairs, we will focus on the implementation of measures like the European arrest warrant.
We also need to improve the way our intelligence agencies work together.
Having good information on what terrorists are planning and preparing to do is our first line of defence.
The EU Action Plan already outlines some of the steps that we intend to take and Mr De Vries is fully engaged in this process.
We are in the process of strengthening the EU Situation Centre that will be instrumental in pooling analyses on terrorism in Europe.
We also need to strengthen the role of Europol and make sure it can play its role.
In the near future, the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will sit with their US counterparts to see how we can strengthen transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
The prevention of terrorist financing is high on our agenda.
Even though the EU is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, we cannot sit back and relax.
Money is the life-blood of terrorism and we need to reinforce our financial systems to make sure that they are not abused by terrorists.
The third Money Laundering Directive is a fresh step in this matter.
We also need to strengthen our policies to freeze assets of terrorists.
We therefore seek to make the EU Clearing House more effective and to secure better implementation.
Finally, we will be looking at ways to prevent cash couriers from circumventing banking regulations by taking their money in cash across borders.
In our external policies we want to make sure that the resources of the Union are being used to their full extent in order to work with other countries in the fight against terrorism.
As I have already said, terrorism is a phenomenon that does not respect international borders.
It is our firm belief that we must work with third countries to promote the ratification and implementation of UN counter-terrorism conventions and to use political dialogue and technical assistance to support countries willing to cooperate.
The EU is already active in Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan, where it is implementing specific programmes.
The EU also operates other programmes in various countries with a view, more generally, to strengthening their judicial systems.
We feel that the EU should do more and therefore we are talking to a number of key countries to explore how we can enhance our cooperation.
That brings me to terrorism in Russia.
Russia is very worried about the threat of terrorism, and rightly so.
But, more than a mere worry, this is a true problem for Russia, which has suffered three major attacks in little more than a week.
We must show â and indeed have shown â our sympathy.
It is clear that the European Union has always systematically condemned all acts of terrorism.
The Russians deserve all the support we can give them. Hence we stand by Russia to assist it in its efforts to fight terrorism.
In our relations with Russia, we already discuss counter-terrorism on a regular basis.
We stand ready to increase cooperation on a technical level and to share the counter-terrorism experience that we have gained in the EU.
We will use the regular dialogues that we have with Russia to discuss how to proceed in this matter.
We are willing to discuss anti-terrorism strategies and methods with the Russians so that we can learn from each other.
This cooperation forms part of our overall strategy to strengthen relations between the European Union and Russia.
It is part of our goal to make tangible progress on all four common spaces at the next summit on 11 November.
In the field of external security, we have made progress.
But the interaction should go hand-in-hand with building up cooperation in the common space of internal security.
The terrorist attacks have prompted Moscow to continue to regard Chechnya as a predominantly anti-terrorist issue.
This gives rise to concern.
We have been consistent in our position that human rights should be respected in the fight against terrorism.
Indeed, the European Union has a clear position on the situation in Chechnya.
We will continue to present this position to Russia in future.
As to the terrorist attack in Beslan, I will be brief. We have fully and unconditionally condemned this attack and have offered our condolences to the relatives of the victims, the Russian Government and the Russian people.
We therefore fully supported your initiative, Mr President, for schools all over Europe to respect a one-minute silence at noon yesterday in commemoration of the victims of this terrorist attack.
In that way our children were able to show the world their grief for its victims and their worries about terrorism.
It is now up to us, the politicians, to translate these worries into further concrete action and to reinvigorate our fight against terrorism while respecting our core values.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin where the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands concluded and make it clear that no-one possessed of any shred of humanity could be other than appalled and deeply saddened by the tragic events at the school in Beslan in North Ossetia two weeks ago.
I reiterate the Commissionâs condolences to the people of Beslan.
I also unhesitatingly and unreservedly condemn terrorist acts wherever they are perpetrated.
Attacks on civilians are always contemptible.
When they deliberately target children, they plumb new depths of atrocity.
Sadly, this event, as the presidency noted, was not isolated.
In recent months, Russia has suffered several terrorist attacks, with targets ranging from the Moscow metro to domestic passenger flights.
The sequence is deeply disturbing, and the Commission has of course expressed its readiness to intensify our work with Russia to combat the very real terrorist threats that it faces.
We are, to take one example, already working with Russia to combat the financing of terrorism, by helping Russia to improve its efforts to tackle money laundering.
We want ideally to pursue those efforts as part of our much-vaunted 'strategic partnership' with Russia, as part of a process of dialogue.
Dialogue inevitably involves questions.
Real help comes only with understanding, and understanding comes only with clarity.
What happened in Beslan is still not fully clear, at least to the outside observer.
Who were those involved?
How did the hostage-takers plan and execute this horrific act?
What provoked the storming of the school?
Why was the number of casualties so high?
However, the link with Chechnya is clear.
Events in Beslan followed an intensification of rebel attacks in both Chechnya and Ingushetia since the spring.
The current conflict, now in its fifth year, has been a vicious affair, with widespread human rights abuses and the targeting of civilians by both Russian armed forces and rebels.
Many civilians have simply disappeared.
The conflict has caused a massive humanitarian crisis and has laid the economy waste.
We should all recognise, however, that this is not the time to read Russia lectures about Chechnya.
This is a time of grief and shock.
We have had, and will continue to have, our differences with Russia over Chechnya.
We have made, and will continue to make, those differences clear in our meetings with the Russians, and to discuss them.
That is what partners do.
For the Commission, there are two principles that guide cooperation with Russia on terrorism.
First, it is equally â if not more â important to work together to prevent terrorism, by which I mean addressing its root causes.
Second â and I strongly endorse what the Foreign Minister has just said â human rights are paramount and must be respected.
The fight against terrorism does not justify or excuse the violation of human rights.
Rather, it is strengthened by a demonstrable respect for the human rights of all citizens.
I noted a remarkable statement the other day by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Israel.
He was giving a judgment on the security barrier.
What he said reminded me of what we share fundamentally with Israel, whatever our criticisms of the present governmentâs policies.
Democracies, he argued, have to fight with one hand tied behind their backs.
That is true.
But it is also true that the moment you behave like the terrorists, you undermine your moral authority and you augment the number of citizens who either actively or passively support them.
So when we return to discussion of Chechnya, we should continue to make clear our support for a political solution to the conflict, which fully respects Russia's territorial integrity.
But we should do so in a consistent, intelligent way that does not risk changing from presidency to presidency, and that recognises the complex nature of ethnic conflict in the whole of the Caucasus.
I note in passing that we and our Russian partners need urgently to come to a shared understanding of this point.
Territorial integrity and stability matter throughout Russiaâs near abroad, in the southern Caucasus as much as the northern Caucasus.
They matter in the near abroad as well as within Russia itself.
A shared recognition of that would do much to make our common neighbourhood a safer place.
For our part we should recognise that no-one sensible in Russia could or should want to return to the Chechnyan status quo of the years immediately before 1999.
They remember what that was like, and what it led to.
So should we.
It was appalling â a community that exported gangsterism.
So the Commission welcomes efforts to rebuild properly functioning public health, education and administrative systems, but we have no illusions.
This is the start of a very long journey, which will only be lengthened by the siphoning off of reconstruction funds by corrupt officials, by the apparent manipulation of elections and by a failure to protect human rights and the absence of dialogue.
The challenge for Russia is to put in place a leadership in Chechnya in which the population of Chechnya has confidence.
Without this, there can be no lasting, genuine reconciliation, which it is clear the majority of the population wishes to see.
We can help in this, in a modest way, supporting efforts to promote reconstruction and institution-building in Chechnya.
I repeat the Commissionâs readiness to provide funds for reconstruction and rehabilitation in the north Caucasus, as soon as the security situation permits, and once a needs assessment mission to Moscow and the north Caucasus can be undertaken.
But ultimately that, and any lasting resolution of the Chechnyan tragedy, depend on the pursuit of far-sighted, humane and resolute policies in Moscow.
I hope they are forthcoming and that the government of the Russian Federation will not conclude that the only answer to terrorism is to increase the power of the Kremlin.
Frankly, there is not much good history on the side of that proposition.
Â Â  Mr President, making a speech is always easier when you can say that you agree with the previous speakers, in this case, the Presidency and the Commission.
Almost everything has already been said on the subject of terrorism, following 11Â September, 11Â March and now the Beslan tragedy.
This is no longer merely a case of terrorism, it is a new reality that I would call hyper-terrorism, in which not only civilians, but also children are used as a terrible means of achieving aims.
In the circumstances, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what can be said is very simple.
First and foremost, we must insist that institutions and governments act firmly.
We cannot accept, under any circumstances, any neutrality from an institution or State in the face of an act of hyper-terrorism of this nature.
It is not only governments that must work together; we must demand that all governments and institutions work together in the fight against terrorism and hyper-terrorism.
The firmness that we demand, as has been mentioned, must never, however, be at the expense of what makes us strong and what we strive for, which is democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
This is an area in which we must not make any concessions.
We do not want to establish police states anywhere, not even in those States with the greatest justification for so doing, because if we were to go down that road we would lose, as has already been said, all of our moral strength.
What we need, in addition to firmness, is, therefore, closer cooperation and, at the moment, we feel that there is room for improvement in this area, firstly as regards intelligence, but also as regards the flow of money that is behind terrorism.
The questions of who is funding this flow, and how the money is circulating around the world must be investigated in much greater depth than has until now been the case.
The European institutions are alive to the problem.
I applaud the work done in the Commission, in particular by Mr Vitorino, and this work should be carried on even more thoroughly.
I shall finish, Mr President, by saying that in our view terrorism has always been a struggle against democracy, freedom and the rule of law, which are the very cornerstones of our European Union.
This is one of the main reasons why we should combat it together.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Commissioner Patten said just now, this is a time of grief and not the time for us to read Russia lectures, and on that I very much agree with him.
Nobody speaking in this debate can banish these images.
I think we can all readily comprehend what it means when, in a particular town, not one single family is not lamenting a victim, and most of those families have lost children.
We have to imagine that; there is a place on this earth, in which there is not one family that has not lost a child â grandchildren, nephews, nieces, the children of the family itself.
Beslan will have to live with that trauma for a long time, and not just Beslan; we will all have to live with that trauma for a long time.
The media world, in which we are at home, is fleeting and happy-go-lucky; today, already, other images are making the news.
So I want to take up something Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, something that I think is very astute. âA Rubicon of terrorism has been crossedâ, he said.
That is a fact; indeed, it has been.
For the first time, we have seen in terrorism something characterised by two elements.
It is actually an unwritten, but self-evident law of humanity that says that children are not to be targeted by such actions.
Until now, as I recall, it was a fact of terrorism, albeit not of war, that children were not attacked.
For the first time, something has been introduced, something that says: âWe donât care; weâll take a whole school hostage, and weâre not interested in what happens to the childrenâ.
So it is that the end justifies the sacrifice of children; a Rubicon has indeed been crossed, and it is this against which we must defend ourselves.
That is why I want, in this debate, to draw attention to something: as we all know how these terrorists think, we also need to make two connections here.
There is, quite obviously, a connection between Chechnya and Islamic terrorism, with the idea being to use Chechnya and Ingushetia, regions with predominantly Muslim populations, as a means of taking the conflict to North Ossetia, inhabited by a different faith community, the object being to multiply the conflict two-fold.
When, however, children were taken as hostages, the result was an effect that has gone unnoticed by our media.
The fact is that, for the first time in a long time, in not one Arab country were there demonstrations in the street in support of this act of terrorism.
Throughout the Islamic world, not one newspaper failed to condemn this act.
Even the most radical of Islamic leaders anathematised and repudiated this sort of terrorism.
It is in this element that there lies, certainly, an opportunity to revive a dialogue that has evaded us.
If we can spot a lowest common denominator â and I believe that we can â then it is our shared repudiation of this sort of terrorism, and that smallest common denominator is also an opportunity to begin dialogue, an opportunity that we must make use of.
That is why our group has discussed the need to draw the logical conclusions, to actually avoid talking only in terms of cultural confrontation, and instead seize opportunities for inter-cultural dialogue wherever they present themselves, even if it be at a moral nadir such as this one.
To all the perceptive things that have been said here, I want to add that there is a particular question facing the governments of our Union, in this House and particularly here. It is this.
The European Parliament was broadly unanimous in supporting those states that rejected pre-emptive warfare as a means of conducting international policy and as a model for conflict resolution.
We will shortly be discussing Iraq and the failure of the approach according to which international crises and conflicts can be resolved by pre-emptive strikes.
To be consistent, though, we then have to say that such crises are no better dealt with by nullifying the democratic system, by abolishing the rule of law, or by reintroducing authoritarian structures.
While it is not for us to give Russia advice, anyone who reintroduces the death penalty absents themselves from our platform of action, which we in this House, let me add, share with our counterparts in the Council of Europe.
That, too, is the honest thing to say, and if we cannot say that to a friend, then I think it is already too late, but, as we have friends in Russia, and as Russia is Europeâs most important partner, that must be said loud and clear.
Pre-emptive warfare is no more use than the reintroduction of authoritarian structures.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are horrified by the terrorist atrocity in Beslan.
We abominate and condemn it without reservation.
The brutality meted out to children, parents and teachers beggars belief; these terrorists are not freedom fighters, but cynical murderers.
Like all Europeans, we MEPs are entitled to ask how this tragedy came to pass, and whether it was unavoidable.
Who was it who sowed the seeds of such terrorism, which kills so many of the innocent in such terrible ways, in Beslan and in a Moscow theatre a year ago?
Who is actually behind the aircraft crashes in Russia?
Questions such as these do nothing to diminish our solidarity with the victims and our horror at the hostage tragedy.
There is no simple solution in the war on terrorism, for it goes far beyond the bounds of war as we know it, and is also far more complex than what was known as the Cold War.
There are no defined battlefields, the foe is not readily identified, and that is what makes simple answers such as military intervention so ineffective.
Terrorists must be hunted down ruthlessly, no question about that, and nobody doubts it, but it is not enough to combat the symptoms; we have to get to the causes of this war.
The Russian Government must learn from the catastrophe of Beslan if the vicious circle of violence in Chechnya is to be broken.
In this situation, warlike behaviour bars the way to a peaceful and democratic end to the conflict.
For as long as the people of Grozny have no hope of a normal life, there will continue to be a perverse incentive for more terrorism.
President Putin is playing tough, but he is not taking the tough road that a political solution would be, for his government seems not to believe that a political solution for Chechnya is possible.
We are left with the lie of an unwinnable war.
This week, President Putin announced amendments to the Russian constitution, effectively removing the elements of democracy from the countryâs political system.
That is no real war on terrorism, but it is Putinâs â a war on the political diversity that Russia needs so desperately, and his stronger government makes the country no safer.
We Liberals and Democrats are convinced that we have the right and the duty, as the representatives of the people of Europe, to speak out on Chechnya and to speak up for democracy and the rule of law.
It is not enough to relegate Chechnya to the small print in the margin, and that is why we find it regrettable and deserving of criticism that the Socialist Group and the Group of the conservative Christian Democrats have blocked a resolution of this House on this important subject.
We must not take the manipulation of elections and the ongoing violation of human rights lying down.
Nowhere in the world can we allow the idea of pre-emptive war on terror to take root, for it leads down a dead end.
We believe in the universality of human rights and in the rule of law.
If the European Union is to have the genuine partnership with Russia that it seeks, Russia has to be prepared to rethink its policy on Chechnya and find the courage to change tack.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that this attack in Beslan was monstrous, and that those who perpetrated it showed themselves to be monsters by taking children hostage and demanding that their mothers should decide which children should die and which should survive.
Taking that as our starting point, there are two options open to us: we can say that these monsters must be fought, which is a self-evident truism but rather simplistic, or we can ask ourselves how human beings could become monsters.
The Chechens who carried out this operation were not born monsters, but became them.
Who made human beings into monsters?
That is a legitimate question, and, in Chechnya, a colonial power has for years been waging a colonial war that, day after day, brings forth monsters.
If we want to talk about how to put a stop to the barbarities of terrorism, we have to start by looking at how to put a stop to the barbarities of this colonial war.
History has taught us what colonial wars are like.
The atrocities committed by the Algerians against the French were barbaric.
Colonial wars bring forth barbarians.
The problem is with finding a way to end the barbarism, and here it is not enough to say that we are going to pour more money into the war on terrorism; we have to ask what we Europeans are going to put into the political balance in order to put a stop to the barbarism.
In this context, the role we can play is that of political mediator between the Russians, who are incapable of coming up with a political solution, and the Chechens, who cannot extricate themselves from terrorism.
That is why we call for a condemnation of Putin.
What does the reform of the regional election process have to do with terrorism, or with the fight against it?
Nothing.
It does, however, have something to do with the power of a tsar whose democratic legitimacy is dubious.
The Russia of today â it has to be said â is in the process of leaving democracy behind.
Turning to Chechnya, when there is talk of a political solution, we have to know with whom one is supposed to negotiate.
A political solution will not be found in Russia alone; there must be partners on the Chechen side with whom it is possible to negotiate.
If everyone â the terrorists and the Chechens who propose political solutions â is treated in the same way, that is to say, as terrorists, there will be no political solution, because there will be nobody to negotiate with.
Negotiations will have to involve MrÂ Zakayev, they will have to involve discussing his proposals and recognising him, and it is only right that the European Union should recognise him and prompt him to abandon and denounce terrorism; he has to be treated as a political partner, as an enemy with whom it is necessary to negotiate.
Negotiations are always conducted with enemies and never with friends.
With friends, one organises surprise parties, if one feels in the mood for them; one does not conduct political negotiations with them.
It is for that reason, Mr President, that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is proposing NataliaÂ Estemirova for the Sakharov Prize.
The daughter of a Russian father and Chechen mother, she is in Grozny fighting the good fight for the recognition of human rights: a symbol in herself!
She is a member of the âMemorialâ group that produced Andrei Sakharov, in whose spirit, and with whose friends, she campaigns.
I hope that this House will find the strength to say that there is a solution other than terrorism to the conflict in Chechnya, and Natalia Estemirova would be the symbol of political action on its part in the face of this tragic situation.
Â Â  Yesterday, Mr President, the President of this House expressed on behalf of all of us our profound indignation at the monstrous hostage-taking in Beslan.
Having radically and unanimously condemned terrorism, it is now for us to speak out equally clearly on the roots of these appalling outbreaks of violence, on the results of the much-vaunted war on terrorism, which was launched in order to curb them, and on the EUâs responsibilities in this crucial context.
These questions, however, arise in a very similar way in respect of the Caucasus, Iraq and the Middle East.
MrÂ Bush, Mr Putin and Mr Sharon are taking the same strategy further, with the same catastrophic results.
The roots of terrorism, of course, lie in a state of permanent war, with bombings and acts of destruction and humiliation, when these are not acts of barbarism committed by occupying forces.
Claiming to wage war on terrorism, one ends up waging war on peoples.
Putting them through hell does indeed beget monsters.
The outcome of this alleged war on terrorism is therefore the same in each of the cases to which I have referred.
Vladimir Putin gained power by promising to restore order.
Five years on, the Caucasus is ablaze and the blood is flowing as far as Moscow.
Ariel Sharon promised his people security and peace.
Since then, the people of Israel have been living in a climate of fear, division and confrontation, while Gaza, locked in and exhausted, is rapidly becoming another ticking time-bomb.
George Bush saw good as overcoming evil and contemplated extending democracy to the whole of the Middle East; now Iraq is sinking into chaos while the list of innocent victims gets longer from day to day.
What, then, is the EUâs responsibility, in terms both of its values and of its own best interests?
It is, in the first place, to be there, not as an inaudible entity, but as a recognised interested party; it is responsible, above all, for daring to sound the alarm when the world is falling apart before our eyes.
It must not tremble at every frown from his lordship in the Kremlin.
The accusation of interference carries no more weight today in the case of Chechnya than it formerly did in relation to Kosovo.
It must also do away with the intolerable immunity granted to the Sharon Government, which is openly defying the UN, the International Court of Justice and international law in general.
Finally, it must denounce the unjust, illegal, and increasingly dangerous war in Iraq, formally call for the withdrawal of the occupying troops and, in general terms, adopt as its own for the future the principle that war should be banned as a way of sorting out the worldâs problems.
We should reflect on the words of Kofi Annan, who said: âHistory is a harsh judge; it will not forgive us if we let this moment passâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent tragic events are among the latest unmistakable signs to bring the civilised world up against an obvious reality: the terrorist attacks of recent years have not been isolated incidents linked only by their cruelty and violence, but we are facing a war, albeit not a conventional one.
It is a new war, because never until now have the forces of evil been mobilised on such a broad front and never has the civilised world, at all latitudes of the globe, found itself confronted with such widespread atrocity and such total indifference towards civilised values and principles.
Never have children been struck down with such savagery and determination outside conventional conflicts.
It is time for us to get over the stunned reaction that we, the civilised world, have felt, for we have all been brought up to respect human dignity and civil rights and we cannot comprehend that there can be men and women capable of the acts of savage cruelty that we have witnessed.
They have declared global war on us using unconventional methods, and we must not forget that we were given many warnings, from the Dar es Salaam and Nairobi attacks to the escalation of the Taliban regime.
One of the last warnings was given to this Parliament and the international community by Commander Massud, who was later killed on 9 September 2001, just a few months after his visit to Strasbourg and two days before the attack on the Twin Towers, the attack that marked the terroristsâ official declaration of war on the whole civilised world.
We have to understand the reality in which we live.
There are no more ambassadors to announce that we are at war, but there are bombs ripping our countries apart, child murderers and rapists, and new terrorists being recruited from within our own cities.
Europe has a duty to listen to every voice raised in defence of the freedom of oppressed peoples, but it has to state clearly that terrorism must be fought and condemned with no ifs or buts, and that all those who justify, tolerate or support terrorism â surreptitiously or otherwise â must be isolated and that we must ensure that they can do no harm.
Now that with a sense of solidarity we are struggling to fight this new terrorism that has declared war on us, it is difficult to understand how neighbouring countries that we respect and love, such as France, allow a terrorist convicted in Italy for four murders committed during the tragic âyears of leadâ to escape.
Our national and European laws also need to be adapted to the emergency situation in which we are living.
Â Â  Mr President, Abdel Rahman al-Rashid, the director of the Al-Arabiya television station, wrote a remarkable opinion piece in the 5 September issue of the British .
Those who took children hostage in Beslan, he wrote, were Muslims, just as were the hostage-takers in Iraq, those who commit acts of violence in Darfur in the Sudan, Bin Laden and the suicide bombers who blow up buses, cars, schools, homes and other buildings all over the world.
We cannot clear our name, he went on to say, until we acknowledge the shameful fact that terrorism has become an Islamic activity, a virtual monopoly operated by Muslim men and women, end of quote.
Courageous Muslims such as Mr al-Rashid must be supported in saying such things.
Above all, we must become aware that a global war is being waged on Europe and on the West in general, a war waged by Muslim fundamentalism against our European democratic values and lifestyle, and I am, alas, less than convinced that the European Union is in the forefront of the fight against terrorism, as Mr Bot has just said.
Far more than is at present the case, there needs to be cooperation with the United States, with NATO and with such countries as Russia.
Member States must work together more effectively in exchanging information and must adapt their legislation better with a view to combating international terrorism, or else things will go from bad to worse.
Â Â  Mr President, what happened in Beslan is fundamental proof that Islamist terrorism is now, and will continue to be, the main problem affecting coexistence amongst Europeans.
It is not just an emerging problem. We must have no doubt that it will be an increasing problem.
The greatest risk facing us Europeans in relation to this phenomenon is that the European citizens may come to the conclusion that our reaction is fundamentally the failure to act, paralysis, doing nothing.
That is the greatest risk, the greatest difficulty: not knowing how to confront this terrible risk on the basis of our principles, convictions and values.
On the basis of my personal experience, I believe that, in order to tackle the scourge of terrorism, the first thing, the most important thing, is to increase awareness, awareness of the seriousness of the problem.
Legislative and operative measures will be important, but the most important thing is to increase awareness.
There are two sides to this increasing of awareness: firstly, we must have the courage to treat the fight against terrorism as our very top priority amongst all our problems.
We must therefore say it, repeat it and affirm it in all the Unionâs documents, in all our public statements: terrorism is the main problem.
I would go as far as to say today that the principal gap in the European Union's anti-terrorist policy is not the lack of measures and initiatives, but the fact that we do not acknowledge sufficiently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans.
Secondly, the second objective in terms of increasing awareness is the conviction that we can defeat this phenomenon.
We cannot start to fight terrorism unless we are sure, on the basis of the moral strength of our convictions, that we will be able to beat terrorism.
Terrorism is essentially about fear, it generates fear.
And the fear of failure we feel when we deal with a problem of this nature is the first thing we must conquer if we are then to conquer the terrorist organisation.
Ladies and gentlemen, it takes time to tackle a terrorist phenomenon.
There are no shortcuts and no possibility of magic solutions.
But each and every one of us must have conviction from the outset.
The fight against terrorism has nothing to do with the left or right; it is essentially a moral obligation.
I therefore believe we must dedicate more time, more single-issue debates in this Parliament, to tackling terrorism.
I believe we must state more frequently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans and we must promote a debate amongst governments in order to ascertain in certain circumstances, when terrorist attacks take place close to elections, what instruments are available to those governments in order to defend themselves, whether or not this may include delaying elections, in order to prevent terrorists from achieving their objectives.
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have a moral duty of the highest order.
Â Â  â Mr President, the frightful terrorist attack on a school in Beslan has claimed hundreds of children and their mothers as its victims.
What should have been for hundreds of children a day of rejoicing â their first day at school â turned into an appalling tragedy.
Yesterday, together with millions of schoolchildren throughout Europe, we kept a minuteâs silence to remember the victims, and we thank this Houseâs President for this gesture of solidarity, which was also an expression of powerlessness, the powerlessness felt by everyone in the face of this cruel attack on those who cannot defend themselves â children and their mothers.
Today, we want, above all, to affirm that we are alongside people in a remote corner of Europe, but the debate on the mounting threat of a terrorism that spares nothing and nobody must still go on, both today and in the months to come.
Its keywords must be âcomprehensionâ and âactionâ.
We must endeavour to comprehend the incomprehensible.
We must be prepared to seek out the causes of terrorism, to open our eyes to peopleâs hopelessness and frustration and that of the conflicts that appear to be unending, without the prospect of a solution.
I am quite clearly not saying that the existence of these conflicts is a justification for barbarous violence directed at innocent people, but rather that we must adopt a joint approach in order to do away with this source from which violence develops.
In the same way, we also have to be prepared to act, to take international cooperation in the fight against terrorism further.
It follows that the European Union must offer the Russian people, and President Putin, every assistance in attempting to prevent such far-reaching calamities from happening in future.
The question naturally arises of how all of this was possible.
It is a good thing that the State Duma is conducting an inquiry into how the calamity in Beslan ended and how that final stage was dealt with.
Nor is there any getting away from the Chechen issue.
The assistance to which I have just referred does, of course, include joint operations on the ground by the intelligence services, their training in specialized units and their learning from each otherâs experiences.
International terrorism cannot be tackled without international cooperation, and the European Union has an important part to play in that.
My group has little sympathy for those who think that they can go it alone in combating international terrorism and who also believe that this is the only way to do so.
I want to ask the House for an intensive debate, to be held by the end of the year and jointly with the Council and the Commission, on the European contribution to the fight against terrorism.
Where do we stand, and what is our analysis of the threat?
This morning, Mr Bot made an important contribution to this discussion in his statement on what the European Union and its Presidency are doing.
High on the list are seeking out the causes and dealing with them, but our European tradition bids us also look at how democratic structures are to be secured and fundamental human rights protected.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Bot, what has happened to him in the space of a week.
A week ago, Mr Bot, you asked the Russian authorities a very simple question as to how it had been possible for this tragedy to occur.
A very simple question, and one that you were right to ask, but you are wrong today in your desire to see it buried.
Why is this so?
After all, it is the question being asked by all the families in Beslan; it is the question being asked by all those families as they grieve.
What happened?
What has come to pass?
How can you not see that, in this tragedy, the Russian powers-that-be have deployed all the calculating cynicism of which they are capable âÂ manipulation, disinformation, poisonings â and the best journalists, experts on Chechen issues, found themselves being prevented from reaching the scene.
How are these facts to be denied?
How can one not put these questions to the Russian authorities?
How, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, can you cooperate in the fight against international terrorism with a power that first denied that there was any connection with the conflict in Chechnya, with a power that then condemned the independent and moderate President Maskhadov, putting a price on his head?
Now this same power has proclaimed an international war on the global scourge of terrorism, finally asking all states to refrain from interfering in its internal affairs.
Who is that power, inconsistent and manipulative, with which you seek to cooperate in saving democracy, the rule of law, and our code of values?
Think about it, Mr Bot.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Septemberâs events in Beslan have shocked the world with their savagery and inhumanity.
There are no words to describe the feelings caused by the murder of children.
This act of terror can have no justification whatsoever.
At the same time, I should like to emphasise that this event demands from the state political action to prevent such situations in the future, to remove the causes of terrorism.
