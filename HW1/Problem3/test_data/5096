It is clear that national governments are still not being ambitious enough in their action plans.
They are not looking ahead to the 20% target and, to quote the Commission, there exists a 'considerable gap' in certain Member States 'between the political commitment to energy efficiency ... and the measures adopted'.
I think that this is worrying.
Secondly, the fact that we now have the Renewables Directive and the targets therein means that energy efficiency has never been more important.
If we are going to reach the 20% binding target across the EU, we have to keep energy demand under control.
We can only do 20% if the 100% of the total amount of energy use is something that is reduced rather than being allowed to increase.
So I hope this report does mark a new beginning and that it marks the start of a closing of the gap between political rhetoric on energy efficiency and its actual implementation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 31 January 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I welcome the drafting of this report and the global approach it proposes to energy efficiency in the European Union, in terms of its topics and geography.
It is important that we should be speaking today of an action plan and its details; this shows that we are taking concrete steps in this direction.
As rapporteur on regional cooperation in the Black Sea region, I would like to stress the importance of energy efficiency in this region in order to achieve the energy security goal and to decrease dependency on energy sources.
I also appreciate the international approach to the topic and the examination of global challenges.
As such, I welcome the European Parliament's awareness of the fact that in the future Russia will be unable to meet the internal and contractual demand for gas, and that it expresses its concern in this regard.
This prompts us to reiterate to the European institutions the importance of two major objectives: increased substitution of EU energy imports with other sources, effective ways of ensuring security of supply, and the need to promote energy reform in the Black Sea region and in EU-neighbouring countries with a view to creating a transparent and sustainable energy sector.
in writing. - The Plan of Action was targeting 20 % efficiency by 2020 is an ambitious plan but a necessary one.
On the other hand, it is useless to set targets if there isn't a will to achieve them.
For instance, out of a total of 21 actions scheduled for completion by 2007 only three were completely finalised.
This is a dismal record.
It is true that many others are in progress but nonetheless a percentage which is less than 15 % of completed projects is not something to be proud of.
I am ashamed to say that in me country, Malta, the issue has not been tackled seriously.
In an island where the sun and wind exist in abundance one would have expected that full use would be made of these two elements.
Regarding solar energy very few private, commercial and public buildings make use of this alternative energy.
Wind energy was more popular in the past in agricultural areas.
The Government is intent on setting up offshore wind farms notwithstanding that the technology is not available for the depths of Maltese waters.
Not only but it has made it known to a major developer, who waited to set up four wind mills generating energy, that the permission would not be given because of aesthetic reasons.
in writing. - (HU) Improving energy efficiency is the most obvious solution for reducing the emission of harmful substances.
Joint action in this area can also make a real contribution to eliminating Europe's dependency on energy supplies.
The greatest opportunity for saving energy perhaps lies in the efficiency of industrial and residential buildings.
This is increasingly true in the new Member States of the Union.
The Socialist heavy-industry facilities and tower blocks that are home to hundreds of thousands and which are so characteristic of the region have become symbols of energy wastage.
It is a welcome development that the European Commission has acknowledged the particular situation of the former Socialist countries in its action plan, and specifies the promotion of energy efficiency as a priority objective in the new Member States.
We feel it is unfortunate that several Member States are not keeping their promises when implementing the energy efficiency legislation.
For example, the Hungarian government, whilst paying lip service to climate protection measures, has postponed adoption of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for months.
At the same time, it is to be welcomed that, despite this, some communities are taking advantage of the opportunities.
A good example of this is the programme started in Ãbuda, one of the largest districts of Budapest, under which many tower blocks will be refurbished in the years to come, using Community aid.
We are convinced that Europe is capable of playing a leading role in the issue of energy efficiency.
It is also its primary interest.
The most efficient use of energy also means a more efficient economy, new jobs, better competitiveness and, last but not least, a more liveable environment.
in writing. - First of all, I would like to welcome the initiative report by Ms Hall.
As a matter of fact, this report comes at a time where all initiatives aiming at reinforcing concrete actions for greater energy efficiency should be warmly welcomed.
Energy efficiency is indeed the most effective objective providing already available technological tools for genuinely and rapidly addressing the challenges of global warming and limited fossil resources.
We are now embarked on a plan to cut energy consumption and it is essential that we reach our goals on schedule.
But of course such a plan will require enormous costs and economical sacrifices.
These costs and sacrifices will be especially very challenging for those countries with the lowest budgets and less developed economies.
It is essential that the energy efficiency targets will not simply worsen the situation of the weakest economies and industries in the poorest Member States.
Therefore, ad hoc transitional measures to support the most vulnerable sectors and countries while implementing the legislation are required to avoid market failures.
Of course, in the long run, there is indeed huge cost-effective potential of energy conservation and stronger energy efficiency policy would very likely benefit the job market in the Union.
in writing. - (FI) There are probably few decisions as far-reaching in their effect and as self-contradictory as the Council's three-pronged plan on climate policy as stated in spring 2007: a reduction in emissions of 20%, a 20% saving in energy, and a renewables share of 20%, all by the year 2020.
The third-mentioned binding target unfortunately threatens to accelerate climate change.
Until this is understood, any climatic benefit can only be gained from the first two.
Saving energy specifically to improve energy efficiency is of course one of the most effective tools in the fight against climate change.
There is broad consensus on this and on the content of the report in Parliament and I would like to thank Mrs Hall for making this possible.
What is creditable about this report is that it shows an understanding of the scope of the issue and the options it offers: the insistence on energy efficiency must have an effect that permeates the whole of society.
It has to relate to all planning and activity at all levels.
The aims of energy efficiency and the rules that apply must extend equally to equipment, buildings, energy production and transfer, transport and consumer habits.
We need to take action right away.
That is why it is regrettable that Parliament should need to remind the Commission that there is already legislation in place in this area.
So far the degree of implementation among the Member States has been less than satisfactory, which is something the Commission should focus its attention on.
Improving energy efficiency is about effort, where the best result as far as climate is concerned is achieved with reference to market conditions.
An example of this is the various standardisation systems.
We need to be wary of inflexible legislation: if the best available technology is under the yoke of a carrot and stick regime, the efforts made are sufficient.
The legislator's pernickety interference in the ways and means only serves to exhaust the organisations in question.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, in this debate on the rational use of energy, while agreeing with the main arguments of the rapporteur, Ms Hall, I want to draw attention to some issues that are of particular importance for the new Member States.
1.
In order to narrow the gap between themselves and the most developed EU countries, the new Member States must develop two to three times faster than the latter, i.e. at an annual GNP growth rate of at least 6%.
Such a growth rate will mean a significant increase in CO2 emissions, something that was not taken into account in the proposals put forward by the European Commission in its recent energy and climate change package.
2.
The Commission's proposals are clearly directed at restricting the use of coal, which will mainly hit economies like that of Poland, where energy production is based mainly on burning various kinds of coal.
3.
The proposal that the energy production industry will have to purchase all its CO2 emission allowances by auction as from 2013 will cause a massive increase in energy prices that will be particularly painfully felt by the domestic economies.
At the present time, when the Polish energy production industry buys barely 10% of its emission allowances at auction, the price of electric power has risen by some 15% in 2007, and is set to rise in the next few years by a further 20% to 30 %.
in writing . -
This report on energy efficiency is timely - given our concerns about climate change and the need to face up to the finite energy resource of fossil fuels.
But eliminating waste of energy is positive in its own right and from a purely selfish point of view; improving energy efficiency should cut costs for households and businesses.
Many individuals are aware of the need to be more conscious of energy use.
Many already know that a TV on standby uses 45pc of the electricity used by a TV that is on, that electrical equipment on standby uses 10pc of household energy in the EU and that leaving phone re-chargers plugged in uses energy - 95pc of which is wasted.
And while we can all act to switch off power to electrical gadgets, would it not be more effective is the manufacturers designed the equipment with an eye to eliminating the energy waste.
A combination of new development in manufacturing and increase awareness among consumers will yield results, but industry needs incentives to develop new products with energy efficiency in mind and the public need positive messages to educate them about the extent of energy savings which can be made in the home and office.
in writing. - (HU) As the EPP-ED rapporteur in the Committee on the Environment on the Green Paper on improving energy efficiency (Doing More with Less), I welcome the repeated and increased Community efforts in this area.
At the same time, I must express my disappointment that while the European Commission and Parliament are making serious efforts to create consensual rules and prepare implementable plans, the attitude of Member States towards realising them is in many cases inadequate.
Some Member States have missed the deadline for preparing action plans by months or more; for example, there are seven countries which, to date, have still not submitted them, even though they are already 7 months overdue.
This is not the only problem, however.
There is a lack of social agreement on these plans, and the plans that have been prepared are often very anaemic, and in many cases do not reflect the realistic schedule and system of instruments for achieving the common objectives.
Consequently, we can say quite bluntly that many Member States of the Union have only paid lip service to energy efficiency, thrift and the ultimate aim of a 'low-carbon society', so what future is there for an economy, households and transport with zero carbon dioxide emissions?
It would be good if the guardian of Union legislation, the Commission, prepared summary analyses and evaluations from time to time regarding the quality of the national plans submitted, and the extent to which the Member States are implementing them.
in writing. - First of all, I would like to welcome the initiative report of Mrs Hall.
As a matter of fact, this report comes at a time where all initiatives aiming at reinforcing concrete actions for greater energy efficiency should be warmly welcomed.
Energy efficiency is indeed the most effective objective providing already available technological tools for genuinely and rapidly addressing the challenges of global warming and limited fossil resources.
We are now embarked plan to cut energy consumption and it is essential that we reach our goals on schedule.
But of course such plan will require enormous costs and economical sacrifices.
These costs and sacrifices will be especially very challenging for those countries with the lowest budgets and less developed economies.
It is essential that the energy efficiency targets will not simply worsen the situation of the weakest economies and industries in the poorest Member States.
Therefore, ad hoc transitional measures to support the most vulnerable sectors and countries while implementing the legislation are required to avoid market failures.
Of course in the long run there is indeed huge cost-effective potential of energy conservation and stronger energy efficiency policy would very likely benefit the job market in the Union.
in writing. - First of all I would like to congratulate Ms Hall on a truly comprehensive report, dedicated to improving energy efficiency and calling on the Member States that are far behind the implementation of existing legislation to take all the necessary measures.
Secondly, I am glad to concede that the report has not only pointed out ways for industrial consumers to save energy, but for small consumers as well - especially by means of raising consumer awareness and providing reliable information of the most environment-friendly options.
It must be noted that the consumption of households accounts for 40% of overall energy consumption.
Therefore it is an individual responsibility for all of us to contribute to maximise energy efficiency.
Thirdly, energy consumption is progressively increasing and so does the expenditure on energy.
It is simple common sense to enforce measures for energy efficiency in order to gain the optimal use of means of production.
in writing. - Mr President, I congratulate Ms Hall on this report, which contains a number of sold, sensible, achievable suggestions to encourage energy efficiency.
Amidst the current fuss on generation and security of supply we risk losing sight of the fact that changes in building and equipment standards, as well as how we use energy, will in themselves allow a great deal of energy capacity.
I am glad to support this report and hope that it will be the start of more measures in this direction.
Reduction in unwanted by-catches and elimination of discards in European fisheries (debate)
The next item is the report by Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European fisheries (2007/2112(ÎÎÎ)) (Î6-0495/2007).
rapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, I am grateful to the shadow rapporteur for helping us to end with a good report.
I also want to thank Commissioner Borg for at last - at last! - proposing powerful measures to deal with the discarding of fish and unwanted by-catches.
Today we have a fisheries policy which is emptying the world's oceans, ravaging seabeds, destroying ecosystems and causing fish stocks to collapse.
Even seabirds are killed by our current fisheries policy.
If this destruction had taken place on land - if we had treated our forests in the same way as we are now treating the seas - we would have had rioting on the streets, but the destruction of the oceans is happening out of sight and in silence.
Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, had a powerful impact in 1962 and was a wake-up call for many to become committed to caring for the environment and to nature conservation.
We are now in the time of the Silent Sea.
In fact, last year, the journalist Isabella LÃ¶vin published a book with that very title.
Let us now put some life into the fight to rescue future generations of fish and fishermen.
The Commission's proposals will in fact mean an end to quota systems and detailed regulation, which have in practice encouraged fishermen to empty the seas and throw back unprofitable fish dead, and under which the development of fishing equipment was aimed mainly at taking more and more from the seas.
Faced with the threat of having to fill their vessels with unprofitable fish, fishermen in the EU are getting an incentive to fish more selectively.
But a successful policy needs carrots as well as sticks.
We can, for example, allow more fishing days for vessels with selective gear, or give them access to areas which are closed to vessels without selective fishing gear.
It is important, for each type of fishery, to set annual reduction targets for by-catches and discards and to have a dialogue with interested parties in order to achieve best results.
Positive examples are the Bay of Biscay, the Kattegat and the Skagerrak.
In those areas French and Swedish fishermen have used sorting grids with great success in the Norway lobster (Nephrops) fishery.
These have in practice completely eliminated by-catches.
With a little more freedom and accountability for the fishing fleet, perhaps cooperation can grow between the research community and fishermen, and that can lead to positive development.
This goes together with better data on what fish are caught.
We need to look at systems using electronic logbooks and possible video surveillance to see whether we can devise a good solution for maintaining personal integrity.
Another important aspect is what we are to do with fish landed in the form of by-catches when there is a ban on discards.
It is important that it should be possible to use it in some way but at the same time that the level of compensation should be so low that it does not provide an incentive actively to seek by-catches.
I hope and believe that the Commission will quickly finalise a proposal that can be implemented.
It would then become an important element in the fight against overfishing and in achieving a sustainable fishery.
But of course that is not enough - we also need general reductions in fishing effort where currently endangered species are concerned, but perhaps we shall be able to debate that another day.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for the excellent work.
We all share the view that discarding is, to say the least, an unnecessary waste of good natural and economic resources that should be stopped.
However, each fishery is different and requires tailor-made solutions.
We have therefore chosen a results-based approach which implies that we set targets to reduce the amount of discards over a timeframe and then leave it up to the fishermen concerned to choose how to reach the targets - such measures could include an increase in mesh size, the use of selectivity devices, real-time closures, spatial changes of activity or any other possible measure or a combination thereof.
Turning now specifically to the report.
Concerning Community action plans on seabirds and sharks, I can inform you that the latter is under way and that, on the former, my services are gathering information and scientific advice with a view to completing the plan by the end of 2009.
I particularly agree that the discard policy should not be seen as an isolated action but as part of the general approach to move towards the MSY objective.
We are also in agreement concerning a case-by-case approach and the importance of participation and consultation of the sector at all levels.
Here I note with interest your proposal to test new uses of monitoring of discard practices as was done in some third countries.
In addition we must ensure that incentives reward a real reduction in discards.
They therefore need to be assessed carefully so as not to lead to adverse effects.
Indeed, Member States already have possibilities to favour cleaner fisheries through the allocation of quotas.
Having said this, I am of the view that incentives should accompany the various phases of implementation, in order to boost a change in behaviour until the final objective is reached.
Concerning policy implementation, I generally agree with your suggestions, with a different focus, however.
We should set the goal of a discard ban in a fishery wherever this is possible from the outset and not as a last resort measure as you seem to suggest.
I need to clarify here, however, that in certain instances the set target may be that of reducing discards to the absolute minimum possible.
So where are we in the process?
On the basis of scientific advice expected soon, we will choose fisheries for specific legislation during the course of this year and at the same time plan a roadmap with a timeframe for the subsequent proposals covering - over time - all European fisheries.
In parallel, as decided at the December Council, Member States will trial discard reductions in the whitefish fishery in the North Sea in order to reduce discards of whiting by 30%.
For cod, the commitment with Norway is to reduce discards to less than 10%.
Other activities include the proposal on technical measures in the Atlantic, the proposal on a revised cod recovery plan, the revision of the control regulation and several studies and impact assessments for the legislative proposals.
Finally, I can agree on Amendments 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10 to 12.
Amendments 2 and 7 are related and I can agree to them with a slight change.
On Amendment 9, some cautious thinking is needed since these techniques need further research.
There are problems with high costs and reliability.
Finally, I cannot support Amendment 4 as such.
With respect to Amendments 13, 14 and 15, I need to reflect further, since the whole question concerning appropriate incentives for fishers to encourage them to adopt an effective discards policy needs to be further studied and assessed before a definitive position is adopted.
Let me conclude by restating the urgent need for legislative action on this file, and I look forward to your continued cooperation in developing this policy.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President, the discarding or dumping of fish in European waters destroys over a million tonnes of fish a year, particularly in multi-species fisheries.
Globally, according to the FAO, millions of tonnes of unwanted fish by-catch are thrown back into the sea each year.
This has a very negative effect on the economy of future fisheries and on the health of marine ecosystems.
The practice is amoral, unethical and completely unsustainable and results directly from the Common Fisheries Policy, which criminalises fishermen for landing by-catch, thereby forcing them to discard - fishermen who are desperately trying to make a living while faced with ever-depleting levels of fish stocks.
Our ultimate aim has to be the reduction of these unwanted by-catches and the virtual elimination of discards through a discard ban, with incentives in place to ensure that all unwanted by-catch must be landed.
But how and when we get to this point of a ban should be a matter for all stakeholders involved, including the Commission, the regional advisory councils (RACs), the fishermen, the scientific experts, the national governments and NGOs, and fishery by fishery if necessary.
The negative micro-management spiral has to be avoided and the common fisheries policy needs to be fundamentally altered, as the discard issue seriously discredits it.
Solving the problem of discards is beneficial for all actors concerned, particularly the fishermen.
It is possible to implement bans, as the examples of Norway and Iceland show us.
I am pleased that the report emphasises that fishermen and other stakeholders need to take responsibility and ownership concerning any policy to eliminate discards.
New ways to monitor fishing vessels could be used, such as electronic logbooks and the use of CCTV on the perimeter of fishing vessels, which has been piloted in Canada and New Zealand with some success.
The only successful way to achieve implementation of any eventual discard ban will be through the involvement of the fishermen in monitoring and controlling and, above all, by peer pressure to ensure a level playing field.
I thank the rapporteur for all his cooperation and this balanced report, which I commend to the House.
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President, discards are an appalling waste.
Vast quantities of fish are thrown away every year in European fisheries around the world: as much as seven to eight million tonnes.
Doing nothing to reduce discards is not an option and we now have the Schlyter report as an own-initiative response to the Commission's 2007 communication.
The Commission's communication is welcome, despite the delayed action, and the Commission now intends to act quickly, with certain aspects to be included in a new technical measure regulation in 2008.
In an ideal world we would move straight to a complete and instant ban on discards.
But the reality is more complicated.
Mr Schlyter's report recognises the complexity of dealing with the problem of discarding fish and I really welcome his inclusive approach.
It highlights practical aspects including the cost of dealing with discards and what to do with landed discards, the costs of introducing more selective gear, the implications for the total allowable catches and quota regime if discarding is banned, and the need to give fishermen incentives to fish in a more sustainable way.
It acknowledges that, since both the causes of discards and the measures needed to reduce them vary from fishery to fishery, no single solution will work throughout the Community.
An amnesty on discards is not the solution as it may create a market in discards instead of encouraging fishermen to fish in a sustainable way.
Given the levels of overfishing and concerns over fishing stocks including cod and bluefin tuna, we still need good management of existing stocks.
The report also places the discards issue in the broader context of the problem of by-catches of seabirds and of sharks and it calls for a significant range of pilot discard projects with a geographical spread.
I call on colleagues to support this report which makes an important contribution to dealing with the disgrace of discards.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the ALDE Group warmly welcomes the content of Mr Schlyter's report, which is to be commended for its sensitive, yet highly practical, approach.
Members of the public find it almost impossible to understand just how it is that we can allow fish to be caught and then thrown back dead into the sea.
Fishermen too have major concerns with the fact that this kind of action is, to some extent, forced upon them, for the current combination of rules and technical possibilities means that some fish are simply not wanted on board.
Sometimes this is because they are of insufficient economic value. We must make an early and concerted effort to prevent the kind of discarding that results from attempts at high grading.
I suspect that there is already less temptation to this practice in those fisheries where days at sea are limited.
Sometimes, though, discarding is the outcome of conditions we ourselves impose, for example minimum landing sizes, and restrictions on quotas.
Of course, if we are serious about conservation, we need total allowable catches.
But, in my own view, we need to look seriously at the methods we employ to keep fishing within the limits that are set by those TACs, to determine amongst other things, just how far there is an interconnection between the establishment of quotas and the problem of discards, particularly where mixed fisheries are concerned.
This, as well as the adoption of the measures suggested in the report, must of course be undertaken with the full engagement of stakeholders.
Without that, we cannot hope for success.
The industry is already leading the way.
I am particularly proud of the Scots, for their voluntary system of real-time closures.
We need proper incentives to positive actions of this kind for a great deal remains to be done.
I trust that Parliament will give its full support to the report and that the Commission and Council will take matters forward in the manner it recommends.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, I should like to say that I approve of this report; to my mind, the rapporteur has worked out a practical, comprehensive approach to the problem of fisheries discards at sea.
But things are not so easy, and everyone is thinking about the new methods to be applied.
It is time to put an end to the volumes of talk about this matter and take action.
There are plenty of practical suggestions in the report and they could be put into operation.
The one thing that we definitely cannot do is to do nothing.
We have to act for as long as fisheries discards pose a problem.
I should also like to ask the Commission ensure that small fishermen do not incur any additional cost on account of measures to resolve the problem of these discards.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, the common fisheries policy (CFP) has been a miserable failure.
It has failed to conserve stocks, it has failed to sustain our fishing-dependent communities and it has failed to win public support or credibility.
One of the main reasons for that is the scandal of discarding.
The CFP quota system itself is a direct cause of discarding.
It does not measure the amount of fish caught; it only measures the amount of fish landed.
That said, I broadly welcome this report by Mr Schlyter.
In particular, I strongly agree with the principle of positive incentives giving some reward to those fishermen who take steps to reduce or eliminate discards.
I also agree that measures must be tailored to different types of fishery.
It has long been a major flaw of the CFP that it has been over-centralised and inflexible.
I draw attention to paragraph 15, which welcomes the voluntary real-time closure scheme introduced by Scotland, an excellent example of the kind of initiative which should be encouraged and incentivised by the CFP at least for as long as we are stuck with it as a management measure.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, discards are just one aspect of the nightmare that is the CFP.
The EU, through its ill thought-out policy, is destroying livelihoods in developing nations across the world.
The export of fish is significantly more important to the developing world in trade terms than other commodities such as rice, coffee and tea.
Mauritania, for example, is dependent on its fishing industry for half of its exports, which represent 15% of its GDP.
But, having devastated Mauritanian waters, the Commission now wants to dump its deal.
It does not think that these now sterile waters are worth EUR 86 million a year.
This denunciation of a fisheries agreement is supposed to be a secret; well, it was until now.
I think African people should know about the EU's shabby and dishonourable plans.
It is colonialism at its most vicious, and I accuse these institutions of racism and exploitation of vulnerable societies.
President Barroso's non-imperial empire is not as benign as he would have us believe, so, if you want to move forward, discard Giscard and dump the Lisbon Treaty as well as the CFP.
Madam President, the scandal of discards is one of the EU's own making.
Impossible quotas and restrictions are imposed in mixed fisheries, prohibited stocks are inevitably caught and in consequence they are dumped back - dead - into the sea.
And all this while hunger prevails in many parts of the world.
For years the EU has wrung its hands over this but, frankly, has done nothing to stop it.
Such fish, I believe, should be landed; they should be sold at a fixed price, sufficiently low to discourage deliberate catching and sufficiently high to make their landing worthwhile.
Also, it is sensible and right that we should reward the use of more selective fishing gear.
But I do most positively reject any blanket discard ban as translating into yet another device of driving more of our fishermen out of business.
We have ruminated on this issue for years.
Now is the time, at last, to do something about it.
(ES) Madam President, in general terms I support the rapporteur's report as an expression of the long-standing concern about the rigidity of the common fisheries policy when it comes to tackling problems which are entrenched in our fisheries management system, of which discards are simply another example.
In particular I support the paragraphs advocating a fishery-by-fishery introduction of reductions in unwanted catches and discards, and their gradual elimination, and for any ban to be introduced only when it has been ascertained that there is no alternative, as the Council and all the regional consultative committees have said.
We could not adopt another approach and we could not move to a full blanket ban on discards within a management system which encourages them, both through the rigid TAC system and quotas in force, and through the absence of adequate technical measures which constitute a fundamental factor in preventing by-catches, the review of which we have been waiting for years so that they can be adjusted for the Atlantic.
What I cannot accept, Madam President, is Amendment 10, which would allow the creation of a parallel fishery market based on discarded fish, which would therefore be unlawful.
I think we should remain firm in defending the principle of non-commercialisation of discards as set out in paragraph 32 of the report, as have countries with a longer history in this matter such as Norway.
Incentives to prevent discards must be of a different kind: for example, incentives aimed at reducing them to a minimum through the use of more selective gear.
It is much better for a juvenile fish to continue to live in the sea and grow up to feed people or other fish instead of being discarded and the subject of negotiations on fishmeal production.
(EL) Madam President, I should firstly like to express my satisfaction with the draft report on fish discards and to stress that this is one of the most important problems in European and international fisheries.
Allow me to make a couple of points about the report.
I believe that, apart from the points suggested, a common policy for the final elimination of discards must be implemented.
This policy should emerge from a study of the problem in all the fishing countries of the EU, and should incorporate all national studies and global research.
In order to tackle the problem in a radical way, the EU must immediately finance a study on all fishing equipment, types of fishing and kinds of catch.
The EU must also commission specialised research institutions to conduct it.
This will enable the EU to impose the best and most efficient solutions centrally, through regulations, on Member States.
If this does not occur, I fear that the problem will be considered and then shelved, while all the fishery stocks are devastated.
(FR) Madam President, I should also like to say how much I approve of the approach suggested by our rapporteur to remedy the rightly criticised waste of resources in the current practice with discards.
Whilst drawing up his report, Mr Schlyter has been conscious of the effects that the immediate implementation of a total ban on discards might have, first of all, on the fragile financial equilibrium of those working in the sector and, secondly, on monitoring of its implementation by the Member States and the Commission, obliging them to tighten up methods of supervision that do not conform to the budgetary rigour required of them.
For that reason, he thought it more appropriate to propose the gradual introduction of a series of measures to encourage the fishermen themselves to alter their fishing methods and equipment, an approach strongly approved of by the Commission.
(inaudible) ... from the outset, I think that is highly ambitious.
Can I also congratulate Mr Schlyter and Mrs Doyle for the great amount of work they have both done on this report?
I am delighted to support Mrs Doyle's land-all policy, whereby fishermen will be compelled to land everything they catch.
It has many benefits.
Scientists will get a much clearer picture of what fish are being caught and where, which will enable more accurate conservation and recovery plans to be devised.
Also, when young, undersized fish are landed, fisheries inspectors could immediately call for a temporary closure of specific fishing grounds to avoid further pressure on immature stocks.
Under this policy, undersized fish and other species which previously would have been discarded could be sold to the processing sector, which is desperate for raw material to supply the fishmeal and fish oil industry.
They would be paid - through a regional compensation fund - a token amount, say about EUR 50 a tonne, which would not be enough to encourage targeting these fish and creating the black market that Ms Fraga EstÃ©vez fears, but would be too much to throw them, dead, back into the water.
The whole operation could be policed by attaching weatherproof CCTV cameras to every vessel.
In an industry already constrained by limitations of the number of days that can be spent at sea, time spent catching and sorting fish of no commercial value is regarded by fishermen as valuable time lost.
So I think fishermen will support this proposal.
(ES) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Schlyter for his work and I am particularly glad that several of the amendments I put forward have been incorporated into the text of the report we are debating today.
I refer in particular to the amendments stating that discards are not only to do with the use of a particular gear type, but are also influenced by the nature of the fishery concerned, as in the case of European fisheries, almost all of which are multispecies in nature, where the risk of discards is higher.
Therefore, any measure which is adopted must be case-specific.
Also thanks to my amendments we can see from the report that discarding is caused by a range of factors, including excessive fishing effort, and the current TACs approach requiring fish for which there is no quota to be discarded.
Measures must therefore be taken to prevent species of legal size which are inevitably caught from being compulsorily discarded owing to the lack of a quota for them.
Having said this, I would like to warn Mr Schlyter to tread carefully, because after the criticism he made in his speech of fishermen and the selfless, age-old tradition of fishing, I am not sure what we are doing here or if Mr Schlyter is going to put the Commissioner, the members of the Fisheries Committee and fishermen out of a job. (That's a joke, Madam President).
Madam President, I thank Mr Schlyter very much for his report.
I think it is excellent.
Can I also thank the Commissioner for his points at the beginning, where he is moving towards a discard ban, because he is very well aware that I have seen him many times, as many other Members of this House have, about bringing in a discard ban, and I think it is high time we did it.
I also think that, at the end of the day, if we can protect fisheries' stocks, then actually it is better for fishermen in the long run, because we do have to have sustainable fisheries.
Of course the scientific advice that we are using can very often be flawed.
Therefore, the landing of all catch and by-catch so that it can be thoroughly investigated will actually give us a much better idea of what is in the sea.
I also think that some of the practices, such as pair trawling and others, which do have an awful lot of by-catch, again, will emphasise what is happening.
Of course, a lot of trouble catching dolphins, sharks and porpoises and many other things will be highlighted in the by-catch that is landed.
So, if we can bring in the right amount of carrots to encourage it to be landed and not too much to encourage by-catch, then I think this is the way forward.
So I welcome the Commissioner's support for this report, I welcome the report itself, and we should all support it.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Members for their interesting comments, which demonstrate once again that we share the common objective of eliminating this appalling practice.
As I stated before, our proposal will be gradual but effective.
Realistically speaking, we simply cannot bring about a discard ban overnight.
However, as one speaker said, doing nothing is not an option.
And, undoubtedly, during the course of this year we will be coming up, hopefully, with three legislative proposals on reducing discards for specific fisheries, apart from incentivising and encouraging Member States to come up with pilot projects, by virtue of which we could achieve the introduction of a reduction in discards or even, possibly, discard bans.
The example of Scotland, which was adopted by the Council in December, was a very laudable one.
Concerning the point that was made on positive incentives, I agree that these are important, but we need to find the right mix and the right levels, because otherwise they could be counterproductive, and we could end up with a situation whereby we encourage more catches when, for sustainability reasons, we would want to reduce them in order to reach MSY levels.
I would also like to point out that I could not agree more that our proposals must be tailor-made to the specific fisheries and must contain in-built incentives, as I said, and support for the changes in behaviour that fishermen will have to adopt.
Indeed, already, in our TAC and Quota Regulation, we adopted incentives for fishermen to adopt more selective methods, thus avoiding discards.
In the very first intervention and in others that followed, the point was made that discards are caused by the common fisheries policy.
I would like to state that this is not really correct, because the causes of discards can arise form the high grading of fish by fishermen for the purpose of getting better quality fish, which is done independently of quotas, and the catching of juveniles, which is also independent of quotas.
It is only where there is exceeding of catch quotas, and again this depends, because if it is a clean fishery and the quota is exceeded, then the quota is set for purposes of sustainability.
It is, in reality, where you have a mixed catch, and you have one of the types of catch which has a low quota for sustainability reasons, and the other catches targeted, that you have discarding of fish as a result of the TAC and Quota Regulations.
These are the aspects which we would like to address in order to introduce more selective gear, so that the catches can become even cleaner - which is one of the methods whereby discarding could be effectively reduced.
I would also like to point out that, according to FAO estimates, discards within Community waters are around one million tonnes.
Worldwide they are around eight million tonnes.
These are very conservative estimates.
When one takes into consideration that the system that we operate is producing less than one tenth of all discards - taking into account the TACs and quotas - I think that there are various other factors which contribute to discarding apart from the system operated by the common fisheries policy.
Having said that, we are actively seeking ways and means whereby we improve the management so that the TACs and quotas operate in a way whereby discards are reduced to an absolute minimum or are completely banned.
Finally, on the point raised concerning Mauritania, I would like to say that we have just signed a new memorandum of understanding with Mauritania, and this will lead to a new protocol which will guarantee for Mauritania the same amount that they have under the existing protocol but which will reflect the actual fishing possibilities in a more realistic way.
So we will be paying Mauritania to help it strengthen its fisheries infrastructure and its economy in general under the development funds, so that, in that way, Mauritania is guaranteed the full amount.
But at least what we pay for fish would reflect the actual amount of fish that it is possible to catch in Mauritanian waters.
rapporteur. - (SV) Thank you, Madam President.
Yes, Commissioner, clearly there are many reasons why fish are thrown overboard, but I still think that this has been exacerbated by aspects of our fisheries policy.
There is one thing I want to ask you: I do not really understand why you are against Amendment 4 when it points in the same direction you yourself want to go in.
The report currently states that a discard ban should only be adopted after other measures have been tried.
The amendment means that the implementation of a ban on discards would only take place after other negative incentives had been applied.
Thus we start from the same premise if Amendment 4 is approved, namely that we have a policy on the banning of discards but that its implementation is dependent on the conditions in each individual fishery.
I do not really understand why you said you were opposed to Amendment 4, but perhaps we can talk about that again later.
What makes me optimistic is that in spite of everything we have a kind of consensus.
I have spoken with both research workers and fishermen.
There is a good consensus here on what needs to be done.
The Commission and Parliament are on the same lines and the fishermen and environmental organisations are also on board.
It gives me a certain optimism.
Perhaps all the interested parties will cooperate and we shall indeed get a result.
A split vote has been requested on Amendment 10.
It will therefore be possible to take account of what Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez said if we can vote for the first part and against the second part.
I thank you and I thank all of you who have taken part in the debate and in the work.
It has been a pleasure to work on this report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 31 January 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, the amount of fish discarded, which the rapporteur estimates as possibly a quarter of the total catch, is a serious environmental and economic problem to which we cannot remain indifferent.
The scale of the phenomenon points to an enormous waste of resources and serious damage to biodiversity caused by irresponsible human interference.
Tinkering with the rules will not achieve the desired result.
The situation requires much more wide-ranging action - a complete change of approach and thinking on the matter.
We must clearly define our aims, adopt correspondingly coherent CFP instruments, and ensure the necessary funding.
We must avoid a situation like the present, where the side effects of certain legal instruments are simply ignored.
The imposition of total permissible catches or minimum sizes of fish that can be landed (especially in the case of mixed catches), is a case in point, since it leads to discards.
I fully agree with the rapporteur's view that our approach to limiting discards should largely consist of incentives to fishermen to look for new, innovative solutions in fishing methods and gear.
Greater use should be made of their experience and the knowledge of the scientific community.
I would emphasise that an effective information campaign will be crucial to the success of this strategy.
Without understanding on the part of the fishing industry of the fundamental importance of eliminating excessive discards, and without the general support of fishermen, the strategy is doomed to failure.
European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (debate)
The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation by Gerardo Galeote, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development (Î-0076/2007/rev.1 - Î6-0008/2008).
author. - (ES) Madam President, an essential aspect of the revision of the rules on the Structural Funds, which the Committee on Regional Development has carried out successfully, was to make the promotion of territorial cooperation the priority objective of our cohesion policy, whose funding, I note, was increased by the European Parliament as part of the negotiations on the financial perspective.
Because of this the calling of this debate cannot come as a surprise to anyone: it was unanimously called for by the political Groups, and I am opening it on behalf of the Regional Development Committee.
I thank the Commissioner for attending and regret that the Council has been unable to join us in a debate which affects it directly.
Drawing on the experience we gained during the years of the INTERREG Programmes we can conclude that the absence of an initiative-taking structure with its own legal personality has hindered its effectiveness, and we welcome the Commission proposal to establish European groupings of territorial cooperation as instruments with their own legal personality.
In a united Europe of States and citizens, regions, as the Treaty of Lisbon says, have their highest form of expression in these bodies.
Admittedly, even when under examination by the Council a number of Member States expressed reservations about the usefulness of European groupings of territorial cooperation.
It is up for debate whether the nature and content of the regulation as adopted are too vague, and whether it introduced a degree of legal uncertainty by making its application subject to domestic law in too many instances.
It might be said that the way that some Member States deal with a complex situation depends on their degree of decentralisation, which requires them to identify strategies in the field of territorial cooperation.
However, it should be noted that Regulation 1082/2006 was adopted in July 2006, one year after it was adopted unanimously by the European Parliament on a proposal from our colleague Jan Olbrycht, and has been binding in all Member States since 1 August 2007.
The Member States therefore had six months to make the necessary legislative arrangements.
According to the information available, however, and the Commissioner will correct me if I am wrong, not even ten Member States have taken the necessary measures to ensure that the regulation has full effect now.
It is common knowledge that it is the European Commission's duty and responsibility to ensure effective implementation of European law and to intervene to remove barriers which may hinder its implementation.
Explanations, suggested informally, that the principle of subsidiarity prevents measures being taken against defaulting States will not be accepted: if they were, the Member States could delay or refuse to implement any Community legislation which they viewed as inappropriate or subject to challenge.
Therefore, Mrs HÃŒbner, through our question to the European Commission we demand that Parliament should be clearly informed of the problems encountered by the Member States in the implementation of this regulation.
Which Member States are not introducing the measures necessary for this regulation to be implemented appropriately, and what measures has the European Commission taken or is it considering taking, specifically initiation of infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice to ensure that all Member States comply with the regulation and to prevent the funds allocated being jeopardised by some States' inability to comply with the established rules?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by saying that the deadline of one year for the adoption of national rules was, in fact, very ambitious.
If we look into other regulations establishing legal bodies, it can be seen that the deadlines foreseen are usually between three and four years.
So this is something which we also have to take into account.
In order to accelerate the whole procedure, the Directorate General for Regional Policy has prepared a questionnaire covering the elements of the regulations which have to be taken into account in the national rules.
This questionnaire was sent in March 2007 to all Member States via the networks of the members of the Committee for the Coordination of the Funds (COCOF).
The questionnaire was also subject to discussions with Member States during the COCOF meetings twice last year: once in April and then in the middle of July.
So where are we today with the adoption?
We have six Member States that have adopted appropriate national rules: Hungary, the UK, Bulgaria, Portugal, Romania and Spain.
In another four Member States, the finalisation of the process of adoption of national rules should take place very soon: France, Luxembourg, Germany and Belgium.
Of the remaining 17 Member States, 15 have already launched either the parliamentary or the government adoption procedure.
We have, however, two Member States - Denmark and Estonia - where we do not have any information on the process.
They are expected to respect the deadline of mid-February as fixed in the Director General's letter, which was sent to all the Member States, in which we request information on the communication on the adoption of the procedures of the rules by the deadline of 14 February.
In the same letter, in which we gave this deadline of mid-February to those Member States that still have to inform us whether they have adopted or what the calendar of the adoption is, we also inform the Member States of the preparation process for the interinstitutional EGGC seminar, which, together with Parliament and the Committee of the Regions, will be held on 19 June in Brussels under the Slovene Presidency.
We have also encouraged them to participate in the EGGC expert group which was set up by the Committee of the Regions.
On the possible infringement procedure, let me say firstly that this is a very specific regulation: it is not a directive.
This is a regulation of direct applicability in all 27 Member States, which requires some additional action from the Member States and not merely the adoption of the implementing rules.
After 14 February, when we have received the responses of individual Member States - especially those whose agenda for adopting the necessary regulations we do not yet know - on which any decision of the Commission to start infringement procedures will depend, we will consider our position again and see where the infringement procedure will start.
In any case, we will, of course, also be carefully monitoring the application of the regulations when they are in place.
But let me say - and I think this is a very important part of this whole process - that, in the mean time, the first EGGC was established last Monday between France and Belgium, although the national rules have not yet been adopted, because this regulation is directly applicable and regional and local authorities have the right to set up the groupings.
National rules need to identify the ex ante check procedure, including the designation of a competent authority that would receive the request of the regional or local authority to participate in an EGGC.
We have today around 30 examples of programmes of projects across Europe where the option for EGGC is already envisaged.
There are also regions that have already signed the letter of intention.
A great deal of preparatory work is going on, so we expect that the process will gather momentum once the finalisation of the national implementing rules is completed.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Commissioner, I had the honour to be the rapporteur on the regulation that established the European grouping of territorial cooperation as part of the European legal system.
I witnessed and took part in many discussions concerning the new possibilities opened up by territorial cooperation on the basis of the new legal instrument.
The arguments stressing the new possibilities were accompanied by fears of an organisational and political nature, especially on the part of representatives of the Member States.
Finally, a regulation was drawn up that satisfied both supporters and sceptics.
Realising that the introduction of this new type of legal entity into national systems would give rise to complications, the Member States agreed on a deadline by which work on the corresponding national legislation had to be completed.
That deadline was not met, and so far only a few states have finished the task, among them Bulgaria and Romania, who were obliged to accept the regulation as part of the acquis communautaire.
Under the terms of the regulation itself, the Committee of the Regions is monitoring the implementation and functioning of European groupings of territorial cooperation and is already in possession of interesting information on preparations for the creation of the new bodies.
On the basis of the information available, I can say that there is a need for the European institutions to play a particularly active role - not only the Commission but the Council above all - in persuading governments to take the action which they are obliged to carry out and on which they have previously agreed.
It would not be beneficial if implementation were to be based on judgments resulting from complaints to the European Court of Justice.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, from the outset the INTERREG initiative was the germ of a truly polycentric idea of the European space through cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.
The establishment of this new legal instrument, the EGTC, was born of difficulties which this type of action encountered as a result of the different systems and different procedures in place
The solution reached by the European Parliament after almost two years of legislative work permitted and permits public authorities and public bodies to register as bodies with legal personality recognised Union-wide.
The Member States were, as has been noted, required to take a number of measures by 1 August 2007.
Given the very obvious delay, in July last year the Committee of the Regions held a seminar to study the situation, to which I was invited as rapporteur; at the seminar, as a sign of the European Parliament's willingness to cooperate in the search for a solution, I tabled a question which Mrs Krehl signed with me and which sowed the seed for the debate we are having today.
Commissioner, I can say today with pride that my country, Spain, and my region, Galicia, together with the northern region of Portugal, are pioneers in this and a blueprint which other European regions can follow.
For that reason I would like to ask you how the European Parliament can work with the Commission to encourage countries which have not yet done so to adjust their national legal systems and sign up to and form territorial groupings of this kind?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) During the debate about this regulation we were aware that the key point was the issue of the choice of legislation to be used for the acts adopted within the framework of territorial cooperation.
The aim of the regulation was to enable the cooperating partners to use legislation which would have same effects in both countries, because until then the method of simultaneous application of two legal systems had not been effective.
In this respect, the regulation is clearer than any other earlier document of a similar nature. It means that the law of the place where the seat of authority for cross-border cooperation is registered will be applicable, if such an authority has been established.
We were aware that this regulation was not intended to be a new legal instrument, but a tool to be used in conjunction with other structures already in existence.
Now it is clear that this regulation is not going to have the same effects throughout the whole of the European Union and that, due to different conditions to be imposed by the States, it is very probable that various kinds of groupings of territorial cooperation will come into existence.
In order for the regulation to be applied effectively, it is necessary to adapt the national legislation in an appropriate manner in accordance with the provisions of Article 16.
Only if that happens can we really expect to see the effects of uniform practice in the longer term.
The Member States are therefore called upon to adopt legislation which will launch the development of territorial cooperation and improve the legal security of its framework.
In short, because of its incompleteness, the regulation will probably become some kind of legal laboratory for comparing practices and conditions as and when they are established by the States.
It would therefore be reasonable systematically to monitor instances where the regulation is applied and thereby simultaneously to develop a public database of European groupings of territorial cooperation.
(NL) Mr President, what are we actually doing this evening?
We are trying to take stock of the situation following a very clear decision taken by the European Parliament and between the three institutions in which we announced that there were now new instruments for improving cross-border territorial cooperation.
The national borders still represent scars from the past which sometimes run straight through communities and new development areas.
We need cooperation between universities, hospitals and so on in Europe.
We need new instruments, and if we analyse the legislation that has been introduced, the Member States have been given a great deal of latitude here.
This is why it is so disappointing - given the need to speed up cross-border cooperation - that so few Member States, which insisted on having all this freedom, are now actually using it.
Parliament is therefore quite rightly calling on the Commission and above all the Council, which is not here this evening, to take their responsibility and follow this up very quickly.
I am pleased that there are good examples from elsewhere - the Committee of the Regions was mentioned a moment ago - of how the process of integration can be speeded up without calling the national governments' legal systems into question.
I am firmly convinced that we need to take this approach further.
People have got cold feet: it all seems to be too difficult.
Just this evening we discussed the subject of energy efficiency in the built environment.
It took five years for the Member States to implement this.
In my view what we need here is a Community initiative to ensure that the seven Member States that have already implemented this regulation grow to 25 or 27 within a year, say.
This has to be possible.
This is why I want an answer from the Council, but the Council is not here this evening, which I very much regret.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, because of Hungary's special situation, it is particularly important for us to promote the practical application of cross-border cooperation.
It is for precisely this reason that Hungary was one of the first to formulate and introduce a national regulation corresponding to the Community Regulation creating the EGTC.
However, the application of the new instrument in practice is encountering difficulties, so we would like to set up a working group to prepare a handbook, in cooperation with our partners in the programme.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she would support an EGTC working group within the framework of INTERACT technical assistance and, if so, how this can be done.
Moreover, not only internal cross-border programmes, but also external IPA and ENPI programmes, are important for EGTC cooperation.
Our internal cross-border programmes have already been approved by the European Commission, and the programmes supported by the IPA will probably be approved in February.
However, we need to wait for the indices, to be prepared by the Commission, in order to finish planning the cross-border programme between Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, funded by ENPA.
I would also like to ask when we can expect the publication of the Commission's indices relating to the neighbourhood programmes.
Thank you very much.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, let me say how pleased I am to speak on this subject this evening, because when we considered this addition, tabled by Mr Olbrycht, I expressed my confidence in the report.
In fact this subject was discussed in the French Parliament yesterday and - this is worth emphasising, because it does not happen very often - all the political groups were in favour of the creation of this EGTC, and there were many examples showing how, in the north and south of France, in the Alps, in Lorraine, there was reason to put the EGTC into operation very soon.
As the Commissioner said, this was based in particular on the example of Lille, which last Monday signed an EGTC that will cover two million inhabitants in Belgium and France.
Why did that raise such high hopes?
It was because for three or four years our colleagues looked for legal possibilities without success.
With the EGTC, they found a solution.
We are now expecting that the 70 000 French people who work in Luxembourg every day, the 30 000 French people who work in Monaco and Italy, as well as in Spain and so on, will really be able to foster new forms of cooperation with the EGTC.
My colleagues and I would like to see the Commissioner urge on the States that are lagging behind.
Apart from the fact that they are subject to the requirements of the regulation, they can be told that some countries are already operating the system perfectly happily.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is to implement and administer cross-border, supranational and interregional cooperation measures.
It is no exaggeration to say that this new network is intended to improve the quality of people's everyday lives, to make our businesses more competitive, to extend the scope of our research and education centres and, last but not least, to preserve our environment.
There is no compelling need for the EU to provide financial support for EGTC measures.
This instrument will enable regional and local authorities to form cross-border alliances with their own legal personality - a significant innovation in terms of the scope for territorial cooperation.
The EGTC offers a unique opportunity to generate synergetic effects that transcend the institutional framework and to guarantee better, coordinated investments and uniform and efficient use of resources.
On 5 July 2006, as we know, this instrument was created by virtue of a European Parliament and Council Regulation.
By 1 August 2007, all Member States were to have enacted supplementary legal and/or administrative provisions.
The fact that only five or six Member States have adopted national rules gives us cause for serious concern.
The losers will be the potential committed participants who want to foster cross-border cooperation with their good ideas and innovative projects.
To that extent, the questionnaire was warranted, and we also urgently await information on this matter from the Council.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, territorial cooperation is the third target of the cohesion policy for the new programming period.
According to this target, cooperation is vital in the promotion of balanced, harmonious development within European regions.
The European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is a new means of endowing teams for cooperation between regional and local authorities from different EU Member States with legal personality.
The decision to create this means was not taken lightly; it was the response to technical and legal problems faced in cooperation programmes.
Now, unfortunately, six months after the deadline, local and regional bodies have not managed to set up a territorial cooperation grouping because Member States have unjustifiably neglected to take or have delayed taking appropriate measures to implement the regulation.
We must now send a crystal-clear message to Member States on the importance placed by the institutions on the correct implementation of the regulation in the new programming period, as well as on cooperation as a way of achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion.
(SK) Fifty years have passed since the first Euroregion emerged along the German-Dutch border.
Since then many other regions have initiated mutual cooperation.
They help each other to solve similar or identical problems that often occur in border regions.
They create new job opportunities and share their culture.
The Regulation establishing a European grouping of territorial cooperation that was approved in July 2006 seems to be a very good tool for regional cooperation and a step in the right direction.
It offers the regions flexibility in cooperation and has a positive influence on the population of the Member States, the economy and the business environment.
More is the pity, then, that the Member States have not transposed this useful Regulation into their legislation in spite of the fact that this should have happened by 1 August 2007.
Many regions are very interested in the European grouping of territorial cooperation because it gives them the opportunity to cooperate with other regions and at the same time offers them a significant level of autonomy in their relationship with governments and central administrations.
It has also a positive effect on the lives of the population in individual regions: one of the aims of regional cooperation is to facilitate more efficient development of human resources and so reach a balance in the development of supply and demand in regional labour markets.
We must not forget either that the EGTC will benefit the business world as well, namely by supporting development of the economy with the aim of improving its productivity and structure, creating new job opportunities and stabilising those that are at risk.
Individual groupings of territorial cooperation will be able actively to promote a rise in employment and social inclusion.
The Regulation simplifies and supports regional cooperation in the Member States of the Union and so facilitates economic and social cohesion.
This is a good thing and for that reason I urge the Council and the Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure implementation of this Regulation in the individual Member States.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is a new tool to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the Union.
It is an instrument for advanced, structured cooperation with its own legal personality which will have access to Community funding and resources from other sources.
The culmination in Braga ten days ago of the 23rd Luso-Spanish Summit was a decisive milestone.
Both countries are among the six which have already adopted the provisions necessary to implement the European Regulation of July 2006 effectively.
Galicia Council and the authorities in the northern region of Portugal, which had finished drawing up the draft agreement and statutes in November 2006, will soon form a grouping which will cover 6 400 000 inhabitants and will have its seat in Vigo.
They will take the lead in establishing a Euro-region with government bodies which will promote ambitious European cooperation serving as an example of re-generation.
Their efforts deserve recognition by the European Parliament.
(NL) Mr President, the EGTC, as has already been said several times, is an extremely useful instrument particularly for border regions.
I am very pleased, Commissioner, that you referred to the Eurodistrict project on the border between France and Belgium.
Mr Beaupuy also mentioned this.
The towns of Kortrijk, Doornik and Lille have signed a cooperation agreement just this week in order to work together in practical ways on projects that also involve the public.
Then there is transfrontier work, public transport, cooperation between hospitals and fighting crime - these are the sorts of things that people expect us to deal with on a practical level.
Various initiatives have also been taken in another border region - between Belgium and the Netherlands - to promote practical cooperation between universities using an EGTC.
The areas in question are Belgian Limburg, Dutch Limburg and the region of Aachen.
The idea is eventually to create one cross-border combined university with the help of the EGTC, using it to overcome or circumvent many of the existing administrative obstacles.
Mr President, Commissioner, the EGTC cannot solve every problem, of course, and I realise - as we have heard - that a lot of Member States have yet to start using it.
However, we should now look a little further ahead on the basis of preliminary experiences with this instrument, and think about what improvements we can make on the basis of this first evaluation.
There are some existing problems that we will have to overcome, such as the different social regulations that workers are faced with when they are working under an EGTC.
Commissioner, all I can say is that it is absolutely crucial for the Commission to keep pushing the governments that have so far failed to make this instrument operational.
(SK) Commissioner, the number of projects in border regions, both successfully completed projects and new projects currently being developed under the auspices of Euroregional groupings, proves that there are many development activities with a great deal of potential and that these activities could not be implemented without European assistance.
However, there must be clear rules, otherwise the money will not get spent.
I trust that this debate will encourage interested border parties to participate in the EGTC.
Any parties that have not fulfilled their obligations must be identified in the Member States.
The Commission must step up its efforts to ensure that cross-border cooperation is not damaged.
The Euroregions are cross-border structures that have long been in existence and completed tasks under Interreg in the previous programming period, notably in the case of small 'people-to-people' projects.
I do not believe that the Euroregions have failed.
I am convinced that with the active support of the Commission, the Member States, the regional and local governments, the chambers of commerce and industry, and all the people living in border regions, the Euroregions will use their experience to make use of this new EGTC tool.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank Members very much for their comments and also for all their support for this tool, and for their commitment.
Let me just remind everyone that no Member State has refused to implement this tool and this is, I think, very important.
It is absolutely clear that all of them have to implement.
We have, as I was trying to say in my introductory remarks, tried to move towards completion and accelerate the whole process through very different instruments.
Certainly, today we can still give encouragement directly through your active presence in your Member States and regions, which we have doing for the last year.
During all my visits, all my meetings, all the conferences - not only on territorial cooperation but also on the core of the policy - we have been encouraging, we have been talking and giving instructions.
We have worked a lot with regions to help them prepare for implementing this new tool for cooperation.
But I think today we are in the process.
I think the awareness among the Member States has greatly increased.
I hope that, with the recent impetus from the Director General's actions, we will have most of the national adjustments for the implementing regulations in place by June.
We have to remember, however, that any programme can transfer its management to the EGGC at any time of its existence, so no potential damage to the policy arises from the fact that the Member States have not yet implemented the requisite adjustments.
Also, any project can use this tool for the implementation of the project and, as we know, we can have new projects until the end of 2013.
So there is no threat here either.
This is not a consolation, but I would like you also to see that the fact that we have not yet completed all the implementing procedures does not cause damage in this sense.
What we see today is the great interest of other directorates general in the Commission that are eager to use this instrument within the seventh Framework Programme, but also within the CIT programme and in other policies as well.
It is important in your meetings at regional and local level to remind the regions that, even if there are not yet implementing rules in place, the recent example of France and Belgium clearly shows that the EGTC can be established and a Member State can implement and designate an ad hoc authority to play the role of the authority to which the regional and local bodies would direct themselves for information about the establishment of the EGTC.
Concerning the handbook on EGTC, INTERACT is working on the handbook.
In March there will be a conference in Brussels, and everybody interested will be invited to this seminar on the preparation of the handbook.
Concerning the Madrid Convention, we should remember that it has taken 20 years so far to ratify this convention and, if I remember correctly, not all of our Member States have ratified the Convention yet.
This regulation was renegotiated less than two years ago, and we are now in the first year of its implementation.
That, I think, would be the reaction to what you have been saying.
I would like to assure you that we are strongly committed, because we see the value added and we work with the regions.
This is why so many of them are also so well prepared.
We see all the value added of this instrument that you have mentioned.
However, of course we have to remember that it does not guarantee the money.
It is not a project, it is a tool that we want to use for the cooperation.
But, of course, the EGGC can receive Community funding according to the normal rules, under the European cohesion policy.
This is also important to bear in mind.
Again, thank you for your interest.
We are absolutely committed to completing this process as quickly as possible.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (GA) I wish to suggest that the Committee on Regional Development take initiatives and exert pressure for action enabling ability to be pooled in a European grouping of territorial cooperation with a view to bringing policies to light.
The new EGTCs will serve to enforce legislation in Member States, generate new dynamics in cross-border cooperation, and enable a higher degree of confidence and cooperation to be maintained beyond the limits of borders.
In my divided country a key role could be played by initiatives of this kind and other EU support schemes aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of partition on Ireland.
I fully support the sound thinking behind cross-border cooperation, as this is a European ideal.
There is a great need for Ireland to explore every avenue for cross-border cooperation because our border areas are in poor counties and the level of development is low.
We have spent a long time dawdling and making excuses.
Member States have a duty to help border areas to implement the ECTC legislation as quickly as possible
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the implementation of Community legislation by Member States is not a new one.
I daresay it affects the majority of Community policies.
Working out a common position of 27 countries at European level is in fact only the beginning of a laborious process of harmonisation and implementation of the principles adopted.
It is high time the Member States took responsibility for this process themselves.
The effectiveness of our joint endeavours at European level depends to a large extent on commitment and the implementation of recommendations by the national administrations of the Member States.
What is needed is cooperation between the different levels of our public administration.
I can safely say that, as Members of the European Parliament elected directly by the peoples of the individual Member States, we are ready for and open to every form of cooperation with our national and regional administrations that can improve and speed up the implementation of Community legislation.
We cannot allow matters like the strengthening of economic and social cohesion, which is one of the basic principles of the Treaties, to be marginalised - as is happening with the problem submitted to us today.
A proper EU regulation on territorial cooperation groupings has existed since July 2006, but to this day it is impossible to take advantage of it owing to the absence of corresponding legislation by Member States.

Closure of the sitting

Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)
(IT) I have received a request from Mr Hannan for an item on the interpretation of Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, yesterday the President announced an interpretation of Rule 19 which puts this House in plain violation of its own regulations.
We have now departed from the rule of law and given arbitrary power to the Chair to tear up our rule book and proceed as he sees fit.
This is plainly illegal under our own rules.
This Chamber may be sovereign but it must, nonetheless, follow its own rules.
This interpretation by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is going to be contested today.
It may come before this House in a vote.
If we vote in favour, collectively, we are voting to abandon the rules under which we proceed.
I would almost be tempted to compare it to the ErmÃ€chtigungsgesetz of 1933, but I think that would be disproportionate and perhaps a little rude to our President, who is a committed democrat and a decent man.
Let me instead quote the grandfather of British resistance to totalitarianism, Edmund Burke.
'They must be worse than blind who do not see with what undeviating regularity of system, in this case and in all cases, they pursue their scheme for the utter destruction of every independent power. ...
Their will is the law, not only at home, but as to the concerns of every nation. ...
They have swept away the very constitutions under which the Legislatures acted -'
(The President cut off the speaker)
(IT) Thank you.
I have taken note of your comments, but on this point on interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, as you know, there is already a vote planned for 11 a.m., so we will proceed in this direction.

Freedom, security and justice (annual debate) (Articles 2 and 39 TEU) (debate)
(IT) The next item is the debate on
the oral question by Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council on the 2007 annual debate on the progress made in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty) - B6-0006/2008), and
the oral question by Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Commission on the 2007 annual debate on the progress made in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty) - B6-0007/2008).
deputising for the author. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are having today is taking place, as you know, in a context characterised by two essential elements.
The first of these - I don't have to remind you - is the calendar.
Being generous, we have at best 16 operational months before the end of the European Parliament's current term.
So you see how, with such a tight timescale, we need to agree on the matters we hope to finalise together in the time that remains.
We cannot do everything; we will need to choose and stick to our decision.
The second element, Mr President, is even more significant from our point of view.
This is that the prospect of the entry into force of the new treaty, you know as well as we do, will lead to major structural changes in our area of competence.
I would particularly mention the removal of the artificial separation of policies in the first pillar from those in the third pillar, which will have the effect, in particular, of introducing codecision and subjecting measures that until now were mainly the sole preserve of the Council and fell outside the competence of the European Court of Justice to real judicial control.
You will therefore understand our impatience to see the new treaty enter into force as quickly as possible, since it represents both a strengthening of democratic control and a strengthening of the rights of citizens.
And you will also understand in the light of these two criteria, which are - I repeat - the strengthening of democratic control and the strengthening of citizens' rights, the reticence we feel in principle about dealing under the current treaty set-up with sensitive matters that could soon be dealt with under the provisions of the new treaty.
This reticence in principle is very real.
It runs deep, and it is widely shared by the different political groups represented both in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and in the more general setting of our assembly.
However deep it runs, this reticence is also, at least at present, quite measured.
We are not motivated, Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, by the perverse intention of delaying taking action on important matters that have reached maturity and the urgency of which is not in doubt.
On the contrary, we are willing to try to reach a kind of gentlemen's agreement, through genuine dialogue, that would give each of our institutions the safeguards and guarantees it believes necessary.
In our view, it should be possible to come to an agreement very quickly on some kind of interinstitutional legislative programme for 2008 and the first half of 2009, which would contain a limited number of common priorities in sensitive matters, would come with mutual commitments, and would enable us to benefit from the positive provisions of the new treaty, without bringing them in early.
Parliament already indicated a possible method of responding to this request during the vote held at the last plenary in Strasbourg on modifying the Staff Regulations and missions of Europol.
Indeed, President of the Council, Commissioner, it was by an overwhelming majority of 537 votes that Parliament adopted an amendment stipulating that this decision would be revised within six months of the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Of course, even though it was adopted by an overwhelming majority, this unilateral amendment is not binding.
However, as you will have understood, it is a very clear manifestation of our political will to open up a discussion and find solutions.
It is in this spirit that our committee confirms both its determination and its availability for a genuine interinstitutional dialogue.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I am happy to be here with you today and to take part in such an important debate.
The implementation of policies in the field of justice and internal affairs is of extreme importance for our citizens.
With the development of our society and modern technologies, the question of security has become one of the most important issues for our citizens.
I think that we, as representatives of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, have the same aims: to secure conditions for cooperation between Member States which will offer our citizens an appropriate level of security.
Two years ago we began debating two items of legislation which were intended to enable a giant leap in the quality of our cooperation.
The first was a decision to establish Europol as a European agency, and the other was to incorporate the Treaty of PrÃŒm into European legislation.
In accordance with the new legal basis, Europol will be able to respond more rapidly to changing trends in terrorism and organised crime and it will further improve its analytical capacity and ability to support the Member States.
This will substantially help in a more effective struggle against the organised crime and terrorist organisations which are active in several States of the European Union.
The incorporation of the Treaty of PrÃŒm will enable a faster exchange of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data from national databases.
The two previous Presidencies, Germany and Portugal, have done everything to assist the adoption of both items of legislation by the end of our three Presidencies.
In accordance with the programme which I presented to your colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are planning to reach a consensus on both items by June of this year.
In view of their importance, a delay in adopting them would not be justified, especially as we have already approved them and harmonised them among the Member States and among all three institutions to this current level.
As for the legislation still awaiting debate, the Presidency is willing to cooperate closely with Parliament on a case-by-case basis and in the spirit of joint responsibility for their adoption.
Both institutions will thereby share responsibility for the security of EU citizens and in other areas.
The Council is currently discussing proposals for legislation of general application to do with combating all forms of organised crime and terrorism.
This mainly concerns data gathering and exchange procedures and also applies to cooperation within Europol.
We are also discussing legislation relating to specific problems and specific criminal activities.
In addition to the proposal to incorporate the Treaty of PrÃŒm and the decision on Europol, we are currently building on the measures for preventing undesirable persons from entering the territory of the European Union.
I am personally involved in the efforts to accelerate the development of the second generation of the Schengen information system.
We are preparing to accelerate the adoption of legislation that will make it easier to use the visa information system.
In external affairs, we are working hard with the countries of the western Balkans and Russia to prepare regional assessments of threats from organised crime.
This month the Council started to debate the first of two proposals for directives on legal immigration.
After the first meeting of working groups, where the debate concerned highly qualified workers, the Presidency felt that there was a wide consensus on the application of the directive.
We hope that further debate will identify the key political issues by the end of our Presidency, and we will then hand the dossier on to the French Presidency so that work can continue effectively.
For two years now, Parliament and the Council have been debating the proposal for a directive on the return of third country citizens who are living illegally in the European Union.
The debate is focused on several specific issues on which the institutions have very different opinions.
The Presidency will continue to do its utmost to reach an agreement with Parliament that will enable the directive to be adopted as soon as possible, preferably at first reading.
However, we must be careful that this directive does not make the return procedures worse and thus reduce the effectiveness of our policies in the fight against illegal migration.
In deepening this dialogue with the countries of origin and transit, the Council will continue to strive for the ongoing implementation of global approaches to problems of migration, emphasising that they have to be included and that there has to be a geographic balance.
Our attention will thus be focused on north Africa and south-eastern Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the President of the Council and thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Deprez, for his introduction.
Clearly today we are not just discussing an assessment of the results for 2007, which in our particular area have been positive, in my opinion: we have opened up internal borders to more than 400 million EU citizens with Schengen enlargement; we have created and implemented the Fundamental Rights Agency; we have reached a very important agreement with Parliament on the Visa Information System; we have worked on immigration, as the Slovenian Minister Mr Mate mentioned, and on terrorism.
Just to give a statistic, in 2007 the proposals that fell within my remit and that I presented to you constituted almost 20% of all the strategic initiatives of the European Commission, which means that this area has been and continues to be of truly vast importance.
We have achieved everything that was in the strategic programme.
Today, in 2008, we are facing a challenge every bit as important.
As you know, the Commission identified 26 strategic proposals for 2008, and eight of these, so almost 30%, concern the area of freedom, security and justice.
This year we will deal with external borders: there will be a package of proposals in February to strengthen security at our external borders, along the same lines and using the same criteria as for the Schengen and visa information systems; we will carry out a comprehensive assessment of Frontex, which will enable everyone to learn lessons for the future too; we will, I hope, make some progressive and ambitious proposals on civil justice; we are discussing with the Slovenian Presidency what is known as e-justice, or how to give citizens better access to civil and criminal justice through the use of the latest technologies.
Of course we will continue to deal with immigration.
The initiatives of last year, on which a broad political consensus was reached, will be dealt with and developed during this year.
This year there will be the action plan on asylum, asylum seekers and the European system for the treatment of refugees; in July and November we will have the two comprehensive proposals.
We will be proposing a European strategy for the prevention of violent radicalisation, one of the key factors of a political strategy to fight terrorism; this will happen in June.
However, I think the political issue raised by Mr Deprez deserves a political response, which I will happily give.
2008 is a year of transition.
It is a year of transition to the Treaty of Lisbon and its ratification, with a view to its entry into force - which we would all like - in January 2009.
Then it is clear that the three requirements, on the one hand to work together with Parliament to assist this transition, and on the other not to slow down initiatives that are ready for action and on which there is consensus, and at the same time not to anticipate what the Treaty of Lisbon will say or do when it comes into force, must all be kept in mind.
So I believe that an interinstitutional political agreement will be necessary.
Clearly, this can be reached only if the Council, Commission and Parliament agree on the working method, even before agreeing on the specific priorities.
If there is political agreement on the working method, we can define common priorities together, and the priorities should be initiatives that have an immediate added value for citizens, that attract sufficient consensus, and that achieve the balance we want between the interests at play: security, safeguarding the security of citizens, and also promoting and protecting civil liberties - the usual political balancing act that is the challenge facing all of us.
I believe that the best working method is the one we have begun to explore with the Council: not working in six-month periods, but bringing together the trio of Presidencies, which the current and previous Presidencies have done, to look at initiatives over an eighteen-month period rather than a six-month period, because it is clearly the case that if we work only with initiatives over a limited timescale, we do not have the vision that should carry us - I believe - reasonably, at least to June 2009, because the date of the European Parliament elections is, in my opinion, the only real deadline we should be looking at.
So I am prepared to do this, I am prepared for a political dialogue with the Council and with Parliament to identify those things we can offer our citizens as an immediate response from among the 2008 and 2009 priorities, and those that deserve to be looked into in more detail.
This is how I believe we will demonstrate, without prejudice to the Treaty, that when the institutions work together they get there more quickly and with better political results.
This is the path I think we could all follow together.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate concerns European internal policy and I believe it is right to do what the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, has already done, and that is to take a brief look back.
2007 was a great year for European internal policy.
The opening up of the Schengen area has been a great success and we are also able to confirm to our citizens that if all the investigative authorities in Europe have access to one database system, this will not reduce security, but increase it.
Nevertheless, we must also look to the future, of course.
I read here that the SIS II was debated at the informal Council meeting in Slovenia under the Slovenian Presidency.
As I understand it, the central system is now once again being shelved.
Sections of the Commission appear to be ready, but now a new political group of specialised interior ministers is being set up to deal with the SIS II.
Their aim as regards SIS II is to make real practical progress in combating organised crime and crime in Europe.
Therefore, why do we have to delay any further here?
I am concerned that after enlargement we are falling into a black hole because everyone is satisfied that enlargement has turned out well.
I should like to point out that we in Parliament carried out an evaluation of the systems after six months and will also insist on doing so.
A second practical subject area in which I would ask for action to be taken is the issue of police cooperation.
As you know, unfortunately not all sections of the PrÃŒm Treaty have been incorporated into Community law, but in particular essential issues of police cooperation were not adopted.
Further progress therefore needs to be made here too.
We are awaiting proposals from the Commission regarding border protection.
I am looking forward to proposals regarding the entry and exit systems because it will be very interesting to find out how many overstayers we have in Europe.
One final point: we are to have a new treaty.
I should therefore like to encourage our Committee Chairman, Mr Deprez.
We shall gain the citizens' confidence in this treaty if we haul the decisions in force in the internal policy sector out from the back rooms of the Council and bring them into the bright light of this plenary sitting.
Here people will see how decisions are made.
Therefore, please accept Parliament's outstretched hand.
We are ready to cooperate.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, President of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can share Commissioner Frattini's approach to the debate.
We need to look to the future, we need to understand how we can manage the time left to us with a sense of responsibility and commitment shared by all the European institutions.
We believe that after years of debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, in which this Parliament has been critical of the clear democratic deficit - such a tricky area for the fundamental rights of citizens - we can welcome the signature of the new treaty, which finally creates a European dimension in this area, and which gives Parliament full legislative powers, including on judicial, criminal and police cooperation and on entry and residence policies.
For this reason, my group also believes that, even during the delicate phase of ratification, no institution can escape the fact that the framework has completely changed.
We know it is not possible simply to bring forward the entry into force of the Treaty, but we believe it would be a mistake politically to carry on working on highly sensitive dossiers in a way that sidesteps the democratic scope of the Treaty of Lisbon.
For this reason, our group also believes that a joint commitment from Parliament, the Council and the Commission is necessary to identify any dossiers of particular importance, not to block their passage but to guarantee that Parliament can be consulted with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and to integrate them into the new institutional framework.
I am thinking in particular of the important dossiers on which until now we have merely been consulted, such as the proposal for a European PNR system, the proposal to revise the framework decision on terrorism, the directive on the admission of highly qualified workers and the directive on a uniform procedure for the admission of labour migrants.
May I take a few seconds, Mr President, to express concern over what the Council was saying about the Returns Directive.
We appreciate the Council's availability and cooperation, but we believe that there are a few extremely delicate points.
One in particular is that 18 months' detention is not considered an improvement in the effectiveness of this directive, but an oppressive measure on which a good many in this Parliament will continue to express their displeasure.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we are looking at the progress that the European Union has made towards becoming this area of freedom, security and justice.
This means a development towards a Europe in which both civil rights are upheld and complex issues of law enforcement, such as terrorism and transnational crime, are addressed.
But, unfortunately, what we have had in the last 10 years is a failure to strike the right balance between security, freedom and justice, and actually rather a narrow definition of security.
Law enforcement needs to be better targeted and civil liberties need an upgrade.
For instance, the failure - in 10 years - to agree on a measure upholding minimum rights for suspects and defendants is a real hole in the record.
Advocate-General Maduro, in an opinion on terrorist blacklists - quoting, I think, from the Israeli Supreme Court - said, 'It is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws.
There are no black holes.
The war against terrorism is also law's war against those who rise up against it.'
It is a pity that the Council of Member States did not bear that in mind in considering our report from the Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition.
We have had no substantive response to that report.
I agree with Commissioner Frattini that we need an agreement between the Commission, Council and Parliament about the way forward in the transition from the unsatisfactory intergovernmental procedures in criminal justice to normal Community decision-making.
This is going to take a change of culture and attitude as well as procedures.
Some of the third-pillar measures in the pipeline, like PrÃŒm, data protection, EU P&R, are of low-quality in terms of both democratic scrutiny and civil liberties safeguards.
A lot of confidence is being invested in technological projects, either of exchange of data between Member States or of construction of new EU databases.
I am all in favour of appropriate data sharing, but I caution against over-reliance on technological quick fixes.
Do not let us forget traditional, intelligence-led policing; even if it is more difficult in making it work across borders, it should not be relegated to a secondary effort in the light of the dazzling allure of databases, because this raises big questions of data protection and data security.
I have asked Commissioner Frattini to consider doing a green paper on whether our regime of data security is adequate, particularly in the light of the scandalous losses of data in the UK.
He has declined so far.
I hope he might reconsider.
Also, can he consider the need for that in the light of the route of profiling that we are going down?
Commissioner Frattini does not acknowledge this, but the UK Government does quite openly say, 'we are doing profiling'.
Let us have a debate about what safeguards we need.
Finally, on the UK opt-out, I think colleagues in Parliament might appreciate - and certainly I, as a British MEP would - having some idea what the UK strategy will be in the use of the opt-ins and opt-outs, because I think that would be quite helpful in making clear that the UK intends to engage positively in justice and home affairs in the years to come.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the Irish Government is playing an active, central role in Europe in the fight against international organised crime.
Irish police forces are making their contribution through the European Police Office - Europol.
With a population of 500 million, in what are now 27 countries, it is vital that international borders should serve as a protection against the illicit activities of criminals.
To enable this to happen, there has to be solidly based intensive cooperation among police, customs, naval, and intelligence services, encompassing all of the Member States.
I should like to stress that the Lisbon Reform Treaty will in no way affect Irish neutrality.
Ireland is a neutral country, and Irish troops cannot be deployed overseas unless an appropriate resolution has been adopted in the UN and the necessary consent has been obtained - after a vote in the DÃ¡il Ãireann - from the Irish Government.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, my group would agree with much of what has been said, particularly the emphasis on the need for the protection of fundamental rights as a core basis of many of the decisions we would like to see taken in the remaining period of this Parliament.
My group would also agree that an interinstitutional agreement would be useful to avoid the sort of arbitrary use of codecision that we have seen on occasion, that sort of arbitrary use at the behest of the Council when many of us felt, because things could not be got through by unanimity, Parliament was being used as a sort of alibi.
We would rather see these sort of arrangements set within a proper framework - and within something that is not going to delay for five years much of the progress that we want to see happen.
In terms of the issues about fundamental rights, we are deeply concerned that one of the issues which does not seem to have been resolved in the Council is the question of procedural safeguards.
Many in this Parliament agreed to the introduction of the European arrest warrant, believing that procedural safeguards would soon follow.
Others who were obviously more sceptical said we wanted to see the safeguards first and then we would look at greater cooperation between Member States.
So we would like to know, please, when we can expect these measures, which are deeply important to all of our citizens.
We also share the concern voiced this morning on questions about data protection.
There are growing concerns about the lack of transparency and, certainly, growing public concern about the way in which data is being used and exchanged without any clear information to the public as to what exactly is happening.
I was slightly concerned, to put it mildly, to hear the Council talk about the issues of the Returns Directive, saying that some Member States do not want return to become more difficult.
Some of us might believe that what this means is that the Council does not want to see a safe, secure and open procedure put in place that guarantees the rights of individuals rather than simply, as in the case of some Member States, trying to meet targets through return.
We do not want return necessarily to become more difficult.
We want it to become a more open procedure which safeguards rights.
One of the issues with which we have concern, for example, is the use by some Member States of an automatic re-entry ban.
We also share the concerns on length of detention.
I welcome the statement that was made about the proposal on highly-qualified migrants.
At last we may see a positive measure on an immigration policy, a move away from what some of us see as a policy of deterrents that the Union has been following for some time.
At last we will get an agreement on something more positive and more open, even if it is only affects a small part of those people coming to the European Union.
But I would welcome a comment, please, on what is happening on the sanctions against employers.
Lastly, I would also like an answer to the question posed to both the Council and Commission on the comment about the UK's position on treaty reform.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I much appreciated the willingness of the Commission and also of the Council to reach an interinstitutional political agreement quickly in view of the new transitions we will be experiencing in the next few months.
From January 2009 this Parliament will be able to play an important role in freedom, security and justice, particularly in terms of the need for European citizens to be able to exercise democratic control over the choices being made within the area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.
We think that 2008 will be a year of transition, and therefore a number of priorities in terms of freedom, security and justice must be identified in the course of it.
I think we need to go forward with matters on which we cannot turn back, matters we need to insist on.
I am thinking about the need to introduce a common asylum policy for 2010 and the need to speed up the process that could lead to defining this common policy; I am also thinking of the need to come up quickly with a general plan for legal immigration, not just to encourage the admission of qualified or highly qualified immigrants, but to prepare a plan that covers all admissions to the European Union; I believe that we also need to focus on the freedom of circulation of men and women within the Schengen area, profiting from the results achieved in 2007, and to try to capitalise on these aspects.
I believe we also ought to try during 2008 to assess some of the choices that have already been made.
In particular I am thinking about two important questions.
I think that a genuine assessment must be made of the usefulness and effectiveness of Frontex.
It seems to me that an objective assessment could quietly bring us to admit that it has not produced the effects that the vast majority of this Parliament and Europe's citizens had hoped for.
In the same way, I think that an assessment must be made of the enormous quantity of databases at our disposal.
All too often, the exchanges of information are not of any value and sometimes the information is lost.
To conclude, Mr President, I think that we should probably also make a final assessment of the Returns Directive.
It appears that we have now reached the point of no return, and we probably need to change our strategy: to come up with an action plan and a plan for legal immigration, and then we will know how to kick out, expel and detain immigrants.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the questions to the Council call for particular attention to developments with regard to Frontex.
I have drawn attention to this issue repeatedly in the past.
This debate is therefore a good opportunity to raise our concern about Frontex once more.
I concur with Mr Catania's words in this regard.
Several national parliaments have urged the governments of the Member States to provide manpower and material for Frontex's activities.
Obviously, the Member States are not exactly champing at the bit to participate in operational activities, and I am therefore pleased that the Netherlands has finally agreed to deploy a frigate.
Hence my question: what will happen with the boat people and migrants after they are picked up?
Can the President-in-Office tell us how people intercepted in boats at sea will be dealt with?
We receive regular reports of the interception of boatloads of migrants; as a rule, these people are first brought to shore and taken care of.
Is it the Member State in command of the navy vessel who is obliged to grant asylum or take care of the reception of the intercepted boat people?
From the reaction of the Dutch State Secretary for Justice this week it can be deduced that there is still no definite answer to this question.
I should like greater clarification in this regard, as it is not right, of course, that Member States who provide material and manpower should have to bear the full burden.
President-in-Office, if you are unable to give us an answer to this question during this debate, will you do so in writing?
I now have another question for Commissioner Frattini.
It is easy for ministers of justice to promise to provide navy vessels, for example; but implementation is in the hands of the defence ministers, who are often lucky even to be informed of the promises made by ministers of justice.
Clearly, this gives rise to major coordination problems.
My question to Commissioner Frattini is this: what do you intend to do to avoid this kind of problem in future?
After all, it has taken a very long time for the promises made so long ago to show the beginnings of the slightest effect.
(NL) Mr President, quite rightly, the need for all manner of measures to increase the security of our citizens is extensively debated in this Hemicycle.
Frontex springs to mind in this regard.
However, let us not bury our heads in the sand, as Europe itself has become much less secure precisely because of the open border policy that has been pursued.
The fact is that this policy has tangibly strengthened the power of internationally organised crime without putting adequate measures in place to combat it.
That is not all.
European citizens have also fallen victim to waves of legalisation on the status of illegal immigrants that certain countries have decided to carry out.
This will certainly not reduce the disgraceful trafficking in human beings.
The area of security we are discussing here is, however regrettably, to some extent also an area in which criminals - particularly Islamic extremists - are given free rein.
The essential State competences in this field are all being increasingly eroded - competence with regard to legal immigration, for example.
This is unacceptable.
The Member States must retain total and unconditional control of their own labour markets, and there must be absolutely no restrictions imposed on the way in which they conduct their labour market policy.
(ES) Mr President, I think Mr Deprez has correctly identified the problem and Vice-President Frattini has provided the solution to that problem.
Strictly speaking we are facing a year of transition, but during that year of transition, to which we need to add six more months up to the end of the parliamentary term, we have some mature decisions to make that we cannot neglect.
This is why I think that the interinstitutional agreement is absolutely essential in order to be able to harmonise mature initiatives with the much needed and much desired codecision.
Therefore, Mr President, I think that the importance of initiatives such as those within the framework of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - let us bear in mind that, of the Commission's 26 strategic proposals, a third come under the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - gives us a huge responsibility when dealing with the draft legislation that we have under way.
This is why the much called for evaluation of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders deserves all our attention, as do all issues relating to migratory phenomena, concerning both legal and illegal immigration.
Civil and criminal justice to provide better services for citizens, Europol, a revised European Agency in the new framework of the Constitutional Treaty - not forgetting, Mr President, data protection in the third pillar - all of this merits the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice being harmonised in terms of both methods and time.
- (EL) Mr President, the Internet is the new battlefield.
According to the Commission and the Council, it is a battlefield for combating terrorism, and we do not argue with this.
For many of us, however, the Internet is also a battlefield for the protection of citizens' fundamental rights.
Of course, as we well know, the Internet is used by terrorists, but it is also used by millions of innocent citizens for discussion.
What they discuss also happens to be terrorism which, without justifying it, they are trying to understand: something we do all too rarely here, unfortunately.
So, notwithstanding the importance of a legislative initiative against the circulation of pro-terrorist propaganda on the Internet, this is also a highly sensitive issue.
Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have to tell you that this legislative initiative in its present form is somewhat problematic.
It does not require that a person spreading pro-terrorist propaganda do so intentionally and... 'and' that propaganda be likely to lead to a terrorist act.
Instead of 'and', your text reads 'or'.
In other words, should a member of the public try to make sense of terrorism that is being committed somewhere in the world, they risk ending up in trouble simply because 'somebody' believes that their words have led to an act of terrorism: that member of the public is accused, even though they have no intention of causing such an act.
This is something you must correct.
I should also ask you to explain whether the contents of our e-mails will be checked.
Who will check them to enable the police to judge whether this new law that you are promoting has been violated?
Let me remind you that in the case of data retention of telephone calls, you have repeatedly reassured us that the contents of our SMS messages and phone calls will not be monitored.
Will the contents of our e-mails here be monitored as a result of the measure you are promoting?
Another point I wish to emphasise is the European PNR system initiative.
My friends, we do not need it.
At least, you have not explained to us why we should need it.
We have the APIS; we have, as Mr Frattini has quite rightly pointed out, the VIS, a successful outcome of our agreement; and we have Schengen: so we know very well who is travelling where in the world today, and who is coming to Europe.
Furthermore, of the 27 countries in Europe, only 3 currently have measures in place for the possible implementation of PNR.
Where is the pressure to harmonise PNR legislation now?
Why are you promoting this measure so fanatically, even though the European data protectors have disagreed with it?
Why do you not sit down and discuss it with Parliament, with people who are set on fighting terrorism, but who might be just as concerned about protecting rights - if not more concerned, as we are sometimes accused of being?
- (DE) Mr President, what can be affirmed is the fact that not only do the Council and the Commission place greater emphasis on the term 'security' in their documents, but they also appear to have become increasingly aware of citizens' basic freedoms and rights.
We in Europe, however, can do as much work as we want on the common area of freedom, security and law when third countries' legal systems are apparently impeding us in this exercise.
I believe that the Commission, and specifically the Member States too, should be increasingly monitoring the extent to which the US legal system, for example, is impacting on the households of European citizens.
The Commission and the Council will find themselves faced with a question from me and some of my colleagues, asking how it is possible that mail transfer data from the United States, which to all intents and purposes should be used only for customs purposes, is being passed on to the security authorities.
The confidentiality of mail is one of the last bastions we have so far been able to protect.
I hope that the Commission in cooperation with the Council will be able to resolve the problem of a global approach to combating terrorism and organised crime not only from the security aspect, but also from the aspect of freedom, protection of citizens and elimination of the problems of conflicting legal systems.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the deputy chief editor of Corriere della Sera, Magdi Allam, who could hardly be accused of racism or Islamophobia, has raised a serious issue: the imams and all the requirements of the large mosque in Rome - funding and pay - are supported by the embassies of a number of Islamic countries.
Does this provide security in Europe, in one of its major capitals, against the genuine risk of the spread of extremist Islamic doctrines?
I do not think so.
Rather, I believe that there should be control of the spread of fundamentalist Islamic ideas closely linked to terrorism and that this is what the European Union should be looking at very carefully.
Terrorism: what do we make of the recent opinion of Advocate General of the European Court of Justice Poiares Maduro, which suggests that Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 on freezing the assets of those on the blacklist of members of Al-Qaida and the Taliban is unlawful?
I would like to restate the fact that this Regulation is nothing more than the application of UN Resolution 1390, adopted by the whole international community in response to the attacks of 11 September.
The civilised world wants to defend itself against the risk of terrorism: never drop your guard against the deadly threat of Islamic terrorism!
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have not made any considerable progress in the matters of freedom, security and law.
On the contrary: the governments are not allowing their citizens to have their say on the Lisbon Treaty through referenda and we are therefore moving away from freedom.
Why are citizens not free to decide whether they want their country's participation in EU decision-making to diminish?
Why are citizens not free to decide whether they want to see an end to their governments' vetoes in the areas of migration, energy and transport, as well as control over the European Central Bank?
Why do citizens of the Member States, especially the smaller ones, not know that it is going to be practically out of the question for them to hold the rotating presidency of the European Council?
Indeed, has anyone told them that in six years' time their country will lose its automatic right to have a Commissioner in the European Commission?
The Reform Treaty changes the pivotal European Union documents in a fundamental way.
If it is adopted just by parliaments, without referenda and nation-wide discussions, instead of freedom there will be unrestrained arrogance of the powers that be.
The European Commission should remind the governments of this.
(SL) Firstly, I would like to thank you for the very good presentations on this fairly complicated issue we are discussing today.
I would like to use this opportunity to draw attention to another field which we have not yet dealt with sufficiently clearly.
I am talking about the external borders of the European Union.
All the Member States which are now in charge of the new external borders of the European Union have invested great efforts in securing these borders properly in order to protect them and ensure that the infrastructure is suitable and facilitates implementation of the Schengen standards.
However, we have at the same time found that life at the border has deteriorated.
I would like to draw your attention to the reduced quality of life of people at the border, especially in less developed regions, and I would like to ask whether the Council and the Commission are planning any special additional measures to improve the quality of life in border regions so as to prevent people deserting these areas.
We are all very aware that if people leave border areas, i.e. if they are uninhabited spaces, they are also difficult to protect.
My second question is: At the committee meeting, the Council President mentioned that cooperation with the Balkan countries is also one of the important tasks on which the Council is focusing.
In this context I am especially interested to know whether implementing the Schengen standards and securing our safety will hinder cooperation between our police forces and the police forces within the Balkan countries.
(FR) Mr President, we are at a turning point for the European Parliament in the setting up of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice, and the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon allows us to strengthen democratic and jurisdictional control.
Obviously I wish to support the requests of my fellow Members to come up with a list of priorities we can work on using an early codecision procedure, on the basis of an interinstitutional political agreement.
Indeed, the full participation of the European Parliament can only improve the quality of decisions, and sometimes, as we have already seen, enable an agreement to be reached at all.
Obviously this cannot happen without the national parliaments being involved in this debate, and I propose that we also bring forward the strengthened role conferred upon them by the new treaty.
Another of our priorities, of course, should be data protection.
It will be no surprise to you that I am coming back to this.
Indeed, you know that we encouraged the adoption of the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar.
Naturally, we are pleased that the European Parliament is being consulted again on the subject.
However, we are extremely concerned about the mediocre results achieved in the Council on this text, precisely because of the unanimity rule.
Given that the pillars will soon be eliminated, and to ensure true protection of the private lives of our fellow citizens, do you not think that a solution would be to modify the existing directives on data protection so that they also apply to police and judicial cooperation?
It is particularly important to ensure a high level of data protection because this must also govern the proposal to establish a European PNR.
This is an important question I am putting to you and I would really like an answer.
(NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like full transparency from the Commission and the Council regarding the ongoing negotiations with the United States on a transatlantic data protection scheme.
It seems that now - at the end of the negotiation process - the Commission is going to ask the Council for a mandate.
This is the wrong way round.
Secondly, the PNR dossier is starting to turn into a shambles.
The need for the whole programme is far from well established.
The legal basis is unclear.
There is still no system for the protection of personal data in the third pillar.
Yet it would seem that this has not stopped the home affairs ministers from deciding on a European PNR programme.
Moreover, the European Parliament's representative, Mr Deprez, was not invited.
I should like to understand how it can be that the German Minister of Justice has at the same time declared that a European PNR programme would be contrary to the German Basic Law.
In my opinion, this dossier is far from ready; the European Parliament would first like to hear why this programme is necessary.
- (PL) Mr President, the most important event of 2007 in the area of freedom, security and justice was clearly the enlargement of the Schengen area.
Today we can say that expectations of easier movement across borders have suffered a brutal collision with reality.
Movement across the Polish-German border between Saxony and Lower Silesia is now problematic because of the enlargement of the Schengen area.
People are being accused at random of smuggling illegal emigrants and are being held by the police for hours on end like ordinary criminals.
Such accusations are being levelled at taxi drivers in the border area.
In violation of the law, they are being told to check passengers' documents.
Vehicles with a Polish registration plate are being subjected to checks lasting several hours.
The Schengen Agreement is being introduced on the Polish-German border in a way that discourages people from crossing the border.
This is not in line with the aim of that agreement and demands urgent action by the European Commission.
(RO) The efforts of the Commission and the Council to ensure the free movement of persons across Europe came to fruition in December 2007 with the extension of the Schengen area.
In the field of illegal migration, the draft legislation on common standards for the repatriation of illegal immigrants from third countries and the sanctioning of illegal migrant employers are sure to help reduce this phenomenon.
Concerning legal migration, the Commission has initiated legal measures by submitting to Parliament the draft legislation on conditions for entry and residence for highly skilled workers and the single permit procedure for third-country nationals.
I would like to draw attention to a topic that I believe to be of utmost importance: transitory measures are still in force, imposed by some Member States in order to limit the movement of the labour force from other European Union Member States.
It is all very well to promote a single policy to deal with legal immigration from third countries, but it is not normal to impose restrictions on EU nationals.
We cannot speak about a space of freedom if there are restrictions on the freedom of movement of the work force.
In my opinion, it is obvious that the directives on legal migration from third countries should be enforced, while at the same time lifting the restrictions applied to some Member States.
This can be done gradually by asking Member States that apply the legal migration Directive to repeal any labour restrictions that apply to nationals of other Member States referred to by the Directive.
Moreover, the concept of preference should be applied, so that European nationals would take precedence in meeting labour market demands.
Moreover, I believe a further distinction should be drawn between third countries, where nationals of neighbouring countries, especially of those countries included in the neighbourhood policy, would have priority.
I hope that the discussion between Mr Frattini and Mr Deprez that opened our debate, will lead to actual results and a positive activity on our part.
- (PL) Mr President, the birth of the Lisbon Treaty and the reform of the European Union are bringing about significant changes in the area of freedom, security and justice, although these were expected by EU citizens.
In particular, the subjection of this area to the competence of the European Court of Justice requires good preparation on the part of both countries and EU institutions.
Parliament is aware of this and is preparing itself for the new tasks, and especially for taking the majority of decisions jointly.
In this context I would like to ask the Council: are we to begin work on a common list of priorities in the area of freedom, security and justice, and if so, when?
I know that both the Council and the Commission have programmes.
Parliament, through my committee, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, also knows what needs to be done.
However, we need common, effective and transparent action, and a common list of priorities for the benefit of our citizens.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Portuguese Presidency for enlarging the Schengen area, and at the same time appeal for a regular evaluation of the functioning of this system.
Just a few weeks in, we can already see some incidental negative consequences alongside the excellent advantages.
These include the prohibitive cost of visas for citizens of third countries, particularly for Belarusians.
The cost of a visa - 60 euros - is an obstacle and makes it impossible for them to visit their EU neighbours; it also makes it difficult for us to carry out our neighbourhood policy, which is after all enshrined in the Reform Treaty.
Commissioner, this requires more than just monitoring; ladies and gentlemen, this must be changed.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to focus on something that may seem minor, but which has become seriously worse during 2007 and affects millions of people: security in European airports.
The European Commission and the Council have allowed and are allowing terrorism prevention in airports to be managed as if it were a transport policy.
Freedoms are being limited and rights restricted through procedures designed for the logistical and technical standards for aeroplanes and trains.
As a result citizens are being left with no protection against abuse and limitations of rights are being approved with no assessment of proportionality or evaluation of effectiveness.
Men and women are being treated, at times, like livestock at the checkpoints by security officers who do not know the rules they are applying or the exceptions to those rules, because the rules have been declared secret.
I ask the Commission - and Mr Frattini in particular - to re-establish their authority in this area; and I ask the Council to examine it seriously.
We have turned airports into areas in a state of emergency where neither the law nor the most basic guarantees apply, but rather police authority with no type of control.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to mention three matters that are particularly close to my heart.
The first concerns the way we are going to deal with the phase leading up to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Like all my colleagues on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would like us to reach an interinstitutional agreement on bringing forward the new provisions applicable to our area of competence.
Indeed, this seems to me to be the sine qua non for an effective and transparent collaboration.
The new rules on the role of the national parliaments should also be tried out this year.
As rapporteur on the Framework Decision on combating terrorism, I made a commitment to cooperate in a close and structured manner with the national parliaments.
On the subject of terrorism, an overview of the various texts already adopted would provide a better picture of their respective scope and how they relate to one another.
Furthermore, whilst the fight against terrorism has to be a priority for the European Union, so must the protection of fundamental freedoms.
I will therefore be extremely vigilant, when working on the framework decision, regarding the clarity of the definitions and terms used, to rule out any potential risk of infringing these freedoms, particularly freedom of expression.
Finally, I would like to say a few words about our future action on immigration.
The EU has for a long time been mainly concerned with equipping itself with a veritable arsenal of laws to fight illegal immigration, though this protective attitude towards its borders has not been counterbalanced by a policy on legal immigration worthy of the name.
I am therefore delighted with the initiatives adopted over the last few years in this area, and I hope that the political will to support a welcoming Europe will be as strong as it was to defend fortress Europe.
We are now going into the practice that the English call 'catch the eye'.
In any case, as I am also Vice-President responsible for multilingualism, I am going to try to talk to the interpreters, my friends the interpreters, to see how the term 'catch the eye' can be translated into other languages.
For now we will say that whoever wishes to speak may do so, if the President gives them speaking time by 'catch the eye'.
By 'catch the eye', then, I grant speaking time to Mr Cavada, who I am sure has much to say to us on this subject.
(FR) Mr President, I would first beg you to excuse this disruption to the agenda, or more precisely to the order of precedence. A train breakdown between Paris and Brussels nearly took me out of Europe, but it has been put right now, thank you.
Every year, we debate the progress that has been made on building the area of freedom, security and justice.
Today, however, this debate is of particular importance and that is why I want to present the reasons that led the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to table these two oral questions, to the Council and the Commission respectively, and to press the representatives of these institutions to provide clear answers to the questions we are asking.
If this debate is important, it is because with the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon last December and its entry into force planned for 1 January 2009, the policies linked to fundamental rights and the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice must and will undergo substantial changes, changes that Parliament - as you know, ladies and gentlemen - has been calling for incessantly for some years now.
Among these, I will mention the end of the pillar structure, allowing most of the procedures in the current third pillar to be dealt with at Community level, qualified majority voting to be generalised, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to be extended and the role of Parliament as colegislator to be strengthened; the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be binding.
To benefit fully from the potential offered by this new treaty, we need as of now to prepare a common interinstitutional strategy allowing us to draw up a list of the proposals to be negotiated politically in 2008 and officially adopted during the January 2008 - May 2009 period.
To conclude, Mr President, I would like to say that a strategy of this kind would mean that, once the new treaty comes into force, we will not constantly be having to amend proposals that have just been adopted, and it will guarantee full jurisdictional control for the Court of Justice and the full and complete involvement of Parliament in defining policies that go to the very core of citizens' rights.
As for the question you asked me, I am going to catch my own eye and think about it, to help you in my modest way.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for the questions you have asked here today.
Sadly, there is not enough time to answer them all in great detail, so I will try and touch on the most important ones.
I will first address Mr Weber's question relating to the SIS II system.
I would like to say very clearly that we in the Council feel that security in transferring from "SIS I for allâ to the SIS II system is of the utmost importance and we cannot allow data to be lost in any way or the operation of the system to be subject to any kind of threat.
That is why we decided on a gradual transfer from one system to the other, which, of course, entails development of the converter.
Consequently, that will somewhat prolong the period needed to bring the SIS II system into operation.
I think it is a very good decision because it will ensure data security and, of course, an improvement in the quality of the data which the new system will offer, this being the most important aspect of the SIS II system.
I would further like to touch on a question posed by a number of MEPs regarding cooperation between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
I think it is necessary for this cooperation to be close in most cases.
Naturally, we need some kind of political consensus and mutual relationship in order to establish and ensure an adequate level of security and the safety of human rights.
We need a valid and balanced approach, which is where the European Parliament plays an extremely significant role, and I can hardly imagine how we could operate without this close cooperation with the Parliament.
Naturally, we must be clear that the Treaty of Lisbon is still not in force.
The ratification process is underway.
It is a relatively sensitive process, perhaps more so in some countries than others.
However, we must work and operate in a way which will not threaten the ratification process in any of the Member States of the European Union.
Therefore, I think it would be wise, in this year leading to the application of the Treaty of Lisbon, to cooperate with one another and to divide the legislation we are debating into two sets.
One set consists of the legislation which is nearing conclusion and on which we have Parliament's opinion, or which has been fully concluded or is in the final stages of conclusion.
The other set consists of legislation which we are launching or will be launching shortly and for which we need close and regular cooperation with the Parliament.
I think this is the way to find an appropriate form of cooperation to ensure adequate security and a sufficiently effective method of operation and to lay down future working practices.
I would also like briefly to mention the Returns Directive and Frontex.
The technical discussions and negotiations on the Returns Directive will continue during the Slovenian Presidency and we have also agreed to hold political negotiations.
I hope, therefore, that we will find the necessary and appropriate political compromise.
I still hope that it will be reached and we have already been in touch with the rapporteur, Mr Weber, leading me to believe that the matter is progressing well.
Regarding Frontex, I would simply say that the evaluation of the Frontex work is in progress and the Presidency is planning a more detailed discussion at ministerial level during the conference at the beginning of March, when we will talk about Frontex and its future and evaluate its work so far.
After that discussion we will be able to give Parliament a more detailed report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this morning's debate has shown a shared willingness to work together on the part of all three institutions.
Therefore, not only is the working method important, but so is the merit.
So the wish expressed at the start by Mr Deprez, on which I would say there was a broad consensus including from the President of the Council, and which I personally agree with, is the right working method to use.
As I said at the start, in the Council the idea of working to a timescale not limited to six months has proved a success.
We should try to use it here too, because I think, from what people have said, that a number of subjects have emerged that are clearly a priority.
The fact that we cannot slow down the work towards setting up SIS II - the new generation of the SIS system - is apparent to everyone.
We need to go forward and, beyond the discussion of timescale, what concerns us is that the process of trialling this new system is showing it to be truly of added value for the security of our external borders.
Rather than talk about delay, I would talk about the need for the Member States - something I agree with - to trial the system in depth to see how it works and could work better, before actually rolling it out.
The timescales we have been discussing with the Presidency, and which we will formalise with the February Council of Ministers in a few weeks' time, are timescales that demonstrate our commitment to the added value from the new generation of SIS, something that is clearly a priority.
Many people have spoken about assessing the effectiveness of security measures, particularly counter-terrorism measures.
This is something Parliament asked for, which I agreed to a year ago.
Today we have an exercise under way.
In December, all the Member States received a detailed questionnaire about the results achieved by the counter-terrorism measures being applied.
I can say, not only to Baroness Ludford but to all of you, that by mid-April I will be able to publish in full the results of this analysis for all 27 Member States.
This, I believe, is another priority matter for discussion, something this Parliament has always been interested in.
Some people have talked about procedural safeguards.
You know that no agreement was reached on this because some Member States put insurmountable problems in the way, but now the Slovenian Presidency has raised something that I think could be dealt with as a priority: the matter of judgments in absentia.
This is one of the aspects related to procedural safeguards.
It is not the whole discussion, but it is an extremely important aspect: harmonising the rules on judgments in absentia - a matter I think Mrs Lambert touched on - is a matter that deserves to be dealt with as a priority in 2008.
We have already mentioned the assessment of Frontex.
On 13 February we will publish our first comprehensive assessment of Frontex.
Clearly, the Commission document will be discussed in the Council and in Parliament, and will form the basis for action, which I would also say is a priority, in 2008: how Frontex has worked, how we can improve it, how we can encourage Member States to participate more.
Terrorism was spoken of; many people mentioned it.
Terrorist propaganda on the Internet and violent radicalisation are both matters that will be the subject of non-legislative initiatives.
A few legislative measures are already planned, there will be communications from the Commission and it is worth debating.
I much appreciated what Mrs Roure said about the European PNR.
This is a discussion that will continue throughout 2008.
I do not believe that we will have adopted the European PNR by the end of this year.
However, I believe that three criteria - mentioned by Mrs Roure if I am not mistaken - should guide us: proportionality in the collection of these data and their added value for the fight against terrorism, because this is what we are dealing with.
If this instrument works, we will adopt it, if it does not work we will adapt it or else we will not adopt it.
I personally believe it will be useful, but I think we need to discuss it here.
And then there is the matter of how to protect the data collected and how to punish anyone who misuses these data.
These are matters for discussion, obviously open, that we can tackle during 2008.
Lastly, immigration.
I believe that we should now continue with the general approach to immigration, as the European Council in December said, to think, in view of the future French Presidency, about what the French Government intends to propose as a European pact on immigration, and I have already planned for the Commission to be fully available to work on this matter.
Finally again, asylum policy.
2008 will be decisive, since 2010 is the deadline for setting up a European asylum system.
2008 will be the year in which the action plan will be presented to the Commission.
I have given examples to show how, in this spirit, Mr Deprez's proposal, which I think should be welcomed, is to get together and define in concrete terms what can be done immediately because it is ready - and there are many things we can conclude during the Slovenian Presidency - and what we can continue to discuss between now and, say, June 2009.
Mr President, I note with some surprise and regret that, first of all, the Council has not replied to any question on PNR.
I wonder if it would agree here to give us written replies to all the questions that have been put here.
Secondly, I note - again with regret - that for a year now we have been asking about information about the high-level contact group and the negotiations between the Commission and the Americans on data protection.
Again, we have not received a reply.
They have been negotiating for a year, and I think it is high time that they tell us what they are negotiating about.
I would like a written reply.
Thank you Mrs in 't Veld.
I think that both the Commission and the Council have taken note of what you said and I am sure that they will provide written answers to the requests that you have just made.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the March part-session.
Cooperation between the special intervention units of the Member States (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mr FranÃ§a, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council decision on the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the Member States of the European Union in crisis situations (15437/2006 - C6-0058/2007 -.
rapporteur. - (PT) The face of the old Europe has changed.
Today the European Union, with 27 Member States and nearly 500 million inhabitants, is facing complex and stimulating challenges, requiring us to adopt an ever broader world view and a stance that is very attentive to issues such as peacekeeping, security, stability, freedom and the exercise of democracy.
As immortalised by Victor Hugo's wisdom, it requires us to know how much of the future can be introduced into the present, as the secret of great government.
It is therefore the scope and major challenge of this report - the challenge of the security of persons and property in the EU area - and is an issue in the everyday lives of Europeans.
I am talking about security, specifically, today and tomorrow, every day, in the streets, at work, at leisure and at home, on land, at sea, in the air.
It is the security of our common space that, without being imposed, guarantees and underpins freedom in a balanced society.
Freedom is a cornerstone, a fundamental value of the Union; security is a tool in the service of well-being, it offers stability and safeguards freedom.
Freedom as a value and security as a tool are essential to the European project.
Austria's initiative, taken up by the Portuguese Presidency and which gave rise to the Council Decision, provides for the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the European Union in crisis situations.
It is a good and necessary initiative.
This initiative also complements PrÃŒm, since that Treaty provides for cooperation only in the event of natural disasters or serious accidents.
My report proposed 11 amendments to the proposal for a decision which also establishes a minimum general framework for possible cooperation in man-made crises, hijacking, terrorist attacks, etc.; i.e. man-made crisis situations presenting a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions.
In the proposal, cooperation in terms of training, preparation and action by special intervention units is always a possibility and the Member State may or may not request cooperation, indicating what type of assistance it requires.
The effectiveness and promptness of interventions will always depend on the degree of preparedness, coordination, linkage and the existence of uniform methods in the modus operandi of the intervention units, which is why I propose, firstly, the possibility of joint training and exercises, and secondly, that the training and exercises be funded from the budget of the European Union, pursuant to Articles 30, 32 and 34 of the Treaty on European Union.
I would also point out that, in our understanding, the rules on civil and criminal liability applicable in the event of joint operations must be the same as in the PrÃŒm Decision.
Mr President, fellow Members, this Council Decision is very important.
