In short, there is a lot to be done.
Working hours are being fiddled, and so are collective labour agreements as well as many other things.
Against this backdrop, we bear a special responsibility, particularly regarding international transport, and we have duly taken this on.
One of the first things I did, or was allowed to do, when we came here was related to the Willy Betz construction.
This was a case comparable to Kralowetz, but on a smaller scale.
The trucks were of very high-quality, people ensured that all kinds of things were satisfactory, except for the work permits and a few other things.
That led to this drivers' attestation directive.
Fortunately, we are now in a position where we can welcome a second, very important directive on the organisation of working times.
In my opinion, more loopholes in the legislation will need to be filled in future.
Against this background, it is perhaps very good that the information and consultation directive - I should like to use the word historic - be adopted, for the very simple reason that, in the course of time, many large international transport companies have, in fact, been put under a flag of convenience, a process which often did not involve participation.
They, in fact, turned drivers into self-employed drivers, or contracted them out to small self-employed entrepreneurs.
There was no participation there either.
We are now in a position where we can tackle issues of this kind more effectively.
Mr President, in principle, these are two very important proposals for directives which we are discussing and which are being given very strong support by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
Where the directive regarding lorry drivers is concerned, this professional group will therefore be covered by the general legislation that regulates working time.
This is obviously of significant interest not only to professionals but also to other road users.
During the conciliation negotiations, there were several occasions on which I specifically emphasised the road safety aspect, which I think is important for those governments which are to administer this legislation in the future.
It was also important that self-employed people should now be treated in the same way as other drivers for, from the road user' s point of view, it is immaterial whether he is run over by an employed or self-employed driver.
What is perhaps worrying about this directive is that the transition periods are so long.
It will in actual fact be, at best, seven years before it is implemented, and we know that, even then, it will subsequently be difficult to track and monitor how the legislation operates in practice.
The second directive, on information and consultation, is a kind of framework agreement providing a legal basis that is important to workers' being able to demand information and consultation rights.
We must not, however, forget that - by means, for example, of Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the proposal for a directive, which offer scope for a more or less broad interpretation - it also provides legal opportunities to reject workers' demands in certain cases.
What is crucial, therefore, to how this directive goes on to operate in practice is how it is received in workplaces and how strong the trade unions are when it comes to pushing those demands to which the directive can give some leverage.
I believe that this applies generally to this type of legislation.
We can adopt directives which are sound and well-intentioned in many ways, but when they are then actually put into effect we know that we cannot, in this House, do very much.
Nor do I believe that the governments of the Member States can do very much.
I do not share Mrs Smet' s view that systems with tight controls can be designed. It is difficult to know what happens out on the roads, especially at night.
It is difficult to know what goes on behind closed factory gates.
It is only employees themselves who can do anything about what takes place.
I therefore want to conclude this speech with a strong appeal to those in the workplace: Do not rely upon the problems' being solved in the European Parliament or the Council, but assume that they have to be solved by yourselves and that you can be helped with them by the legislation that has been enacted in the form of the directive.
Mr President, let me start by welcoming, on behalf of my group, the compromise achieved in the Conciliation Committee on the framework directive on information and consultation.
I would like at the same time to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, for leading us to that compromise, which is now very close to the common position.
We have had quite vigorous discussions in our group on information and consultation, but we agreed that the common position is a really good starting point for a sensible solution.
Starting with first reading in April 1999, and, indeed, in the committee meetings before that, there were often major differences of opinion between the groups; the rapporteur had to be agile - she was too - and the same was true for me as shadow rapporteur for the largest group, the PPE-DE.
We have a constructive compromise before us.
What was possible has now been done.
What mattered was at last to get a foot in the door, which can then be opened a bit wider by the next blast of wind.
Second reading stage saw the PPE-DE prevail on many points.
The majority in my group were opposed to European sanctions but in favour of national ones.
The conciliation process saw these ideas incorporated in the recitals.
In its final form, the framework directive primarily contributes to the functioning of the European Works Council.
All local workers' representatives are given minimum rights helping them to assess the information received from the European Works Council.
Secondly, it helps mitigate problems with restructuring, which affect national enterprises as well.
The Works Councils directive, on the other hand, applies only to multi-national enterprises.
The framework directive prescribes that the procedure be carried out in a spirit of cooperation.
This means partnership, which, on the one hand, aims at the clear representation of interests, but also, on the other, their equalisation by means of information and consultation in shared dialogue.
Information at the right time results in transparency, which itself builds trust and avoids the enterprises sustaining frictional losses - an economic and social gain.
Both employers and workers gain from this, and do so in the same way.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for their work on two important directives.
I shall concentrate on the directive concerning information and consultation rights of employees, but I also want to say something about working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities.
It is very important that self-employed people should now be included, even if there is a transitional period, for we are concerned here with protective legislation for those whose job it is to drive lorries.
In work of this kind, there is no difference between being employed and being self-employed.
Just as Mr Schmid says, this is also a road safety issue and, from that point of view, it makes no difference whether the person driving is employed or self-employed.
Where information and consultation are concerned, I agree with Mrs van den Burg who, in her speech, said that the directive was of historic importance. It is of historic importance.
Three women have been involved.
I can add a fourth. When, in June during the Swedish Presidency, the Council succeeded in reaching a common position, which laid the basis for this directive, a female Swedish minister was also involved.
I think it quite obvious that there should be this type of information and consultation in an internal market, that an internal market is not only about companies' rights but also employees' rights and that the latter must be informed and be able to put forward their views.
Sometimes, people in Sweden can be heard saying, 'What does this really mean for Sweden when we, of course, have much better legislation?'
Well now, that is true. Our legislation is such that this directive does not perhaps affect us at all.
That being said, minimum directives are still important, not only for those countries which do not have such good legislation but also, indirectly, to prevent an internal market with social dumping arising whereby companies are set up whose employees suffer poor conditions.
Accordingly, it is important for all the countries that we should increase the minimum levels and have minimum directives that lead to better conditions.
Finally, I again want to thank the rapporteurs for two good directives.
I hope that we can go further and improve information and consultation in the future.
Mr President, the Kralowetz case is to some extent a problem specific to Luxembourg, since governments over the past 20 years have used all sorts of benefits to entice a large number of transport enterprises to Luxembourg, without, though, building up a system to monitor the wages these firms pay and the working conditions they provide.
Kralowetz is, though, also in essence a European problem.
It is proof that 'social Europe' does not exist.
In 1998, the European Union completely liberalised the transport sector, without at the same time providing for the social security regulations it needed.
Kralowetz and other cases are now showing us the consequences of that.
The Commission must, in my opinion, do more than what has been talked about this evening.
There are, in my judgment, three core issues.
Firstly, the controls must be tightened up.
What is the use of laws if we do not check that they are obeyed?
Secondly, social security documentation must be harmonised across the EU.
We should not wait until the end of 2003 to do this, but try to get it on track as early as the beginning of that year.
The third, and probably most important, point is that the ECMT transport licence system, which allows enterprises from outside the EU to drive through the Member States, is today encouraging social dumping and illegality and will still be encouraging them tomorrow if we do not manage to tie these ECMT transport licences to minimum social standards.
If this is not done, then Karl Kralowetz only needs to travel to Russia tomorrow and he can continue to run his unscrupulous business from there.
Mr President, European regulation on work times of professional drivers is necessary for three reasons; firstly for the social protection of the workers, secondly to improve the safety of road traffic and thirdly for reasons of competitiveness.
We take a favourable view of the points achieved in the Conciliation Committee, and are as one with you on the points you have already mentioned, namely the inclusion of the self-employed, a clear definition of self-employment, clearly-defined work times - in respect of which, of course, more redress can again be demanded of enterprises - and the need to define exceptional circumstances as regards weekly work times and work at night.
My colleagues have already stated that, without controls and sanctions, no directive will achieve any kind of progress.
I believe that this is where we have to make a start.
The Commission has presented a new regulation on the harmonisation of certain social security regulations relating to road transport, which will, in consequence, soon be on Parliament's agenda.
There are, at present, marked discrepancies between the results achieved in the Conciliation Committee and the new proposal, which must be cleared up, and this is something on which coordination is needed.
This, of course, means that we also have an opportunity to play our part in laying down sanctions and controls in much stronger form, for it is a regulation we are dealing with, and that means it is legally binding and effective in quite another way.
What is most crucial in my view is that, whilst taking into account the harmonisation of competition, we should put in first place the need to harmonise social security regulations and improve the safety of road transport.
If we succeed in doing that, we will already have achieved a great deal.
Mr President, I do not share the enthusiasm of my colleagues for the results of this conciliation but I am equally warm in my congratulations to both rapporteurs.
They won and I lost, to my regret and possibly their surprise.
We all know that if the Council had not given in then Parliament itself would have conceded rather than lose either directive.
So Parliament had a weak hand but both rapporteurs played it extremely well.
I congratulate them for their skill.
They were helped by the early climb-down of the UK Government during both conciliation processes.
It was particularly ironic that the UK Minister for Europe should have come to Strasbourg last autumn - to plead with UK MEPs from all parties to vote down the whole Ghilardotti report - to find that not only were Labour MEPs positively promoting the report but the UK representative then bent over backwards to support it as well.
Politics is certainly an odd business.
As colleagues know, I am a fervent supporter of information and consultation but an equally fervent opponent of a one-size-fits-all straitjacket for companies of all shapes and sizes.
This directive, as amended, is more likely, in my view, to be a barrier to employee involvement than a bridge.
Moving to the working time directive: in my view this is bad legislation.
It could have been worse had it limited night-time driving, but I was delighted that the rapporteur finally saw reason and this proposal was removed.
But it is still bad legislation in its provisional extension to include the self-employed.
As the Spanish representative said, when joining other countries in registering his country's dissent from the final text, it is the first time that the entrepreneurial sector has been included in any directive.
I will certainly fight to make sure it is the last.
We should want to see more jobs, not less.
This should not and must not be seen as a precedent.
Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, the situation of the stranded lorry drivers in Luxembourg shows us once again where there is a need for European regulation and monitoring.
Scarcely ever before has it been made so clear to us what is actually going on in this particular labour market and what is happening to these lorry drivers.
If ever you talk to European lorry drivers, you will hear how people in that sector work, some of them illegally, and what sort of wages they are paid for doing so; they drive to the point of exhaustion, and not all of them have social security insurance.
That is the reality of one European labour market, and that is the problem facing us.
Looked at from this angle, this work time regulation is long overdue - in the interests of our safety on the roads and of the safety of the workers, that is, the drivers themselves.
I might add that, as has already been mentioned, this case is not only an issue for Luxembourg or about a few Austrian businessmen, we now know that we are dealing with a large number of Austrian businessmen.
It is also a European phenomenon.
For me as an out-and-out advocate of European enlargement, the core problem is the way we are doing the dirty on workers from the candidate countries; it is these workers who are bound today by collective contracts to work for derisory wages, and under conditions which are, in social terms, appalling.
Such is the way this group of workers has entered into our European Union, and that is what we have to take a stand against.
In any case, though, every cloud has a silver lining.
In Austria, my country, a group of hauliers' representatives has already taken a stand and spoken out in favour of European regulations tending towards controls and measures that will influence even this ruinous competition.
That is the situation we face.
I would add, Commissioner, that you should be prompted by that to think more and better about control systems for workers in the European labour market.
I would, of course, like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs.
Having said that, I would like to point out that the approval of these two directives constitutes an important step within the construction of European labour law and, therefore, in the construction of a social Europe, and all this, furthermore, by means of dialogue and mutual concessions from positions which were initially comprehensible.
Of course, the inclusion of the self-employed may go against the entrepreneurial spirit, as my country maintained.
In relation to the general framework for information and consultation, the Chapter IV of the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, entitled 'Solidarity' , begins with Article 27, which establishes, under the title 'Workers' right to information and consultation within the undertaking' , that 'Workers or their representatives must, at the appropriate levels, be guaranteed information and consultation in good time in the cases and under the conditions provided for by Community law and national laws and practices' .
Article 136 of the European Union Treaty already indicated that social dialogue was an objective of the Community and the Member States.
It therefore seems logical and necessary that, outside other specific directives, such as Directive 94/45/EC, a single directive should establish a general framework which lays down minimum requirements for the exercise of the right to information and consultation in undertakings and workplaces within the Community.
These rights, previously laid down in the European Social Charter of 1961, and in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, of 1989, are now, as I have said, included in the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It should surprise nobody that workers, via their representatives, should be aware of the situation and development of the undertaking, the decisions which are to be taken and their repercussions and effects for the future, since their existence and, above all, subsistence, are often linked to the undertaking.
Of course, the content of these rights must be aimed at strengthening the undertaking, increasing employment possibilities and adapting workers to new or revised production processes.
Nevertheless, experience demonstrates that the mechanisms have not always worked well: workers have become involved late in the process of decision-making, when decisions had already been taken.
I therefore feel that the content of Article 4 is particularly worth highlighting...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, we have over the last few weeks dealt with a number of matters - including social security measures - with a direct bearing on the transport sector, and those of us in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism were also of the opinion that all these measures - and I do believe that work time, which is now at last regulated, is an important chapter in the course of completion - only make sense if the Member States have the will, on the one hand, to tighten controls and, on the other, to adjust sanctions accordingly.
I am myself from a frontier region and know perfectly well that the word in the sector is currently that whoever best knows the rules of the individual countries can make the most money.
The lobby that is active here is neither a lobby for the workers nor a lobby against them - I do not think it has anything to do with Luxembourg's legislation either - nor is it a lobby for or against the employers.
At the end of the day, both of them are the losers in the Luxembourg situation, and, indeed, we again reminded the Commission of this in the celebrated van Dam report.
Our concern is not with adding more and more directives and piling up ever more detail; what matters to us is that those countries should be ready to tackle this together, so that employers can charge proper prices without suffering from this dumping that is being organised there and the workers can of course work under proper conditions.
I declare without equivocation that the lobby that is working against this is in essence a lobby supporting nobody but those who cheat and disregard the rules.
To come back to the first report, an HGV driver who is also the owner of his own HGV is always on the fringes of legality if he wants to work and earn a decent living.
That is the situation we are living in.
This means that we have to consider the developing liberalisation in goods transport by road firstly in economic terms, secondly from the employer's - and also the employee's - standpoint, but always from the same perspective, and I believe we can represent both interests equally.
Mr President, I want to use the two minutes available to me simply to respond to Mr Bolkestein's statement on the Kralowetz affair.
What has to be emphasised first in this deplorable business is that it is not Luxembourg's legislation and practices that deserve to be pilloried here, but the way the Kralowetz affair has highlighted social deficits in the European area and the European Union, a sphere in which such things are inexcusable.
Nor, in the first place, is blame to be laid at the door of the European Commission, but rather at that of the majority of the Member States, who are refusing to agree to common rules on working conditions and respectable wage levels in order to counteract social dumping within the internal market.
As regards the proposed EU directive on lorry drivers' driving times, it has been the Luxemburgers, of all people, together with the French and the Belgians, who have, in the Transport Affairs Council, worked to include the pseudo self-employed in the directive's scope.
Despite the praiseworthy efforts as regards the Eurocontrol Route mentioned by Mrs Flesch, it is this nigger that is lurking in the woodpile of the Kralowetz affair.
We need legislation at Community level that leaves no room for legal grey areas, which are shamelessly exploited by people who - as our Prime Minister trenchantly expressed it - possess a certain criminal energy.
That is the lesson we must learn, and I hope that the Member States that have hitherto refused to agree to common rules will now cease from obstructing tighter regulation at EU level, so that this modern form of slavery can now be done away with.
I wish also to emphasise that a reform of the right of establishment in Luxembourg is on its way through the official channels, and will incorporate stricter criteria making it less easy for dodgy firms to get permits and licences to trade in a perfectly legal way, which is in any case not that easy in view of current EU directives on the definition of businesses.
I hope that the devotees of the complete liberalisation of the transport of goods by road, who have so strongly advocated that cause in this House, and no longer have anything to offer against the practices of entrepreneurs like Kralowetz ...
(The President cut the speaker off.)
Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my warmest thanks to the House and to the parliamentary delegation in the Conciliation Committee.
I should in particular like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Friedrich, and, above all, your rapporteur, Mr Hughes, for their excellent work.
As a result of their efforts, their ability and their determination, it is finally possible to adopt a measure which the Commission proposed more than three years ago - a very successful outcome.
In adopting this directive, we are making essential progress towards eliminating the competition distortions in the road sector but, above all, towards improving road safety.
This directive will not only allow the elimination of abuses in that sector but also facilitate a better balance between modes.
Revitalisation of rail will be possible only with the end of wild competition in road transport.
It is thus essential for Member States to make the necessary controls in order to ensure that the new legislation should be respected.
The directive lays down minimum conditions for the organisation of the working time of drivers and also takes into account all the activities which are performed by drivers in addition to driving.
Thanks to this Parliament, it will ultimately be possible for this directive to cover all drivers of all categories, whether self-employed or not.
That is a great achievement for road safety because tiredness obviously affects all drivers in the same way, whether they work for a firm or are self-employed.
Asking the Commission to investigate the effects of exclusion and as a result of its investigations to propose special conditions for the inclusion of self-employed drivers, certainly is the best approach.
Let me thank you once again for the determination that Members of this Parliament have shown throughout the conciliation procedure, which has enabled us to adopt the directive.
Also, on the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, I should like to express my congratulations to her and to all Members of this Parliament on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council on this very important directive.
This agreement was only possible due to the spirit of compromise shown by Parliament and the Council.
The final draft of the directive, as we see it now, firstly meets completely the initial Commission goals, i.e. to establish and develop throughout the Union good practices of worker information and consultation, focused on anticipating and managing change.
Secondly, it gives leeway to action from social partners when it comes to implementing the provisions of the directive.
Thirdly, it is compatible with all national systems and provides for mechanisms allowing for a smooth introduction of the new arrangements in all of them.
Fourthly, it reflects the views of the two legislators as at least 15 of Parliament's amendments in its two readings have been incorporated into the text.
Therefore, the draft before us deserves acceptance, certainly from the Commission but also from Parliament and the Council.
Once adopted, the directive will complete the Community framework in the field of worker information and consultation, a framework which provides European companies and their workers with an essential tool to facilitate change and to ensure that it is carried on in a socially acceptable way.
The Commission very much hopes that the considerable work done in this field in recent years will now be continued through a positive and proactive attitude from social partners in relation to the consultation documents it presented to them two weeks ago on the social aspects of corporate restructuring.
I have received six motions for resolutions, presented pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The vote on the motions for resolutions relating to the Commission' s statement will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Energy performance of buildings
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0465/2001) by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the energy performance of buildings (COM(2001) 226 - C5-0203/2001 - 2001/0098(COD)).
Mr President, this crucial directive stems directly from the Green Paper on the security of the energy supply, which this House has recently debated at length.
We are obviously all aware that the main component of the Union' s energy bill relates to buildings: ventilation, refrigeration, heating, lighting etc. It is within this chapter that most of the Union' s energy expenditure is concentrated.
Therefore, anything that is done in this field has a special effect from this point of view.
Mr President, this framework directive marks the end of the era of expressions of will or recommendations.
We are entering a new era of decisive commitments, binding actions and a firm will that this type of measure may become a reality.
I wanted to stress three aspects of the directive.
The first is the obligation for all buildings in the Union to hold a certificate testifying to their energy efficiency.
This certificate will certainly be of great value as a signal within the markets and will contribute significantly to energy saving.
The second is the obligation for all new buildings to incorporate an energy-efficiency study as an essential requirement for planning permission.
The third aspect is the obligation for all buildings of an area of greater than 1 000 m2 and which are subject to extensive renovation, to undergo an improvement of their energy efficiency.
There are other actions laid down in the directive, but I wanted to highlight these three because they are clearly the ones with the greatest potential.
It will not escape you that if - as some studies suggest - it is possible to achieve a saving over the next few years of 20% in the energy bill for buildings, 20% of 40% brings us close to 10% and this, in terms of the oil bill and CO2 emissions, has an importance which is clear to all of us.
Mr President, this is a good time to thank the other groups in the House for their valuable contribution and for their help in ensuring that Parliament' s amendments improve this important legislative text.
I would like to thank the Socialist Group and Mrs Zrihen for their numerous contributions and, above all, I would like to stress their interesting suggestion in relation to social housing.
I would also like to warmly thank the Group of the Greens and Mrs Ahern for showing such interest and cooperation, and also highlight their wonderful contribution in relation to passive cooling techniques, which are so important in those areas of the Union where the climate is very warm and cooling (air conditioning systems) begins to be a determining factor.
I would also like to thank the Liberal Group for emphasising that tax incentives are always better than penalties.
We say in Spanish that 'more is gained by licking than by biting' , and this is also true in the economic field.
Unfortunately, there are two points on which we have not been able to achieve unanimity in the House: firstly, the time limits for application of the directive, where we have opted for a reasonable midpoint between overly extended periods, which would render it ineffective, or overly strict demands, which would make it unviable.
Secondly, the limit of 1 000 m2, which the Group of the Greens wanted to reduce.
We understand their intention and we share their concern, but if we really want this directive to be implemented within a time scale which makes it effective, we must accept the figure proposed to us by the Commission.
Mr President, if it is the case that politics is the art of making the necessary possible, this directive will effectively guarantee that, in a very important chapter of the Union' s energy expenditure, there will over the coming decade be a huge saving which will contribute to the well-being, the progress and the security of all Europeans.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Vidal-Quadras, on his excellent work on this important directive.
As he has pointed out, the European Union consumes more and more energy and therefore also imports more and more energy products, because our demand outweighs our capacity for supply by means of our own resources.
It is therefore important firstly to diversify our sources of energy, by seeking new energy sources including, of course, renewable energy and furthermore we need to promote and pursue energy efficiency.
I hope that Mr Vidal-Quadras has taken a favourable view of the opinion of the Environment Committee, since I believe that the points which we have highlighted within it contribute to enriching some of the aspects of his excellent proposal.
I believe that a key reference for increasing the Member States' receptiveness to the proposal is that account should be taken of local climatic and special conditions.
Another point on which the Environment Committee has insisted is the homogenisation of building certificates in the different Member States, which would allow for comparisons of the energy efficiency achieved in each building.
We also wanted to define those buildings which are excluded from the application of energy-saving measures and, also, in order that our proposal is not rejected, we have proposed, like Mr Vidal-Quadras, that we accept the Commission' s proposal aimed at reducing the area of the buildings affected.
I am in favour of this approach, Mr Vidal, like my committee, but I also understand your position.
I believe that we will have to wait and see what the final result is and we will have to respect it.
The important thing is that the directive should go ahead, Mr Vidal-Quadras.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca for his usual, very cooperative and consensual approach.
I know that Mrs Zrihen, our socialist shadow, who unfortunately cannot be here this evening, appreciated the way in which he worked.
This directive, part of a package of measures aimed at making our use of energy more intelligent, should disseminate the existing good practice of some Member States right across the EU, and will also be very important in improving the situation in applicant countries where energy-efficient buildings could do much to help their economies as well as protecting the environment.
We as socialists are very supportive of the amendments put forward by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and others.
The rapid growth of air conditioning needs to be taken into account more, the possibilities open to Member States in the form of inducements should be clarified, and many of the definitions need to be tightened.
One point that Mrs Zrihen wanted to make was that the surface area definitions must be re-examined over the next four years.
It could well be that this directive is insufficiently ambitious and that it should also apply to much smaller surface areas.
We ask the Commission to prepare for a reduction if that proves necessary.
In conclusion, may I once again thank Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and the Commission.
We look forward to more directives as promised by the Commissioner in this important area of energy efficiency, of energy intelligence.
Mr President, I should also like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur for a job well done and for his efforts to obtain consensus, which were not altogether successful in my case, as I continued to insist that we deal with a lower surface area than it was possible to agree on.
So I have tabled amendments to that effect.
I would like to know whether Mrs Zrihen will support them in light of the comments just made by the Socialist Group.
We live in hope, and perhaps a review is the best way forward, as Mrs McNally indicated.
Many provisions of this directive have already been envisioned in the SAVE directive in 1993.
We should now proceed to give it teeth.
As I said, I would have liked to have seen stronger teeth here, but we need legally binding measures - which I believe we have - which will begin a process of really ensuring that we deal strongly with energy saving in the European Union.
In practice, the obligation to review is one of the most important requirements in the report, and for that I thank the Members.
Mr President, I have an interest to declare: I chair the Energy Efficiency Advice Centre which operates in the northern half of the region that I represent.
I hasten to add that it is a technical interest and not a financial one.
Improving the energy performance of buildings, however it is defined, is the most difficult issue that I have ever had to grapple with.
Therefore my sympathy, to some extent, is with the rapporteur in being presented with an issue of this complexity.
In the UK we have too many organisations trying to improve matters.
At the European level we have a certain confusion of objectives.
Are we trying to save energy?
Are we trying to reduce CO2 emissions, or are we trying to reduce energy consumption?
These are not all the same things.
It is energy consumption that we should be focusing on.
In my experience it is the existing buildings that are the key to our success.
If you look at the housing sector, the most difficult area is rented accommodation rather than the owner-occupied sector.
We are a long way from solving that one.
In general I support the Commission's proposals and the report, but I have some hesitation about Amendment No 15.
We should be focusing more on the common methodology rather than worrying too much at this stage about minimum standards applying right across the whole of the Community.
We are really a long way from being able to achieve that.
I also have some reservations about including a CO2 emission indicator.
If you take a house, it depends on how much gas is being used or how much electricity.
Therefore you cannot compare them very easily.
But it is a step in the right direction.
Mr President, successful management of energy issues is one of the most important prerequisites for building the sustainable society.
What we are now discussing is energy efficiency.
In his report, the rapporteur has done well to highlight a series of measures that will contribute to increased efficiency where energy use is concerned.
It is important to consider both large and small measures.
All in all, there is a very great deal to be done when it comes both to greater conservation of resources and to the development of different techniques.
If the necessary objectives are to be achieved, political initiatives are required that include both legislation and measures that act as a stimulus.
The whole of society must share responsibility for these efforts.
That applies both to companies and individuals, both to public and private enterprises and both at European and national and local levels.
How we solve energy issues will naturally affect our comfort and prosperity, but also our future living environment in the broad sense of the word.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca on his excellent work on the proposed directive concerning the energy performance of buildings.
I should also like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for its thorough and thoughtful discussions and to express my satisfaction with the way in which the debate in Parliament has sharpened the focus of the proposal and strengthened it.
It will very likely be one of our most important means of meeting the European Union's Kyoto commitment and of improving our security of supply.
As has been pointed out, the buildings sector accounts for over 40% of all EU final energy consumption.
It also has a very large cost-effective savings potential.
This proposal may lead to a significant improvement in the energy performance of buildings by promoting better minimum standards in Member States and in their building codes and by requiring more frequent updating and wider application of these codes.
Not only would this apply to new buildings but, as has been said this evening, even more importantly to many existing buildings when they undergo major renovations.
That is where the real potential for improvement lies.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's report and the proposed changes that will serve to improve, clarify and strengthen the proposal.
Many amendments do this by enhancing the technical and financial definitions, giving concrete examples and defining the proposal's scope and implementation more exactly.
For example, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 35, 36 and 37 are amendments the Commission can accept, many as they are, some with minor redrafting.
Amendments Nos 3 and 6 encourage the use of subsidy schemes and incentives to promote the implementation of the proposal, taking into account socio-economic implications, and are thus also acceptable.
Amendments Nos 7 and 22, on individual metering and billing and authorisation of inspectors respectively, can also be accepted if their financial and legal implications are illuminated more clearly in the text.
Mr Adam mentioned Amendment No 15.
That is a comprehensive amendment, parts of which are acceptable to the Commission.
The setting of efficiency levels at Community level is, however, not yet feasible.
Amendments Nos 18 and 20 are also acceptable in parts, bearing in mind the need to allow CO2 indicators to remain optional.
Amendments Nos 1, 12, 13, 16, 17, 21 and 27 are not acceptable to the Commission for technical and definitional reasons, including the degree of detail or because of related problems of subsidiarity that would result for example from the setting of efficiency levels at Community level.
Because of the heterogeneous nature of the building sector as a result of differences in climate, culture and building traditions, subsidiarity and flexibility for Member States are important in the implementation of this directive.
The Commission feels that the most effective way to improve energy performance requirements in Member States is to provide methods to encourage them to improve their own building codes, set their own performance levels and ensure full application and regular revision of those.
While methods of calculation, many norms and a number of standards can be established at Community level, the actual efficiency level of energy performance of buildings should remain a Member State matter.
Most of the amendments proposed take these principles into account.
Another important point is with regard to the threshold for upgrading the energy performance of existing buildings when they undergo major renovation.
Upgrading existing buildings is an important part of this proposal.
For many Member States it represents a new area of endeavour which will require new performance standards, new resources and substantial investment.
We feel that the proposed threshold of 1 000 m2 for upgrading is therefore the best possible compromise attainable at this early stage.
Finally, as regards the period for transposition of this directive we feel that it is important to underline that we should avoid an unnecessarily long period if we are to meet the target date for Kyoto which is usually set at between 2008 and 2012.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon..
(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
At the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 31 January 2002 it was decided to alter the duration of the adjournment of the session. I should like to inform you that pursuant to Rule 10(4) a plenary sitting will be held in Brussels on Wednesday, 20 March 2002.
The purpose of that sitting will be to hear the outcome of the Barcelona Summit meeting.
It will be addressed by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar.
EIB Annual Report for 2000
The next item is the report (A5-0392/2001) by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the EIB Annual Report for 2000 (C5-0541/2001 - 2001/2218(COS)).
Mr President, Mr Maystadt, I should like to thank you, Mr Maystadt, very much for the kindness and readiness to help which you and your colleagues have shown to me and the committee.
It made the work considerably easier.
I also wish to thank my colleagues.
The role of the EIB has been of topical interest in the debate in recent years, and criticisms have been made.
These have mainly been targeted at deficiencies when it comes to environmental issues, openness and transparency.
The EIB has understood the criticism, and significant changes have taken place.
For this, you, Mr Maystadt, and your colleagues deserve our recognition.
The analysis for the year is in many respects a follow-up to the sterling work carried out a year ago by Mr Lipietz.
A number of the views put forward at that time are being repeated now.
As is well known, the most important issue for the EU is enlargement.
This involves a fundamental change constituting a major challenge both for the candidate countries and the current Member States.
Today, most EIB loans go to different types of regional development project within the EU.
That is certainly fully compatible with Statutes of the EIB, but future enlargement makes it necessary to reconsider this distribution of resources.
There must be an increase in the future Member States' share of the total loans.
Solidarity on the part of the EU must also, of course, extend to include third countries that until now have been recipients of EIB loans.
Among these are the Balkan countries, the Mediterranean countries and the ACP countries.
Now it is also Russia' s turn.
There is also a need for discussion concerning which less developed countries the EIB is mandated by the Council to support and concerning whether, for example, the 49 least developed countries are not in fact in greater need than the ACP countries traditionally supported by the EU.
In the information society, economic growth and an improved standard of living are not only the results of constructing new roads and factories, but also of education, innovation, new technology, e-commerce and the development of other knowledge-intensive sectors.
In my view, this has to be reflected to a greater extent in the EIB' s activities.
It is important that the EIB should continue to strengthen its support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
There are clear opportunities for growth in this area.
The EIB needs to become more active in making SMEs more aware of the possibilities that already exist for granting such loans.
From having been a rather closed institution, the EIB has begun to change its attitude to information and transparency.
Contact with democratically elected representatives at local and regional levels is important.
There is a knowledge of the projects at local level.
Contact with non-governmental organisations has improved, and the bank' s web site has also improved.
The EIB has published a list of projects at the assessment stage.
In my opinion, it would be good if all the public documents from the internal evaluation unit were published on the Net.
As matters stand, the EIB is supervised by its Board of Governors, that is to say by the 15 Finance Ministers, but it lacks prudential supervision by a competent authority.
The committee has discussed the possibility of letting the European Central Bank, or ECB, exercise supervision over the EIB because the EC Treaty provides for the Council to give the ECB specific tasks of prudential supervision.
If the Council does not want to give the ECB this remit, the issue should be clarified at the next Intergovernmental Conference, with the objective of establishing proper prudential supervision of the EIB' s activities.
In order to improve the way in which the Bank fulfils its obligation to render accounts, the committee proposes that the external Auditors' Committee forward its findings to the European Parliament, as well as to the EIB' s Board of Governors.
Mention might be made of the fact that the EIB has already shown a willingness to cooperate more closely with OLAF.
The environment is the issue which the NGOs are most interested in.
These issues received much attention in the Lipietz report last year.
I believe that the EIB has become more aware of environmental issues and that the Bank' s support for environmental projects has increased considerably.
Another key factor is the EIB' s environmental assessment capacity.
At present, the EIB has only one person responsible for coordinating environmental issues, while the project teams are composed of engineers and economists who have received additional environmental training.
In my opinion, more staff are required in this area.
More trained environmental experts should be appointed or contracted to review the environmental impact assessments correctly.
There are, therefore, many demands upon the European Investment Bank.
If all of these needs are to be met, it is necessary to increase the capital of the Bank.
In line with what applies to commercial banks able to handle greater risks, the Member States should, for example, consider reviewing the ratio of capital borrowed by the Bank to capital of its own, with the purpose of including the EIB' s reserves.
Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the House.
Finally, I want to comment on the amendments that have come in.
I am able to support Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 from Mr Lipietz etc.
They do not change the content of the report but highlight the environmental issues and the issues concerning openness and transparency.
I cannot, however, support Amendment No 2, which I find unnecessarily far-reaching.
I am only able to support Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, my Swedish colleague Olle Schmidt, for a very good report.
It sheds light upon the important areas of Europe' s future development, which the EIB has a major responsibility for promoting within the framework of its powers.
The report also addresses the demands Parliament should make upon the EIB as Europe' s financing institution.
I therefore want to confine myself to highlighting a few more of those aspects I consider to be most significant.
I am thinking of the candidate countries, the way in which projects are prioritised, small and medium-sized enterprises and supervision of the EIB.
Where the candidate countries are concerned, it is extremely important that there should be a significant increase in their share of the total loans of EUR 36 billion.
In 2000, they had access to EUR 2.9 billion.
In view of the forthcoming enlargement of the European family, there must be an increase if it is to be possible to achieve the objective set at the Lisbon Summit.
When it comes to prioritising projects, it is important to safeguard Europe' s competitiveness and therefore prioritise infrastructure in the broad sense of the word.
That applies, then, to communication not only in the traditional sense of roads, connecting links and the availability of energy-efficient transport systems for goods and people, but also in the sense of telecommunications, IT, e-commerce, education, increased knowledge and support for new technology.
Small and medium-sized enterprises at present account for more than 60 per cent of EU jobs.
In an enlarged EU, they will probably account for a significantly higher percentage.
Of the 18 million companies in the EU, 99% are small and medium-sized enterprises employing 66% of the workforce.
More than 90% of these companies have fewer than ten employees.
If, like many new companies, the existing small and medium-sized enterprises are to be given the opportunity to grow and become larger, or simply become large companies, more must be done in terms of supplying information, contributing to projects and providing access to venture capital.
The rapporteur has proposed that the Commission be called upon to give the ECB powers to exercise supervision over the EIB.
I agree with that.
The Bank has no national connection and cannot therefore be compared with a private commercial bank.
The ECB is therefore a suitable supervisory body until such time as a possible European finance inspectorate is established.
In view of the objective set by the Lisbon Summit, priority must be given to those projects which lead to economic growth, development and increased employment in an enlarged Europe and which attach major importance to small and medium-sized enterprises' opportunities for growth.
Competitiveness and staying power should be the guiding principles here.
Greater demands must be made upon the EIB in terms of providing information and evaluating projects and the importance of proper professional supervision and auditing must be emphasised.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to extend a warm welcome to the President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Maystadt.
In February last year, I expressed the hope of turning the discussion of the annual report in this Parliament into an annual tradition, and this is what we are honouring now.
It has taken a while before the report could be included on the agenda - indeed, it was already completed in November - but it is good to uphold this tradition.
Moreover, I understand that, this coming Thursday, you also intend to present the plans for the future and the 2001 annual report to the press and the Council.
Last year, we met immediately after this presentation, whereas this year, our meeting immediately precedes it, and I hope that you will be able to lift the veil and give us some information about these plans for the future.
Before I deal with the content, I should also like to thank Mr Schmidt for his report and for the sound cooperation during the handling of the amendments tabled by us and other groups.
In my opinion, it has been a productive group effort.
I should now like to turn to a number of points which were also raised in our annual report last year, and note with satisfaction that you have indeed devoted attention to these in your further plans, and that Parliament' s areas of concern indeed recur in the Corporate Operational Plan which you presented this year.
I should like to comment on a few of these areas of concern.
I will skim over other points, because these have already been dealt with by others.
I trust that the environment will be dealt with adequately by the Greens and others.
Needless to say, we support this, as well as the tabled amendments, although, like Mr Schmidt, we are loathe to replace Paragraph 30 which concerns the balance between the environment and other objectives.
In other words, we do want to maintain this balance and only accept the amendment in question as a supplement.
Transparency and evaluations have also already been commented on, and the subject of SMEs has already been raised by Mrs GrÃ¶nfeldt.
I should, however, like to touch upon the matter of supervision.
Last year, this was the subject of an extensive debate here, and you noticed that we made it very clear this year in the report that it is desirable for the European Central Bank to play a role in this supervision.
You have probably seen the Financial Times of 29 January and ascertained that this is now also very much being considered in ECB circles.
This was evidently raised during a lunch meeting with the Chairman of the FSA, the British financial authority, and I remember that we, too, raised the point during a lunchtime meeting with Mr Duisenberg and his colleagues in the past.
It is my impression that, although the Bank is amenable to the idea, it is quite reticent because it is not equipped for this at the moment.
I would call for a somewhat broader discussion to be held about this financial supervision in this Parliament, but also in the Council and in the Commission, for I have the impression that this topic is being dealt with in different reports in a very fragmented manner.
It is important to sketch the broad outlines in this matter too.
Perhaps we could do this in a more coherent discussion some time in the future.
As far as the EIB is concerned, it is not so much about supervision of the latter' s conduct.
A number of arrangements have been made on this score and this supervision is also being exercised in a number of areas.
It is mainly about the economic supervision of companies.
The advantage of that could be that, by means of the financial resources available within the Bank, and also with the available reserves, more could be done and more risk-bearing action could be taken than is currently the case, provided that sound supervision is in place.
I would now like to turn to another topic which, with a view to the future, will become an important point of discussion, namely that of increasing the Bank' s capital.
I assume that the supervisors, the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs, will be talking about this during the forthcoming meeting in June.
You have seen that, in Paragraph 33, we declare our support for such a capital increase.
This matter should be brought to a conclusion from 2003, and should particularly play a role in enlargement.
The point of departure in this is - this is actually a comment I should like to make - that it should add value to EIB loans.
The EIB should not do what is also possible within the market, and I believe that it is important that it act in a transparent manner.
Unfortunately, I am unable to make any of my other comments, but I shall do so in due course.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Maystadt, President of the European Investment Bank.
My colleague, Olle Schmidt, the rapporteur, has already expressed the opinion of the Committee on Economic Affairs on the annual report of the EIB and has presented proposals which, according to our committee, would improve its operation and also meet the need to provide it with greater resources to fulfil its commitments.
I would like to draw your attention to a very specific and topical point.
In Laeken it was agreed that the EIB would carry out a study to create a financial instrument or institution which would guarantee that, in terms of the cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean, the level of use of resources responds to the effectiveness and possibilities for development cooperation that the situation demands.
We know that in the Mediterranean, in the medium term, very serious conflicts may arise with the European Union itself, and that in order to ensure our own peace and stability in the future it is necessary to strengthen this cooperation and ensure better application of resources which, according to the experience of the first MEDA programme, has only been 30%.
Therefore, this initiative agreed at Laeken, of presenting a proposal or alternatives to increase the level of application, seems to us absolutely essential and urgent.
Also, if this could be consolidated at the next meeting of the Special Council of Barcelona, we believe that it would be even more appropriate, because the whole issue of development cooperation with the Mediterranean was born in 1995 in Barcelona, under the Spanish Presidency.
The current Presidency of the Council has also considered the issue of cooperation with the Mediterranean to be an urgent priority and we decisively support this initiative.
Mr President, as Mr Schmidt also pointed out, the initiative leading to Parliament' s resolution on the European Investment Bank' s annual report was taken by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, with Mr Lipietz as the original rapporteur.
I think it necessary for the European Parliament to express an opinion about the EIB' s activities because the EIB is not only a Bank but also an EU institution that finances large projects and uses Community funds to steer development.
The EIB has been criticised for neglecting environmental issues, as well as the issues of openness and transparency.
Mr Schmidt also mentioned that positive changes to the EIB' s policy have taken place recently in response to the criticism.
I hope that the EIB will continue in the same spirit.
I want to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report that addresses important issues.
It proposes, for example, that loans to the candidate countries should be increased and that evaluations should be made more easily accessible to the general public.
A further proposal is that dialogue between the two sides of industry, politicians and non-governmental organisations etc. should be strengthened as aspects of openness and transparency.
The report could, however, have been more vigorous when it comes to environmental issues.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled six amendments that specifically address environmental issues and matters of transparency.
A prerequisite for expressing our support for an increase in the EIB' s capital should be that the projects lead to sustainable development.
Performance indicators must also be established so that the EIB' s activities can be measured and evaluated properly.
I am delighted that the rapporteur expressed his support for most of our amendments.
In accordance with Mr Schmidt' s wishes, I also accept Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30.
It would, however, be unfortunate if Amendment No 2 were not to be adopted.
If civil society is to be able to keep track of an issue, the documents must obviously be available in the national language.
I call upon MEPs to vote in favour of this amendment.
Mr President, the European Investment Bank may be said to be one of the European Union' s unknown powers that be.
With loans amounting to EUR 36 billion granted in the year 2000 and total capital of EUR 100 billion, it exercises significant influence through its policy.
In spite of its influence, there has been very little discussion of the Bank.
This is the second year that we are discussing the annual report in Parliament.
What is perhaps most remarkable of all, however, is how little all this is discussed by the Bank' s owners, in the Member States and in the parliaments of the various Member States which, I believe, are in many cases quite unaware of the Bank' s activities.
This situation may be compared with that in relation to the World Bank, which has been exposed to extensive examination and debate, or with that regarding the European Development Bank which has also been examined in a different way to the European Investment Bank.
A good deal of criticism has been directed against the EIB' s activities and in two areas in particular.
First of all, the EIB has been criticised for having supported a series of projects that have increased environmental problems, as well as for shortcomings in terms of environmental impact assessments.
Secondly, the EIB has been criticised for a lack of openness and of willingness to engage in dialogue with, for example, environmental movements in different countries.
I think that this criticism has been justified.
Comparisons show, for example, that the World Bank is in actual fact significantly better than the European Investment Bank at providing environmental impact assessments and at publicising these.
It is rare for the Left to have occasion to praise the World Bank, but it does in this case.
For some years now, the European Investment Bank has shown a new attitude to greater openness, which is very welcome.
What is important, however, is that this new positive attitude also be followed up by practical measures.
Mr Schmidt' s report addresses certain demands for measures with which I agree, referring, for example, to the need for more resources, including more staff working on environmental issues and the question of greater openness.
There is a need to go further, however.
I believe, for example, that it is reasonable to demand that, if environmental impact assessments are carried out, they should always be published before decisions are taken.
The EU' s demand for environmental impact assessments must also be fulfilled when loans are granted to projects outside the European Union, and these assessments must be available in translation in the national languages of the countries to which the loans are granted.
The European Investment Bank should also comply with the Ãrhus Convention, entailing an obligation of great openness towards the environmental movement.
This should mean a big improvement.
The EIB should also have a more evolved policy when it comes to development issues, for example, development in the Developing World as the Bank' s activities there increase.
The Gothenburg Summit gave the EIB the task of supporting sustainable development and concentrating on climate issues.
This should have far-reaching consequences for the type of transport and energy projects that can be supported.
It should imply, hopefully in practice too, a change of focus for the Bank.
I believe that increasing the Bank' s capital must be conditional upon reforms being carried out.
Only if the Bank is obliged to implement such reforms should it be agreed to increase the capital.
I am opposed to the idea of allowing the European Central Bank to act as a supervisory authority.
The European Central Bank is a genuinely undemocratic institution which should not be given tasks of this kind.
Mr President, it is right and proper that we should keep on highlighting the significance of SMEs for the European economy.
SMEs ensure growth and employment in Europe.
It is therefore right, and indeed important in terms of Europe's development, that the EIB should step up its support for SMEs or carry on with it.
Half of the total lent, about EUR 5.7 billion, was used for that purpose in 2000.
This amount should be increased or its continued availability ensured.
We must not stop the support measures.
It is also important that more risk capital should be made available to these enterprises, and this is something which I personally strongly support.
It goes without saying that the points of criticism made in the report must be taken seriously.
It is not acceptable for the EIB's own home page to list its activities in only two or three languages.
By so doing, the EIB is limiting its own significance.
Mr President, Mr Maystadt, the Lisbon Process cannot be imagined without the European Investment Bank.
Support for SMEs and for entrepreneurship as sources of employment is becoming more important, as external finance other than through banks is becoming more expensive and bank finance for small and medium-sized enterprises is becoming more and more problematic.
When we consider what the European Investment Bank has achieved since 1968, in terms both of funds and of initial support for projects, I consider the outcome to be an impressive one.
I must say that the integration of the EIF and the EIB under one roof, which was pushed through by the Lisbon Process, has resulted in an optimisation of the European Investment Bank's activities right across the board.
I would therefore ask those who now want to push for the founding of another bank, to rely on, and make use of, the competence and qualified expert staff that the European Investment Bank has at its disposal.
It is for that reason that I oppose the founding of another bank.
It would surely also be in the interests of the Central and Eastern European States for the work of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and that of the European Investment Bank to be more efficiently harmonised and coordinated with each other.
I am therefore sure that both the European Investment Bank's quality and its financial activity will be improved still further, or advanced, at the European Summit in Madrid, due, among other things, to the European Commission's consolidated report.
As has been pointed out by my fellow Members and also in Mr Schmidt's report, one must surely see to it that the best possible use is made of funds for small and medium-sized enterprises.
It will, without doubt, be a matter for our concern that there may be a decreasing number of small and medium-sized banks and financial institutions available with which the European Investment Bank can manage the flow of its funds.
So it is, of course, very encouraging that the European Investment Bank has a network of 130 active intermediaries and that activity in Italy has now resumed to an encouraging extent.
We should bear in mind, though, that what matters, above all, is that small and medium-sized enterprises should really be enabled to get access to working capital and also risk-capital financing at their local level.
It is therefore important, Mr Maystadt, that an assessment should be submitted of what influence this activity by the European Investment Bank has actually had on growth and employment at local and regional level.
Regional development is, after all, one of its main fields of activity.
We know that the whole European Union benefits if economic and social cohesion can be realised at regional level.
So this assessment must be carried out, as should in future be done, before the Spring Summits, so that even better use may be made of the European Investment Bank's instruments.
One final plea, Mr President. All the institutions are committed to the need for gender mainstreaming.
I have noted that progress has been made in appointments to the European Investment Bank.
There is so far, unfortunately, only one woman on its board, and so the Member States are urged to give women, too, the facilities and opportunities to play their part in the Investment Bank's work.
I also note that, at its highest level of management, only one of the twelve officials is a woman.
There must be changes here.
Mr President, I will make a few quick comments which have occurred to me during the debate.
Firstly, I would like to thank Parliament for taking the initiative of holding a debate on the annual activities of the European Investment Bank.
You know, and some of you have highlighted, the important role the Bank plays in the channelling of savings towards investment in key sectors of the European Union as well as sectors outside it.
You have highlighted the Bank' s fundamental objective of contributing to our aims in close cooperation with the Commission.
The Bank has already implemented the Lisbon initiatives.
Initiative 2000 is fully operational and continues to increase its actions in the funding of small and medium-sized businesses.
President Maystadt will make some subsequent comments, but I would like to congratulate the Bank on the good work it is doing in this particular sector and, above all, on the transformation which has taken place as a result of paying greater attention to risk capital.
In this respect, the European Investment Fund is turning risk capital into an important Community institution as a complement to the market forces which govern supply and demand.
Some of you have suggested that the Bank should pay greater attention to environmental factors.
I believe that we must be aware that each institution has its own function and the function of the Bank is basically financial.
Environmental issues are fundamental, of course, but each institution must play its corresponding role.
I would like to make two further comments.
The first relates to the extension of the Bank to other areas.
I believe that this issue is mentioned in the seventh point of the report.
Nevertheless, we must not forget the extension of the Bank' s actions over recent years.
We only need to remember that, in 2000, Croatia was included in the CCEE contribution and the special option for the Customs Union with Turkey, and that in November 2001 the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was included.
Some of you have expressed your concern with regard to the careful monitoring of the Bank' s activities.
It is true that the statutes of the European Central Bank open up this possibility, but it is also true that it has no authority whatsoever.
Even if it had it, we would have to raise the question of whether the idea of monitoring the European Investment Bank is consistent.
The European Investment Bank is not a commercial bank. It is a multilateral bank which belongs to the Member States and has been established as a Community institution by the Treaty.
Therefore, in my opinion, it is doubtful whether it is correct to have additional monitoring of one Community institution by another Community institution.
Above all, bearing in mind that we now have a clear system for controlling the Bank by means of the auditing that is being carried out, which directly informs the Council and the government and is attended by external auditors.
Furthermore, you also know that the Court of Auditors already carries out inspections of its activities when they involve European Union funding.
Therefore, I believe that this issue warrants more profound analysis.
We do not believe that we should create other monitoring posts or institutions.
Finally, with regard to the issue of Barcelona and the possibility of funding cooperation with the Mediterranean, raised by Mr GasÃ²liba, President Maystadt will comment on the actions of the European Investment Bank.
I will simply say that the Commission is working on the Laeken mandate in order to have a report as soon as possible.
We would all have liked it to have been finished for Barcelona, but, naturally, we will have to follow the normal procedures.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to say what an honour it is for me to have another opportunity to answer the questions raised by the House, as Mrs van den Burg wished; this could become an annual tradition.
Although the European Investment Bank has no formal obligation to report to the European Parliament, I think that it is natural, in a democracy, for all public institutions, including the financial institutions, to have to respond to questions and to take into account the priorities expressed by the representatives elected by the citizens.
It is therefore a great pleasure for me to attempt to answer the questions that have been raised, bearing in mind that five minutes does not, of course, give me enough time to provide a detailed answer. We will, however, have the opportunity to continue the dialogue, particularly within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, under the dynamic chairmanship of Mrs Randzio-Plath and on the basis of the excellent report by Mr Olle Schmidt.
Today, I would simply like to give some details in response to the four categories of questions raised.
The first category contains questions on the activities of the EIB; the second relates to questions on supervision; the third category regards questions on the policy regarding information and transparency and, as for the fourth and final category, I will speak briefly about equal opportunities, an area that is particularly close to Mrs Randzio-Plath' s heart.
First of all, as far as the EIB' s activities are concerned, Mrs Randzio-Plath quite rightly pointed out that regional development was still the main task of the European Investment Bank.
In conjunction with Commissioner Barnier' s services, we developed a set of indicators and we are attempting to assess, in a more systematic manner, the impact of projects that we finance on regional development.
The growing importance of the EIB' s activities in the candidate countries has also been mentioned and Mr Schmidt quite rightly emphasised this point.
Enlargement is a huge challenge for us all, for those who are already in the European Union and for those who are about to join it.
Clearly, the European Investment Bank must step up its work in these countries to assist them in fulfilling the conditions of membership as quickly as possible.
Currently, the EIB already has a portfolio in excess of EUR 16 billion, so far mainly for infrastructures - such as transport, communication and energy infrastructures - but also for the environment and these funds are increasingly being granted directly to promoting the private sector.
The environment is another area on which the rapporteur and other speakers have focused in particular, and I think that it must be approached from two angles.
The first angle is that of the number of environmental projects that we finance; these are projects which play a direct part in protecting or improving the environment.
I can now give you - before anyone else hears them - the figures that I will be publishing next Thursday.
Last year, we granted EUR 6 billion to environmental projects in the form of individual loans and EUR 2 billion through what we call global loans, in other words, loans to intermediaries, which themselves provide loans to local authorities.
This therefore amounted to EUR 6 billion for environmental projects in the European Union and EUR 0.5 billion in candidate countries, which means that, currently, approximately one fifth of our loans go directly towards improving the environment.
We hope to gradually bring this figure up to a quarter of the total volume of our loans.
This is the first angle, but there is obviously a second angle - and your Committee has quite rightly paid this a great deal of attention - which is that the other projects, those that are not directly aimed at improving the environment, must also take into account the impact they have on the environment.
We must therefore put in place the resources to enable us to assess more systematically the environmental impact of these projects.
This is the reason why, following a suggestion made in last year' s report by Mr Lipietz, we carried out internal restructuring and set up an environmental group within the project department, whose specific task is to ensure that proper account is taken of environmental aspects when assessing such projects.
And we, of course, intend to further improve our resources dedicated to this task.
To continue on the subject of the EIB' s activities, we must mention the Mediterranean.
Without going into too much detail, I would simply like to say that we have taken note of the objectives announced by the Spanish Presidency and that the EIB is at the Council and Commission' s disposal, if it is felt, given the extent of our activities in the Mediterranean, that the EIB can help to achieve these objectives.
Lastly, I note the concern expressed by several of you, particularly Mr Schmidt and Mrs Randzio-Plath, regarding the support given to small- and medium-sized businesses.
We are continuing to provide this support, not only through global loans but also through the European Investment Fund, which last year gave risk capital of EUR 800 million to small- and medium-sized businesses.
With regard to supervision, we should bear in mind, as Commissioner Solbes stressed, that the EIB is already supervised in various ways.
I would simply say that we are working to apply the prudential banking rules.
If it were considered advantageous to organise additional supervision by a body that is specialised in banking supervision, the EIB would, of course, have no objection.
We would welcome an external authority specialised in banking supervision checking that we are correctly applying the prudential rules.
As for the policy regarding information and transparency; first, we now publish all our strategy documents; second, we publish an overview of our assessment methods; third, we publish, with a few exceptions, the list of all the projects currently being examined so that the public can respond and submit its comments; last, we now publish all the full assessment reports carried out by the independent ex-post evaluation department, which was set up a few years ago.
I should like to end by briefly touching upon the subject of equal opportunities.
Mrs Randzio-Plath has, on several occasions, drawn our attention to an undeniable imbalance within the Bank' s higher management.
There is still only one woman on the Management Committee.
I regret this, but it depends on Member States.
As far as the management itself is concerned, we decided last year to appoint four women to senior management level, which will therefore begin to correct this imbalance.
To sum up, Mr President, we are determined to ensure that the EIB remains an institution that serves the European Union, something which requires, by necessity, greater cooperation with the Commission and strengthening dialogue with Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.
Financial services legislation
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2002) by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the implementation of financial services legislation (2001/2247(INI)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be responding on behalf of the European Commission to Mr von Wogau' s report on the implementation of financial services legislation, in the context of the Lamfalussy report.
I would like to start by congratulating Mr von Wogau and thanking him for all his impressive efforts to build consensus on this important matter in this House.
Let me also congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath, who chairs the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and who has helped to stimulate the Commission' s thinking on these matters.
Implementing the proposals contained in the Lamfalussy report in a fair and balanced way is of major importance to the European Union.
It lays down essential stages for delivering the entire Financial Services Action Plan by 2005, as requested by the Lisbon European Council, and the measures relating to the securities markets by 2003, as requested by the Stockholm European Council.
The aim is, of course, to build a strong, stable, pan-European capital market, a market which will benefit its citizens and businesses by improving future employment and growth prospects throughout Europe.
We have reached a fair and honourable compromise. Let us, together, seize the moment.
I am confident that our debate today will yield a positive result and send out a strong signal of the renewed and effective cooperation between Commission, Council and Parliament.
Before making a formal statement on behalf of the Commission, I should first like to dispel any possible doubts by stating that the Commission will act both on this statement and on the Stockholm European Council resolution and what is set out in the letter of 2 October 2001 from Commissioner Bolkestein to Mrs Randzio-Plath, Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I should also like to draw your attention to three vitally important points.
Firstly, the Commission will naturally respect Parliament' s powers of codecision and the rights to information and transparency which underpin our democratic process.
The Commission will do business with Parliament and the Council on a joint basis, fully respecting the current interinstitutional balance.
Secondly, the Commission will, without exception, take full account of the European Parliament' s position, as is provided for in the Stockholm European Council resolution.
It will do everything in its power to find appropriate solutions in keeping with the current interinstitutional balance.
Thirdly, with a view to the longer term and the revision of the Treaties, the Commission wishes to see Article 202 amended and both its own future executive duties and the joint role of the two co-legislators clarified.
This concludes my preliminary remarks. I shall now make a formal statement on behalf of the European Commission:
"As was recalled at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, the integration of financial services markets is fundamental to strengthening the European economy.
The delivery of the Financial Services Action Plan by the deadlines set by the European Council conclusions - 2005 for the entire Action Plan and 2003 for the measures relating to securities markets - is crucial to achieving this objective.
Ahead of the Barcelona European Council, which will take stock of the European Union' s economic reform process as mapped out in Lisbon, the Commission welcomes the close cooperation between the Community institutions and expresses confidence in its harmonious development when it comes to implementing the Commission' s proposals, in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Wise Men chaired by Baron Lamfalussy.
The Commission stated in its White Paper on European Governance that, in general, its executive responsibilities need to be more clearly defined and that the Council and the European Parliament should have an equal role in controlling the way in which the Commission carries out its executive role.
In the White Paper, it also announced its intention of launching a debate on this issue in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and indicated that it favours an amendment to Article 202 of the EC Treaty.
In the meantime, before the next revision of the Treaty and without setting a precedent, flexible regulatory mechanisms in the field of financial services are needed that fully respect the institutional balance.
In this regard, a letter was sent on 2 October 2001 by the responsible Commissioner to the chair of Parliament' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
In this context, the Commission is now in a position:
to take note of Parliament' s intention to limit the duration of the delegation of executive powers to the Commission to four years from the entry into force of each particular directive, subject to an extension being proposed by the Commission and accepted by Parliament and the Council.
The Commission could accept amendments adopted by Parliament to this end;
to ensure that Parliament is given a period of three months from the first transmission of draft implementing measures in which to examine them and to give its opinion.
However, in urgent cases that are duly substantiated, this period may be shortened;
to ensure full transparency vis-Ã -vis Parliament throughout the entire procedure for the adoption of implementing measures. The Commission will also ensure that there is wide public consultation before draft implementing measures are drawn up;
to support Parliament' s wish to see the establishment of a market participants group attached to the Committee of European Securities Regulators, and it strongly encourages its establishment in as short a time as possible;
to recall its political willingness to endeavour to ensure that Parliament benefits from equivalent treatment and, in order to secure effective cooperation between the institutions, reaffirms its commitment to take the utmost account of Parliament' s position and any resolutions that it might adopt with regard to implementing measures exceeding the implementing powers provided for in the basic instrument and the Commission' s aim of reaching a balanced solution in such cases."
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will firmly support the approach that I have outlined. It is the fruit of a lengthy debate and very close cooperation between Commission and Parliament.
Indeed, with this approach, we can now take another major step forward towards European financial integration, which is the next crucial step after the introduction of the euro.
Today' s positive result makes it even more essential for work to start in the interinstitutional working party to which Prime Minister Aznar, no less, pledged his authoritative support before this House during the January part-session.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an extraordinarily important debate that we are taking part in today.
It is important to banks, insurance companies and investment funds, because this debate will make it clear that we are pressing onward - and that without delay - on the road that leads to a common European market in financial services.
The debate is though, also important to the European Union's citizens, as we are removing obstacles from the path of cross-border competition in the field of financial services, in the granting of credits and the negotiation of insurance policies.
Competition of this sort will put the citizen in a stronger position and enhance Europe's competitiveness.
What, then, is this debate about?
Alexandre Lamfalussy and his Committee of Wise Men have made proposals as to how we can speed up the great legislative package needed to make this common market in financial services a reality.
In doing so, he made the wise suggestion that the legislator, that is Parliament and the Council, should focus on setting the essential objectives, whilst leaving to the Commission, working together with experts, the small print of the implementation provisions.
That proposal is a very good one.
Where, then, is the problem?
The problem is that we have always found, in our experience as parliamentarians, that it is to us that the public and firms come with complaints about the European Union's bureaucracy, and that they are not complaining about the law, be it a directive or a regulation, that we have helped to enact, but about the provisions made for its implementation.
That is why Parliament has insisted on being able, jointly with the Council, to carry out a kind of final check on whether the implementation provisions that are enacted actually correspond to what the legislator intended.
What have our negotiations with the Commission and the Council now achieved?
At this point, let me warmly thank President Prodi for his statement, but also Commissioner Bolkestein, Mr John Mogg and many others, as well as the secretariat of the Constitutional Committee.
I have to tell you that the discussions lawyers had in this area occasionally reminded me of disputations in ancient Byzantium on the sex of angels.
I wish to thank very warmly all those who helped me find my way judiciously through this labyrinth.
What have we achieved?
Transparency first of all.
That is important, as we are informed about everything that goes on in the Commission.
We also get to see preliminary drafts.
Secondly, we have achieved the reduction of the mandate to four years, after which period it must be renewed by Parliament and the Council.
We have, furthermore, gained the right to monitor outcomes, which is where President Prodi's statement was extraordinarily important.
Like the Council, we have three months in which to do this, in which respect we are given equivalence with them.
President Prodi, indeed, spoke of parity and equivalence, which adds up to an additional safeguard.
Thirdly, we must be clear in our own minds about the actual relations between the powers.
We are faced with a large number of legislative acts, which have to be adopted.
Each time, Parliament and the Council together must give the Commission a mandate, and if the Commission were to fail to take Parliament's justified interests and objections into account in this respect, it would have cause to fear that it would not be granted that mandate when it came to the next legislative act.
What this means is that, today in any case, we as a Parliament are in a very strong position in this context.
To that extent I take the view that, in this context, or on the basis of President Prodi's statement, the equivalence we demanded has been granted.
Something that strikes me as also especially important is the committee of market participants, which we decided on. This represents a first step towards the European Union's lawmaking becoming more modern.
We must reach the situation in which legislation generally makes a clear distinction, as Alexandre Lamfalussy proposed, between the Parliament and the Council's intentions as joint legislators and the small print of the technical details.
Here, for example, the supervisory authorities and the experts should be involved, but at the same time the market participants, too, should be included in the structures as purely practical issues are under discussion.
In that sense I also believe that what we are deciding on today can also be a model for the Convention, the Intergovernmental Conference, and the improvement of the European Union's legislative procedure, and so I wish to ask you to adopt my report.
Thank you, Mr Prodi, for your statement, but also, and perhaps more importantly, for your introductory comments.
This statement is peppered with 'constructive' ambiguities, and I hope that, on this basis, we will manage to complete the fruitful discussion that we started in this House, following the resolutions that Parliament adopted on 13 March and 5 April 2001, and the publication of the Lamfalussy report.
I have two comments to make on the important nature of the discussion that we are holding today.
My first comment is that, as the rapporteur pointed out, following the introduction of the euro, it is crucially important that we put in place an action plan on financial services, especially if we want to reach the objectives that we set collectively at Lisbon, namely to make the European Union the most competitive economic area in the world.
However, the institutional issues are also important and provide the evidence of democracy.
From this perspective, the discussion that we are holding today is of major importance when you take a look at the timetable before us: the Convention and the IGC, the Commission' s White Paper on Governance, the essential reform of Article 202 of the Treaty and the redrafting of the interinstitutional agreement on comitology, which patently does not take account of the evolving powers and role of the European Parliament as a legislator, in particular, in the economic and monetary Union.
I think that, from the Commission' s point of view, the fact that the two pillars of economic and monetary Union are working well means that the European Parliament is a full partner and this demonstrates the importance of the discussion that we have been holding with you for almost a year now.
We will all appreciate the outcome of this discussion, from our own perspective, both in economic and institutional terms.
Personally speaking, I would like to underline two points, the first on the issues that you brought up in your statement and the second on what will certainly be the subject of future discussions that we will hold, particularly within the framework of the Convention.
Regarding the first point, I think you mentioned the notorious 'constructive' ambiguity of doing business on an equivalent basis.
We do not believe that equal treatment is a matter of discussing complex subtleties: it is in the hands of the Council.
You are aware of this, Mr Prodi.
In any case, this is how we are interpreting your statement and comments.
Behind this, however, there is the idea that this request, in addition to the formal statement that you have just made, must be used as a reference each time that we have to issue an opinion on a document within the framework of the financial services action plan.
Then, also, there is the issue that you have not tackled today and that we will continue to bring up in the forthcoming meetings that we shall have with you, namely, how can we avoid a possible disagreement between the European Parliament and Commission?
On this point, we believe that the idea of an informal trilogue enabling us to reach a balanced and mutually acceptable agreement, as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is the correct negotiating basis for the future.
Mr President, more and more often in present-day society we are seeing situations where legislators are expected to enact laws very quickly and effectively.
It would seem that these demands being made with regard to financial services are quite justified.
This means we really have to evolve a modern legislative process, as Mr von Wogau mentioned.
Unfortunately, a modern legislative process often seems to mean that it is the European Parliament that is expected to give up some of the legislative powers it enjoys by virtue of the Treaty.
The problem with the Lamfalussy package is that the European Parliament cannot be completely certain it would not, in fact, be surrendering the legislative power it has on behalf of the citizens of the EU to the Council, on the one hand, and the Commission, on the other.
In this regard, the European Parliament must ensure that these parliamentary supervisory powers are brought into closer focus.
As President of this institution, you will surely seize on the proposal that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has put forward: whenever the European Parliament suspects that the Commission is using more than its fair share of powers of implementation, you could negotiate an ad hoc scrutiny mechanism to prevent Parliament' s legislative powers from being watered down.
We all know that Parliament' s legislative power is not an end in itself: we really try to ensure, on behalf of the public, that decisions are taken openly and democratically, and that all views worthy of attention are taken into consideration during the process.
It is also perfectly clear that the EC Treaty is no longer relevant to modern times in this respect.
The Commission' s commitment to amending Article 202 of the Treaty in the very near future, which would restore Parliament' s legislative and supervisory powers, is to be welcomed with open arms.
It should also be emphasised that the European Union needs a hierarchy of legal acts, with legislative powers and powers of implementation being defined very clearly. At present we are in a grey area with this Lamfalussy package, the direct result of level 2 decision-making.
Mr President, not many Members of this Parliament are attending the debate today in this House.
And this debate is probably not going to be treated as a priority interest by the media.
Nevertheless, and I am addressing the public who are in the galleries, this is a very important debate for European citizens.
I hope that today, after many months of work, negotiation and seeking a consensus, this Parliament will take a decision on the report which has been admirably well drawn up by Karl von Wogau, and which represents one more step forward in the process of constructing an economic and monetary Europe, and furthermore, is an important step within the framework of the process started at the Lisbon European Council aimed at achieving greater flexibility, competitiveness and growth and creating jobs.
I also hope that this process will include other important decisions at the next European Council in Barcelona.
At a point when the euro and its implementation have been a great success, this Parliament, the Commission and the Council must demonstrate that they are fulfilling the obligations laid down for them in the Treaties.
Mr President of the Commission, you have done this recently - and I thank you for being here today - by adopting the appropriate measures and reproaching those countries which are on the point of exceeding the criteria established in Maastricht in the field of deficit.
This is a good decision, and I am therefore deeply disappointed that the German Commissioner has shown a lack of solidarity in certain comments made in Bild am Sonntag.
I do not approve of this, because what we want is to maintain the internal cohesion of the European institutions and the balance between all of them.
In this respect, this exercise is politically positive, because Parliament has had to fight hard to gain its competences, like all parliaments.
Therefore, having gained them, we want to keep them, since that is what the people demand.
Baron Lamfalussy' proposals, which we all agree are needed, also mean, in the long run, putting our trust in the European Commission.
On behalf of my group, I would like to tell you that we have always defended the European Commission, because it is at the heart of the Community institutions and is the most obvious motor for integration.
However, as Mrs BerÃšs and Mrs Hautala have quite rightly said, we must take precautions.
We neither can nor want to give anybody a blank cheque.
That is why this negotiation has gone on so long and has involved so many people.
And I would like to acknowledge, not only the rapporteur, whose work we have all praised, but also Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mr Napolitano, the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Bolkestein and his team, as well as Mr Rato.
Mr President, we have finally achieved a text, whose declaration you have read today and which, in the judgment of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, fully satisfies - and I say this emphatically - our expectations: we are going to be treated on an equal basis with the Council, our rights of codecision and the transparency requirements we demanded are going to be guaranteed and there is a formal commitment from the European Commission that, in the next reform of the Treaties, which the Convention is going to analyse, there should be a modification of Article 202.
Today is therefore a good day for European integration: we are sending messages to the markets that we are prepared to make even more progress in realising all the aspects of economic union.
It is also good news for the citizens, who, thanks to our choosing this method, are going to see the disappearance of much rigidity, which will give us hope for greater growth and employment in the future.
Congratulations, Mr Prodi and Mr von Wogau.
Congratulations to all of you.
Mr President, what we are debating is the proposal that Parliament and the Council should delegate substantial implementing powers to the Commission.
Parliament is happy to go along with that, provided there are substantial guarantees as regards the oversight of such delegated powers.
Those who sometimes worry that in seeking such guarantees Parliament is trying to modify the interinstitutional equilibrium should remember that this substantial delegation of powers is itself a modification of the interinstitutional equilibrium as it exists and that in those circumstances it is quite legitimate for Parliament to seek to obtain certain guarantees.
After many months of discussion, talks and negotiations with the Commission, the result has now been put forward to us in the form of the statement just made by Mr Prodi.
I must say that it contains a number of significant steps forward.
First, the Commission recognises that Article 202 of the Treaty should be changed at the next revision of the Treaty - it supports Parliament's position on that.
But, in the meantime, the Commission recognises that Parliament has the right to examine and take a position on the implementing measures that it puts forward to the specialist committees that will be set up to work with the Commission.
Parliament will have three months instead of just one month, as it has under existing procedures, to examine and take a position on such implementing measures.
The text of the Commission does not limit Parliament's right to examining whether the Commission has gone beyond what has been delegated to it, something which we could anyway solve by means of a legal case, if ever it came to a conflict.
It gives us the right to object, if need be, on the substance.
That is also very important.
But what happens if Parliament objects and then the Commission does not accept its objection to an implementing measure?
There the text is a little ambiguous: it speaks of equivalence without saying equivalence with whom.
Mrs BerÃšs has already made the point: equivalence with the Economic and Social Committee, equivalence with the press?
No, it is obvious for us insiders that it means equivalence with the Council.
That is what we have been talking about for months, and Mr Prodi's introductory remarks made it clear that the Commission too accepts that it means equivalence with the Council.
That is how we interpret it and I think there can be no other interpretation.
We have a third step forward and that is a guarantee in case all this does not work.
We have the sunset clause: after four years the delegated powers will revert to Parliament and the Council, unless we agree to renew them.
That is a guarantee to us and it will concentrate the minds of the Commission in between times, making it aware that it must exercise these implementing powers in a way that Parliament finds satisfactory if it wishes to have any hope of their renewal.
Fourthly, we have some important guarantees as regards openness and transparency, and we have acceptance of Parliament's idea that a market participants' committee should be set up alongside the other committees.
So, all in all, we can be satisfied with the progress that has been made, even if the drafting on the points I made earlier could have been a little better.
Nonetheless, I would ask whether the full text of the Commission's statement and Mr Prodi's statement today could be incorporated not just in the Verbatim Report of Proceedings but also in the Minutes, because it was a very significant statement and should be recorded in our Minutes, so that we have a proper record of what the Commission has undertaken to do.
Mr Corbett, your request has been anticipated.
This will appear in the Minutes as a document of record of some substance.
Mr President, for more than a year we in Parliament's negotiating teams, together with the Commission and the Council of Ministers, have been struggling with a puzzle.
We have all agreed with Baron Lamfalussy and his wise men that effective regulation of financial markets and the creation of a single financial market require us to delegate powers to the Commission and to a more nimble official committee.
But there has been a key problem.
Although this House was given the power of codecision vis-Ã -vis such legislation by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, it was not given the power to oversee effectively the role of any committee.
What we have seen of such committees in the past, we have not liked; they have been secretive, bureaucratic, Kafkaesque.
One condition on which my group insisted was that this culture of secrecy must change fundamentally, opening up decision-making not only to us in Parliament, but to the world outside.
We needed guarantees of transparency, openness and consultation.
Here they are in the President's statement and in the letter that Commissioner Bolkestein addressed to the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
But how were we to ensure that those promises of a changed culture, so often honoured in the breach, were finally respected?
It became clear that no lasting change could happen before the convention and the intergovernmental conference of 2004 had been concluded.
Only an IGC could change Article 202, which basically gives sole rights of oversight of committees to the Council of Ministers, ignoring the new role of Parliament.
We needed a promise that our concerns, ignored in successive treaty revisions, would be taken on board.
We needed an interim solution that meant that Europe's savers and investors did not have to wait still longer before the completion of the single market in financial services, which was first launched in 1973.
The health of the European economy depends on this legislation.
A vital and dynamic economy depends on an efficient financial system for collecting savings and funnelling them at low cost to the most productive uses.
It was long clear to the Liberal Group that the only interim solution would be to put a time limit on the delegated powers.
For the first time in EU legislation, we will have a sunset clause that will remove the powers of the Commission and the committee after four years unless they are used wisely and well.
Thankfully, the initial opposition of the Socialist Group and the European People's Party, together with concerns about legal uncertainty, were overcome.
Any regulations passed by the committee will remain on the statute book even if its powers are suspended, but Parliament can bite if it needs to.
This is an important moment for liberalisation of the European economy.
The deal will underpin the euro - for what is a single currency if the markets on which it is traded are still divided by national barriers?
It will give confidence that, whatever the challenges ahead for economic and monetary union, the European Union can surmount them, and it shows that Parliament is a serious and responsible legislature and partner in economic reform.
The Lisbon reform process is back on track.
I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr von Wogau, our rapporteur, and commend this report to the House.
Mr President, what is interesting about this report is the expressed concern for Parliament's rights.
This is matched by the claim that the committee wants to enhance democratic control over this fast-moving area.
What I do not see is any concern expressed for those in financial services or for the customers they serve.
Without dwelling on any particular aspect of the financial services legislation to which this report refers, I have to fulfil my own democratic responsibility and point out that the aggregation of Community legislation is slowly, but inexorably, strangling the financial community and making it almost impossible to trade.
In this context I am constantly reminded by my constituents that those most affected are the small and independent financial advisers, the net effect being that business is becoming steadily concentrated in the hands of larger and larger firms.
On the other hand, I see no slackening in the number of financial scandals which break into the headlines.
In fact, the very reverse seems to be the case.
Coming as I do from a tradition where parliament is the guarantor of safeguards and freedoms of individuals, I therefore find this report yet another exercise in increasing the power of the Community institutions, with no thought for what the legislation is trying to achieve.
The committee is counting the angels dancing on the end of a pin while the industry gradually collapses.
This to me typifies what the Community is about.
Mr President, President Prodi, Commissioner Bolkestein, once again, we are faced with the inadequacy of the European legislative procedure, as Mr Huhne pointed out a short while ago too.
In this context, Parliament has two distinct aims, which could have been conflicting: on the one hand, the need to secure a more significant, effective role for Parliament in these matters, to secure, that is, greater democratic legitimisation of the rules we are debating; on the other hand, however, there is the urgent need to conclude the Financial Services Action Plan with all speed in order to implement the common market in this sector.
We are seriously behind schedule, and the persistence of this hotchpotch of regulations is creating barriers which are costing the European citizens dearly.
One example is the case of pension funds, which have long been constrained by protectionist rules in the different Member States.
The average size of European pension funds is one sixth of that of pension funds in the United States and the yield in Europe is 60% of the American figure.
This represents a severe handicap for pensioners, for savers in general and for the efficiency of the economy.
The time factor is crucial.
We are lagging behind severely and we must therefore be responsible in our attitude and not neglect the need to give a vigorous boost to the construction of the internal market in our pursuit of the goal of securing a proper role for our institution.
To sum up, Mr President, my view is that the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, Mrs BerÃšs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have succeeded in achieving a balance between these requirements, providing us with a good short-term solution and pointing the way for the future.
The Italian radicals will therefore vote for the measure.
Mr President, as various Members have said, the Commission has been engaged in frequent discussions with those closely involved in this issue in Parliament, and the importance which the Commission gives to this important matter is also reflected in the presence of the Commission President here this morning.
Various Members have referred to angels this morning - either to the sex of angels or to how many could dance on the head of a pin.
May I say that it is often in the detail that one encounters the devil.
Let us hope that the devil and angels will compensate for one another and that we can achieve a balanced compromise this morning.
According to some Members who have spoken this morning, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo for example, that is indeed the case.
He said that this is a good day for integration and offered congratulations to the rapporteur - congratulations which I should like to echo on behalf of the Commission.
I should like to thank Mr von Wogau and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs very much for having crafted this compromise.
It is only right that the Commission should give expression to those feelings.
Mr von Wogau started by referring to the ambition of the European Union as expressed by the European Council in Lisbon, which is, as is well known, that the European Union should become the most competitive place in the world.
The Lamfalussy report should be seen in that context.
Mrs BerÃšs also referred to the ambitions expressed in Lisbon.
Indeed they form a whole, and I do not need to emphasise our wish to give as much impetus and stimulus as possible to our moves towards greater competitiveness.
Once again, this debate and the result which I hope it produces are of importance to the economic well being of the Union.
I do not have to explain what the report of the committee headed by Baron Lamfalussy is about and the way it refers to the comitology procedure for implementing measures or executive proposals.
The report by Mr von Wogau enumerated what has been achieved.
Mr Corbett has also done so.
He referred to the fact that, in the Commission's opinion, Article 202 of the Treaty should be changed in the context of the next intergovernmental conference - and this is the heart of the matter.
Parliament has often impressed upon myself and others the need to achieve equality with the Council in the oversight granted to both Parliament and the Council in considering executive proposals.
The Commission agrees and also sees the need for equal standing for Parliament vis-Ã -vis the Council in the whole comitology procedure.
Unfortunately, from the point of view of Parliament - and the Commission recognises its feelings and opinions - this is not possible at the moment.
Article 202 is clear: the comitology procedure arrived at in June 1999 is also clear and, as much as the Commission sees the point of view of Parliament and has said so in its own White Paper on governance, it is at present unable to grant Parliament's wishes.
The Commission's view as laid down in the White Paper on governance is that Article 202 ought to be changed.
However, the Commission itself cannot do that; any such change has to take place in connection with the next intergovernmental conference.
Mr Corbett mentioned that Parliament now has three months to consider the executive measures put forward by the Commission.
There is full equality with the Council here, and that is a good thing.
He went on to say that Parliament now has the possibility to object in substance.
Yes, indeed, the substance concerns us all and Parliament has the inherent right to put forward its positions and its arguments.
The Commission has said that it will take the fullest possible account of Parliament's position.
That is also what Parliament would want the Commission to do.
Mr Corbett spoke about equivalence - a fine word - but equivalence with whom?
Obviously, equivalence with the Council.
That is what the whole debate is about and it would not do to deny what is clear to every one.
Parliament wants that equivalence with the Council; the Commission is willing to grant it, takes the same view, and has said so in its declaration and in discussions.
Mr Corbett mentioned a sunset clause, which is another example of a weapon available to Parliament to ensure that the Commission takes the utmost account of Parliament's wishes.
The sunset clause means that the delegation of executive measures to the Commission lasts for no longer than four years.
It may be prolonged on the initiative of the Commission, but it certainly keeps the Commission's nose to the grindstone and is a powerful weapon available to Parliament.
The same applies to another factor, mentioned by Mr von Wogau.
In his introductory statement Mr von Wogau said that if the Commission does not carry out its promises - as set out in the declaration made by Mr Prodi - then the next time a directive comes around Parliament knows that it can keep a tight rein on the Commission.
The Commission is well aware of that.
That is another way in which Parliament can put forward its opinion forcefully and with conviction.
The Commission would therefore be well advised to listen carefully and take the utmost account of that opinion.
Mr Corbett's last remark - apart from the desire to have the declaration put into the Minutes - was on openness and transparency.
The Commission has stated this morning and in the letter I sent on 2 October to Mrs Randzio-Plath, chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that it is most willing to practise that openness and transparency.
Mr Titford said that the industry would collapse.
Methinks this is a poetic exaggeration.
I am not under the impression that the industry is about to collapse.
Yes, scandals emerge - perhaps less so in the European Union than in other parts of the world - but that is a fact of life.
I do not think the proposals made by Mr Prodi this morning will fuel more scandals.
They will, in fact, go a long way towards avoiding them, and therefore I cannot agree with the sentiments expressed by Mr Titford.
Finally, I come back to Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo who said that it was a good day for integration.
He congratulated Mr von Wogau, and I join him in that.
I wish to congratulate Mr von Wogau personally on the fact that at 11 o'clock this morning he will receive a high French decoration, the LÃ©gion d'Honneur.
The Commission congratulates him.
I will have the opportunity to reply to further questions later in the debate, so I rest the Commission's case here.
Mr President, I would like to ask you to record Mr Bolkestein' s comments in the Minutes of our meeting, because, if I am not mistaken, Mr Bolkestein is correcting Mr Prodi on a crucial point.
He is saying that the word 'equivalence' does indeed mean equivalence between Parliament and the Council.
Mr President, may I briefly reply to Mr Goebbels?
There is no contradiction between what the President said and what I said.
The equivalence is with the Council and nobody has ever thought differently.
Colleagues, if you read the text of Mr Prodi's preliminary remarks, you will see they carry the sentiment in substance.
Those remarks will be Minuted.
They cover the issue that has been referred to.
Mr President, on behalf of the British Conservatives and the rest of the PPE-DE Group I would like to say that we strongly support the compromise set out in the von Wogau report and reiterated by Mr Prodi this morning.
Parliament has secured significant concessions on transparency, on consultation and on oversight.
Parliament's rapporteur is to be congratulated for securing those.
Parliament should also express its appreciation to Mr Bolkestein and his staff, and to the Commission, for responding to the concerns that we raised about these matters.
Mr von Wogau deserves much praise for drawing to a conclusion the lengthy negotiations that we have had on this important issue.
We in Parliament have taken a pragmatic approach.
This is a workable interim solution pending final resolution of the whole matter of delegated legislation in 2004, when Parliament could and should ask for a legally binding call-back mechanism, which is desirable but, sadly, not permissible within the terms of the current Treaty and arrangements.
It is of vital importance that Parliament backs this compromise when it votes at 12 noon today, because without it we will not be in a position to deliver an integrated financial market - whether in 2004, 2005 or indeed ever.
That financial market is not just of interest to bankers; it could also lead to cheaper prices and a wider choice of financial products for consumers and businesses, cheaper borrowing, higher returns for savers and investors, as well as doing a great deal to start defusing the pensions time bomb.
All these are highly significant benefits to the ordinary people who elected us to serve on their behalf.
Accepting this compromise will bring us considerably closer to achieving our goal of an integrated financial market and delivering those benefits to ordinary people right across the European Union.
.
Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I want to vigorously emphasise that nobody in this House underestimates the significance of the financial markets.
We all know how important it is that we catch up on the United States' integrated market in terms of the productivity of capital.
On the other hand, we are also aware that the European financial market has significance not only for enterprises but also for those who rely on proper provision for old age, in other words who are, as consumers, dependent on it in view of their small pensions.
Parliament therefore bears a heavy responsibility for coming to the right decisions in the co-decision procedure.
In today's proceedings, with our debate on the von Wogau report, we have an extremely sensitive topic to deal with.
The rapporteur has attempted to find cautious formulations in order to give a chance to all the parties who are particularly sensitive to the effects of this legislative process.
I wish to underline again that Parliament, which demands more and more rights of co-decision, will not refrain from doing so in the parliamentary legislative procedure and that today's compromise in the von Wogau report is without prejudice to the possibility of Parliament giving up this legal position.
If we come to a transitional arrangement for secondary legislation today, that will only mean that we as a Parliament had previously been unable to push through the cementing of secondary legislation in the Treaty.
That had previously been a matter for the Commission.
In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to Mr Bolkestein for the fact that our negotiations on governance, laborious and difficult though they were, nonetheless succeeded in getting this formulation incorporated into the White Paper as a Commission proposal.
That is a success in which we all share.
Now we also have to achieve a successful conclusion to the next Intergovernmental Conference and the next amendment of the Treaties.
That is, without a doubt, very important.
One question, though, has not been answered - that of to what extent we can actually attribute real significance to the Lamfalussy procedure in all this legislation, because all of what has been described as technical, today, is very often political.
Parliament cannot be satisfied with a role legislating only in outline; we must rather still hold on to our authority to define, item by item, detail by detail, paragraph by paragraph, and article by article.
We shall pay attention to that.
I think it should also be clear, Mr Prodi, following your statement and also Mr Bolkestein's, that we will also take care to ensure that Mr Bolkestein's letter of 2 October to the committee will also, as an interpretation, be part of this protocol.
The third thing that is clear is that, by its two statements, the Commission is committing itself, today, in the implementation of the Lamfalussy procedure, not, under any circumstances, to follow the recommendations of the Securities Committee against a qualified majority.
This was, fortunately, clear today.
So I think we can be full of optimism and constructive spirit in approaching this form of cooperation on the basis of parity and equivalence.
Mr President, I should like to say thank you to Mr von Wogau who has expertly prepared a very well-considered report on this difficult issue.
It is an issue which has been waiting to be solved for a very long time, and I wish to be the first to welcome a solution.
Our debate today shows the general dilemma we face between, on the one hand, wishing to be effective and, on the other hand, wishing to secure democratic control by means of the legislation we adopt, and it is this issue of, on the one hand, effectiveness, and, on the other hand, democratic control which is to be discussed in detail during the forthcoming Convention.
Those of us who want to see clear ground rules for the European institutions are often criticised for being nit picking and preoccupied with power.
I disagree very strongly with that view.
In my country, Denmark, we had a constitutional struggle that lasted from 1866 right up to 1901, in which parliamentarianism was finally adopted as the central democratic principle.
It is the same process we are now in the throes of at European level.
I am therefore also very pleased that, in the midst of this struggle, we in the EU are able to deliver a result, namely this practical agreement.
To refer again to the situation in Denmark 130 years ago, the whole political system was just about paralysed during the Danish constitutional struggle.
I am therefore very pleased about the President of the Commission' s, Mr Prodi' s, statement that the Commission approves the content of this report, which ought to receive considerable support from the European Parliament.
However, it is extremely important that the Council not merely accept the content, but also the basic message, of this report.
Quite a few Members of the Council basically believe that this whole matter is futile and is merely a case of Parliament' s making a nuisance of itself.
That is not so. It is, in short, about exercising democratic control by means of our common European legislation.
Mr President, I will comment briefly on five points.
Firstly, at this point in the debate the facts have been well established.
The history of the tempestuous relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been well described and if, as Lenin said, only fools discuss the facts, I do not want to fall into that temptation and I will say no more on this point.
Secondly, if you will allow me to speak autobiographically, I belong to the generation of Spaniards who well recognise the importance of parliament in a democracy.
What is more, I was part of the Spanish Parliament that created the Constitution.
I therefore have great sympathy for Mrs Randzio-Plath' s defence of the rights of Parliament.

Thirdly, to continue in an autobiographical vein, I am also a committed European and I am absolutely sure that, just as the euro was essential yesterday, today structural reforms are absolutely necessary and, amongst them, we must place special emphasis on the reform of financial services if we want the European economy to be competitive.
My fourth point is the reconciliation of these two objectives: doing things well and doing them quickly, speeding up the process and respecting the rights of Parliament, must be carried out, as Mr Huhne said, within strict limits, the limits laid down in Article 202, which are badly worded and whose reform we advocate.
Finally, the solution to this dilemma has been discovered by the new Knight of the Order of the Legion of Honour, Karl von Wogau, and supported by this Parliament.
I hope that the Commission appreciates this vote of confidence from Parliament in the Commission and the Council, and that it will never fall into the temptation - since Mr Bolkestein likes Latin - to alter the par conditio, because the reaction of a spurned lover is unpredictable.
Parliament has the powers to try to go into the maximum detail within level 1, which would delay the process.
Parliament could, like a spurned lover, delay discussing the proposals and that would mean doing the opposite to what we should be doing.
I believe that today is a great day for all of us.
I congratulate Karl von Wogau, the Commission and the Council and I hope that in Barcelona we will be able to reap the harvest which we have begun to sow today.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is indeed a most decisive day as far as the role of Parliament is concerned.
President Prodi's statement - which I see as an undertaking by the Commission - has made clear in an unprecedented way that the Commission will put its weight behind the idea that the two components of the legislature should have real equality of rights in what they do.
I believe that what Commissioner Bolkestein had to say was also of particular value.
It was, in particular, thanks to Mrs Randzio-Plath's initiative and endeavours that we were able to convince Commissioner Bolkestein as well, something that was not so easy, nor was it clear from the outset that we would be able to do it.
I do not believe that Commissioner Bolkestein has now been transformed from a devil into an angel, for we did not see him as a devil and he is not an angel now, but a good piece of work has been done.
Commissioner Bolkestein, I would also like to express my respect for the way you today clarified and enlarged on what President Prodi said.
Firstly, I see this as a clear commitment by the Commission to bring about the parity, as President Prodi stated, of the two components of the legislature, to give equal weight and value to the roles of the two legislative bodies, the Council and Parliament, and finally, to do so by means of the amendment to Article 202.
The statement is clear and unequivocal, and it is as such that we will always, to some extent, keep it in mind.
There are, secondly, definite statements on how this equal treatment will affect financial services.
I assume that other areas are also affected by the intention - even subject to the legal position as depicted by Mr Bolkestein - to do everything legally permissible to achieve de facto equal treatment for the two components of the legislature.
I must acknowledge that what you say, Mr Bolkestein, is indeed how the law stands.
What I can read between the lines, though, is that the legal position will not be used to keep the unequal treatment in place until Article 202 is amended, but that everything possible is to be done in the meantime to achieve de facto equal treatment of the two legislative bodies in all essential matters.
For my third point, Mr President, I will address you, for it has to do with the setting up of an interinstitutional working party to make appropriate preparations, something which President Prodi has repeatedly urged, most recently persuading Mr Aznar, the President-in-Office of the Council, to give a positive response to the effect that this working party is now actually going to be convened.
I would think it right and proper, Mr President, if joint discussions in the Conference of Presidents were to prompt you also to take the initiative in order to achieve what, as I have said, President Prodi was the first to propose, namely this interinstitutional working party.
Today is an important day in the sense that it is now a matter of record that we recognise the knowledge and insight possessed by the experts, but at the same time that democratic control means that it is parliaments that, at the end of the day, decide on political objectives.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr von Wogau on the wonderful work he has done on this report.
This report and the statements made about it by both the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Commissioner Bolkestein, free up a process which has really prevented the speed that we would have liked in the negotiation of projects and the proposals for the creation of an internal market in the financial sector.
In the little time remaining for me, I would like to focus on two aspects.
Firstly, once we have freed up the process by means of the agreement that today' s debate represents, what we have to do is get to work.
That is to say, we have to make the 42 directives envisaged a reality, by 2003 in the case of the capital market and by 2005 in the case of financial services.
Secondly, I would like to point out that the European Parliament has never created obstacles when it has been asked for speed, urgency and cooperation in the implementation of projects and issues of such importance as the implementation of the euro or the European internal market itself, which are two very important successes of European construction.
The Commission has not normally created obstacles, nor has Parliament, and if we have ever been faced with obstacles, it has been in the Council.
In other words, everybody must fulfil their responsibilities.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take up a position on this issue and propose to do so in seven stages.
Firstly, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for this report and for his gesture of commitment to various committees and institutions, in order to resume progress towards realisation of a common objective.
This instance has provided an answer to the question as to what sex an angel is; here the parliamentary angel was a male one in the person of Karl von Wogau.
Secondly, I would like to thank him, again, today for the excellent work he has done for the Community on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which he has left after many decades and to which - as to all the other committees he sits on, as this report shows - he has brought massive experience and economic knowledge.
Thank you, Karl.
My second point - and this is probably beyond doubt - is that we must speed up the Lisbon process, and - not only for that reason, but certainly for that reason - we must create an internal market for securities as rapidly as possible.
My third point is that whoever wants to do that must take all necessary steps to enhance the efficiency of the decision-making procedure and accelerate the legislative process.
That, after all, is the reason for this report and for the Lamfalussy report too.
There is just one contradiction I wish to clear up.
There is no contradiction between speeding up the procedure and Parliament having greater efficiency and more codecision.
There is a contradiction between Article 202 and Parliament's codecision procedure; that is why it needs to be amended.
So I do not only expect codecision, information and transparency to be adhered to, as this is so formulated in most of the translations of the Commission's reports; rather, I expect us to make every effort to help bring to fruition something that is a fundamental Parliamentary right and a precondition for transparency and information.
This report is an important step towards making this possible.
In this connection, I would like to direct your attention to item 5 of the report - I do not need to explain it at the moment - and to two events that show why we are so sceptical.
I recall that the Commission presented a report in October 2000 on occupational pension schemes, which Parliament adopted in July by 460 votes, yet the Council has not, to date, adopted a Common Position on it.
I recall the European Company, on which we are in agreement on matters of content but not at all as regards form, because we act on the basis of Article 95 and, in Nice, the Council pulled the legal basis for codecision from under our feet.
That is why we are so sceptical.
Now for my last point. Mr President of the Commission, I wish to refer in this context to the sentence in your statement in which you said that it is the introduction of the euro that makes this report so important, and that, by this report, we are contributing to a strong and solid capital market.
I therefore do not at all understand how a member of your Commission can, in a German newspaper, criticise your decision to send a notice of poor performance to the Federal Republic of Germany and actually dissociate himself from the thinking behind it.
I would like a statement on that as well, as the Stability Pact and adherence to it are issues affecting the credibility of the euro and a precondition for public confidence in it.
I consider the letter necessary because we must not differentiate between States, but must do our utmost to ensure that the Stability Pact is applied to everyone equally and with its full weight.
Anyone who dissociates himself from that is endangering the credibility of the Stability Pact and, thereby, confidence in the euro.
Mr President, Mr von Wogau has submitted an excellent report.
Nevertheless, Mr Prodi' s answer is not totally satisfactory, because Mr Prodi was still vague on the crucial point, namely that of equal rights between the Council and Parliament.
Mr Prodi tells us that the Commission is declaring its political will to work towards a situation where Parliament enjoys equal treatment.
Equal with whom and equal to what?
Commissioner Bolkestein told us that we must not discuss the sex of angels, but that 'equivalence' obviously means equivalence between Parliament and the Council.
At the same time, however, Mr Bolkestein is warning us that the Commission cannot guarantee us this equivalence.
Why did Mr Prodi not use these simple words, namely 'equal treatment with the Council' ?
Mr President, I am the European Parliament' s rapporteur on the market abuse directive.
I must now table an amendment, therefore, laying down in substance that the Commission will be permitted to make technical amendments to this directive and that Parliament will have three months in which to respond.
If, within this time, Parliament has not adopted a resolution stating that the proposed technical amendments go beyond the executing powers specified in the directive, the Commission will stop its measures.
So far, so good!
If this does not happen, I will have to write 'the Commission will work towards a situation where Parliament enjoys equal treatment' .
Mr President, who are you trying to fool?
Can you really propose this sort of text to Parliament?
I think that the Commission must make a commitment to show respect for the resolutions adopted by Parliament.
That, Mr President, is democracy - pure and simple.
Mr President, even though I have only two minutes in which to speak, I have to begin by saying this: Esteemed Commissioners, we MEPs are now committed to working on the assumption that the Commission's statement is made in accordance with the thinking behind the codecision procedure and on the basis of the role played by Parliament and the Council in the Lamfalussy procedure being one of equivalence and parity.
And what are we doing today?
This is a very important stage in the new European Union's coming into being, and I think we have managed to specify what paper and pencils are to be used, where the entrances will be, which architects to appoint and what they can do and when they can do it on the road towards standardised financial services.
What we should not forget in all this, though, is what the edifice will look like, because it will be one of the most important high-rise blocks in the European Union.
Following this trial of strength between Parliament, Commission and Council, the issue is now what we want this building to be like.
That is the next step and also what we in Parliament expect.
Our expectation is that the standardisation of financial services will not result in the problem of consumers having this sort of excess of information, that, in other words, once equal entitlement to them is offered without regard to national frontiers, that it does not come pouring in like a flood of videoclips inundating the consumers, who will then be 'overnewsed and underinformed' .
We, of course, expect to prevent the big businesses' desire for excessive market concentration, resulting in a mere two or three players ending up defining the market.
The insurers Allianz have said that they will only go into markets where they will be among the top three, and that, on an international level, will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The third problem is the insecurity of investors.
We are implementing this at a time when only 65% of Germans who invest in stocks and shares state that they want to carry on doing so.
We live at a time when we have to deal with the collapse of important pension facilities in the USA, and 'ruinitis' is going round.
This must not be allowed to happen in Europe.
There you have a demand for what your legislation should contain.
If we end up with USA-style unequal distribution, then we in Europe will have failed.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the speakers for this excellent debate on an extremely important subject, which has focused both on the matter at hand and, more importantly, on its symbolic value and on the joint commitments we must make for the future.
We all know, we all realise that we need to respect the current sensitive and possibly inadequate balance between institutional matters and policy, but we also know that we will have ample opportunity to go back over these issues during the debate launched within the Convention.
Today, the Commission has committed itself according to the terms of the statement I have read - and it could do no more - but soon it will undertake to work with Parliament to ensure that its institutional rights are fully recognised.
Mr President, Mrs Randzio-Plath has drawn to our attention the importance of financial markets and the Commission wholeheartedly subscribes to her words in that respect.
She said so in order to stress the importance of the report by Mr von Wogau and there again the Commission agrees with Mrs Randzio-Plath.
Mrs Villiers very succinctly put her finger on the sore spot by saying that a compromise is necessary and that is what we are discussing this morning because the call-back option is not permitted under the Treaty and the comitology procedure.
That is perfectly correct.
Mrs Villiers then went on to say that we are talking here about benefits for ordinary people.
There again the Commission wholeheartedly agrees.
Fortunately we are living in the European Union where more and more ordinary people own shares and all we are doing this morning is providing a legislative framework which safeguards the interests of ordinary people.
I am very pleased to say that we are making good progress in this work.
If I have understood Mrs Randzio-Plath correctly, her interpretation implies that the Commission would not go against a simple majority in Parliament.
Without saying so she refers to the "aerosol declaration" which the Commission appended to the comitology decision of June 1999.
If that is what she meant - this is not the first time that Mrs Randzio-Plath and I have discussed this matter - then that is not a possibility for the Commission because, as Mrs Villiers and other Members of Parliament know, it does not agree with the comitology decision or with Article 202.
I should like to address Mr Goebbels' comments.
He said that the Commission should show respect for Parliament's resolutions.
The Commission does show respect for Parliament's resolutions.
More to the point, the Commission has said that it will take the fullest account of Parliament's position.
What more can Mr Goebbels want?
I should like to add that the Commission has respect for Parliament's resolutions, but it has more respect for the Treaty. It has more respect for the agreed comitology procedure.
The Commission shows respect all around but is bound by the formalities of the Treaty and wishes its words to be interpreted in that way.
Mr Goebbels also made reference to the word "equivalence".
The Commission has very clearly indicated its sympathy with Parliament's position with respect to Article 202.
It has laid that down in black and white in the White Paper on comitology.
The Commission will continue to work on that basis - as stated by the Commission President, Mr Prodi, when he said that the Commission would continue to do that and, fully respecting the existing institutional balance, the Commission would treat Parliament and the Council on an equal footing.
In the end we are striving for what we can achieve only at the next IGC, which hopefully will start in the year 2004.
Since this is close to the hearts of Members of Parliament, may I end by summarising in seven points the safeguards which this Parliament has.
Firstly, the extent of delegated powers will be defined through codecision.
Secondly, there will be a fully open and transparent process including a market participants' group attached to the European Securities Regulators' Committee.
Thirdly, there will be a sunset clause - and this is in response to a specific request from Mr Huhne in this Parliament - limiting the duration of the delegated powers to four years after adoption of each legislative act.
Fourthly, the Commission, as I have mentioned a few times this morning, will take the utmost account of Parliament's position and of any resolution - Mr Goebbels - stating that the Commission has exceeded its delegated powers.
Fifthly, the Commission will support a change to Article 202 at the next IGC.
Sixthly, there will be a full and open review in 2004 and we hope an interinstitutional monitoring group to ensure everyone carries out their commitments connected with the Lamfalussy process.
Seventhly and lastly, if the Commission fails to respect its engagements Parliament will not grant any further delegated powers in future.
In effect, Parliament can make its voice heard in no uncertain fashion and the Commission is bound to listen to that.
I should like to thank the rapporteur and Members of Parliament for their constructive attitude.
Mrs Randzio-Plath was kind enough to say a few kind words in my direction.
May I reciprocate and say that I have always found the discussions with the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs very fruitful, friendly and, in the end I hope, constructive.
Mr President, may I briefly put a question to Commissioner Bolkestein?
On the basis of which article of the Treaty did the Commission agree, at Stockholm, to declare that it would not go against a majority opinion of the Council?
Mr President, both Mr Goebbels and Mrs Randzio-Plath are well aware of the answer.
They know that when the comitology procedure was decided on in mid-1999, the Commission issued a unilateral declaration, which has become known as the "aerosol" declaration, which was given in exchange for something called the contre-filet, another procedural device.
The Commission and Council accepted that the contre-filet procedure would disappear, and in its place came this unilateral declaration, which referred to a much earlier case in connection with veterinary matters.
That is why in the unilateral Commission declaration mention was made of particularly sensitive cases, because the veterinary situation back in the early 1980s concerned human health.
The declaration stated - again by way of replacement of the contre-filet procedure - that the Commission would not go against a majority opinion of the Council, thereby basically maintaining the status quo, while bringing things into sharper focus.
Therefore the Stockholm resolution adds nothing beyond what was already in place under the comitology procedure, because the same words - the ipsissima verba - that appeared in the declaration by the Commission in June 1991 reappear in the resolution of the European Council.
So matters have basically remained the same.
If Mr Goebbels is asking on which article this is based, then the reply is on Articles 202 and 211.
Mr President, there has been a qualitative change in the form of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This shows me, though, how necessary it actually is to have secondary legislation on a basis that accords with the Treaties.
I just want to ask whether the Commission is now, at last, declaring itself willing to grant the competent committee in Parliament, the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, observer status on the Securities Committee and invite it to the meetings on a regular basis.
Mr President, much as the Commission would like to come to a final and positive agreement with Parliament, I regret that on this specific point the Commission cannot agree with Mrs Randzio-Plath since the presence of a parliamentary observer in the Securities Committee would not be in accordance with normal constitutional principles.
As Mrs Randzio-Plath says, it would amount to a mixing of executive and legislative powers, and for that reason the Commission cannot see its way to agreeing with the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.
Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco
The next item is the debate on the second report (Ã5-0016/2002) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Article 93 of the Treaty states that efforts must be made to harmonise excise, that Parliament must be consulted in this procedure and that the aim of the Treaty is to harmonise taxation to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market within the time-limit laid down in Article 14.
Of course, Article 14 expired a long time ago, back in December 1992; however, as the internal market has not quite been completed, the purpose of the Commission's first proposal was to serve the objectives of Article 93, with which we have no choice but to agree, given that they derive directly from the Treaty.
Because Parliament has a consultative role in the matter, the Council is pushing for a fast response from us.
The Commission too has put pressure on Parliament, brandishing the fact that the Council is in unanimous political agreement on the matter, so all that is left is for us to endorse the Council's and the Commission's faits accomplis.
This was, in my view, an unfortunate way of dealing with Parliament, especially on the part of the Commission, because it is tantamount to asking Parliament merely to endorse a fait accompli without making any contribution of its own whatsoever.
Our purpose in life is not to sign blank cheques, Commissioner.
And, may I say to the Council that I trust that its haste in requesting an urgent procedure does not mean that it is merely going through the motions and that it will give serious attention to Parliament's opinion, into which, I can assure you, we have put a great deal of thought.
Parliament has already rejected the previous Commission proposal by a large majority.
The main tenet of that proposal was to impose a minimum fixed tax of EUR 70 per 1000 cigarettes, alongside the minimum 57% tax charged on the most popular market brand.
I do not want to go into the technicalities of how this tax is calculated at this point.
Parliament rejected the proposal because it accepted the following arguments: first, imposing a minimum fixed tax would put small and medium-sized tobacco companies at a distinct disadvantage.
Assuming that the only way a small tobacco company manages to get its most popular brand on to the market is by reducing the price, it immediately faces a heavy fixed tax which bears no relation to its production costs, putting it at a disadvantage in relation to large tobacco companies.
Secondly, the immediate effect of the Commission proposal was to increase prices in southern countries, where per capita income is lower than in the northern countries in the main zone of the Union.
Insofar as taxes were harmonised, they were harmonised upwards, by increasing prices.
Parliament had, in fact, called for this sort of harmonisation in the past, but it was clear from the last vote that the new Parliament voted in took a different view and in 1996 and 1999, Commissioner, the rapporteurs voted against the Commission proposal.
I believe that Parliament is now convinced that constantly increasing the price of cigarettes does not achieve the objective, which I support, of reducing smoking; all it does is to reduce legal sales of cigarettes and encourage cigarette smuggling which, in some countries, has reached worrying proportions.
