The Commission therefore does not accept Amendments Nos 10 and 13.
The Commission can, however, accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12.
We will indeed have to look again at the Commission's original proposal for emission ceilings in 2004 and decide whether it would be better to share the burden differently in the light of more recent developments.
Amendments Nos 11 and 12 explain this very clearly.
In answer to Mr de Roo' s questions, I want to say that the Commission has completed two studies on volatile organic compounds.
We are now doing preparatory work and expect to be able to discuss potential proposals with experts actually before the summer.
That is perhaps important information.
As regards costs, and how far the Member States, Mrs Jackson, are willing to pay the costs?
As you know costs were discussed at enormous length in the Council.
Member States believe we can meet the target and they have signed up to what they feel they can do now.
They want to look again at the costs in 2004 before signing up to more.
Of course the costs are higher for some countries than for others because of where the pollution emissions come from.
All emissions are not equal because of different weather patterns.
That was also noted in the discussions in Council.
As far as the remaining amendments are concerned, Amendments Nos 1 and 6 are related to Amendment No 10.
The Council inserted the word "broadly" in recognition of the fact that the emission ceilings of the common position will not go all the way to meeting the goals for 2010 and the Commission does not therefore accept these amendments.
Amendment No 4 would set dates by which the long-term goals of this directive should be met and it is still the Commission's view that, with our present knowledge, any date would be mere guesswork and we should not put it in a legal text.
The Commission must therefore reject Amendment No 4.
I hope we will have a clearer forecast when we review the directive in 2004, but then - if you will forgive the joke - some emission figures will have to be taken out of the air.
The Commission agrees wholeheartedly that emissions from international shipping are important and must be tackled effectively.
We must also look at the effect of aircraft emissions.
The Commission can accept fully Amendment No 2 and can accept in part and in principle Amendment No 3.
We would however prefer to quote Directive 99/30 more directly.
We cannot accept Amendment No 5, nor the first part of Amendment No 7.
Emissions from international maritime traffic and cruising aircraft cannot be assigned to individual Member States.
We must instead follow up action already taken in the International Maritime Organisation and decide what else is needed.
The Commission can accept Amendment No 8 in part and in principle.
Bringing forward proposals on economic instruments is something that we will look at as part of our review of the directive in 2004.
We can accept in part and in principle the second part of Amendment No 7 and Amendment No 9.
Again, the Commission cannot accept the requirement to bring forward proposals.
All the issues highlighted by Parliament should be considered during the review.
I thank Parliament for its time and look forward to progress on this very important dossier.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environmental inspections
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2001) by Mrs Jackson, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council recommendation [C5-0001/2001 - 1998/0358(COD)] providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States.
Mr President, I report to the House at the end of a long and not wholly satisfactory saga.
The European Parliament's delegation wanted to see this recommendation on environmental inspection cast in the form of a directive.
We were very forceful about that and we tried to persuade the Commission to sympathise with us.
It did not.
We tried to persuade the Council of Ministers to agree with us and it did not.
This is very sad but it is a situation which we have unfortunately had to live with because, if we had not agreed to the texts which we now have in front of us, we probably would not even have had a recommendation.
Many of my colleagues - I hope all my colleagues - feel that we are dealing with a very unsatisfactory situation.
In effect, we are constantly adding to the burden of European Union legislation on the environment, with the very good intention of improving our environment, but the Member States are signing up to legislation which they are in many cases unable to put in place in the form in which they adopt it.
They may in the end be able to reach the standards that they agree to, but we have to ask how long this will take.
In some instances the Commission is still very much in the dark about whether Member States are really complying with legislation because the Member States are very slow in telling the Commission about the state of implementation in the reports that they are obliged to send to Brussels.
So, if you want to put it at its most dramatic, the European Parliament finds itself complicit in a deceit on the people of Europe.
We are telling them that we have very forward-looking environmental legislation but in instances such as the nitrates directive and the urban waste water directive we find that in fact Member States are taking much longer than required to comply with legislation.
Indeed the case of the fine that the Greek Government is still paying to Brussels for failing to comply with a waste directive shows that it can be a quarter of a century before a Member State is even taken to court for failing to comply with legislation effectively adopted in the 1970s.
Parliament felt that the way to deal with this was to take what was originally a recommendation on environmental inspections and use it as a way of enforcing common standards throughout the Member States by upgrading it to a directive which Member States would, we had hoped, want to take more notice of.
As I say, the Member States were against this.
It was rather enlightening to go to the meeting of the Conciliation Committee where it was quite clear that some Member State delegations were not interested in the subject at all, let alone in that particular meeting that we went to that night.
This is a situation in which only a minority of Member States are really interested in compliance.
For most it comes very low down on their list of priorities.
So I am afraid we have settled in a sense for second best.
We still have hopes that we will be able to return to this issue.
Indeed we intend doing so because, although we have a recommendation, within it we have a revision clause which will mean that the Commission comes back to Parliament within the lifetime of this Parliament - I think I am right in saying in 2003 - in order that we can try to assess how the Member States are performing in relation to this particular recommendation.
That would mean that Mr Davies and I, if we are spared and have managed to survive foot-and-mouth, BSE and everything else that seems to be afflicting the United Kingdom, will be able to make sure that we move to a directive if we feel that the recommendation is getting us nowhere.
We hope that we will have the support of the Commission in making that reassessment in 2003 a really serious exercise.
I am sure that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, who is very keen on getting better compliance, will want to support us in that.
We also managed to get into the recommendation the idea that the reports on inspection must be publicly available within two months of their completion and submission to the Commission.
We want to make sure that more people in Europe are interested in the issue of compliance - more people throughout the Member States, not simply in a selection of the northern ones.
And finally, might I draw attention to the fact that, although we could not formally record this, we have said that we will put a standard clause into directives that will simply say "Member States undertake to have in place, by the date of entry into force of the directive, systems of environmental inspection which will enable them fully to comply with the provisions of this directive".
We do not see how any Member State can possibly oppose that.
Mr President, I should like to begin with a word of gratitude and congratulation to our rapporteur.
I believe the parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee fought very hard before reluctantly consenting to the result of the conciliation process, and that is also how my group will vote in the Chamber.
Nevertheless, we cannot be satisfied with the joint text.
The European Parliament wanted a binding directive rather than polite recommendations.
The Member States dug their heels in and must now take responsibility for the stagnation of environmental policy in the Union.
At the present time, proceedings for infringement or non-observance of current environmental legislation are pending in more than 150 cases.
As much as this Parliament rejoices at every step forward in the field of environmental policy, we also have every reason to doubt the sincerity of the Union' s commitment to the environment if it omits the most important step, namely the application of its policy, the enforcement of its rules.
The best legislation is worthless if it is not enforced.
The conditions we imposed, namely the coordination of inspections between Member States in cases of cross-border environmental crimes and the publication of inspection reports two months after each inspection, represent an improvement.
But Parliament' s most important demand, in my opinion, relates to the revision clause which Mrs Jackson described, the clause requiring the Commission to present a report to Parliament after two years on the application and impact of the recommendation and, should it prove to be a dead letter - which I fully expect it to be - to present a proposal for a directive too.
Since I do not quite trust the very wishy-washy wording of this revision clause, which now states that the Commission should present such a report as soon as possible, rather than in two years' time, I must ask Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m to reaffirm her determination to ensure that this report will be on the table in slightly more than two years from now.
I do hope, of course, that the report will provide evidence that the recommendation has borne fruit, that our environmental legislation has become more effective, that the situation has improved.
At the present time, however, although I have heard the message, I am still lacking in faith.
Mr President, I know of no one who disagrees with the view that environmental legislation should be enforced equally and effectively across the Union.
This report gave us the opportunity to take some practical action.
It seems to me that for more than a year and a half we have had a dialogue of the deaf and the result is that we have achieved nothing worth having.
I do not blame the Commissioner who inherited this from her predecessor, but the recommendation from the Commission was deeply flawed and thoroughly unpopular with Member States, who supported it only because it was non-binding and could therefore be ignored.
The view of Member States, that it was too prescriptive, came to be shared by many Members of this Parliament.
But there was never an opportunity to have a serious discussion between the Council and Parliament about the best means of achieving what should have been shared objectives.
Perhaps this was a failing on our part to take some kind of initiative.
On the other hand, the radical yet eminently sensible compromise proposal made by Mrs Jackson and backed by the Conciliation Committee gained no support either from the Presidency or the Commission.
So maybe no meeting of minds was possible.
But the commitment secured from the Commission to consider introducing some kind of directive in a couple of years' time, while welcome, given the Commissioner's declared support for ensuring that we are enforcing rules and laws effectively, should have been coming any way and adds nothing to previous statements.
I regard this entire law-making exercise as a failure.
There was simply no proper dialogue between the institutions.
I feel we have let down our constituents across the European Union.
With hindsight, I believe it would have been better for Parliament to have let the conciliation process collapse.
The Liberal Group will be voting against adoption of this recommendation tomorrow.
I just hope we can all do better next time.
Mr President, I will keep Parliament regularly informed on implementation and the rate of compliance.
This is one of the most important issues we have to work on in the next few years and that is also why it is given as one of the priorities in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
We have to concentrate on implementation.
I will, of course, come back to Parliament and if necessary introduce legislation, the so-called guillotine approach.
We will put pressure on Member States.
I think when people come to the conciliation process they put a lot of time, effort and energy into it and they want to agree, so it is worthwhile.
It will help if the citizens of Europe are kept informed about implementation and we are proposing different ways of doing that.
Any more ideas on how we might achieve this and keep up the pressure on the Member States will be welcome.
The difference of opinion was on the legal instrument that would best meet the objectives.
I am glad that we have reached an agreement on the form and wording of the instrument by taking on board Parliament's amendments.
I also support Mrs Jackson's suggestion that this sentence should be inserted in all the proposals from now on.
It is a good reminder for the Member States.
The amendments will tighten up the requirements in the recommendation.
For instance, reports on site visits should be available within two months of the inspection taking place.
We now have to ensure that the recommendation is fully implemented.
I should like to acknowledge IMPEL's role.
Its work on minimum criteria for inspections helped in the drafting of the recommendation and they are a very important instrument.
IMPEL now has a mandate under the recommendation to review inspectorates, inspection practices and best practices in the training and qualification of inspectors.
The recommendation would now require Member States to report to the Commission on the operation within two years.
The Commission will then consider whether to put forward a proposal for a comprehensive directive covering the inspection's life cycle.
We will definitely come back to this and I hope that together we will be able to improve the implementation of the acquis communautaire on the environment.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Motor vehicle heating systems
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0055/2001) from Mr Miller, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, concerning the common position of the Council [7074/1/2000 - C5-0615/2000 - 1998/0277(COD)] with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive relating to heating systems for motor vehicles and their trailers and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Council Directive 78/548/EEC.
At this point we are reminded of the momentous nature of our work here in terms of the future of the European Union!
Mr President, I should like to begin by pointing out a technical correction.
This is something that should have been picked up in committee but, unfortunately, it was not.
It refers in Annex IV, 2.2, to gauge pressure of 500 HPA, where in fact it should actually refer to 0.5 HPA.
I would be most grateful if that small technical correction could be made.
I am sure all manufacturers of car heating systems would also be grateful.
There are two further amendments on this.
Both are very technical and have been suggested to me by the industry.
When I looked at them I did not see any problem.
I have submitted them to the committee and it has approved them.
The very fact that I have stood up here and said that two further amendments have been submitted to me by the manufacturers highlights the dilemma Parliament faces with this type of directive.
Last month, I moved a report on making buses accessible to disabled people.
Certain people criticised that report because it was far too technical.
I had actually taken a lot of the technicalities out of it.
However, when we come to this report, I wonder what I am doing, standing here at 10.30 p.m. on a Tuesday night, arguing over technicalities.
This is not a job for Parliament.
We should be directing policy in the way it is going, but we should not be discussing technicalities which would have been better addressed elsewhere.
I would like to suggest to the Commission that some of us get together at some point in the near future to stop this sort of report coming on to the agenda of Parliament.
It is wasting the Commission's time and it is wasting our time.
It is high time that we started looking at ways of removing these technical reports - which are not political by any means - from the agenda.
They should be discussed within the appropriate forum where engineers, technicians, scientists etc., or whatever technical group, would look at these specifications rather than coming to me.
I am not an engineer: I was a milkman in my first trade.
I do not know how I am expected to know the difference between 0.5 HPA and 500 HPA.
I make a plea to the Commission that we address this problem.
Hopefully we can get a decent night's sleep some time in the future.
Mr President, I really can only echo what my friend and colleague, Mr Miller, has said.
He and I alternate from one side to the other as rapporteur and shadow rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on these technical files.
I can also reveal to him that not only have I been nominated for this task in the Legal Affairs Committee, but I currently have on my file six other technical regulations - wearing my other hat - for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Perhaps it is because I was an engineer in my previous life.
But seriously, we must consider first of all the whole way in which this work is to be carried out.
This is an important directive.
We should not underestimate the importance of it.
I thank Mr Miller for the work he has done on basically sorting out the finer details of it although, as he said, it is not really a job we should be doing.
Commissioner Liikanen's services need to make sure that they are sorting out the fine detail.
The fine elements of this - the technical detail that the car or component manufacturers are advising us about - really ought to be handled by him before it comes to us.
Indeed, now that the Commission has acceded to the protocols of the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva, which has been where the bulk of motor vehicle legislation in Europe is handled, we are faced with another set of issues - most of which are being handled in the Industry Committee at the moment - where Parliament does not have the right of amendment as we have with this sort of directive.
That is probably right but there are still the political elements that we need to consider.
In fact, Mr Miller should be receiving an invitation from me, so I am pleased to say that I had already anticipated what he was going to invite me to do tonight.
He will be receiving an invitation from me to a meeting next week where I have been asked by the Industry Committee to convene a group of interested parliamentarians.
I know that Commissioner Liikanen's motor vehicle colleagues will be well represented and are keen to come and exchange views with us, as are the motor industry trade associations and the European and Japanese component manufacturers, to have a look at how we handle this growing and important issue and how we relate to it politically.
Essentially, we are looking for some shape of strategy and for key issues requiring a political input, so that we can then leave the technical side to the Commission.
There may be then, in the case of EC regulations, simply a right of veto at the end or, if we feel that the work has not been done properly, we will simply not accept it until it comes back in its finally completed form.
Then we should not have to be dealing with this sort of technical work.
Hopefully, by the time we come around to another cycle of these procedures, Mr Miller and I will not be here late on a Tuesday evening, talking about the technical details of heaters, tyres or whatever it is, but we will have had a chance to make an overall political input into the scope of motor vehicle regulation.
I know that Commissioner Liikanen is interested in seeing this process streamlined, not only in the fine technical detail, but also by looking at the ways in which the industry itself can be encouraged to develop its own technical regulations within an overall public policy framework and indeed, on crucial issues like safety, to be able to move beyond those and to use its own technical resources to help make better, safer and more environmentally-friendly vehicles for us to use.
Mr President, it has become a habit for Mr Miller, Mr Harbour and I to spend the evenings here in Parliament and I am happy to see so many parliamentarians wanting to join this debate - Mrs McNally, Mr Wijkman and Mr Chichester.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Miller, for his report.
It has been asked why this proposal has been put forward.
The answer is that it is a matter of extending the scope of the directive.
I really hope that we can find some solutions so that the Commission, the Council and Parliament can concentrate on issues of political importance.
Outsiders might find it difficult to understand why we spend our time on directives like this.
The proposal amending the Council directive relating to heating systems for motor vehicles is aimed at extending the scope to include all vehicles and not just cars.
The provisions for combustion heaters are introduced to ensure that these devices comply with high safety and environmental standards consistent with current technology.
The industry is also supportive as this harmonisation will offer it the benefits of the internal market.
I am therefore pleased that the rapporteur largely agrees with the common position.
He has proposed two technical amendments regarding the specific requirements of combustion heaters.
The Commission can accept these amendments as they do not interfere with the current safety requirements in the proposal.
The Commission will further investigate specific requirements for LPG combustion heaters to be added in Annex VIII.
It will also take into account the implications of the second amendment.
This report will pave the way to a speedy adoption of this directive.
In conclusion, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Energy efficiency
The next item is the report (A5-0054/01) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council [COM(2000)247 - C5-0567/2000/2265(COS)], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Action Plan to Improve Energy Efficiency in the European Community.
I feel sure that motor-vehicle heating systems will play a crucial role here too!
Mr President, the Commission' s proposal for an Action Plan to increase energy efficiency is welcome.
As the rapporteur, I can, at the same time, see that the plan has many shortcomings in its original form.
I hope that the proposals in Parliament' s resolution will be valuable in the way they complement the plan and that, as the Commissioner responsible, Mrs de Palacio will make our proposals her own.
In the course of discussing the Action Plan, it has become very clear how neglected energy saving is as a policy area and in society generally.
Many people are doubtless aware that we have to change the direction of energy policy and reduce our considerable dependency on fossil fuels.
If, however, you ask them how we are to do this, they do not as a rule come up with many answers.
Some people propose renewable energy sources. Extremely few would state that it is especially through more efficient energy use that the change should be brought about.
The reason, of course, is the lack of knowledge about what can be done.
What is more, there are not enough economic incentives to facilitate investment in more efficient energy use.
One major problem is that energy savings are invisible.
When we invest in a wind park, it is obvious to everyone what the money has been used for.
If we put a corresponding amount of money into the rational use of energy, the investment is seen as being significantly more diffuse.
I therefore hope that the proposal to turn all the EU' s institutions, that is to say the buildings we work in, into symbols of the rational use of energy will be adopted.
We can, of course, begin with this Parliament.
There is very great potential within the EU for saving energy and using it in rational ways.
In my view, the Commission is too cautious in its assessments.
At least 30% of the energy used today could be saved through rational behaviour.
If, moreover, the environmental costs of energy production and consumption were built into prices, the potential would be even greater.
The report' s demands that environmental costs should be internalised and that the problem should be overcome by means of different types of tax, especially a kilometre/tonne charge on heavy vehicles and a tax on bunker fuels, must be seen against this background.
In the same way, it is important to use the tax system to promote energy-efficient vehicles and buildings, or equipment which contributes to the more rational use of energy.
There is a lot to be done in this area to increase the incentives for the rational use of energy.
A general overhaul of tax policy is needed in order to promote what is good and positive from an environmental point of view rather than what is anything but good and positive.
That is additionally important in the current situation in which electricity markets are being deregulated.
Deregulation is excellent, but it has led to such low prices that, for example, problems involving counter-pressure have arisen.
The report demands a series of new directives aimed at stimulating energy efficiency in different areas: the building sector, combined power and heating, electronic equipment of different kinds and the transport sector.
Another important proposal is that of linking the intelligent use of energy to what is being called the Lisbon process.
The Lisbon Summit set the goal of making the EU into the world' s most competitive and productive economy.
Such a programme would be significantly impaired if the environmental aspects were not covered.
These could be covered by a demand for energy efficiency within the European Union to increase annually by, for example, 2.5%.
Even if no account were taken of the environmental aspects, there is a lot to be said for putting energy efficiency on the agenda set by the Lisbon process.
The more efficient use of natural and energy resources would be an excellent contribution to the European Union' s competitiveness and productivity.
Nor must we forget countries in the vicinity of the EU.
If these aspects are important to ourselves, it is also important that they should be emphasised in the negotiations with the candidate countries in the context of the enlargement process. That also applies, of course, in connection with the aid we supply.
In the course of the work done on the report, it has become clear to me how important it is that systematic, long-term work should be done on these issues.
Together with three other MEPs - Mrs McNally, Mr Turmes and Mrs van der Laan - I have therefore prepared an initiative called Energy Intelligent Europe, which has already been supported by many representatives of different political groups and Member States.
The intention is, in various ways, to stimulate the debate about the rational use of energy and to propose initiatives that should be taken by the EU and the Member States in order to make our energy use more intelligent.
There is therefore every good reason to return to these issues.
Mr President, it is right that we should consider another aspect of this communication, namely the fact that the planned 18% saving would also be a gigantic boost to the European economy.
An energy saving of 18% is equivalent to a drop in energy consumption of 1 900 terawatt/hours.
That represents a saving of EUR 124 billion, which could be used to enhance the economic potential of the regions within the European Union.
If we extrapolate from these figures, we find that consistent implementation of this programme could create about a million jobs in the European Union.
The second issue is the protection of resources.
We must be aware that 90% of the oil that is extracted today was found more than 20 years ago; in other words, it comes from sources that are more than 20 years old.
Only 10% of the oil that is being extracted today was discovered in the last 20 years.
Once again, I cannot fail to mention here that the procurement of oil is inextricably linked with the use of military power.
We see that in the Middle East, we see it in the Caucasus, and we see it in Africa.
The most important things in this context are to create awareness and to develop intelligent models for the use of combined heat and power, judiciously funded contracting models.
If we are serious about this, it is essential that the aims which are formulated here be given binding force.
Otherwise our work will merely have been a statistical exercise and an inefficient use of our own energy.
It is imperative that we remove the fiscal, bureaucratic and financial barriers.
Mr President, Commissioner, as we speak about energy efficiency today, we naturally think primarily of the security of energy supplies, and security of supply is undoubtedly an issue that is very high on the agenda of the European Union.
For that reason we wish to aim for a reduction in energy intensity.
The political objective for us at the present time is a 2.5% reduction.
It goes without saying that the widely divergent starting points of the 15 Member States must be taken into account when such targets are set.
That is precisely why we believe that this target must be binding, and the process should begin in that country where the level of energy efficiency is highest, the country most capable of effecting such an improvement.
We also believe that the share of combined heat and power generation in the energy market could be increased to 18% by 2010 and 25% by 2015, because that would also put electricity supply on a secure basis.
Cogeneration, of course, can be achieved with fossil fuels as well as with renewable forms of energy.
We are backing renewable energy in particular, and there are encouraging examples in this domain, such as pellet-fuelled heating, with which heat and power can be cogenerated very efficiently.
It is also important that the European Commission steps up its coordination effort in this area.
Coordinating European initiatives is a highly demanding task, if we think of programmes such as SAVE, Altener or the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Energy.
Many programmes are available, but the important thing is to ensure that they are carefully targeted.
My last point concerns public tendering and centralised procurement.
Special consideration should be given in these contexts to small and medium-sized companies; to that end, the cost of new appliances and systems should be calculated on the basis of their entire life expectancy, including the price of total energy consumption over that period in addition to the purchase price.
Mr President, congratulations to the rapporteur, who has achieved a quite remarkable level of consensus right across this House.
That consensus is leading to the joint initiative he mentioned, which we shall be announcing tomorrow.
This is unusually good working together.
Thank you, too, to the Commissioner, who works within the limits of a very inadequate Treaty.
There is no energy chapter in the Treaty.
This is a big gap and we must continue to put pressure on Member States if we want a coherent policy.
That is what disappoints me about this action plan.
It does not seem to be part of a coherent energy policy with short-term, medium-term and long-term strategies.
It is a piecemeal approach in which the emphasis varies according to the publication.
The case for energy efficiency is clear and unanswerable.
It meets all three requisites of an energy policy: environmental impact, security of supply and competitiveness.
All are helped by energy efficiency.
So if this is so self-evident, the obvious question is why do we need an action plan?
Why is this not happening automatically?
We know what the barriers are to accepting such a common sense solution.
Ignorance of the facts, particularly at household and small firm level.
Lack of incentive - energy in the European Union is artificially cheap because of the subsidies for the conventional forms of energy, which are often denied but certainly there, and the failure to take on board the external costs.
In many Member States, there is no requirement to even look at demand site management.
Commissioner, what has happened to the rational planning directive?
Please bring it forward again.
It has not finished its journey through the legislative process.
Transport is, of course, a particularly difficult area and action is needed.
This action plan of the Commission's is unambitious.
A 1% per annum improvement would be very easy to achieve.
We need at least 2.5%; that is attainable.
We want to give serious consideration to the setting up of an energy programme agency with the task of producing the coherent energy strategy I mentioned.
We can look at energy appliances.
However, I am dubious about voluntary agreements.
The Sixth Framework Programme gives us an opportunity to look at research and I hope that tomorrow, Commissioner, you will join with us in looking forward to a more intelligent use of energy in the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that in the European Union, across all sectors of the economy, and also in the world of the private consumer, there is great potential for boosting energy efficiency levels.
It is therefore essential that an effective strategy be developed.
It is the task of the European Commission to formulate proposals to improve building regulations, to promote the energy efficiency of electrical appliances, for which, among other things, standards must be laid down with regard to the standby function, and, last but not least, proposals for measures to adopt a Community policy for a sustainable transport system.
In my opinion, the European Parliament also has to act as a model.
Why, for example, can we not install solar panels in the European Parliament buildings, both here and in Brussels?
After all, the energy generated would supply sufficient energy to operate the hundreds of computers in the European Parliament.
Energy efficiency is not just about installing more efficient technology.
It is, above all, a matter of behaviour patterns.
Where the Member States are concerned, instead of getting bogged down with levy increases or the introduction of a CO2 levy, they should just focus on creating incentives for investments in energy efficiency, for example by reducing VAT rates on energy-saving appliances and services, or by reducing property tax for buildings which meet high energy-efficiency standards, and on granting special tax benefits for cogeneration, in particular.
Such measures constitute a considerable encouragement to promote energy efficiency, and I believe that we must urge everyone to actually make this happen.
Mr President, energy efficiency is arguably the poor relation in the overall supply situation.
We all agree that it is a good thing.
But, rather like Saint Augustine, who prayed to God to make him good but not just yet, we tend to put off doing something about it.
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his determined effort to put this right, both in his report and the initiative that my colleague has referred to for an energy-intelligent Europe - although I confess that I would describe efficiency and conservation more as common sense than intelligence.
Everywhere one looks in the energy-rich world we inhabit in Europe, and the USA in particular, one can see examples of energy extravagance, even profligacy.
The challenge lies in persuading members of the public of the need to change their ways.
The rapporteur lists many sectors where improvements can be made: by public authorities, industry, business and individual consumers.
However, I do not believe it is necessary to have an energy chapter in the Treaty, nor to impose punitive taxation in order to impose an improved efficiency.
It is better to proceed with a combination of setting higher standards and offering fiscal incentives, coupled with a campaign to persuade people to change.
Above all, we must change attitudes and encourage people to look at the world in a different way.
That is the way forward to achieve energy efficiency.
Mr President, the Commission has given us a good basis for discussion.
However, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for substantially improving and enriching the original ideas.
The ideas themselves, in fact, are not new.
We have been talking about them for the last ten or fifteen years.
There have been reports and studies - we already know everything we really want to know.
The question is how we can implement it all.
How can the technology, which is already available, be combined with the money, which is also available?
And here I wonder whether the European Investment Bank could play a bigger part.
The second problem I should like to address concerns administrative matters.
Let me cite one small example in the federal State from which I come. Our State has a number of universities, but let us just take one of them as an example.
Some of the university buildings were to be better insulated and have better energy systems installed.
It took many years before the buildings were refurbished.
Why?
Because the buildings belonged to the Ministry of Finance, but the Ministry of Science was their user.
In other words, one ministry would have had to invest, but another would have benefited from the investment.
Because each of them has its own separate accounting system, they did not sit down together.
It took many years until they were able to agree - and it took an EU study to bring them together, incidentally.
Absurd it may seem, but that is how things are!
By the way, in my home town, cars with extremely high petrol consumption are going for a song at the moment, whereas dealers are finding it difficult to sell cars with low fuel consumption.
This is a third problem, a question of consumer behaviour.
Consumers bear responsibility too, not only legislators.
If administrators, consumers and legislators get their act together, we can achieve something, and I eagerly await the Commission' s proposals.
I can assure you, Commissioner, that we shall support you in these efforts, and we shall also present initiatives of our own to that end.
Mr President, my colleague, Mr Wijkman, has been engaged in some valuable and creditable work in preparing this report.
This is a very important issue: we are not only speaking about the protection of the environment but safeguarding the supply of energy.
Any Member State that wishes to steer its emissions in a cleaner direction by means of taxation must be considered jointly responsible to the Union as a whole and our common environment.
We, for our part, must ensure that we do not support the distortion of competition in the name of free competition at the cost of caring for the environment.
A Member State that manages its carbon dioxide emissions responsibly, for example, must not be allowed to get into a situation in which countries that produce their energy with a proportionately greater quantity of polluting fuels have a competitive edge over it.
It is on this basis that harmonised environmental taxes are justified.
This example of mine is a clear depiction of the distortion of competition.
This scenario could eventually lead to a situation where environmental considerations are not predominant when deciding energy policy.
There is a danger that, with the liberalisation of the electricity market, Member States that attend to their obligations with regard to emissions may lose their electricity markets to countries that ignore their obligations.
Combined heat and power production is important for energy efficiency.
The special conditions that prevail in small and remote countries are also relevant here.
The special climatic features of Member States have to be taken into account at Community level.
I hope that Mr RÃŒbig' s amendment will gain support among my colleagues on this basis.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not long since the Commission reopened the debate on the security of energy supply in the European Union.
The Green Paper put forward by the Commissioner is an important instrument for energy policy in the European Union and clarifies some of the priorities in this field.
Amongst other things, it proposes decisive action in connection with energy demand.
If energy efficiency can be improved by 2.5% or 1% as the Commission proposes, we shall have succeeded in adding one more grain of sand towards achieving the objectives of the energy policy, which are to respect the environment, achieve a competitive market and improve the security of our energy supply.
In this context, I have to congratulate the Commission on its proposals for encouraging renewable energies, energy efficiency, security of supply and biofuels, and the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, on his references to future directives on building construction and cogeneration of heat and electricity, and I trust that the Council will give a much-needed boost to all these proposals.
GDP in the European Union is growing by an average of 3%, and we citizens of Europe are enjoying increased well-being.
We do not want to forgo this well-being, but we can make it more sustainable, especially in the construction and transport sectors.
I do not think this is the moment to reopen the debate on the CO2 emissions tax, given the differences in tax rates imposed by the Member States and their effect on inflation.
In addition, it has no effect on energy efficiency.
Neither should we separate this question from other additional measures to ensure that the internal electricity market works properly.
Lastly, it must be made quite clear that improved energy efficiency does not cut CO2 emissions but simply optimises them, since they will only come down through a reduction in the use of fossil fuels.
It is important that at the same time as we debate this issue we should think about promoting other forms of energy and carrying out consistent policies in other fields.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, and all the Members who have spoken today for the contribution they have made to this debate.
As we all know, energy efficiency is a question that has figured prominently while we have been drawing up our energy policy. As Mrs Ayuso was just saying, we have to look at it in a consistent way.
Energy efficiency is one of the elements in a consistent, rational energy policy. But I have to say that it is one of the elements that can help us meet the Kyoto targets, help make this a lasting development, and also help enhance the long-term security of supply.
As indicated in the Green Paper on the security of supply and the Kyoto commitments, issued by the Commission in December, energy efficiency and energy savings contribute to energy policy, since every kilowatt saved is the equivalent of needing to produce one kilowatt less.
I am aware of how difficult Mr Wijkman' s report was to prepare and the effort he had to put in to present such a clear and concise document as he has presented today.
I want to tell Mr Wijkman and everybody else here that in general I fully agree with what his report contains.
The scope of the report and the constructive opinions it contains will help us push forward and consolidate the implementation of the energy efficiency action plan.
I know that for some of you it seems rather unambitious to set ourselves an objective of a 1% increase in energy efficiency to be sustained over the next ten years.
You must, ladies and gentlemen, realise how much effort it will take over the next ten years to maintain this 1% increase in energy efficiency.
Of the approximately 18% margin that we have calculated could be obtained in energy efficiency we should be able to achieve two thirds by 2010, that is an improvement of about 12% in energy efficiency.
One per cent sustained: this is not 1% for just one year but an effort that will have to be kept up for some time.
I am pleased that Mr Wijkman concludes in his report that we can continue uncoupling economic growth from energy consumption. That is, we can grow more and at the same time still contain growth in the demand for energy.
I fully agree with Mr Wijkman' s demands for improving efficiency in construction.
A draft directive has already been circulated in the Commission to regulate efficiency and the construction standards within the European Union that ensure energy efficiency in buildings, especially public ones.
The Commission may present this directive soon, and I look forward to your contribution to it.
We also intend to put forward a framework directive on electrical equipment in buildings.
Up to now there have only been industry regulations or rules for particular types of electrical appliances - Mrs McNally has also brought up these matters - and what we intend to do is make a global regulation covering all electrical appliances that go into buildings of all kinds, whether domestic, industrial or commercial.
I also want to tell you that the proposals included in the White Paper on transport policy, which I hope to present soon, are entirely compatible with what we have been talking about here today and with what the Green Paper says.
Therefore I hope to be able to count once again on your backing and support for all these initiatives.
The idea put forward by Mr Wijkman that the Commission and the Member States should turn major public buildings into symbolic demonstrations I think is highly appropriate, and this is something I have emphasised in the past.
On the subject of the directive on the energy performance of buildings I hope to be able to make some progress in this direction.
I must also say that I fully agree with Mr Wijkman on the importance of the SAVE programme.
In order to guarantee the future of that programme and to determine its guidelines and scope, we shall soon be beginning to draft a new decision on the execution of the programme from 2003 onwards, and Mr Wijkman' s opinions and those given in the report we are discussing will obviously be taken into consideration.
With regard to the European Energy Programme Agency, this issue is likely to be more complicated, as you well know, but in any case the important thing is not so much which body or administrative division will carry out these activities but rather that the activities should be carried out.
On that we are in complete agreement.
I should like to conclude by stressing that the requests and observations made in the Wijkman report, together with all your contributions, will be taken into consideration - some of them very soon, like the buildings directive, for instance - and I think they are wholly consistent with the general energy policy that the Commission is putting forward. You already have concrete evidence of this: the directive on electricity from renewable energy sources, the communications - like this one - on energy saving, the Green Paper, and soon the directive on energy efficiency in the construction industry.
In today' s case, we are approving something that is not to do with energy saving but with the effectiveness of the whole system: the liberalisation of the gas and electricity sector. This is in no way at odds with the existence of additional measures encouraging us to save energy or use it better.
Human behaviour is essential.
As some of you have said - Mr Chichester and Mr Beysen, amongst others - the key is education and making people aware of how we must be really careful in using energy, because even though we may be able to pay for it there are certain costs beyond the price of the energy itself that we must never lose sight of.
We must not squander it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Thank you all for keeping within your allotted speaking times.
As a result, we can put the light out 45 minutes ahead of schedule, which will save a great deal of energy.
Thank you very much.
(The sitting was closed at 11.14 p.m.)
Madam President, I wish to inform the House that today is the UK's No Smoking Day.
As half a million EU citizens die needlessly each year from smoking yet 80% of smokers want to give up, I hope that colleagues will see fit to sign the tabled written declaration calling for an EU no smoking day.
Today alone 1500 EU citizens will die from smoking.
Let us, the European Parliament, lead the way in preventing these deaths.
Thank you, Mrs Stihler.
I have the feeling that the applause from your fellow Members shows that they have indeed listened to your message and I do not doubt for a single moment that they will all observe the UK' s No Smoking Day.
Madam President, I simply wish to ask whether we could once again check that the no smoking rules in this House are being enforced.
It has come to my attention that was not the case earlier this week.
I would urge renewed vigour in the application of those rules in this House.
Thank you, Mr Watson.
I see that Mrs Banotti has indeed been listening to you, as have the other quaestors, and we shall look into this.
Madam President, as you know I am a very enthusiastic anti-smoker.
However, I would just like to remind colleagues that they can smoke in comfort and away from everybody else in the designated area over there to the right at the window.
Fine, thank you, Mrs Banotti.
Follow-up to Nice
The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the follow-up to Nice.
I would like to welcome the President-in-Office. Mrs Lindh, you now have the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 'I am delighted to see that the Commission has taken concrete steps to include European citizens in a debate that is going to determine the long-term future of the Union.'
This is the beginning of the first contribution on the website on the future of Europe from Russell Pickard of the UK.
He hopes that as many citizens as possible will express their opinion on fundamental issues such as 'What kind of Europe do we - Europe' s citizens - want?'
'If we want things to change, let us 'be' the change' , writes Vincente Garcia-Delgado SeguÃ©s from Spain.
'Now every European citizen can say exactly what he or she wants - whether negative or positive - and the responsible leaders in the EU can listen to the citizens and take into account their wishes and hopes' , writes Ann Catherine Talbro from Denmark.
Kurt Linderoos from Finland proposes that all EU citizens contact an additional fourteen people, one from every other Member State, to discuss the future of the EU.
Last week, Parliament' s Vice President David Martin, the Prime Ministers of Sweden and Belgium and President Prodi launched the debate on the future of Europe.
You, Madam President, the two Prime Ministers and the President of the Commission made a joint statement and the website, which was initiated jointly by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, was opened.
With last week' s launch and today' s debate we are leaving "the follow-up to Nice" behind us and instead entering into the debate on the future of Europe.
According to the Nice Declaration, this broad debate on the future of Europe must be followed by a new Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
This year, the Swedish and the Belgian Presidencies will work with Parliament and the Commission to encourage wide-ranging discussions with all parties concerned: representatives of national parliaments and of public opinion, schools and universities and representatives of civil society.
We will place great emphasis on what the various political groups in Europe, inside and outside this House, have to say.
We must naturally include young people in this debate - it is their future in Europe we are discussing - as well as the candidate countries, as they too will be involved in building the Europe of the future.
The entire process must take place with the greatest possible openness.
Our goal is to bring the Union and its institutions closer to its citizens.
According to the decision made in Nice the process will address issues including restricting the competencies of the EU and the Member States so as to reflect the principle of subsidiarity, the future status of the EU' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, simplification of the treaties without changing their content and the role of national parliaments in the structure of Europe.
When we initiated the debate last week at one of the European Schools in Brussels it was clear that the interests of citizens extend far beyond the examples of institutional issues given in Nice.
I believe that it is correct and important for us to be able to conduct a broader debate on the future of Europe.
If we are to begin this discussion at the right end, we should, just like the school pupils in Brussels and the contributions on the website, ask the fundamental questions of what tasks we want the Union to take on and what role we want the Union to play in Europe and globally.
We have to be able to show our citizens that the EU is a strong force on the important issues: dealing with globalisation, human rights and democracy, a common asylum and immigration policy, employment and growth throughout Europe, combating crime, the environment, sustainable development and food safety.
It is important that we begin this debate with the factual issues, which our citizens can identify with.
In this work I really look forward to the contribution of Parliament as it is you Members who have direct contact with your voters around Europe.
This house has so often spearheaded important European debates on openness, the environment, expansion, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to name but a few examples.
It is now time to move from discussing form to also discussing facts and substance.
Then it is, of course, also important to return to the question of form, the best way in which we can reform the Union' s institutions and way of working.
Let me first say that the community method, which has played such an important role in European cooperation, must naturally retain a strong position in the future too, even if, in some areas, we supplement it with the new open coordination method.
A strong Europe requires strong institutions.
I noticed this myself when I was environment minister and worked closely with both the Commission and Parliament.
Let me also say that from the Swedish point of view we have an open attitude to the question of the form continued preparations will take.
I can see both advantages and disadvantages in the 'convention method' which several players have suggested as an important or possible model for debate.
Madam President, we are at the start of an incredibly exciting process.
The future of Europe is now being discussed throughout the Union, from Termonfeckin in Ireland today, to the Canary Islands in Spain next week, the following week in Kiruna in the far north of Sweden and the following day in Sparta in Greece.
Next week, as the first in a line of measures, this Parliament will organise a meeting with participants from the parliaments in the Member States and the candidate countries.
I look forward to being involved in the debate next week.
Later this year, the Commission will make an important contribution through its White Paper on European Governance.
I myself will also take up this discussion in the Council (General Affairs) and with the candidate countries in conjunction with the unofficial meeting of foreign ministers in NykÃ¶ping.
Sweden will also initiate a conference on the external role of the EU this autumn.
Every country will naturally conduct a national debate in the light of its own traditions and conditions.
We ourselves are responsible for ensuring that there is a broad debate which also involves the national parliaments and addresses the issues and organisations which are relevant in our respective countries.
What I have talked about so far naturally only concerns the very first initiatives.
The process will continue and the participants will inspire each other.
The Swedish and the Belgian Presidencies, Parliament and the Commission will share the main responsibility for this first phase, which demands close and trusting cooperation.
The internal debate within Parliament will be particularly interesting to follow.
The preliminary signals we have received are exciting and I look forward to the resolution from this house which is planned in May.
A report on issues concerning the future will be submitted to the meeting of the European Council in Gothenburg in June.
The European Council will then adopt a view on the continued process at the meeting in Laeken/Brussels in December.
Madam President, what kind of Europe do we, the citizens of Europe, want?
The question has been asked - let the debate commence!
Robert Schuman once said that Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements.
It is important to remember this even today.
Let the debate begin. Let us start from all those who have participated in the debate from the days of Schuman onwards and let us include all the young people who are talking to us today through the schools of Europe or participating in the debate on the website.
I now look forward to hearing the visions of the Members of Parliament on the future of Europe.
Madam President, Madam Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we too wish to hear the proposals and suggestions made by the Members of Parliament but, if I may, I would like to sum up the position of the European Commission on this major debate, which was promised at Nice in the early hours of the morning, when the ink had not yet dried on the agreement. It was almost as if the Heads of State and Government were not really satisfied with what they had just done after three days of negotiations.
So they decided, at the same time, to call for a broader-based and more in-depth debate on the future of the European Union.
Less than a week ago, the Swedish Presidency, together with the future Belgian Presidency, invited Parliament and the Commission to participate in this debate.
In a broader sense, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission looks forward to and will encourage this debate on European issues.
The Commission had already structured its approach a year ago, as I am sure you remember, by proposing, with you and with your support, a dialogue on Europe which was to be a first step.
However, for this debate to achieve the objectives laid down in the joint declaration signed on 7 March by Nicole Fontaine, your President, GÃ¶ran Persson, Guy Verhofstadt and Romano Prodi to highlight the challenges facing the European Union and encourage proposals, it is necessary to define the principles, the method and the agenda of this debate.
In the few weeks ahead of us, let us take the time to work on these principles, this method and the agenda.
This is, and will continue to be, the subject of work we will be carrying out together, especially in Parliament and the Commission, throughout the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, as we must achieve a high level of ambition concerning this debate and future reforms in Laeken.
A basic principle, first of all: it is the content of the debate, the future of the Union, which must inspire the form of this debate and remain its priority.
What sort of Europe do we want in the future?
What do we want to do together?
What will our plan be?
Do we want more integration or not?
Do we or do we not want a more political Europe?
I will add another question: how do we reform the Community model?
Even if it seems difficult to find simple answers to these complex issues, and perhaps for that very reason, the debate must enable our citizens to become aware of them and participate in it.
The first principle is therefore that of transparency and of the objectivity with which this debate must be conducted. We must not deny, indeed we must encourage, the expression of contradictory opinions.
We know that, in each of our Member States, opinions are diverse and often contradictory.
In order to respect the principle of transparency, however, we must ask disturbing questions, as I have just said.
The second principle is that of proximity.
Such a debate cannot be joined correctly if it is conducted solely from Brussels or Strasbourg.
There is the Internet, of course, which today is an irreplaceable information and dialogue tool, and this debate is already open on the website, even though, I admit, this site is far from perfect.
However, dialogue over the Internet is not enough.
The European debate must be opened up to people where they live, where they work, where they study, and to their national and regional elected representatives.
So, it must, of course, take place at a European level and be based first and foremost on the debates organised in each Member State at the most appropriate level which is, from my point of view, the level which is closest to the people of Europe.
If the Community institutions can make a contribution to the organisation of the debate - and the Commission is playing and will continue to play its part in this - these national debates will first of all have to be organised by the Member States.
The third principle could be that of anticipation.
Even though the candidate countries are not yet members of the European Union, they soon will be in a matter of years.
The future of this Union, therefore, concerns them here and now as much as it does existing Member States.
I believe that we must find a way to ensure that they are involved in the debate; that they take on an active role.
After the principles, ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the method.
The final decision-making stage of this debate which, as you have said, Madam Minister, we hope will be as short as possible, will, of course, be the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
We hope it will take place as early as possible in 2004, as was suggested by President Romano Prodi.
It is only by holding an Intergovernmental Conference as provided for in the Treaties that the Treaties can be reformed or changed.
We know now that this is the only possible method.
On the other hand, we also know that we must make careful preparations for this IGC and, without doubt, differently than in the case of the preceding IGCs in Amsterdam and Nice.
We must translate the challenges of the public debate into concrete proposals for the revision of the Treaties.
The structure or the competent body must, I believe, find inspiration precisely in the model or the precedent of the Convention thanks to which, in the course of a few months, the European Union adopted a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was solemnly proclaimed in Nice.
In other words, this structure or this body must not only be involved in debate but also in work and putting forward proposals, bringing together the different sources of the democratic legitimacy of Europe: representatives of the Members States, the European Parliament, national parliaments and the European Commission.
Having said that, many questions remain open.
What will the decision-making procedures of this body or this future convention be? What will its composition be?
Most notably, what place will be reserved for the representatives of the candidate countries?
What will its mandate be?
Does this preparation have to follow the public debate or is it preferable to undertake it in parallel throughout the process leading up to the IGC?
The Commission is very attentive to the replies that the European Parliament is giving and will give to these different questions of procedure.
And we ourselves are working on this.
I also think, Madam President, that our proposals, yours and ours, must be brought into line as closely as possible in the run-up to the European Council in Laeken.
And so I think we must step up the work done together by our two institutions, in consultation of course with the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies.
To this end, it will also be essential that the structure called upon to accommodate the debate is not a place reserved for experts alone, but rather a permeable structure which is open to external contributions.
Finally, having talked about the principles and the method, I would like to say a few words about the agenda for this debate.
Throughout recent years and this very long round of interinstitutional negotiations which began in Maastricht and ended, at least temporarily, in Nice, the European Parliament and the Commission have always united their efforts to ensure that real reform can see the light of day.
And at this stage, Madam President, I want to pay tribute to you and to thank you as well as Chairman Napolitano and the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the intelligent work you have carried out in close cooperation with us.
This was especially true, I think, of the last IGC, on the occasion of which, in its resolutions of November 1999 and February 2000, Parliament had expressed the desire to discuss global reform of the institutions in the same spirit as the Commission.
I think we must now keep this convergence intact, even if this means that, beyond our work together, we have to open doors and windows, stretch out a hand, listen and participate in a much broader debate.
If we really want to address all the challenges facing the Europe of the future, the next IGC cannot settle for simply examining the four issues mentioned in the Nice annex, which are constitutional in nature.
In all honesty, some of these four issues, at least two in my opinion, may have a negative or even a regressive impact on the level of integration of the European Union, if they are tackled in the wrong way.
So let us not be afraid to tackle these four issues and let us not tackle just these four issues.
On these four issues, then, which are simplification of the Treaties, the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the debate on powers and the place of national parliaments in the European architecture, let us be careful not to undermine the Community acquis or weaken the Community method by tackling them in an inappropriate manner.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to successfully turn this public debate into discussions which are necessarily more technical and precise at the next IGC would be a measure of our success in achieving a more ambitious reform than that obtained in Nice.
It would also be an effective remedy to counteract the fears and all the prejudices which these fears underline or support and which some people bandy about to slow down the progress of European integration.
For these two reasons at least, which may be crucially important in the runup to the enlargement of the Union, the European Commission, its President and all the members of the College of Commissioners will leave no stone unturned to breathe life into this major debate which was promised in Nice by the Heads of State and Government.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to welcome this debate which is finally taking place in the European Parliament, and the presence of Minister Anna Lindh. It is she who can interpret for us the statement in Annex IV, which has become statement 23, which we do not believe was simply the result of fatigue and frustration during the early hours of Monday, but which is a modification, a development, and not merely repentance, but a political change towards greater democracy.
The President-in-Office has said that the debate began on 7 March.
I have taken good note of what she said and furthermore I would like to thank her publicly - because I raised the question at the previous plenary session - for the fact that Parliament has finally been incorporated into the statement of 7 March, something which did not happen initially, and that you have amended the letter that you sent us which had rather too much of a tone of the secretariat of the Council, including annexes.
You have produced a shorter letter so that we can understand one other better.
You have launched a website.
If I may be so bold, my Group had already raised the issue on 1 March.
Then you began the debate in the European School and I must point out that you were really playing on home ground, because the children are sons and daughters of European officials and they are well-versed.
The night before you put very pertinent questions to the parents.
I think that it would be worth going to Kiruna or the Canary Islands to speak to the ordinary folk.
In this instance, I think you were playing with an advantage.
To turn to the heart of the matter, I must say that my Group, as we stated in plenary, agrees with President Prodi' s proposal for a structured debate in three phases, because this is neither an academic debate, a chat over a cup of coffee, nor a talk show.
This debate must yield results.
The important issue for my Group is to know how you see the organisation of the debate, because since I agree with and respect Sweden' s essential role and tradition of openness and transparency, you will agree with me, Madam President, that the shock may be even greater if, after holding a very broad debate, open to civil society, we then take decisions behind closed doors.
What is unacceptable today will be even more so in the future.
It is very important, therefore, to know how you view the structuring by phases, especially because we are in representative democratic systems, and how you view the second phase, in which the various representatives of civil society, which are basically the European Parliament, the Parliaments of the Member States, the Council, the governments and the Commission, can truly make our contribution.
The NGOs, various forums, colleges and universities must also participate.
This is an absolutely decisive question.
We propose an open and transparent method which involves all the participants.
That is what gave us a successful convention and we believe that it is absolutely essential that the Swedish Presidency, without waiting for Laeken, makes some proposals on method, because in Laeken content will be discussed and you have an historic opportunity to lay a first stone, to launch this debate, giving it order and structure.
To this end, you can count on our support.
And although, in the end, we have corrected the statement of 7 March, I must say that it did not have the most auspicious start.
We hope that the Swedish Presidency, with the greatest respect for its democratic and open tradition, is capable of understanding the message, which I believe Parliament and the Commission agree on, and that this process may begin, in order to ensure that a debate is held and that decisions are taken on the future of Europe.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, on behalf of my group I welcome the tone of the Council's contribution and the content of the Commission's contribution.
It is early days yet for us to have a definitive idea of how this process will develop, but I do believe that you, Madam President, have been excessively cautious and I would like to raise one or two questions with you and invite you to respond to them at the end of the debate.
You have said that you look forward to seeing the European Parliament contribution and, of course, the resolution in May.
I join you in that.
You have said that you can see advantages and disadvantages in the convention method and I am aware that many in the Council would share that view.
Could you please expand on that and not leave it in suspended animation?
Part of the purpose of this dialogue is for us to seek rational solutions if people perceive disadvantages in what we propose.
So please could you let us have your assessment of the pros and cons to which you have referred.
You have referred to the four dimensions in the Nice annex, the debate on competencies, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of national parliaments.
You also, if I understood the translation correctly, believe that the Treaty should be simplified but without changing its content.
Is it possible to look at competencies, the role of national parliaments and the role of the charter and not change the content of the Treaty?
That seems to me to be a contradiction in terms.
Like the other institutions, the European Parliament is currently considering how things might be presented for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
I and my group strongly believe that the convention method could be adopted.
This Parliament has a democratic legitimacy.
It is rooted and founded in the European treaties.
We are not a mendicant seeking alms at the European door.
We have a right - in fact a duty - of participation.
I believe the convention method open to the Member States, national parliaments, the Commission and perhaps ideally also to candidate states can provide a very good framework - not necessarily a single-choice menu, but a framework of rational and consistent choices - and an Intergovernmental Conference can then be invited to proceed.
Finally, without anticipating the future too much, my own group feels sufficiently strongly about this participation that if Parliament was inappropriately excluded or diminished in its institutional role we would consider recommending that it should not give any opinion on an Intergovernmental Conference.
That would be a difficult decision and I hope it will not be necessary but it is a constitutional requirement under Article 48 that this House should give an opinion before an IGC even though, regrettably, we have no right of assent after an IGC.
That is something we should note at this stage because full democratic participation is vital.
Madam President, 2001 is the year of public debate.
I am truly amazed that the presidency has not announced an initiative at European level involving civil society.
The Internet is not enough, Madam President.
There was talk of the possibility of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission organising a great initiative, geared to mobilising civil society to study and write about Europe' s aims and its future.
It seems that that initiative has encountered some strange and inexplicable resistance, even within this House from a large group on your left, Madam President.
It really is a sin, especially as the utter dearth of ideas the President of the Council has presented to us in - if I may say so - a rather bureaucratic and vague speech, demonstrates how much our governments are in need of some fresh inspiration.
Why is Sweden abandoning an initiative which could give its presidency a positive image and also allow it to fulfil the mandate it received at Nice?
The dialogue with civil society is a great deal more than a rhetorical flourish or a few e-mails.
I agree that we need to have national debates, but there is now such a thing as European public opinion and, at this stage, it needs to mature. This will also facilitate the preparations for the Laeken Council which should be preceded by a great conference of European national parliaments, the natural follow-up to the public debate supposed to have taken place this year.
That is the only way to make the debate on the future of Europe public and exciting, and that is the only way Parliament and the Commission will be able to find the allies they so badly need to break the purely intergovernmental logic of the forthcoming reform, give words like 'convention' and 'Community method' a revolutionary and constitutional meaning and make the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference more than a mere formality.
Madam President, please tell us whether or not there is room in your programme for a European initiative like that, and if not, why not?
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, as you know, many of my fellow Members are critical of the Nice Treaty.
My group - and I personally - are also deeply concerned about the future of the Union, because numerous issues which determine the daily concerns and needs of the people are still unresolved or have only been tackled half-heartedly.
More importantly, we are still a long way from a social Europe.
Nice - I am convinced and many of my fellow Members obviously share this view - has weakened the Community.
In the final analysis, the governments simply fought to maintain their national right of veto.
More democracy, greater transparency, a greater ability to act and take decisions - all were left out of the Treaty, which is why the follow-up to Nice must tackle a programme of ambitious and truly far-reaching reform with a twofold purpose.
First, it must not reverse the progress already made towards integration. I specifically share the concern expressed by Commissioner Barnier in this regard.
Secondly, we need reforms which make the Union truly viable for the future.
In my view, this means introducing a quasi-constitutional process, as a result of which a unified Europe is established by the will of its people.
It means holding a broad, public, open debate.
But it also means, in my view, that the Intergovernmental Conference is no longer the right method for taking Europe forward.
We need a different method.
As a member of the convention working on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, having experienced its success first hand, I expressly recommend the convention method as the right way for us to work together and take Europe forward.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which we currently find ourselves is rather strange: Nice has not yet been ratified, much less come into force and yet we are already debating the 'follow-up to Nice' .
We know what has led us to this point but, politically speaking, it is not a good idea to adopt a Treaty with the next Treaty already in mind; this should never be done and can only be a sign of a series of mistakes, a succession of slip-ups, not to say a whole forest of barely disguised lies.
Now that we have reached this point, however, and that the debate has already begun, we must draw the lessons from the failures in Nice and we in the European Parliament must learn how to do things differently in future, for 2004. Otherwise, we will be in danger of repeating the same mistakes, the same frustrations and the same failures.
I wish to say two things that I think are crucial: firstly, we must listen more and talk less.
As Members of this Parliament, our duty is not just to speak.
Often, however, on these fundamental issues, it is our duty to know how to listen, to listen and to act on the genuine feelings of our citizens and not only on the corporate desires of our institutions.
Secondly, we must allow debates to take place at national level and not be afraid of them.
The issues that ran aground in Nice are the same issues that had previously floundered in Amsterdam, and many of them have been on hold since Maastricht.
These issues concern our citizens and the future of the Nation-States very closely, and I would therefore say that what we need most of all at the moment is not so much a European debate but 15 in-depth national debates.
Alternatively, thinking in terms of enlargement, we need 27 genuine in-depth national debates held by the Portuguese with the Portuguese people, by the British with the British people, by the Germans with the German people, by the Czechs with the Czech people, by the Poles with the Polish people etc. on what they want the European Union' s future to be.
Only in this way will we be able to achieve, by 2004, a decision-making body that is properly equipped to take the decisions of the future. Otherwise, we will run aground on the same mistakes and embarrassing failures that we saw in Nice.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, a fundamental point seems to have been recognised at last by Parliament.
There were very good reasons to look ahead to the next conference.
I am very pleased to see that this Parliament has remembered that there will in fact be elections in 2004, that it was not elected in perpetuity, and that there was a certain amount of interference between Parliament and the appointments that had been proposed to us.
Basically, we can only say that there is still not much meat in the pot, as the Italians say, and that we are talking about the gender of angels, that is, the role and the links between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. This is a subject which, like the Loch Ness monster, keeps rearing its head in our debates but has never got us very far.
The people of Europe are not very interested in this kind of debate.
They would rather know who does what at European and at national level. They would like a bit less Baroque construction and a bit more clarity.
They would like the European Parliament to have a bit more influence over matters which concern them rather than over matters which do not concern them. They would like national parliaments to have a bit more visibility and a bit more influence over issues which should clearly be left to national parliaments.
The people of Europe would also perhaps like to be able to elect the President of the Commission, for example, so that they know who is responsible for making the major choices, and for the major issues which must be decided at European level.
My view is that we must not think civil society is always lagging behind in the debates we are able to have here within the European Parliament.
Unfortunately, the contrary is often the case and our Parliament should perhaps travel somewhat more amongst the people of Europe to equip itself with new ideas.
I would finally like to address a question to the President-in-Office, to the President of the Commission and, above all, to the Chairman of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, my friend, Mr Poettering.
I hear that the Belgian Minister, Mr Renders, a Liberal, is proposing to create a new Baroque figure, a 'Mr Euro' on the model of Mr CFSP, which was disputed not only by us but also, I believe, very forcefully by Mr Poettering and by the Group of the European People' s Party.
Is Mr Poettering in favour of the creation of this slightly Baroque figure of a 'Mr Euro' on the model of Mr CFSP, as I believe I heard him say in his conclusion of the European People' s Party Congress in Berlin?
I would be very grateful for an answer to this question.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on a good home page.
It is splendid to be able to see agendas for meetings in the various working parties.
May we also be given the names of the participants and access to the documents and minutes from the meetings?
I would also congratulate the presidency on the Futurum home page initiative.
Why, however, must it start with interventions from the top, from Mr Persson, Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Prodi and Mr Barnier?
Why are there not also interventions from people who are opposed to the Treaty of Nice and the centralisation of more administrative power in Brussels?
How can a Swedish President-in-Office issue invitations to a debate at the European School in Brussels without having a single critical voice on the panel?
According to Eurobarometer, only 18% of EU citizens prefer decisions to be made in Brussels. 63% prefer them to be made at local, regional or national levels.
Why do the 18% all have places on the panel in the first debate about our future, while the 63% are not represented at all?
The critics of the EU in my group and in the intergroup, SOS Democracy, are prepared to engage in debate both at the European School and in community centres.
We should like to explain why we wish to see an open, democratic and slimmed-down EU in which decisions are taken close to the people they affect, an EU which addresses far fewer cross-border issues, but then whose work is free from bureaucracy, waste and fraud.
In future, initiatives for devising common rules should be taken by the national parliaments and not by the Commission or Parliament.
Why not create a sort of council of the parliaments that could meet a couple of times a year and agree upon the work programme and the legal basis for projected bills?
It is the legal basis which, of course, decides whether it is to be a case of voluntary coordination or binding rules.
In that way, it will be elected representatives from the Member States who decide in each case whether decision making is to be transferred to the EU from the electorate and elected representatives in the Member States.
In that way, democracy will at least have a chance in relation to the present system of legislation by officials to which we have become accustomed, even if all fifteen Member States profess to be democracies.
We are, of course, in the absurd situation in which, if it were one of the candidate countries which adopted laws in the same way as we do, we should have to turn down the country concerned for not being democratic.
Madam President, may I begin by welcoming the highly ambitious programme of the Swedish Presidency.
A great deal has already been said and written about the follow-up to Nice.
I was delighted just now to hear many of my own thoughts voiced here today.
But there is another aspect of all this which I should like to highlight today.
During the course of the first debate on the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro working paper in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, one of the requests made was for the historical introduction in the first part of the report to be angled not from the point of view of the Council' s victories or the Commission' s victories, but from the point of view of Parliament' s defeats.
I can understand, with the impression made by Nice and the power games played out there, why one side or the other is tempted to resort to aggressive or belligerent words.
Surely there can be no victory or defeat for one institution over another; surely there can only be progress or retrogression with regard to the overall concept, i.e. the concept of Europe, and we should not lose sight of that.
I therefore feel that, as parliamentarians, we should stop using this sort of vocabulary; avoiding it will send out a message of cooperation between the institutions.
Madam President, I would firstly like to welcome Mrs Lindh.
We work very well with the Secretary of State, Mr Danielsson, and it is therefore a pleasure to have you here today.
Mrs Lindh, I believe that I do not need to speak at length, since the President of our Group, Mr Poettering, has made a clear, apposite and brilliant speech in which he has spoken loud and clear.
Therefore, allow me simply to point out certain issues on what we expect from the Swedish Presidency and from this European Council in Gothenburg.
You have said that we have to organise the debate.
Of course we do.
I agree with the words of the Socialist spokesman: the 7th was a good start, but we have to do more.
Therefore, what we want is for you to structure the debate, to make proposals to structure the debate.
How must this be done?
This Parliament has certain ideas and we are very happy to give them to you.
However, as a starter, I will say that it has to take place on a national level, in democracy that is close to the people, and on a European level.
This debate is very important and cannot be closed. It cannot be simply delivered on a plate, ready-made.
This debate must have conclusions, which will make up the second phase.
This debate would be frustrating for the participants if it did not include room for drawing up and proposing ideas.
That is what we call the convention method.
The convention which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights was a success, because it brought together national and European legitimacy and it included transparency, publicity and participation by the people.
Furthermore, all of this led to a document which you yourselves, at the European Council in Biarritz, recognised as being positive.
Therefore, things may be amended, others may be joined together, but it provides us with a model which may be of use.
I think that it will be very useful to work together on this model.
Finally, with regard to the timetable, it seems to me that if we do all of this, the IGC 2004 will have to be very brief, since the work will already be largely completed.
I believe it is also very important that this model allows for the participation of the candidate countries.
Europe is not only being built by those of us already in the Union, but also by those who are waiting to join it.
Madam President-in-Office, I believe that you are going to take away a very favourable impression of this debate today, since all the participating spokespeople from the extraordinarily varied Groups have said more or less the same thing. The parliamentary groups are whistling the same tune.
I believe that if we work with you and, of course, with the Commission - and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his marvellous speech - from this one common tune, together we will be able to compose a fine European symphony.
Madam President, Commissioner Barnier' s speech has confirmed how close the positions of the Commission and Parliament are.
I listened carefully to the speech made by the representative of the Council, and it is to her that I would like to address a few brief comments.
Mrs Lindh, the new IGC is the last thing to be talking about.
The important issue is how to get there.
You have called for maximum transparency in the debate now beginning and in the whole process described in the Nice Declaration, with a debate as close as possible to the citizens.
Well, the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference before the Nice Summit demonstrated minimum transparency and maximum distance from the citizens.
A new method is vital.
There is a precedent, which is the Convention for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That idea came from the Heads of State or Government, felicitously invented by them in Helsinki, so it is hard to understand why those same Heads of State or Government should now mistrust that method.
It is not a problem of the name; it is a problem of substance. As well as the Commission, the European Parliament and the national parliaments should be involved not just in the debate but in drafting and drawing up the proposals as well.
We should be writing the answers to the great questions on the future of the Union together.
Mrs Lindh, we feel sure the Swedish Presidency will want to commit itself to dispelling the extraordinary suspicion meeting every proposal made by any of the groups in the European Parliament.
We hope the resolution from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and hence from Parliament as a whole, will also help to make you more convinced than you are this morning and, in the meantime, we look forward to our meeting of 20 March with the representatives of the national parliaments of both Member States and candidate countries.
Madam President, I have looked at Futurum, a website for debate and dialogue which has recently opened, and it is good.
This morning, 76 citizens from different countries had chosen to take part in the debate.
Of course, this figure could have been considerably higher, but this is a good start.
The question is naturally what will happen to this input to the debate.
Will these opinions lead their own lives until 2004 when the Council will once more shut itself away behind closed doors in marathon negotiations on a new treaty?
The speech of the foreign minister indicated that this would not be the case.
However, it is important that we tell people today how these points of view will be used and channelled so that we really do achieve a broad debate rather than just empty words.
I am sorry if we here in Parliament sound like we are nagging, but this is really important for us across group borders.
Just like us, citizens need to know how these points of view will be channelled.
Will it be some kind of convention where those of us who are elected representatives at various levels will really be able to use them to contribute to the design of the new treaty?
Mr President, I shall speak with a voice that has not been much heard in this debate so far, despite the two words in Mr Barnier's speech about regional parliaments.
It must be remembered that Europe is not just a Europe of central institutions and Member States.
Within the Member States there are self-governing countries - called, in the parlance of this House, "regions".
Many of their citizens regard themselves as citizens of ancient European nations deserving as much recognition in this Union as others.
Mr Poettering rightly said that the Community method is a good one from the point of view of small states.
Let it also be a good method for small countries that are not, or not yet, Member States of this Union in their own right.
If, in the debate over the next three years, the voices of the democratically-elected parliaments of the countries and regions of Europe within the Member States are not heard properly and taken as fully into account as the voices of the Member States themselves, the "national" parliaments and - as Mrs Frassoni rightly said - the NGOs, then the debate will have been a failure.
Subsidiarity is a two-ended concept.
At one end it requires that decisions be taken as close to the people affected as is consistent with efficiency and equity.
But that implies that many decisions can only be taken at the other end, at the higher level, when, for the sake of equity and efficiency, the whole of a great polity must be included.
That great polity will not do well, however, unless it avoids taking power from the little people, the more local levels of government.
The "regions" of Europe must be properly represented in this discussion and proper attention must be paid to subsidiarity.
Mr President, I have two things to say.
The first concerns the method: I consider it of vital importance that power over the treaties lies with the national parliaments.
If power is passed to the European Parliament, a vital step will be taken towards converting the EU to a state, which I oppose.
I am therefore also sceptical regarding the convention method.
If such a method is to be applied, it must be a convention for the national parliaments who are to discuss the treaty.
My second point concerns content.
In my opinion it is not sufficient to discuss the points stated in Nice.
Instead, discussion should centre upon democratic reform of the European Union, providing full insight into the legislative work and reducing the power of civil servants, especially within the Commission.
A unique situation currently prevails where civil servants have the deciding influence over the content of legislation, which is a problem in terms of democracy.
Mr President, the European Union has a problem in that, despite the systems it has established and the extensive jargon and impressive rhetoric it makes use of, its people are either indifferent to, or directly opposed to, the integration process that has been on the agenda in recent years.
This is referred to by the polite euphemism of a 'democratic deficit' .
The reason why it is a euphemism or understatement is that the institutions operate in practice in a way that actively contributes to eliminating participation by the people.
It is actively anti-democratic.
Against that background, it is, if anything, absurd to attend today' s debate.
The idea is to establish a democratic dialogue.
It sounds so appealing, of course, but this very project reflects a total misunderstanding of the nature of democracy.
Democracy is literally government by the people, which means that the people' s wishes, demands and political views prevail, without direction from above.
What is now on the agenda is very reminiscent of another union which collapsed a few years ago.
It is the same trend and the same mechanism for development whereby living democracy is dismantled piece by piece in favour of government by an Ã©lite.
That must be humiliating for the Swedish Presidency in particular. What is happening is in direct conflict with the best grassroots traditions in Scandinavia.
Sweden has an unusually pronounced and progressive tradition of transparency and the rule of law, and the Swedes are the people in the European Union who most actively oppose the integration process.
It is a most regrettable situation and a political identity crisis for our Swedish friends.
Mr President, the debate on the future of the European Union, which was decided at the Nice European Council, will have to avoid one major pitfall: limiting itself to the circle of specialists in European matters, including the members of the institutions of the European Union. That would once again run the risk of couching the issues in a language and code only accessible to the initiated and of finally widening the gap which separates Europe from its people.
To bring this closed circuit a bit more up to date, certain federalists are proposing a solution which is a mere faÃ§ade: a convention inspired by the one which has already prepared the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This convention is composed, for the most part, of docile creatures and headed, for more security, by a steering group or a drafting group to lead the debate in the direction the institutions want it to take: towards more federalism.
This method would be very dangerous.
We should not forget that the previous convention produced the text of a Charter which was unacceptable to all Member States and that it was necessary to mask the differences by proclaiming it a non-compulsory text.
If a future convention worked with the same methods in a rarefied atmosphere, it would produce, in 2004, an ultra-federalist text which would be unacceptable to all or some of the Member States.
This would spell disaster for Europe.
However, neither should we have a debate dominated by confusion and disorder.
We must stay close to the people, move at their speed and stay orderly to stay productive.
That is why, Mr President, we think there is only one viable solution: to organise the debate around national parliaments and under their responsibility.
Mr President, I particularly welcome the efforts of the Commission President, Romano Prodi, to set the contours of this debate, which follows on from our debates in January and February in this House.
Now, it is not the post-Nice debate but the debate on Europe's future.
It is vital that European institutions get this opportunity right.
It is a rare occasion in history where peoples of Europe can potentially have their own say on what a so-called constitutional framework would look like post-2004.
It is now up to Europe's political leadership to set the terms and determine the nature, breadth, substance and intensity of this debate.
At present there is some imagination but little action, given the extensive nature of Annex IV of the Treaty.
This morning I looked at the website that the President of the Council mentioned.
There is no mention of Parliament participating in the debates on 7 March.
It is simply a web page with no facility for citizens to communicate their own views by e-mail.
There is only a skeleton programme which is put on this web page under the Belgian Presidency, who will have a business forum.
It is deeply unimpressive and needs to be looked at immediately.
So let us look at the future debate.
First, its nature.
It needs to be politically led rather than bureaucracies being left to run expensive programmes which will look like propaganda in the view of our citizens.
Perhaps this would be a subject for Stockholm: stimulating heads of state to start debates.
Madam President-in-Office, you have said that this should be something which should be done but in my own country our Prime Minister, Mr Blair, has been curiously silent on this subject.
Secondly, the breadth.
This needs to be something which will involve all parts of society, as Mr Bonde has said.
You cannot simply preach to the converted as you did in the European School a few days ago.
Thirdly, the substance of the debate: that needs to be considered in terms of papers, broad dialogues and other ideas of this kind.
Lastly there is the intensity of the debate, which needs to be developed with the best technological means available.
I conclude by saying that in our Parliament we need to network with the national parliaments, the Council needs to give us the lead through the heads of state in each of the Member States and last, the Commission can produce guidelines so that we know what course this debate will follow.
We can then discuss this when we come to ratify the Nice Treaty a little later this year.
Mr President, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the Commission on the content of the position that it has adopted here, but I should like to ask Commissioner Barnier a specific question: is the Commission going to content itself with this statement or do you, Mr Barnier, and Mr Prodi intend immediately to visit the governments in order to persuade them to accept your positions?
This is what differentiates a centre for discussion from an institution which is able to implement and make policy.
I would like you to give me a specific answer to this question because, at the time of the Treaty of Nice, the Commission put forward good proposals and good positions, which were then ignored by the Council.
With regard to the issue that has been raised here of the 'follow-up to Nice' , I wish to express my satisfaction at the agreement that has been reached in terms of the items on the agenda.
The Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have agreed that the four items are inadequate.
As a matter of fact, this is inevitable, because we cannot stimulate a European debate and then restrict the intellectual exercise of extending it to other issues, as the President pointed out.
Nevertheless, I should like to ask the Swedish Presidency two questions.
Firstly, is it prepared to review the date for drafting this Treaty? I think that 2004 would be the worst year to undertake this exercise, not only for the reasons that Mr Dupuis has just given, but because, instead of uniting the parties in each Member State that is in favour of the European project, the election campaign often divides them.
Therefore, I should like to know if the presidency and the Council are considering this issue of the date.
Lastly, Madam President, neither the Council nor the presidency itself must use the debate as an excuse to do nothing.
It must be an event that leads to some form of action.
My specific question is this: why is the presidency afraid of there being a forum or convention that can make proposals?
We do not want to replace national governments and we do not wish to take decisions - you are the decision makers - but I should like to ask, why are you afraid of our ideas, our proposals and our contribution?
Mr President, why is it that we insist that the specific legitimacy of the European Parliament is recognised in the preparation of the IGC?
This is not simply because of our wounded self-esteem, but because the Member States left to themselves will quickly become obsessed with their own national power relationships.
The common European interest will only be fostered if all those who share executive power - the European Council and also the Commission - collaborate with all those that share legislative power - the European and national parliaments.
A true constitutional step forward will be achieved only if such a pluralistic formula is agreed.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, solving the historic task of the Union will be no easy matter; describing it is a piece of cake.
Our most pressing task is to found a European democracy.
That is the nub of the discussion and the conflict between us.
The biggest obstacle now on the path towards a European democracy - and it needs to be said - is the Council' s claim to power, the claim to power of the national governments, which are not content merely with governing and legislating for Europe, they also want to write its constitution.
The Council failed in Nice in its bid to become Europe' s constitution-writer.
It was the arrogance of power which gambled with the acceptance of European unification by our citizens.
The most important unanswered question in this discussion about European democracy is the position of the Commission.
Madam President-in-Office, you spoke about transparency, about being close to the citizens, about dialogue, the spearheading role of parliaments and broad public debate and you meant, you believed, that you were talking about democracy.
You were not talking about democracy.
Democracy in Europe demands that we talk about the fundamental principles and elements of democracy, about the separation of powers, about the fact that it is unacceptable for national administrations to legislate. Democracy demands that we talk about the principle of legislating in public, about the fact that it is unacceptable for the Council to pass laws behind closed doors and for citizens to be stripped of their right to know who decided what and why and of their right to hold the decision makers to account.
Democracy demands that we talk about a catalogue of human rights, about legal validity and about citizens' access to the Court of Justice, that we talk about a system of checks and balances and about the fact that writing a constitution never has been and never will be the prerogative of governments; it is the original, inalienable prerogative of parliaments.
Unless the Council renounces its claim to power and puts these elements of democracy at the top of the agenda, we never shall solve this major historic task.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, first let me thank you for the optimism which you expressed in your speech - it makes a welcome change from the last presidency.
That aside, I should like to use my brief speaking time to make a proposal.
The proposal discussed by various political groups to set up a second chamber of the European Parliament to represent the national parliaments could be dispensed with if we followed the Austrian example here.
Under our federal constitution, the Austrian representative to the Council is directly responsible to the national parliament and the main committee of the Austrian National Council can influence the position taken by the Council representative.
This ensures that the representatives of the Austrian people control and help shape political negotiation in the Council, without the need for a second chamber.
Involving national parliaments at the very earliest stage makes a second parliamentary level unnecessary and would be a simpler and perhaps cheaper and less bureaucratic solution.
Mr Brok, you now have the floor for two-and-a-half minutes.
You thought it would be three, but if I give you two-and-a-half, it will be at least three anyway.
Brok (PPE-DE).
(DE) Mr President, thank you for the warning.
We must, I think, acknowledge that we have a broadly-structured discussion process before us, during which it will become apparent that the intergovernmental approach under the leadership of the Council will be unworkable with 27 Member States and that the executive leadership of the Commission, with Parliament as equal co-legislator, i.e. the classic Monnet approach, will therefore be the only way of ensuring that we are able to act within the European Union.
However, Madam President-in-Office, your comment that you were looking forward to the contribution of the European Parliament has already aroused my suspicions, because the European Parliament has no contribution to make here; according to my reading of the Nice paper, the Council, Parliament and Commission are supposed to shape the overall debate together.
In other words, we are not your sub-contractors, we are joint project managers of this broad, European dialogue.
As far as I can see, there is as yet no guarantee of this whatsoever in the preparations, which I find somewhat telling.
In my opinion, there are three stages: the broad, public debate led - and I mean led jointly - by the three institutions, which must be held over the course of this and next year, but which must also accompany the overall process through to the end.
Then comes the preparation of the subject matter which, in my view, should follow on logically within the framework of a convention or whatever else you want to call it, whereby it is important for Laeken and for us, Madam President-in-Office, not only for the convention to be set up but for there to be no doubt as to the status of its outcome, by which I mean that it will not produce one of many papers but the paper which will be the basis for negotiation for the decisive round of Heads of Government.
I should like to point out that, as Hungary and the Czech Republic will be using the enlargement agreements to deal with institutional matters, precisely because they have no voice in the European Parliament, the question of improved decision-making procedures in the Council should be taken into consideration during enlargement negotiations, meaning that enlargement negotiations also form part of the post-Nice process.
At the same time, I should like to pick up on the question of the timetable.
I, like many of my fellow members, are worried about wrapping this up in 2004 in the middle of the European election campaign.
I think it would therefore be a good idea if we used this year and next year for the broad public process and started on the convention in the second half of next year, so that we have the whole of 2003 for negotiations and can wrap things up at the end of 2003 or by the beginning of 2004 at the latest so that the outcome can be discussed during the European election campaign.
This would allow us to initiate a public plebiscite on the outcome and to seal the dialogue, as it were, with the expression of the will of the people of this European Union.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, taking the floor for the last time before this House, which I will be leaving in a few weeks' time, I would like to address a few words to my fellow Members.
Of course the problems of the method adopted in the follow-up to Nice are important: the Community method, the Convention method, and so on. What is even more important, however, is that there is a plan and a driving force to push it forward.
Each time the European Union - and the Economic Community before it - made progress, there was this plan and this driving force: the Spaak committees before the Treaty of Rome, the White Paper produced by Lord Cockfield before the Luxembourg Treaty, the strong proposals made by the Commission and the strength of the France-Germany axis with the Treaty of Maastricht.
We know that, in the chancelleries, there is no plan and even less political will to move forward.
We also know that, despite the very interesting proposals made by Commissioner Barnier, the Commission has neither the strength nor the authority it had ten years ago.
So there remains the European Parliament. Over the years it has proved itself to be the strongest link in the institutional tripod.
I would like to turn to my fellow Members and say that the European Parliament has a majority which transcends political and national divisions. This majority is in favour of a plan for a new European federalism.
We need a federation of projects and a catalysis of energies to take this step forward as is expected of us and which the citizens of Europe expect from you.
So, comrades, friends, fellow Members, I would like to take my leave of you by saying that I truly expect you to be ambitious and audacious.
That is what the citizens expect from you.
Thank you.
Mr President, the word 'federalism' risks staying devoid of meaning if we do not make a basic choice.
Yes, we do have to draft a European constitution to avoid ending up with a simple free exchange area after enlargement.
To do that, however, we really must understand subsidiarity, which remains the most important principle of federalism.
I will give an example.
Under the Italian constitution we have a special regime of autonomy.
On the way towards a necessary European constitution is it not important to involve the regional political level in some way, especially when it represents a linguistic minority?
I ask this question knowing full well that the answer is not easy, but it is nevertheless vital for the democratic future of Europe.
Mr President, the representative of Parliament in Nice summed up the result as a catastrophe.
It is impossible to understand how one can cold-bloodedly build a future conflict between large and small countries into the treaty.
It is even more difficult to understand how the Council can refuse to introduce a reference to the rights which all Member States have previously signed up to.
How are citizens to understand that their elected representatives do not wish to confirm the rights which they politically pretend to support?
A weak treaty may pose a risk to an expanded EU, which has to combine many different legal traditions.
We want to see higher ambitions when it comes to reaching decisions on who is to do what, who is to decide what and how, and on rights and democracy.
The debate with the citizens must focus on the central issues of the future in a more flexible Europe.
A democratic convention is required, not merely a website, to create open debate and open decisions.
The presidency gives the impression of seeking to avoid the key issues of the debate on Europe.
This is tantamount to shirking its responsibility to lead Europe.
Seize the opportunity to contribute to a democratic EU with a democratic European Parliament - which I also hope the presidency will show respect for.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you used the word strong three times in your speech.
The EU must be a strong force, the Community method must contain strong positions and we need strong institutions.
I agree with you wholeheartedly there.
But actions speak louder than words.
As far as the post-Nice agenda is concerned, what you said means more Europe, not less Europe.
It means more integration, not less integration.
In other words, the proposals which you make will need to be specified and some will need to be reworded.
One often has the impression, when it comes to the separation of powers, that forces are at work which seek to weaken Europe.
It is up to you, I think, to say what we want to do together, what we must do together in the 21st century in order to make Europe strong.
Then the debate on the separation of powers will be a completely different debate from what we sometimes hear now.
Strong Community institutions: this issue also needs to be specified.
The issue here, as far as I am concerned, is the application of parliamentary democracy to policy on Europe.
This does not just mean discussing the role and function of the national parliaments, it also means making the European Parliament even stronger.
We have still not been granted a number of rights which we need when it comes to legislating, setting the budget and controlling the Commission.
If we want strong Community institutions, we need to re-examine the Council and the Commission. The Commission should be a sort of government, not just the Council' s secretariat, and the Council should then be seen as a committee with the ability to take decisions.
As far as the method is concerned, you said rather cryptically that the convention has advantages and disadvantages.
I should like to know what the disadvantages are and for whom.
I was a member of the Charter convention.
I saw no disadvantages.
I saw only advantages.
I therefore call on you to state in your Gothenburg report that the new method will be a new convention to prepare the Intergovernmental Conference.
One last word on the timetable.
I too think that 2004 is wholly inappropriate.
We can wrap this up by the end of 2003.
A new Treaty of Rome would then perhaps be the right basis for European elections in 2004 and a good basis for completing enlargement.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, never in my career as an MEP, and I have been a Member since 1979, has there been a treaty which leaves one with such a bitter taste as this one.
That is hardly surprising, for whoever takes stock of the chaos which the government leaders created in Nice, is not amazed that all eyes are now fixed on post-Nice. That is, after all, the quickest way to make people forget Nice.
One of the problems is that it has now become impossible to explain to any citizen how vote weighting works, or what the outcome of the Commissioners' rota system is.
Neither is it clear how many MEPs there will be between 2004 and 2009.
Post-Nice is thus not a normal follow-up of Nice, but a harsh necessity to rectify what has gone wrong as soon as possible.
What needs to be done?
The democratic hole which was left as a result of the fact that the European Parliament will not be receiving codecision power on all the topics which will soon be decided on by qualified majority, must be filled at the earliest opportunity.
In actual fact, we should already be reaching an interinstitutional agreement on this.
It is disgraceful that power has been removed from the national parliaments and has subsequently not been transferred to the European Parliament.
Secondly, there should be a fair distribution of national and European powers, which must be laid down in a European constitution. The latter should also include the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
I happen to share Mrs Lynne' s opinion that the document is sound.
Thirdly, the current IGC procedure must be replaced by an interinstitutional convention which is capable of preparing these actions.
The damage which Nice has done must be repaired before the next European elections, in other words by 2003, for we cannot afford to carry this burden into those elections in 2004.
Finally, Madam President, you mentioned citizens.
But do you realise that in the three-way discussion on this notorious regulation on access to documents, we constantly meet with a Council in full body armour, which does not give an inch and which is causing us the greatest of difficulty?
Madam President, Mrs Lynne mentioned the word 'strong' .
There must have been eleven socialist governments in Nice.
Well, they were anything but strong on the day.
Let us not beat about the bush.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I entreat all of you: let us stop talking about the follow-up to Nice and talk instead about the future. Let us look towards the future.
I would also like to correct an oversight this morning.
Before we look to the future let us wind up the past. Let us invite the Member States to ratify Nice as soon as possible.
This is essential if we want to clear the air for the debate.
As I look towards the future I am convinced about one thing. The leap forward we are expecting will come from public opinion, from the debate, but first and foremost from young people.
It is to them that the Europe of the future belongs.
It is not enough, however, to say: the debate, the debate, the debate. You are right, Commissioner: we must organise it and structure it.
To guide this debate, I think that at some point we must ask ourselves about the usefulness of a questionnaire.
By the same token, we must use all the available forums for this debate, while being aware that none of them, be it national conferences, consultations with unions, forums of civil societies, will have the power to arrive at a conclusion.
For, pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty, the conclusion belongs to the Heads of State and Government.
Let us take note of this.
Between these two stages, though, what will revive hope within Europe is nevertheless the adventure of the convention, which is no longer that adventurous.
The experience of the Charter demonstrated this.
I believe it was Mr Poettering who asked a question about a parallel process between the public debate and the convention.
It seems to us that the correct formula is that of a broad, open debate, which will take place as soon as possible. When the convention starts its work, the debate will continue in parallel in order to draw the necessary lessons from the experience of the convention.
And then this Parliament will agree to consult all the wise men on earth and to participate in all the forums.
In the final analysis, however, it is the representatives of democracy who will have to participate in this convention.
One last word, Mr President.
The Council was courageous enough to invent the convention. We ask it to show the same courage and look to the future with confidence.
Our citizens expect this. Our fellow Member, Claude Desama, has invited us to take part in constructing a new federalism and we should accept this invitation.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have already been praised several times during the course of this debate, and rightly so, for your understanding and your sincere appeal for a proper new start in a common Europe.
"The future is at stake" is the way you put the objective of the work of the Swedish Presidency into perspective.
Unfortunately, you went no further than perspectives in your reference to the objectives of Annex 4 to Nice, in calling for us to be closer to our citizens and in your more than cryptic comment that you see both advantages and disadvantages in the convention method.
With all due respect, that does not amount to much. In fact it amounts to far too little if you consider that the Swedish Presidency is already approaching the half-way mark.
I would have welcomed at least a few specifics on the crucial core issues addressed by Michel Barnier.
Do we want a more or a less political Europe?
How exactly do we envisage fundamental reform of the institutions?
How should we be organising the process of writing a forward-looking European constitution?
I would have listened gladly to at least some sort of attempt to reply to one or other of these questions.
Perhaps you will yet do so in your closing address.
May I add another question to those already put to you by my fellow Members?
What does being closer to our citizens mean from an institutional point of view, i.e. once we get past websites and discussions at the European School?
Does it mean depriving the European Parliament of power by setting up a second chamber of national parliaments, over which the Council believes it can exert more influence than it can over the European Parliament?
Some answers please.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have a reputation, not without reason, for being extraordinarily skilful, and your presentation has confirmed this.
You have come here and flattered us, spoken of important contributions by the European Parliament in the past, found the relevant debates interesting and exciting and we thank you for your compliments.
But how do they fit in with the facts?
You were in Nice.
What does the real future look like on paper?
The loser at Nice was the European Parliament.
Instead of at least more transparency, we ended up with less democracy.
We now have a Europe which looks like the late Habsburg empire in the 19th century.
Then, the large landowners had all the votes, now it is the countries. And everything is obscure.
Now you talk of an open attitude to future procedures.
Since I started working here as an elected representative of the people and before that during my work as a journalist, I have always wondered exactly what the people in power are thinking when they talk like you do and when they act like you do in the Council.
What is it you really want?
What is it you stand for?
In school I was told that it was Parliament' s job to control and the government' s job to react.
Where exactly are you reacting?
We knew where we stood with Konrad Adenauer, with FranÃ§ois Mitterand and even with Helmut Kohl when it came to Europe.
Where do we stand with the Council?
Why do you not just say that, at the end of the day, you want a seriously democratic and transparent Europe, come what may?
Do you really find it so hard to shoulder responsibility in front of your voters?
What is wrong with Sweden?
We admire your country - I personally am a great fan of your political transparency, but I am fast losing heart when it comes to these crucial issues regarding the future.
If, rather than lead, you merely lead astray, and up the wrong garden path at that, i.e. up the national path which hankers after the past rather than down the glorious path which will take us forward, then you run the risk of going down in history as the gravedigger of Europe, because you could not and would not explain to your citizens that the European Union plays an indispensable role in the age of globalisation and that this European Union is therefore in dire need of radical democratisation and practical application of the principle of subsidiarity.
I trust that Sweden will yet dare to act.
Leave flattery and diplomatic skills behind you and profess your faith in the separation of powers and a European constitution.
I am relying on your ambition.
Mr President, I would like to begin by presenting my thanks for a good debate with many constructive contributions.
I seem to have noticed that Mr Poettering, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, Mr Cox and others who have taken part in the debate are still in favour of a broad political debate on issues of both content and form, and I think this is good.
I would like to comment on some of the contributions and begin with the first speaker, Mr Poettering.
I repeat: Openness and access are a key issue for the Swedish Presidency.
I know that Parliament and the Swedish Presidency have a great deal in common in this respect and I hope that we will be able to help each other to achieve as much openness and access as possible.
Naturally, we also need to carry the Member States with us and agree on this.
Then there is the major question of the next Intergovernmental Conference.
When it comes to the decision itself, according to the Treaty there is no method other than the Intergovernmental Conference.
It is important that we remember this, just as Mrs BerÃšs said just now.
I understand that Parliament is very interested, as I am, in the important discussion on how we will reach a decision - the debate we will have before the decision, how we will prepare for the debate, and the role which might be played by the convention method.
These issues were addressed by the initial speakers.
The discussion in Parliament shows that we must have a broad debate on these matters, but I think it is too early today to reach a definite position as there are both advantages and disadvantages.
The advantages are clear - an open debate and broad participation - but here too questions can be raised.
Who is to be involved - Member States, candidate countries and organisations, and if so, which?
We cannot reach a final position on this today.
Some have also put forward the disadvantages.
With very many participants, the process can become unwieldy.
Furthermore, the decision-making process itself can be unclear, as the convention submits proposals and the Intergovernmental Conference has to reach decisions.
Even if one advocates a convention, one must also discuss dealing with its disadvantages.
We should therefore discuss this properly and in detail.
The Council has not said yes but nor has the Council objected, and we have definitely not said that we are afraid of a convention.
We have said that we must now be able to discuss both the factual issues surrounding the future of Europe and the methods - including the question of a convention.
Just as Mr Brok and others said, the European Parliament is naturally involved in this entire debate.
You played a part in initiating the debate on the future.
You played a part in the launch and you are also among those participating in the website.
I do not know exactly where Mr Elles has been looking, but I can guarantee that Parliament is represented.
Furthermore, there are lots of contributions, so if Parliament was not represented there today, it can only be an oversight.
This debate is a further example of Parliament' s being involved, but we would also like to see the view of Parliament as a whole on the debate on the future, and we will get that in May.
Therefore, I think it is important that this also be included as part of the on-going discussion.
Let me now comment on some other issues.
Mr Cox wondered why I said that the Treaties should be simplified without changing the content.
I reply that I was quoting the Nice Decision.
To Mr BarÃ³n Crespo I would like to say that it is clear that we must go out into the real world.
I myself have taken the debate to many Swedish schools.
I presume that you others too have also visited schools.
I think it is important that, here too, Parliament is really involved in the debate on content.
What schoolchildren and the general public will ask us will naturally be questions which are very much wider in scope than those we have discussed here today.
I would also like to say to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo that of course Parliament was invited to take part in launching the future of Europe right from the start.
To Mrs Frassoni I would like to say that when it comes to the question on civil society, there must unfortunately have been some problem with the translation, for the Swedish Presidency has exhibited a very great interest in civil society.
In my introductory speech, I cited examples of major conferences we are organising in Sweden and in other countries.
Ahead of the summit in Gothenburg we are organising three broad forums arranged by civil society.
We are also working on town twinning to a great extent and are doing a great deal of work at many schools and universities.
I personally have several school classes as reference groups, which I can recommend, by the way.
Mr Bonde brought up the subject of the website and said that only Prime Minister Persson and other high-up figures are allowed to write on it.
I recommend that he go and look at it as there are already many contributions there.
Among other things in my introductory speech, I quoted contributions from Denmark and the UK - opinions of ordinary citizens in both countries.
This is naturally an important debate for the future.
I expect we will return to the discussion of the methods and the convention and how we can best broaden the debate.
But it is also important that we have a broad debate on the factual issues, i.e. on how Europe really will be able to address globalisation and on how Europe can become a strong force on employment, environmental issues and the matters we will be discussing later today.
So when it comes to the future of Europe, let us discuss both methods and substance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with thanks to each and every one of you, I would like at this stage to comment briefly on a few specific questions put by a number of you. As for the rest, I can only confirm on behalf of President Prodi, and on my own personal behalf, that the Commission will continue to work intelligently and in close cooperation with the European Parliament during this rather sensitive period of the debate on the future of Europe, as Mrs BerÃšs said.
And that is what counts.
Mrs Lindh has just said a few words about the website, which several of you have mentioned, most notably James Elles and Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m.
This site is going through a running-in phase so please show a little understanding.
It was opened barely a week ago.
I think all your comments will help us to turn it into a real website for the people.
Furthermore, our idea is to share the management of this site amongst several institutions, including the European Parliament, but I admit that we must push it forwards and perhaps also understand its role better, as it must be used as a platform for the national debates which will soon be organised in each Member State.
That is my first reply, but this site must be improved and the Commission will make a contribution to make this happen.
Mr Seguro asked a question of the President of the Commission and the Commissioner.
Yes, Mr Seguro, we are going to continue to meet with the governments in each of the capitals not only of the Member States but, as Mr Prodi has done, as each of us does, the capitals of the candidate countries too. This is the role of the President, which he carries out not only with regard to the debate on the future of Europe, but on many other subjects as well.
I would add that we will also continue to meet with national parliaments, which has not been normal practice for the Commission up till now.
In the context of the debates in the run-up to Nice, I personally was concerned to meet with national parliaments and, quite frankly, I do not regret it at all.
Mr Leinen mentioned, as did Mr Dupuis, the concern we expressed through our President that 2004 will be an extremely busy year. It is the year in which we will table the new post-Berlin agenda.
It is the year in which many accession negotiations will be concluded, if this has not already happened. It is the year of the renewal of the European Parliament and it is also the final year of this Commission.
So the sooner we can move, at the start of 2004 and perhaps, Mr Leinen, why not in Rome at the end of 2003, the better it will be for everybody, for us and for you, and so necessarily for the European debate itself.
The answer to that, however, is also in the hands of the Heads of State and Government.
I would like to thank each and every one of you, especially the group chairpersons who expressed their desires and their agreement with the ideas or the guidelines of the Commission.
We will continue to work together. Please allow me to say a final personal word of thanks to Mr Desama at this moving time when he is about to leave this House to take up more local responsibilities in Verviers.
I am sure he will not forget the profession of European faith he has carried out here when he assumes his role of Lord Mayor in the weeks to come.
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to put on record a matter I raised at the Conference of Presidents.
