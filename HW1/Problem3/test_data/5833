Amendment No 13, in its current specific form, would not be acceptable.
One point which you have raised is the reference to its exceptional assistance character.
Of course it is exceptional assistance.
Of course it is of a temporary nature.
And this is already reflected in the text.
Therefore, certain references do not seem necessary to us, such as its not exceeding 2003.
I do not know if it will be necessary for us to reconsider the issue in 2003, but to say now that in no event are we going to do anything in 2003 does not seem correct to us.
Neither does it seem necessary for Amendment No 7 to refer doubly to the concessional and temporary issue.
With regard to the obligatory consultations with, shall we say, bodies of a political nature, we believe that the political debate is taking place now and will take place in the Council.
But once the conditions have been basically defined, the Economic and Financial Committee must be the correct body to carry out the control of what in reality we are going to talk about, that is to say, the practical application of the proposals.
We therefore believe that other types of conditions are not reasonable, such as those established in Amendments Nos 12, 14 and the first part of Amendment No 16.
You request additional reports to Parliament.
We are thinking of the reports proposed in Amendments Nos 16, 18 and 19.
We can accept the one in Amendment No 19, if it refers to information on the previous year.
It is very difficult to give information on the same year unless it is excessively delayed information, but the production of additional general reports, as well as the one we present every year, on macro-financial assistance, we believe to be an unnecessary bureaucratic burden.
Nevertheless, we do understand that Parliament wishes to control and know what is happening with these issues.
We are therefore at your disposal to provide you with information on the implementation of this aid, whenever Parliament may ask for it.
But we believe that it is much better to react to specific proposals than to establish this type of formal obligation, which does not always have the necessary interest.
I would lastly like to comment on certain precise dates which are laid down in relation to the limits for the first and second payments.
You say that the first payment must be made before 31 December and the second before 30 June.
There are two problems.
One problem is bureaucratic, administrative: will we make it by 31 December?
This is not the real difficulty.
The real difficulty is that in the system of macro-financial assistance we are working with certain economic policy conditions and these payments can only be made in the event that these conditions are met.
Of course, our objective is the same as yours: to implement aid as soon as possible, to pay it as quickly as possible and in this respect we are going to continue working with Parliament in complete harmony.
Finally, and I will end here, I would like to thank Parliament for its support for the Commission proposal on the granting of macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
I hope that at the next Council we can adopt a response which will allow us to quickly confront, as Mr Brok said, this important challenge and be coherent with our own past positions.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
DSABs 3 and 4/2001 - EU own resources in 2001-2002 budget (conciliation procedure)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are holding the joint debate about the three reports produced. Looking around, we all know already what everyone is going to say, and we have said it all before.
Even the Commissioner has listened to us more than once, so let us just say it one more time for the record.
The Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget is a completely non-contentious issue in the Committee.
The most important points are, firstly, funding for 27 new posts for RTD projects; secondly, the OLAF establishment plan and the necessary funds in the budget line for the recruitment of new staff; and, thirdly, an increase in the Commission' s payment appropriations required for the EU assistance in the Balkans.
In other words, we want an additional 100 million plus.
This was all agreed unanimously in the Committee on Budgets with the support of all our colleagues.
At this point, I would like to thank Herbert BÃ¶sch very warmly once again for the solution to the OLAF issue.
He worked very hard to ensure that we reached this compromise.
The fact that the balance from the 2000 budget gives rise to a surplus of EUR 11.6 billion is one reason for this House to underline yet again that the budget management is very frugal, and for the Council it is a cause for rejoicing.
However, what is the report concerning the European Union' s own resources about, and why has it been drawn up?
We - Parliament - have taken the initiative and called on the Council to discuss with us, prior to every budget procedure and before the Commission produces its draft budget, the situation concerning the European Union' s own resources.
Please note that I said 'discuss' , not 'codecision' . We thought this was a very cheap option, but far from it, the Council is resisting, and that is what it is doing this evening too.
It is simply not listening!
It refuses even to discuss the European Union' s revenue with us.
As a result, we looked at the EU' s own resources without having discussed them with the Council.
What we noted for the 2001 budget year is no different from the trends observed in previous years.
Traditional own resources and VAT resources are becoming less and less significant.
The transfers from the Member States as a GNP resource share have increased steadily.
In total, own resources constitute 98.3% of revenue for the 2001 EU budget.
This is equivalent to 1.06% of their GNP, which is far less than the own resources ceiling percentage of 1.27% laid down in the financial perspective.
This shift towards the GNP resource can undoubtedly be viewed with mixed feelings.
It could lead to a fairer division of burdens between the Member States, as GNP is probably the best indicator to measure the relative wealth of the Member States' economies; indeed, if we look more closely, some Member States already cover 22, 29 or even 33% of their contributions to the European budget from traditional own resources - in other words, from money which has already belonged to the European Union for some time.
Secondly, it changes the nature of the European Union' s own resources, transforming them from real own resources into a form of Member States' contribution.
Thirdly, it simply does not create a visible link between the European Union and its citizens.
When the Belgian President of the EU, Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, spoke this morning, it warmed my heart. He too is questioning this indirect financing of the European Union.
He too is calling for more transparency.
He too wants citizens to become more familiar with the European Union, and this includes more transparent financial arrangements.
We want financial autonomy at European level, and we want to work towards this now.
We want this financial autonomy to be shared jointly and on an equal basis with the Council, and we want to have co-decision rights in this area.
We want equal rights in all areas; we want to be one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, in respect of all expenditure and all revenue.
We want complete budgetary autonomy.
A European tax may still be a long way off, but the Belgian presidency, the Belgian President of the European Union himself, has called for this.
The Belgian Finance Minister supports this demand, and even the German Finance Minister no longer rejects it outright.
A European tax may still be "future music", as the Germans say, but if we do not start playing it now, we will not be dancing to it in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Jutta Haug' s co-rapporteur, I had a rather easier task with the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for her outstanding work on the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget.
The purpose of my report, which I am honoured to present here, is to prolong two temporary posts, 1 A7 and 1 B5, and create two new temporary posts, 1 A5 and 1 A7, for the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
Naturally, I fully support this proposal in terms of content; this is a very serious matter as it concerns the refurbishment ...
... of the Belliard building.
After all, it is also in the European Parliament' s interests to ensure that sensible use can be made of this building in Brussels in the long term.
I would particularly like to stress the fact that the two Committees are making the necessary resources available through savings in the personnel field, which I think is very positive.
This shows that the willingness to make savings, which is something we have demanded from all the institutions, is being implemented very effectively by the two Committees.
I therefore recommend that items VI and VII of Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget no. 3 be adopted.
However, I should also like to make some general comments, as my group has kindly granted me a few minutes so that I can conclude my part as rapporteur.
First of all, I welcome the fact that this House is debating two Draft Supplementary and Amending Budgets simultaneously.
This is a contribution towards saving tax-payers' money while taking matters forward on a simpler administrative basis.
I think this is also worth mentioning.
I would point out that on the revenue side of the 2000 budget - as Ms Haug has already mentioned - the surplus of EUR 11.5 billion shows that there is still quite a lot of scope here.
I remember the ritual - which we will have the honour of continuing in July - when we fight over every euro, with the Council sinking to its knees and accusing us of supping from a horn of plenty.
Finally, by developing a serious Commission budget policy, but also through Parliament' s constant monitoring and support to ensure a prudent use of budget resources, we are now managing to generate surpluses which might actually make some of these rituals unnecessary in future.
I should mention in passing that the finance ministers of the Member States are delighted to receive a generous rebate towards the current budget.
I am sure this will be reflected in the Member States' eternal gratitude to us.
I should also like to make several comments on the issue of own resources.
Ms Haug, according to my information, a separate European tax was already being debated before my time, namely in April 1994.
It would seem that even then, people were making music that nobody danced to.
I am not sure whether it is useful at this stage to initiate a debate at European level on financing through taxation.
Let me say this quite clearly: we have other priorities first.
The first task which Europe must address is the issue of a more precise delimitation of powers between the European Union and the Member States.
The public would also like to have some answers. What is Europe responsible for, and why does it need money?
In a second step, we must of course discuss what kind of long-term institutions are required in Europe so that the tasks entrusted to Europe can be performed in a democratic and transparent way.
Finally, at the end of this process, decisions must be taken on how the necessary resources can be made available.
I think that if we approach matters on this basis, we will be on the right track.
By supporting a European tax at this stage, Europe' s citizens are more likely to be frightened off by what is happening here.
It will not help us to achieve lasting acceptance among citizens in the European Union.
Finally, as he is the next to rise, I should like to express my warm thanks to Mr Costa Neves who had the difficult task of setting out the parameters for the forthcoming deliberations with the Council.
Yet again, there are a number of problems for next year.
The Committee on Budgets can look forward to some lively debates.
However, I think that Mr Costa Neves has carried out his task with the necessary care and wisdom for a serious proposal to be put forward to the tax-payers, whom we - in our role as part of the budgetary authority - are representing here.
I am pleased that the German Social Democrats are also very receptive to the proposals from Bavaria.
This also opens up entirely new perspectives for the coming year.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, we are now completing another phase in the process of attempting to adopt, hopefully in December, the budget for 2002. This is a lengthy and complex process which, on the basis of the proposals made by the European Commission, seeks to achieve agreement between the Council and the European Parliament, the two branches of the budgetary authority.
Such agreement will require respect for the regulatory framework, for the existing agreements and between the institutions concerned, taking account of the representativeness of each one and the priorities that they legitimately define.
We must, therefore, work on the essence of the positions held by each of the parties involved, otherwise we will not be able to reach any kind of agreement.
I must emphasise that the report we are now discussing is a basis for negotiating with other institutions, which has been defined in accordance with the guidelines that we adopted in April; it is not the European Parliament' s final position on the 2002 budget.
As the basis for negotiations, it must not address issues on which Parliament has the final say.
It must lead to a discussion of aspects on which more positions held from more of a remove are required on issues on which the Council has the final say.
This applies to agricultural spending, security policy and international fisheries agreements.
It is the most basic common sense also to address other key issues, such as the level of payments for next year and the pace of the Commission reform.
We are therefore, I repeat, in a negotiating phase.
I must emphasise the essence of Parliament' s positions, with which you are, of course, all familiar.
In December 2000, the Council agreed that, by 30 June of this year, the Commission would present a progress report on a raft of matters, with a view to increasing the levels and the quality of budgetary implementation, improving coordination between legislative and budgetary procedures, and ensuring the success of the Commission reform.
This means that one of Parliament' s priorities is to consider issues of the budget' s quality, and their impact, and to assess and take account of the budget' s implementation.
The progress report has already been presented by the Commission, which is cause for satisfaction, and we are sure that it will seen as the crucial instrument that it is and which we are already beginning to study.
Furthermore, in April of this year, the European Parliament adopted guidelines that suggest the perennial matters in the progress report that I have just mentioned as political priorities, as well as food safety and consumer confidence, together with sustainable agriculture, the definition of priorities and, more generally, better implementation of the budget, including very specific aspects such as e-learning, a key aspect of the priority that is always given to issues of employment and social inclusion, and policy development in the field of asylum and immigration.
In this context, it is understandable that there should be concern at the speed at which commitments are met by making payments in due time and, at the same time, effectively reducing the amount of delayed payments and reducing the amount of RAL (amounts outstanding).
We feel, therefore, that we must take maximum advantage of the payment possibilities laid down in the financial perspective and we want to respect the financial perspective for 2002 to a value of 1.14% of the combined GNP of the Member States.
I must also highlight the following: the need for a precise, rigorous and up-to-date assessment of the implementation of the common agricultural policy reform, specifically taking account of the consequences of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises. We also need a timetabled approach to the future, which involves respecting the commitments given by the European Union at successive European Councils, particularly the Lisbon Council on employment and competitiveness, the Tampere Council on asylum and immigration and the Nice Council on the consequences of failing to conclude fisheries agreements with Morocco; the clarification of costs for external policy and common security, particularly with regard to the division of responsibilities between the Council and the Commission, respect for the financial perspective' s ceilings in category 4 too, in which attention must be paid to the traditional priorities of the European Parliament, which are well-known; the precise identification of real expenditure resulting from the enlargement process, with particular emphasis on administrative expenditure in category 5 and lastly, real consideration of the proposals previously made by Parliament, especially those relating to preparatory action and pilot projects.
I shall end here, in the hope that on 20 July - the date scheduled for the conciliation meeting - the positive and constructive spirit that I personally feel, will spread to all of those present.
Mr President, I should in any case like to congratulate Mr Costa Neves on the strategy which he has outlined on behalf of Parliament.
It gives a powerful signal indicating what Parliament does and does not want.
Coming from the Committee on Fisheries, I also notice that, with regard to agriculture, the European Commission has in any case understood that Parliament would like to set aside a large proportion of the budget for food safety and the fight against animal diseases, but as for the fishery guidelines, I have to say that it appears as if the Commission is still on a different planet.
It does not breathe a word about the problem that, after the failure of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, less money is being spent.
Neither does it mention the problems this has caused in vulnerable coastal regions in Spain and Portugal.
Nothing about the problems in the northern regions as a result of the temporary fishing ban due to the worrying cod stocks.
Even the Council is, for the time being, not taking any action further to implement Nice.
Needless to say, it is evident that the transfer of money from one heading to another, from heading 4 (external actions) to heading 2 (structural policy) is no child' s play.
Also because the ceiling of Berlin has been determined per heading.
But financial crisis management, such as the fight against the BSE crisis and aid for the Balkans, has shown that decisive politicians are not hindered by strict budget rules.
The EP' s Committee on Fisheries agrees with rapporteur Costa Neves where he states that both the Commission and the Council may actually be slightly too relaxed in some areas. At the same time, it prompts him to boost the creativity and decisiveness of the Commission and the Council.
Our proposals are as follows. We would earmark the funding that has not been used for fishery agreements under external actions, heading 4, to alleviate the effects in the coastal regions of South-Eastern Europe.
We would target structural funds to address the crisis in fisheries, which have been left over following the failure of the fishery agreement with Morocco, and further to the measures which have been taken to protect cod and hake stocks. We would, for the time being, set aside any balance in the account in 2001 to restructure the fisheries sector and, if possible, use the instrument of flexibility to fight the fisheries crisis.
Finally, we would also like specific research to be initiated into the use of genetic modification techniques in fish farming.
Europe is lagging far behind the United States and Canada in this respect, and only sound research will provide a basis to keep this technique in European fish farming at bay.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. (ES) Mr President, in heading 4, external actions, the cuts in the preliminary draft budget and those which appear to result from the first reading in Council are, in some cases, significant.
Furthermore, as we know, it will not be possible this year to use the flexibility instrument in this chapter.
We have just heard what the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries has said.
We in the Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to point out that the extension of the Union' s activities in this field, particularly in the field of the CFSP, requires sufficient contributions.
The uncertainty in the allocation of resources compromises the credibility and prestige of an external policy which must be in a position to fulfil its commitments and ambitions.
For all these reasons, the Committee on Foreign Affairs - in the context presented to us by the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, of a stage of the budgetary procedure, both in this conciliation procedure and at first reading, and in accordance with the priorities set in its opinion of 20 March, approved unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs - has the purpose of requesting the allocation of sufficient budgetary resources to finance the new priorities.
This of course, Mr President, bearing in mind their healthy, effective and transparent management.
The Commission has included approximately 120 million in relation to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, and we, like the general rapporteur for the budget, ask that the commitments made at the Nice Summit be fulfilled.
Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to say that if the European Union wishes to have influence on the world stage in the economic, commercial, financial and industrial fields, we must be coherent and provide ourselves with the necessary resources to do so.
.
(NL) Mr President, this is always a slightly awkward moment in the procedure.
On the one hand, we are preparing for the initial contacts with the Council.
We also know, however, that those contacts will never solve everything entirely. That is also evident from the absence of the representatives of the Council on the other side of the table.
Their curiosity only gets the better of them once the real procedure reaches completion.
That is why we can only make some general comments at this stage.
On behalf of my Committee, I should like to say that generally speaking, we agree to continuing last year' s policy, although we do have a number of specific concerns.
Our main concern is actually related to the proposals of the European Commission itself.
I have already drawn your attention to it. Particularly the huge cutback which the Commission proposes for the employment chapter gives us great cause for concern.
If you add this to what is happening in the funds, for example in model projects, our concerns only grow.
These concerns are exacerbated even more if one considers other projects which we agreed on last year in the budget, yet which failed to get off the ground.
They do seem to get snarled up in the Commission apparatus, but I do not want to go into that now.
That is worrying because we are making an arrangement here in respect of the budget, namely if the Commission agrees to that arrangement, it is also responsible for the implementation, and it should not try to get out of that responsibility via all kinds of legal or illegal backdoors.
In my opinion, that can be an extremely difficult issue in this procedure.
That is, in actual fact, our main concern at the moment.
It is no longer a matter of money.
It is now simply about appropriately spending the money that is available now and that was allocated in the previous budget.
We know that there are plenty of projects, but ever stricter criteria are being prescribed.
In some cases, the number of countries increases dramatically.
Originally, it was possible for three countries jointly to submit a project.
That has now suddenly increased to seven. We then wonder whether that is how both institutions should deal with each other.
I should like to put this to you now.
We will return to the other issues in due course.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we hope that the presidency of the Council can spend more time with us, at least when we hold our mini-sessions in Brussels.
In any event, in this joint debate on Supplementary and Amending Budgets Nos 3 and 4, the mandate for the budgetary conciliation and the report on the situation concerning the European Union' s own resources, the PPE-DE Group wishes to state that it is voting unanimously in favour in the first two cases and in favour by a majority in relation to own resources.
Clearly, the most potentially controversial issue in this Haug report relates to Parliament' s support for the possibility of opening a debate on the establishment of a direct Community tax which would be a source of autonomous funding for the Community budget.
Within all the groups. Mr President, there are differing sensitivities in relation to European integration, and this is all the more obvious when it comes to funding issues.
Therefore, Mrs Haug' s tendency towards this possible tax is too much for certain national delegations.
However, I believe that the majority of my Group will possibly agree with it.
Of more immediate importance is the mandate for conciliation by Mr Costa Neves, and we publicly thank him for being prepared to hold dialogue and for seeking a consensus.
We are sure that, thanks to this way of proceeding, we will be able to achieve successful results.
We are presenting clear proposals for the conciliation of 20 July, which the Council should not reject, because they represent the majority will of this House elected by the citizens of Europe.
Amongst these concerns I would like to stress our doubts about the reserve in agriculture, the low implementation of appropriations in food safety and the future of rural development.
I would also like to stress the will for the Council to comply with the Nice commitments with regard to overcoming the problems caused by the absence of a fishing agreement with Morocco and the need to safeguard Parliament' s external priorities, which are always cut at first reading by the Council and, even more, the indispensable consultation procedure which the Council should carry out with Parliament when adopting commitments on external policy.
Lastly, I would like to mention the need to deal with the problems that have already been mentioned in Category 5, especially the separation of administration expenditure and the identification of the Council' s expenditure in that category.
Ladies and gentlemen, all of this makes up the hub of Parliament' s negotiating position for the conciliation of 20 July, with regard to which we ask the Belgian presidency to maintain an open position and hold dialogue so that we can deal with the final part of the budgetary procedure with guarantees of success for all the parties.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I must begin by informing Markus Ferber from Bavaria that he will not necessarily find commonalities on those points where he hoped to find them. Let me explain why.
He said that we must first establish a different form of institutional development for the European Union before we talk about the EU' s finances.
I think this is wrong.
This is especially apparent from the issues before us today.
If you ask any member of the public nowadays what the European Union spends its money on, 30% will say 'to cover its administrative costs' , and another 30% will have no idea at all where the money goes.
That means that 60% do not know what we do with the resources provided by the tax-payer.
However, the tax-payers know that what they see as massive amounts of money are involved.
Enormous sums of money are spent, and I think that today of all days, the general public would be astonished, yet again, by what is happening at European level.
On the one hand, we have a Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget.
In one of them, the European Union, the Commission, shows that it has no intention of complying more than cursorily with the will of Parliament, at least as far as the sections on UCLAF or the new OLAF structure are concerned.
We made a very clear statement on this issue during the year.
We wanted to shape personnel and the staffing structure in such a way as to create a new institution which fulfils modern requirements.
In fact, it is only thanks to our colleague Herbert BÃ¶sch, who was willing to grasp the nettle, that no attempt was made to redeploy the staff and reshape this same institution - which, of course, was the focus of intensive debate last time - into another, which cannot develop entirely new structures as its personnel remains the same.
This also deserves criticism here.
My second point is this. We will be returning EUR 11 billion to the Member States.
EUR 11 billion means that we have a budget underspend of around 10%.
We have an underspend in the field of consumer policy, where just 74.7% of funds are being used.
Consumer policy - that is a word to savour!
This is the issue we have spent more time and energy discussing over the last few months, if not years, than any other - and yet only 75% of its budget is actually being spent.
We have allocated funds to address one of the European Union' s major problems, namely under-employment.
Let me give you the rate of expenditure in the field of employment policy: 39.6%.
We have millions of unemployed, money has been made available, and yet less than 40% of these funds is being spent.
Explain that to the European public!
We are handing back billions!
In category IV, i.e. external actions, we see that just under 60% of the funds allocated to the European initiative for democracy and the protection of human rights - an issue which we spend hours discussing for every resolution, as well as under "urgent business" - is being spent.
The rest is forfeited and goes back to the Member States.
Let me make it very clear: the European public must be told where the money goes.
However, they should also be told where it comes from.
That is being discussed quite specifically today, for it is always implied that the Member States provide the money. That is the case here today as well.
We must ensure that the public understands the situation.
We must make the revenue side and the expenditure side more transparent.
We cannot continue to explain why we battle against the Council in the budget debates to secure an extra 11 billion, only to hand it back in the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget at the beginning of the following year because it has not been used.
The money then goes back into the relevant national budgets.
We must move away from this situation.
There must be a reliable and accountable source of revenue which is transparent to the public. Whatever form this takes, we must not cobble together a solution - Markus Ferber is quite right on that point.
We must not be tempted, as a knee-jerk reaction, to agree any old solution as quickly as possible, for an uncoordinated, unstructured debate only leads to confusion.
We must be able to manage this.
Once we have set this up on the revenue side, once it is directly linked to citizens, and the expenditure side is then controlled by citizens as well - for they will look very carefully at what we are doing with the money - no further funds will be returned to the Member States. Instead, they will ask us: how have you actually managed the money?
This is where we draw together the two issues which we are discussing today - the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget, with massive movements of money on the one hand and own resources on the other. In other words, the issue is this: how much is the public actually paying for Europe?
In my view, there is no need to be frightened about telling the public what we are doing.
We have good arguments, we have very good policy areas and policies, and we can present them persuasively.
There is no need to be frightened of the public: we simply need to approach them very openly and transparently, and invite them to work with us on building Europe here.
Mr President, the package under discussion concerns the EU' s accounts for last year, own resources and next year' s budget.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs Haug, Mr Ferber and Mr Costa Neves.
Last year' s accounts are astonishing: they show a surplus of more than eleven billion euros.
This is because revenue was EUR 3.3 billion more than was estimated and expenditure EUR 8.5 billion less than forecast.
The increase in revenue is a good thing.
However, the saving in expenditure is deceptive, based, as it is, mainly on the lamentable under-utilisation of Structural Funds.
A good 20% of payments were not taken up, amounting to EUR 6.5 billion.
These payments will be carried over to the years following, meaning that no real savings have been made at all.
The main reason for under-utilisation was that new Objective programmes were slow to be approved.
Only half of the EU Objective 1 programmes came to be approved in 2000, almost two years after the Agenda 2000 decision taken in Berlin.
Just 8% of the Objective 2 programmes were approved.
No money at all was spent on new Community initiatives for the second year in succession.
Administrative payments are in a pitiful state.
The Commission must improve its ability to pay considerably.
It has to bear the responsibility for seeing to it that matters are dealt with efficiently and on time.
The present omissions will be reflected as backlogs in budgets in the years to come.
The other peculiarity in the accounts is the reduction in the refund made in respect of the United Kingdom' s contribution.
It is odd that amendments should be made to this supplementary budget that go back to the budgets of two and four years ago.
Why were these amendments not made at the time?
Mr Costa Neves' s report provides a good basis for discussions next year.
According to preliminary estimates, administrative expenditure of the institutions under heading 5 will exceed the financial perspectives, which is mainly due to the increase of more than 9% in the Council' s expenditure, which, in turn, is the result of a rise in CFSP expenditure.
Parliament must strongly insist on its demand that a separate plan showing a structure of the posts involved in the administration of this policy should be put forward.
This expenditure is not part of a gentleman' s agreement between Parliament and the Council according to which the institutions do not interfere in one another' s budgets.
Mr President, I wish to speak about own resources.
The tables appended to Mrs Haug' s report and dedicated to the subject of own resources do not give a correct picture of the different share of contributions among the Member States.
It has to be said aloud that the United Kingdom is one of the EU members getting a free ride.
It has been given a reduction on contributions.
It should form part of the report' s conclusions that the United Kingdom should be made to pay its contribution according to the same principles as everyone else.
In addition, the report' s statistics disguise the real situation with respect to the customs duties the UK collects on behalf of the EU.
But customs duties disguise the share of contributions made by Holland and Belgium still more, as these countries also collect customs duties on goods bound for other countries.
Holland and Belgium are not the large net contributors the figures show them to be.
The report' s conclusions call for the introduction of a special European tax.
This is no mere accident.
The country holding the presidency, Belgium, has also announced it will pursue the issue.
There are two different opinions on this in our group.
The tax is supported by those who are guided by the spirit of European federalism, while those who wish to preserve their national sovereignty are opposed to the EU having the power to levy and collect taxes.
Federalism is the making of the European Union into a federal state.
If the EU is given the power to levy and collect taxes we will be paving the way for federalism.
As a representative of taxpayers in a small net contributor country I cannot endorse European taxation for the purposes of a federal state.
Mrs Haug' s conclusion in her report is too radical.
Mr President, I too want to speak about Mrs Haug' s report on own resources.
Her advice that we should go for a European tax is premature and unnecessary.
She says that the Belgian presidency is expected to put this forward or start a debate.
I have read the notes on the work programme by the Belgian presidency and there is little or no reference to it.
There is only one reference to the tax on flows of speculative capital - the so-called Tobin tax.
That was voted down by Parliament only a few months ago.
At the end of the document there is also reference to direct or indirect funding of the European Union, so that we can once again operate with the European Union' s own resources.
I put to her that the Prime Minister of Belgium only, in the last few days, said that he does not want to pursue this path towards a European Union tax because "it is sensitive".
It is very much a sensitive matter and totally unnecessary.
Mrs Haug mentions that the amount of money coming in from the nation-states through gross national product is going to rise.
I accept that.
I sat in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom for 18 years before coming into this Chamber.
I always thought it was marvellous that the percentage of gross national product coming into European spending was declining.
That downward path has continued during the last two years.
I applaud that.
It shows good and effective control of spending and nation-states do not mind passing on that money to the European Union.
I see no reason whatsoever for the European Union to raise its own direct tax.
That is why I have tabled four amendments tomorrow for voting.
Two of those will be on a roll-call vote.
You can see this evening that there is opposition from various countries.
I hope that people will vote in support of my amendments and oppose the European tax.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for his proposal and for such good cooperation.
We on the Committee on Budgets have reached agreement on most areas.
It is my guess that, this year, it will be issues of principle which dominate the budget debate more than individual budget items, issues which will feature increasingly in the debate in the coming years.
I am thinking particularly about enlargement and the development of a common foreign and security policy and its budgetary effects.
I am thinking of the reform of the agricultural and fisheries policies.
In addition, I am thinking of internal reform, especially the Commission' s ability to actually implement the decisions of the budgetary authority.
The basic conditions are quite worrying.
Popular faith in the EU is waning in many Member States.
At the same time, we are on the threshold of perhaps the most important change ever - eastward enlargement.
In the face of this challenge, the EU' s ability to carry out its priorities must be strengthened considerably.
It is therefore worrying, even if some finance ministers are rubbing their hands with glee, that the level of budgetary implementation is so low that we now have to pay back EUR 11 billion to Member States.
The problem of promises of aid and assistance being delayed or not being carried out is an obstacle to the whole Union.
It is therefore good that the Commission now wants to increase payments and reform the work in the direction of more modern, efficient and open management.
This is something that the Council must not change.
With regard to the points at issue, I want first to raise the subject of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Although this is a large and complicated issue, we must now increase the pace of change.
Before we adopt the budget for 2002 and, above all, before we fully conclude negotiations with the prospective Member States, we absolutely must be clearer about the future Common Agricultural Policy.
In this context, I would like to point out the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
This committee is seeking, in its proposals for amendments, to confirm that agricultural expenditure is to be kept within the framework of the budget, but although there are technical difficulties, especially in the light of enlargement, they are also seeking to redistribute funds in the interest of comprehensive development of the countryside, category 1B.
This is to be welcomed, and I believe that we should continue on this path.
Otherwise, we are currently mostly concerned with the reason for the Commission wanting such large reserves for BSE and foot and mouth disease when they still have the opportunity of adjusting the proposed budget themselves.
In this respect, we would like to postpone any further decision on our position until we have received more answers to our questions.
Let me also briefly comment on the breakdown of the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
The fact that this cannot now be implemented will have consequences for the fishing fleets of several countries.
I, for one, am sceptical about the EU' s major subsidies within the agricultural and fisheries policies, but we must still, of course, take into account the problems of the fishermen who have been counting on new opportunities for earning a living.
We must support proactive restructuring and test the possibility of creating funds for this under budget headings other than category 4.
In addition, there is a need for developed proposals from the Commission.
Although the conciliation into which we are currently entering primarily concerns headings 1, 2 and 5, we would like to take the opportunity to highlight a few other points.
Last year, Parliament promoted an extra focus on employment and small businesses.
Following the development of the Lisbon Process at the Stockholm Summit, there is every reason to keep to this set of priorities.
As such, we must also clear up a number of the problems about which Mr Pronk, for example, spoke earlier.
In addition, we would now also like to focus on the area of e-learning, which we believe must receive resources in order for it to be developed into the key area it must become if we are to be able to increase growth and ensure that this growth is more evenly distributed across Europe.
Finally: we are also concerned about the external undertakings.
They have presented the greatest difficulty in 2000 and 2001.
These problems have not, of course, gone away.
We have made considerable commitments to Kosovo and Yugoslavia, at the same time as having major and neglected needs to meet in other, even poorer areas of the world.
This is one of our most vital tasks, but we have huge problems which we must be able to solve in order to implement everything we have promised.
Although there are major challenges ahead of us, I nonetheless believe that, with good will, we will be able to solve them together.
Mr President, the agricultural budget is probably typified by strokes of good fortune as well as huge setbacks.
The setbacks are the outbreaks of animal diseases.
The impact of those setbacks for the following year will probably not be fully known to us until the end of October, to be exact.
One thing is certain: the strokes of luck will not last forever.
We can expect setbacks in the form of outbreaks every year.
I am about to repeat what I said last year, the year before that and God knows how long before that.
It is irresponsible, in my opinion, to have EUR 41 million earmarked in the budget for the outbreak of infectious animal diseases.
If we consider how much BSE and swine fever outbreaks have cost, and what foot and mouth is costing now, then those 41 million are a mere pittance.
I therefore believe that the Commission should adopt a structural approach in order to improve the situation.
Is it possible to have insurance cover in place?
Is it possible to have a specific cattle fund, and does it not amount to distortion of competition if the national portion in one country is to be paid by the farmers, while it is entirely government-funded in other countries?
Those are the aspects which the Commission, the Member States and the rapporteur need to work on in the short term, for it is quite likely that we will be experiencing setbacks of this kind again in future.
Mr President, this debate on the EU' s own resources and on EU tax is familiar to us all.
It comes around every year.
The positions are well known, and in a way it seems quite unnecessary to repeat the debate and decisions year after year.
Apart from the questions of pure principle, one might wonder whether higher and new taxes are what EU Member States and EU citizens really need.
We are all highly taxed.
Certain Member States have some of the highest taxation levels in the world - I myself come from one such country.
If we look at them, it is hardly these countries which have experienced the greatest economic growth in the last decade.
Of course the report talks about tax in total not increasing.
However this is a theoretical proposition which has very little to do with practical reality.
I also believe it is the case that if a tax is introduced, particularly a new tax level as in this case, taxation will also increase.
It is almost inevitable.
I would also like to mention the fact that the rapporteur says he is seeking to strengthen the link between the Union and its citizens' .
This is no doubt admirable and important, but in my view it should happen in a completely different manner.
I am very doubtful indeed whether people would feel any stronger connection with the EU through having to pay higher taxes than they do already.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to jointly debate the system of own resources and the next budget at the point of conciliation reinforces the idea that income and expenditure are two sides of the same coin.
There have been calls here for fiscal autonomy and codecision for income and expenditure, but first we must achieve suitable and fair funding of Community policies and we already know that there are differing opinions about the most efficient system for achieving it.
Sooner or later we will have to reach a permanent agreement, but first we will have to debate and clarify the issues selected at the Nice Council.
It seems a pointless exercise to talk about a new philosophy for own resources without having cleared up the fundamental unknown factors first.
It is not very prudent to begin building a house from the roof.
In any event, to use the argument of the issue of net balances - as has been done - does not move in the right direction, but, for many reasons, contributes to undermining the principles of the Union.
The question today is whether the new decision on own resources effectively makes progress towards greater equity and transparency and takes more account of the Member States' tax capacity.
It is clear that the gradual reduction of the maximum reference rate for the VAT resource contributes to correcting the regressive aspects of the system in force.
The Member States' contributions via the fourth resource or VAT must be proportionate with their contribution to the Community GDP as a key element of safeguarding the equity of the system.
Therefore we must keep up our efforts in this direction.
The proposal also has some negative aspects, which are far from negligible.
The maintenance, albeit with a modification of the calculation system, of the so-called correction of budgetary imbalances in favour of the United Kingdom, confirms that this procedure is totally contrary to the desired transparency and simplicity.
With regard to the 2002 budget, I would like to point out that the Costa Neves report - and I congratulate the rapporteur on his work - provides the necessary elements for a good negotiation.
I believe that there is a margin for reaching final agreements with the Council.
I would ask the Commission to fulfil its commitment to propose a suitable instrument and funding to deal with the failure of the fishing agreement with Morocco, which also means that the aid can be used in projects for alternative economic activity in the regions affected.
I feel that I need to give you some information in light of Mr Dover' s speech.
Earlier, you called Mr Heaton-Harris to speak for the Budgetary Control Committee and he was not here, and he is still not here.
I think I know the reason why - because he is knackered or should I say 'physically exhausted' following a football match this afternoon between British Labour Members and British Conservative Members which the Labour Members won by 7 goals to 1.
However, Mr Dover and so were also involved.
You expect Labour members to stand the pace!
Since he is here, I think Mr Dover should be congratulated, not for what he said, but because he is present here tonight when Mr Heaton-Harris is not, and he is a much younger man.
(Mixed reactions)
I really do not know whom I should now be personally congratulating for winning at football!
Mr President, rapporteurs, honourable Members, there is always a lot to do, discuss and decide where budgets are concerned, and today we have just had four important points: the two supplementary budgets for the current financial year, the resolution on financing the budget and the preparations for the first reading of the 2002 budget in the Council.
Amending Budget No 3/2001 is concerned solely with personnel matters, in the field of research and in OLAF.
Amending Budget No 4/2001 is concerned with the use of the budget surplus from last year.
Both budgets are discussed in the report by Mrs Haug and Mr Ferber.
In the matter of the Commission' s research personnel, they suggest a different establishment plan.
This is acceptable to the Commission.
So far as the change to the OLAF establishment plan is concerned, this is now based on a compromise arrived at in lengthy negotiations and I should like at this point to make a few observations about it.
Firstly, a comment on the fact that the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control which is before us today still speaks of serious irregularities in OLAF, specifically that there are more A grade officials than posts.
In connection with this word "irregularities" I should simply like to point out once again that the budgetary authority authorised a certain number of grade A posts for the year 2000 establishment plan. Not all of them were actually filled by the Commission or OLAF, but when it came to the 2001 budget the budgetary authority then decided to cut the number of grade A posts to fewer than there were officials in place.
Nothing like that has ever happened before and of course it creates difficulties, but to call it an irregularity and to create the impression that the Commission has filled posts it was not authorised to is simply not correct and I must reject the term irregularities in this connection.
I should also like to point out that the Commission passed the OLAF Director' s establishment plan proposals on to the budgetary authority unchanged precisely in order to underline OLAF' s independence.
On the other hand, some of the European Parliament' s resolutions amount to very detailed micromanagement, which naturally at least raises a few questions as regards independence.
Overall, the fact that posts are being blocked and also that unfortunately not all posts have yet been approved is not exactly making it easy for OLAF to operate, and the authority does now have some really big tasks, and above all a wide range of different tasks, to cope with.
I can at this point only assure you once again that the Commission is doing all it can to create good working conditions for OLAF.
Regarding the second Supplementary and Amending Budget.
The year 2000 budget ended with a surplus of EUR 11.6 billion, as has been mentioned here several times.
This is in part the result of increased revenue, the fruit, for example, of a more favourable trend in gross national product than was initially assumed, but for the greater part it is the result of resources not being implemented on the expenditure side.
I must now say something about structural policy - it is after all the largest chunk, accounting for 6 of these 11 billion - namely that account was already taken of the fact that it would probably be difficult to implement all resources in the first year when the Interinstitutional Agreement was drawn up and signed.
That was more or less taken for granted and it was therefore decided that commitments could be redeployed for subsequent years, and that is what has been done, which ensures that no resources are lost to the Structural Funds because of implementation difficulties in the first year.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is in my opinion that we must start much earlier with preparations and decision making for a future support period.
I should like to point out, for example, that Parliament' s position on the Community initiatives was adopted in April 2000.
We can see here that the whole process began too late.
In other words, we must simply set an earlier timetable for the next support period.
That applies to everyone, it applies to the Commission, it applies to Parliament and it also applies, of course, to the Council.
Incidentally, the entire resources of EUR 11.6 bn are not being returned.
EUR 1.6 bn were already deployed in the 2001 budget, among other things to finance the BSE measures decided in Supplementary Budget No 1.
EUR 2 075 bn are used to finance the budget correction for the United Kingdom, and unlike the previous speakers I am not looking at Mr Wynn here.
We have also proposed using EUR 350 million to top up the resources for reconstruction in the Balkans and to return the other part, namely EUR 7.5 bn, to the Member States by reducing their contributions to the 2001 budget accordingly.
The rapporteurs are now proposing that not just EUR 350 million but 450 million be used to top up the resources for the Balkans.
The Commission actually wanted to fund the difference by making further transfers from other areas, but we now agree to your proposal, especially in the light of the time factor, which is very important.
We really do not want to run the risk of having to suspend payments for measures for Kosovo or Serbia.
We all know how sensitive this area is and I very much hope that Parliament' s proposal in this connection will meet with the Council' s agreement so that the entire proposal can be adopted before the summer break.
Now to the present motion for a resolution on own resources.
The subject is becoming increasingly topical because of the question of what is the best way to finance the European budget.
On the one hand, of course, we have the following situation: a new decision has been taken on own resources with a new structure, and this own resources decision naturally applies until something else is decided, with everything that goes with it, including the British rebate.
That is the law as it stands.
So far as the structure of financing is concerned, the Treaty states that the public budget is financed out of own resources.
That is what it says in the Treaty.
The agreement with Parliament in 1975, for example, also stressed again that they should be genuine own resources.
But instead, the de facto trend has been in quite a different direction, and you showed in detail in your report, Mrs Haug, that it has taken a different direction.
Regarding the financing that we currently have, I simply have to say that it is not transparent for the citizen.
It is one of the most serious points, that hardly any citizen knows how the EU is financed, and what they do not know is all the more unfathomable and leaves room for every kind of speculation.
For my own part, I can only say once more that I very much welcome the fact that the Belgian presidency intends taking up this matter of how the EU budget is financed and, Mr Ferber, I consider it to be a subject forming part of the whole issue of the delimitation of competences between the Member States and the European level.
That is where it really belongs.
I think it is of course also quite important that all who welcome a restructuring on the revenue side should now also find a common vocabulary as soon as possible.
If we talk about introducing an EU tax, that sounds like inventing some new kind of tax that the European Union will be entitled to levy.
That is not what it is about at all.
It is about specifying a tax, some or all of which will flow into the European budget, where responsibility for the amount raised will lie at European level, and it naturally also involves the problems of the European Parliament' s budgetary powers.
From my own point of view, I can only stress what Mrs Haug said, that the real issue is: will the European Parliament continue to have these reduced budgetary powers on the revenue side as it does on the expenditure side?
I believe an opportunity has presented itself, and we should in my opinion go with the momentum when the Council presidency raises the issue on its own initiative, because if it is not adopted as a topic for Laeken at this point in time, I fear the matter will be buried again and we shall not be able to debate it for a long time.
Now to Mr Costa Neves' s report.
This concerns the conciliation procedure before the Council' s first reading on 20 July, preparations for which take place in the trialogue on 9 July.
I should again like to stress that the 9 July trialogue is of course also an important date, an important point in the whole budgetary procedure.
Since Mrs Theato is here, I should like to make a brief comment. Mrs Theato, you sent me a rather strongly worded letter asking me kindly to come to the Committee on Budgetary Control to debate a periodic report on 9 July instead of going to the trialogue.
I must again point out that I cannot of course be in two places at once and it goes without saying that it is part of the budget Commissioner' s duties to take part in the trialogue in preparation for the conciliation procedure for the 2002 budget.
But now to the points that will be at the centre of the conciliation.
Mr Costa Neves has described these in detail.
I should like to say the following. Firstly, I consider the Commission' s proposal to provide a EUR 1 bn reserve in the agriculture budget to be highly appropriate given the uncertainty surrounding the direction agricultural expenditure will take in the forthcoming year.
We now have the first bills for foot and mouth disease on the table and more will come in, and they confirm that a large reserve is really necessary.
We ought to play safe, and we will of course be able to be more precise in the Letter of Amendment in the autumn, including on the question of how much we shall have to pay from the budget for foot and mouth disease.
But for the present I believe the level of reserve proposed is the best way forward and I very much hope that the European Parliament will support this in the conciliation procedure with the Council.
The second point concerns the abortive fisheries agreement with Morocco, which has been mentioned by several speakers here.
It is an important point; I therefore want to speak about it briefly.
The Commission plans to propose a cofinancing programme to assist with the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets concerned by the end of July.
It will be a programme financed in the category of the structural funds. But now you will say the structural funds category is empty or fully committed.
The Commission will for this reason be making a proposal that the flexibility reserve, or part of it, be used to finance this restructuring programme.
It would then be a one-year programme, implementation of which may extend over several years.
How the resources released in category IV by the abortive fisheries agreement should be used will have to be considered weighing up every aspect, including, and I say this expressly, the aspect of budgetary discipline.
In the matter of common foreign and security policy, Parliament takes the view that resources could be cut this year, too.
In fact, the preliminary draft budget is the same as the 2001 budget, and the Commission sees no need for further cuts here, but the Commission will, of course, assist the rapporteur as requested in order to improve the budget commentaries.
Now a word on administrative expenditure.
I share the European Parliament' s concern about the future trend of Category V and I therefore fully support the efforts for greater transparency and ease of planning for any new areas of activity, such as justice and home affairs.
But I also want to make clear that it is not the expenditure on Commission reform that is putting a strain on the financial framework here.
We all have to consider necessary reforms, and I believe it is essential that all institutions try to put forward a medium-term plan so that we can see where changes are necessary in order to get to grips with Category V. We really need to give thought to whether a high level group or similar should be deployed to deal with these issues.
You have drawn attention, Mr Costa Neves, to the report that the European Parliament had called for and which deals, among other things, with matters of budget implementation.
I should like to thank you for the positive comment that it was completed on time and that it is a useful tool for discussing the questions raised in Parliament' s declaration.
There will also be close cooperation in the field of any actions included in the budget by the European Parliament.
As also agreed, the Commission will be involved in the discussion by the various committees at an early stage in order to ensure that actions and pilot schemes can be implemented.
That, too, is important for us and I should like to highlight in particular the areas of asylum and immigration policy.
A brief word on priorities in e-learning and employment policy as they affect small and medium-sized enterprises.
These are areas where large sums of money are available not only in the budget lines of Heading 3 but also in the structural funds, and the Commission believes that the new instruments introduced in the last budget must first prove their worth before they are substantially increased or expanded.
To conclude, all this shows how much we still have to discuss.
Over the coming months we must work out the year 2000 budget together, and I hope that we shall be able to make good use of the next few weeks and the forthcoming meetings to arrive at common positions so that we shall have a good start to the budget negotiations.
, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. (DE) Mr President, I should like to address Commissioner Schreyer.
I am rather surprised to hear her say I wrote her a strongly worded letter.
She quotes me as having written that she should kindly come to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
That cannot be true.
I wrote a businesslike letter in which I asked her to come to us in the Committee for Budgetary Control in accordance with our agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
If Mrs Schreyer has other commitments, I do, however, assume that she is able to send a senior official to give the Committee the information it requires.
The letter has no other meaning.
Mrs Schreyer, I am somewhat astonished that you read the letter in that way.
It was entirely businesslike.
I just wanted to explain that.
Thank you.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Management of Community programmes
Mr President, what we have here, albeit under a somewhat technical title, namely the creation of executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes, is a rather important reform, and an element which is by no means peripheral to the administrative reform which is taking place within the Commission.
I must say straightaway that the Committee on Budgetary Control and this House are very much in sympathy with the principle of the agency that has been proposed to us, and our initial impression is a favourable one, because, in creating this agency, the Commission is responding to a matter of fundamental concern to Parliament, a concern which it expressed in the context of the budgetary procedure for the year 2000.
Parliament was anxious to see the dismantling of the technical assistance offices (TAOs), which were not supervised very well and which did not come under the Commission' s control, and to have them replaced by establishments which would exhibit both the security which goes with the public nature of the institutions and, at the same time, the flexibility of management and operation which is necessary in order to accomplish a certain number of tasks, in particular the implementation of certain programmes.
In short, what we said was, - 'Let us abolish the TAOs, but let us not replace them with central Commission services, but rather let us invent something new' .
These agencies are certainly something new.
The Commission' s proposal forms part of a greater whole, an externalisation policy which comprises three facets. First, there is the privatisation of certain specific, precisely defined tasks, a privatisation which we are in favour of provided that the private persons who will be responsible for these tasks are not given integrated administrative tasks to do.
Second, there are the executive agencies themselves.
Finally, there is a third aspect about which we are more doubtful, but which we are not about to discuss this evening, and that is the creation of national agencies, which will be responsible for running a certain number of programmes in the territory of the Member States.
The proposed regulation which you have before you is concerned only with the statute of the agencies.
Therefore, Madam Commissioner, in principle you have the support of the rapporteur and the support of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
That does not mean, as I am sure you suspected because you know me, that we agree with everything.
There are a certain number of points on which we agree and a certain number on which we disagree.
As far as the first group is concerned, as I have already said, we agree with the principle of the agency.
We also agree with the detailed rules for the management of that body, part of which will consist of staff seconded from the Commission, because we want this agency to be clearly subordinate, both politically and administratively, to the Commission. The other part of the body will consist of more flexible staff recruited on the basis of temporary contracts tailored to the management flexibility needed for programmes of limited duration.
We also believe, and I think that this is a point on which we agree, that these new bodies must be subject to the same controls, and the same obligations regarding communication, audit and OLAF competency, as the Commission' s central services.
On this point, I think we see things from the same angle.
On the other hand, there are a certain number of points on which we still have doubts which need to be cleared up.
The first of these concerns the definition of the tasks that are likely to be externalised and entrusted to the executive agencies.
This is an old issue, and one on which the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control are in step, even if some of us are not entirely of the same opinion. We would like these externalised tasks to be really externalised, because they are of a temporary nature and because they require the use of temporary or specialist staff, but we do not want them to be externalised simply because they would cost less because they would be using less well paid and less qualified staff.
That is not our objective.
Secondly, we believe that the Commission' s legal responsibility should be complete and direct.
This is a point of law on which we may disagree, but I do not believe that we are fundamentally opposed to one another.
In the same way, and this is quite an important technical point which Mrs Theato, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, is particularly keen on, we would like to see discharge being granted to these bodies at the same time as discharge is granted to the Commission.
We do not want them to be separated, and we do not want to have to know about innumerable separate discharges. We want to be able to decide on discharge with a single vote, for both operating appropriations and administrative appropriations.
I am approaching my conclusion. There are still two points on which we still differ, and which are causing a problem at the committee stage.
First of all, the rapporteur had proposed that 25% of the staff of the agency should actually come from the Commission, although the Committee on Budgetary Control did not go along with this proposal and has not, in fact, agreed to it.
On behalf of our group we tabled an amendment which was intended to reinstate this request, but slightly altered, and after negotiations with the Commission we specified that the figure of 25% would not have to be achieved until after a certain time had elapsed, in this case a period of eighteen months, which would enable the agency to reach cruising speed.
I hope to be able to convince committee members in the Socialist Group to support this proposal.
I have not managed to do so yet, but I have not given up hope.
I now come to my last point, and it is an important one. It concerns the nature of the typical staff statutes and contracts.
We disagree on this point, and I am concerned because, following the Cocobu vote, I saw proposals for regulations which rather worried me.
We are concerned to note that staff would be subject to non-renewable statutes.
If this is the case, we shall find ourselves with staff of inferior quality, who are less loyal and who will not be in a position to ensure continuity of service on all occasions, thus giving rise to periods of interruption which will be detrimental to the interests of those who benefit from the services and for whom the programmes are intended.
On this point, Madam Commissioner, I want to ask you for a firm commitment.
We want to have continuity of service, and we want the staff who are used by these agencies to have renewable arrangements according to need, and not to have their contracts cut off arbitrarily and automatically while the programme is still going on.
Those, Madam Commissioner, are the feelings of our committee.
I shall stop there, having reached my conclusion, which is that we support your proposal in principle, while waiting to hear from you certain clarifications on the points which I have raised.
Thank you, Mr President, for your patience, and I should also like to thank my fellow committee members for their warm support.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission says it cannot cope with the ever growing number of Community programmes and their implementation with its statutory number of staff.
That may be right.
It means the Commission must delegate and decentralise.
Various models have in the past proved unsuitable or failures.
Either they were not financially transparent, like the minibudgets, or they were conducive to fraud like the TAOs, which is why Parliament demanded their abolition.
Now the Commission is presenting a proposal for a regulation for the statute of so-called executive agencies, which the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, has just explained.
I should like to congratulate him on his very detailed treatment of this proposal.
I should like to underline a number of important points in his report.
The Commission must provide a precise list of the tasks to be transferred, whether they are public or non-public and the type of executive agency to which they are to be transferred.
Unfortunately, we do not yet have the promised handbook about that.
But it must be clear that responsibility for the proper and economic execution of the transferred tasks lies with the Commission, which is subject to discharge by Parliament, which means there can be no discharge for the agencies themselves.
Parliament must be provided with all the information and documents it requires for the purpose without delay.
The agencies are also subject to scrutiny by the Court of Auditors and, where appropriate, also by OLAF.
The Commission is also legally liable for the executive agencies, since they are not anchored in the Treaty as institutions in their own right.
The agencies must be evaluated within not more than three years to check they are operating as they should.
Finally, all contracts with outside agencies must be limited in time.
Mr Bourlanges has just mentioned that.
The framework regulation makes no provision for their term to be extended.
But I think there ought to be provision for that.
It is at all events important that at least 25% of executive agency staff should be seconded Commission officials in order to ensure internal supervision of administrative tasks and to see that the Commission' s responsibilities are fulfilled.
May I first of all use up a small proportion of my valuable speaking time to congratulate you on the excellent work you have done in the Conciliation Committee with regard to the Takeover Directive?
I have stood up to the group discipline of my delegation to support you, but to no avail.
I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report that is before us today.
He has adopted a very constructive attitude in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I should also like to congratulate him on the excellent working relationship with the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets.
It is first-class teamwork, which deserves to be emulated.
Our group gives its unqualified support to the proposal of the European Commission.
We also back the report by Mr Bourlanges.
We are of the opinion that the Commission proposal forms a key component in the reform programme that was set in motion after 1999.
The proposal aims to externalise certain tasks in a clearly defined framework and end the administrative chaos of the technical assistance offices.
The Committee on Budgetary Control did tighten the proposal of the European Commission on a number of scores, as Mrs Theato has already mentioned.
Firstly, the location of the registered office of the agencies.
The text now refers to opening branch offices for agencies.
According to our amendment, this reference is being deleted.
There is still room for improvement.
Mr Mulder has tabled a sound amendment and I should like you, Mr Bourlanges, to consider adopting Mr Mulder' s amendment as a supplement to your amendment, so that we do not need to choose between the two.
Secondly, the provisions on financial audit and control are being tightened. The obligation has been included to produce a report annually.
That is a major improvement in my view.
Thirdly, we call for one Financial Regulation for all agencies, as opposed to a different Financial Regulation for each agency.
If not, we fear that we will no longer see the wood for the trees.
And finally, OLAF' s powers relating to agencies and relating to the European Commission should be the same in our opinion.
We still beg to differ with the rapporteur on a number of points.
Firstly, his definition of externalisation is rather skimpy.
He would like to restrict externalisation to temporary tasks and tasks of a technical nature. In practice, it is true that that will often be the nature of those tasks, but we find it too restricted.
A decisive Commission needs flexibility.
The question is what is most efficient, what is most cost-effective?
That question should be central, and we as European Parliament should not plug that opening.
And secondly, this has already been mentioned, Mr Bourlanges proposes to include a minimum percentage for the number of Commission officials who need to work in such an agency.
Needless to say, a certain percentage of Commission officials will need to work in such an agency, but it appears inappropriate in our view to place a figure on that percentage.
That will differ for each agency according to the nature and work of the agency.
Mr Bourlanges said in the committee: surely the Socialists are in favour of workers' rights?
I would say: surely, the PPE is in favour of abolishing unnecessary rules and in favour of freedom?
And finally, I should like to ask the Commission its opinion on the amendments tabled by Mr Ellis to this report.
- (NL) Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Bourlanges.
Needless to say, the proposal we are discussing at the moment has become inevitable after the events of a number of years ago.
It is necessary for us to further regulate the task of the executive bodies so as to avoid the mistakes of the past.
What will be the specific task of those bodies?
We totally agree with Mr Bourlanges that that still needs to be regulated.
One thing is certain: they will need to carry out a specific administrative task for a certain limited time.
What are the salient points for the liberal group?
Firstly, the Commission will always remain responsible for what happens.
It would be unacceptable if certain tasks were to be delegated to another executive agency on a discretionary basis.
Secondly, the percentage of the number of officials in such a body will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
We are opposed to putting a percentage figure on it, for we cannot possibly put a figure on it at the moment.
That will clearly depend on the tasks of the agency.
Concerning the discharge of agencies, the suggestion that this Parliament should look into the discharge of each agency seems unreasonable to us.
If the Commission is responsible, and if it is the case that the Commission is granted discharge by Parliament, that naturally implies that we indirectly grant the agencies discharge.
That is our strong view.
As for the remainder of the proposals, we generally back the amendments which the rapporteur has tabled.
Mr President, honourable Members, the European Parliament has played an important part in the whole discussion about Commission administrative reform.
The Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control have also played a key role in the question of externalisation.
The rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, in particular provided the initial impulse for the proposal for a regulation that is now before us.
I should like to thank you for your continued cooperation in working out the proposal and also the report.
I have to say that Mr Bourlanges already impressed me when he presented his magnum opus on externalisation in November 1999.
It is after all very difficult to produce good literature. Many people would say that creating a literary work on externalisation was an impossible task.
But you really succeeded in presenting something of high literary value with this first report on externalisation. My warmest congratulations.
It is now recognised that the Commission as a whole must concentrate more on its fundamental tasks.
That is the very reason why the subject of externalisation is being discussed, namely in response to the question of which tasks could be performed in a way other than within the Commission' s present administrative structures.
The plan envisages three methods and forms of externalisation, namely externalisation in the form of a delegation of tasks to executive agencies, the delegation of tasks to national agencies, i.e. decentralisation, and the assignment of tasks by contract to third parties.
The framework regulation for executive agencies defines a new form of Community institution that operates in the service of the Commission and has the task of managing and implementing Community programmes independently on the Commission' s behalf, including the associated execution of budget resources.
The regulation therefore provides the framework for the creation of executive agencies that the Commission will set up as and when required.
In this connection I should like to highlight the most important points once again. An executive agency is an instrument in the hands of and under the control of the Commission.
This also again makes it clear that it is wrong to equate externalisation with privatisation, as often happens in the debate, especially with officials.
You made it very clear, Mr Bourlanges, that such is not the case.
It means that the Commission' s responsibility for the execution of the budget under Article 274 of the EC Treaty is retained without qualification.
That is a point that has just been emphasised again by the Committee on Budgetary Control and also by you, Mrs Theato.
An executive agency is set up by the Commission.
The agency' s management bodies are appointed by the Commission.
The Commission exercises control through its own departments.
The operational resources managed by the agency remain in the European Union' s general budget and are administered by the agency in its capacity as an authorising party by delegation of the Commission.
The prerogatives of the budgetary authority are preserved. The budgetary authority approves the allocation to the agency' s administrative resources.
The agency' s establishment plan is submitted to the budgetary authority as part of the budgetary procedure.
We are unable to go along with the suggestion that a fixed percentage of the agency' s staff should be Commission officials.
Regarding the duration of the contracts, however, I can point out that setting up executive agencies only makes sense for tasks taking rather longer than one year.
That therefore means that contracts for contract personnel will run correspondingly longer.
I should also like to add that the European Parliament grants the discharge for the execution of the executive agency' s administrative and operational resources.
To sum up, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Nos 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 in part, as well as Amendments Nos 16, paragraphs 1 and 2, in part and 17 and 21 in part.
I should like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their critical scrutiny of our proposal.
Their contributions will make our proposal more balanced and bring us a step closer to our goal of increasing administrative efficiency.
Mr President, just a brief word.
I should like to have a very clear explanation from the Commissioner on the third part of Amendment No 25, in other words on the point about renewable contracts.
I have discussed the matter with your staff, and I wanted a precise undertaking from you.
I have not had it.
This is an issue of fundamental importance to us.
If we do not have a clear undertaking on this point by tomorrow, I shall make arrangements to submit to this House a motion to postpone the vote.
I have made it very clear to your staff that we want the people who work for this agency to be subject to contracts which can be renewed.
Obviously the renewal does not have to be obligatory, but it is something that I have been insisting on ever since I became aware of the proposed regulation which had been submitted to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I should also like to say, by the way, that the proposed regulation in question had not been notified, for reasons of which I am unaware, either to the Committee on Budgetary Control or to the Committee on Budgets.
I therefore made it very clear to those who were responsible that I would be expecting an undertaking from the Commission this evening.
I have not received it.
I would like to think that perhaps the message was not passed on.
You have until tomorrow to think about it, but I shall expect an undertaking from you before the vote takes place.
Regarding Amendment No 25, Mr Bourlanges, the first part is accepted by the Commission, the second part is rejected.
As regards the third part, I agree to your suggestion of clarifying the matter by tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Safe operation of mining activities
The next item is the report (A5-0214/2001) by Mr SjÃ¶stedt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication on safe operation of mining activities: a follow-up to recent mining accidents [COM(2000) 664 - C5-0013/2001 - 2001/2005(COS)].
. (SV) Mr President, the background to this report and the Commission communication with which it deals is a number of extremely serious accidents which have happened in the mining industry in recent years.
In 1998, a dam collapsed at a mine in Spain, with very serious ecological consequences, and a similar accident occurred in Romania in 2000.
Both these accidents had international environmental consequences.
In recent years, we have also seen similar, but less extensive, accidents involving collapsing mine dams, e.g. in Northern Sweden and in Wales.
This has led to the EU reviewing its legislation with regard to this type of mining operation.
At the same time, we have large amounts of mining waste stored in various places releasing heavy metals and other toxic substances into the environment.
The content of this waste and the extent of the problem are also not entirely clear.
As such, mining waste is one of our major environmental problems.
The safety of mining operations is also a major environmental problem.
In its proposal, the Commission presents its thoughts on possible ways of improving EU legislation in this area.
In the main, we have decided, in our report, that things are moving in the right direction.
However, we have a number of comments on what we believe the more concrete content should be and on what we would like the Commission to propose.
We emphasise that, in the event of an accident, the responsibility should lie exclusively with the company, including responsibility for the environmental consequences, and that the mining industry should be included in the future Directive on environmental liability.
We would like more research in this area.
At the moment, there is a major lack of research into the management of mining waste.
We would, therefore, like the techniques currently found in various countries to be developed.
We would also like the EU to review its own financing of various projects in this field.
With regard to the main proposals, in my report we propose that the study now underway should also take in the candidate countries.
The study means going through old mining waste and identifying cases of serious environmental problems.
We know that the situation may be more serious in many candidate countries than it is in the present Member States.
We also emphasise that we would like a common method to be used so that it will be possible to compare results from different sources.
We believe that, in the cases where it is established that there is a major problem, these must also be followed up with actual action plans.
The most important element of the Commission' s proposal is the proposal for a new framework directive on mining waste.
I, as rapporteur, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, believe that this is the right approach.
A special directive is needed, as neither the Directive on Waste nor the Directive on the landfill of waste is especially applicable to the management of mining waste.
We also stress that this directive must deal with both old mining waste and existing production.
This directive should also contain a provision obliging the Member States to have legislation on the restoration of those locations which have been used for mining operations.
Such legislation already exists in a number of Member States but not all, particularly if the candidate countries are included.
We would like specific provisions on dam safety which directly address these accidents.
In addition, we would like a direct ban on the method used in Baia Mare in Romania, where cyanide was used in open dams for metal extraction.
This is an extremely dangerous method which risks seriously damaging the surrounding environment if the dam bursts, as was the case in Romania.
A third element of the proposals is that the Seveso II Directive should be reviewed.
It is a question of broadening the scope of the directive in order to include requirements for contingency plans and information for mining operations.
In this area, there is the one amendment to the report, which comes from the Conservative PPE-DE Group.
The amendment proposes that the obligation set out in the Seveso II Directive should be restricted and only cover mining operations concerned with ore processing, i.e. metal extraction.
I believe it is too early to set such limitations before the Commission' s proposal has even been tabled.
It would be unwise to do this at this point.
Instead, options should be kept open for all types of mining operation to be covered by this directive.
There was widespread agreement when we discussed this matter in committee.
I would like to thank my fellow Members for their comments and for the support I have received.
We have also enjoyed excellent cooperation with the Commission and now look forward quite soon to receiving the first proposals that have been promised, especially the revision of the Seveso II Directive.
We hope that the Commission will also listen to us regarding the focus of the forthcoming proposals.
Thank you for such excellent cooperation.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for his report and to congratulate him on it.
He had a really very tricky subject to deal with.
My group, at any rate, will be very glad to vote in favour of this report.
As we shall, of course, be voting in favour of your report, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, allow me to give voice to certain misgivings expressed to me by persons affected.
Persons affected are of the opinion that a lot of things are being said here that are not materially justified.
Because of the two tailing ponds disasters with which we are familiar, the mining industry as a whole and the existing rules are being seen in a light that bears no relation to reality.
People have mentioned to me recital A, which says that mining accidents have highlighted the inadequacy of rules and monitoring requirements governing the mining industry in present and future EU states.
Couched in such general terms, that is not correct.
What is correct is that the strictness of the regulations varies within the EU and naturally also in the candidate countries.
But the problem lies not so much in the laws as in how those laws are enforced in certain countries, Romania for example.
On recital D: poor management of mining operations and disposal of mining waste is a global problem.
This, too - according to the people concerned, who feel offended by it - is not exactly true, because most firms in the SME category do not operate on a global scale.
Many large firms that are active worldwide are, on the contrary, pioneers when it comes to strict safety and environmental standards.
Viewed globally, in gold mining, for example, there are more problems with small, under-funded operations that are not in a position even to be properly aware of environmental concerns.
But there are also things that are expressly welcomed, for example the final sentence of point 8: 'Furthermore [Parliament] believes that the landfill of waste Directive does not constitute an appropriate framework for regulating mining waste and therefore urges the Commission to put forward a proposal for a specific Directive on mining waste.'
That can only be fully and entirely welcomed and underlined.
I believe the European mining industry is very much aware of its responsibilities and is therefore calling for a specific directive for mining waste.
There must, then, be adequate rules for waste, and environmental and technical standards must be laid down.
I believe we are all aware that the specific nature of mining is such that the Landfill Directive cannot be applied and would not bring about any improvement in the ecological and economic situation of mining companies.
I have taken the liberty, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, of tabling an amendment to paragraph 9.
This is concerned with extending the Seveso II Directive to also cover risks arising from storage and processing activities in metal ore mining.
I hope you will be able to agree to this amendment and I congratulate you once again on your report.
On behalf of my Group, I welcome the Commission' s report and the rapporteur' s report.
The incidents which precipitated the study and the subsequent reports in Spain and in Hungary have made us aware of the problems posed by mines and mine-workings, both old and new.
The potential problems - particularly the problems of water pollution - are cross-boundary problems and therefore worthy of European-wide legislation.
After consideration of existing legislation, be it on IPPC, landfill or Seveso, and in each case I have acted as the rapporteur at different stages of development of that legislation, it is clear that none of them can provide a comfortable solution to the range of problems presented by mining operations.
So I would concur with the rapporteur that a new piece of legislation - some kind of new initiative - is required to regulate the mining industry in particular.
I would raise two points with the rapporteur.
Firstly, old sites do not necessarily need to be cleaned up.
Many old sites are literally centuries old and have developed in such a way that they are now sites of scientific interest and contain particular flora and fauna.
I would urge that we should consider preserving sites and using sites in that way rather than simply clearing them off the face of the earth at great expense.
Secondly, I would say that classifying mining waste as waste is very difficult when you consider that large amounts of it are simply crushed rock and quite similar to products that you would get from any quarry in the Union.
Therefore I would say that we have to look more particularly at processed waste from mines which often contains high levels of toxic chemicals.
That does require regulation.
I would say that the amendment from the EPP Group is not particularly helpful, since it tries to reduce the scope of this directive to the mining of metal ores.
From my own experience, the first tailings dams I ever saw were in Derbyshire in the north of England, and they were the result of the mining of fluorospa, not a metal as any chemistry teacher will tell you.
But they present exactly the same problems as tailings dams resulting from mining operations.
I would recommend a positive vote tomorrow and, I hope, rapid action by the Commission to implement the recommendations.
I would like to say that our Group very much supports this report.
We think it is excellent.
The mining sector' s track-record leaves a lot to be desired, not just in Europe, but in eastern Europe and worldwide.
One of the very important things in this report is the need for a future directive on mining waste.
It should cover both operational and abandoned sites and disposal and contain provisions for mining waste action programmes as well as provisions to facilitate more sustainable extraction: site cleaning, waste reduction, and dry-tailing disposal in the case of metal mining waste.
Mining companies need to establish decommissioning plans for new and existing mines and tailing ponds.
I just have to look at it in my own country where mining companies have come in and basically taken what they want.
They then leave the mess behind to be cleaned up.
As Mr Bowe said, there may be "historical" mining sites of interest, but we are really talking about tailing ponds which contain many dangerous substances.
Local communities have to live with that and, in some areas, even farming has been affected because the mining companies leave their mess behind, affecting not just the water supplies but also the land in general.
We really have to take into account all sectors in the community.
The mining industry has got away with it for far too long.
We really need an extremely tight clampdown on how mining industries operate and a future directive on mining waste is extremely important.
I would just like to finish by saying that the report itself is excellent and I hope that it gets full support.
I would also like to confirm that our group would be reluctant to support the amendment proposed by the PPE Group for the reasons just mentioned by other speakers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening I am standing in for Margot WallstrÃ¶m on this topic because Mrs WallstrÃ¶m had to leave today for the international climate talks in Japan and Australia.
I think the Committee will be fully in agreement with Mrs WallstrÃ¶m representing the European side at this High Level Group because climate protection policy is one of our most pressing concerns.
I should like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the European Parliament and especially you, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, but also the committees involved, for your constructive cooperation and outstanding report.
The background to the Commission' s communication was the serious environmental damage caused by cyanide following the dam breaches in Spain in 1998 and in Baia Mare, Romania, in January 2000.
The communication mentions the three key actions planned by the Commission after the most recent mining accidents: first, amendment of the Seveso II Directive, then the presentation of the proposal for a new directive on the treatment of mining waste and, thirdly, the creation of a reference document on best available technologies following the procedure laid down in the IPPC Directive, with a description of the best available technologies for reducing everyday pollution and preventing or reducing mining accidents.
The Baia Mare Task Force' s final report reaffirmed the need for these measures.
It was Mrs WallstrÃ¶m who set up this Task Force to obtain more information about the Baia Mare accident and, on that basis, to devise measures to reduce or prevent such hazards in the future.
In their report they welcome this communication and support the Commission' s general approach of creating a transparent and coherent framework for greater safety in mining by making appropriate amendments to environmental law and the instruments.
This refers not only to the three key actions just mentioned but also to legislation that is not specific to mining, such as the proposed directive on environmental liability.
I should like to stress at this point that the three key actions mentioned now have different time frames.
The proposal for a directive amending the Seveso II Directive has already completed a public consultation and, according to the Commission' s work programme for 2001, is likely to be adopted in the course of this year.
The directive will not only cover mining but also, following the tragic accident in Enschede in the Netherlands in May last year, the safe storage of fireworks.
In the light of the amendment that is now before us and of what Mrs Flemming has said, I should like to add that both the mining accidents mentioned in the Commission communication occurred during activities connected with the extraction of metallic ores.
The Commission therefore understands the reasons for wanting to confine the scope of the directive to this field.
But I would ask you to consider that a gradual extension of the scope of the directive - when and only when accidents have happened - is not consistent with the precautionary principle.
Aristotle himself said the improbable will probably happen.
Even tomorrow, there could be an accident in an industrial plant not covered by the Seveso II Directive, in which case we would make corrections retrospectively and wait for the next area, so to speak.
I would therefore be pleased if Parliament would support the Commission in its efforts to be proactive rather than reactive in its proposed legislation.
A comment on the time frame for the second key action.
Work on the proposal for a new directive on the treatment of mining waste is progressing well.
The study of mining hot spots will soon be completed and consultation with the interest groups concerned has already begun.
The proposal will probably be adopted by the Commission in 2002.
Work on the document on best available technologies began with an opening session at the European IPPC Bureau at the end of June.
From past experience, however, producing such a detailed document describing the best available technologies takes two years on average.
Finally, the report calls on the Commission to intensify dialogue with the European mining industry.
This dialogue is already taking place. It will play a central role in implementing Community strategy for safety in mining.
Your support shows the Commission that we are on the right road.
The report motivates us to continue to work hard for a swift implementation of our strategy for the prevention of mining accidents in the European Union and also in the candidate countries.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Coastal zone management in Europe
Mr President, the principles of integrated coastal zone management are accepted worldwide as a mechanism to enable sustainable management of coastal areas.
Europe is currently well behind other developed nations in implementing them.
For instance, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all implemented major legislation to progress integrated management of coastal and marine areas.
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 commits coastal signatories to integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas.
The EU' s demonstration programme on integrated management of coastal zones, funded by LIFE, has proved that implementation of integrated coastal zone management results in both economic and environmental benefits.
The EU should be taking advantage of these benefits.
The coastal zone requires special management.
There is an urgent need to integrate planning and management and promote collaborative working of marine and terrestrial assistance at local, regional and national levels.
Through good practices of coastal zone management, we should work towards sustainable management of the coastal zone.
Europe should provide specific leadership to ensure good management of the coast.
This will only be possible if the integrated coastal zone management process is backed up with appropriate legislation.
The EU must establish a legal framework to enable action at other levels.
This recommendation should be seen as a first stage in the development of that framework.
I am astonished at some of the opposition to the idea of binding legislation because it is essential to secure adequate funding for integrated coastal zone management initiatives across Europe.
Integrated coastal zone management initiatives usually focus on a central coordinating mechanism which requires comparatively low levels of core funding.
Yet the integrated coastal zone initiatives already in existence are floundering, due mainly to lack of financial support.
For instance, the EU-funded integrated coastal zone management projects such as the Atlantic Living Coastline in the UK and others have since ceased.
The UK initiative and the Severn Estuary strategy, involving 12 local authorities, have only secured funding for the next six months.
Member States should adopt binding measures to ensure good coastal zone management.
This should happen not later than three years after the adoption of the current recommendation on integrated coastal zone management.
This would be preceded by a national stock-taking to analyse which actors, laws and institutions influence the planning and management of the coastal zone in order to ensure convergence of public bodies and local initiatives, to be completed by the end of December 2002.
In my own country, the Bantry Bay coastal zone chart is the only agreed integrated coastal zone management plan in the whole of the country at the present time.
Even in countries such as the UK, where the EU programmes have funded some of the most important coastal zone management and regeneration projects, local authorities are unable to give priority to funding integrated coastal zone management actions because of the absence of a national policy framework, statutory duties, responsibilities or adequate funding.
For this reason local authorities strongly support EU leadership to ensure cross-European commitment by national governments to give funding and legislative support in this field.
Some people have criticised me for saying that I want to give the EU more power in this area.
My colleague, Mr Davies - who is not here tonight - has criticised me in committee.
I was beginning to wonder if I was the Euro-sceptic or was he?
In relation to environmental protection, it is extremely important that the EU is given some sort of control.
In my own country the government failed to take recommendations and even directives seriously and implement them in a way that actually achieves their original aim.
A recommendation is basically non-binding.
So you will have the situation where Member States do not take seriously the management of a coast.
We cannot say that if we manage our own coasts, that is sufficient.
It has a knock-on effect in other areas, especially where there are shared coastlines.
It is completely unacceptable that some Member States have a very good integrated coastal zone management strategy and plans, whereas other countries do not.
That is completely unfair.
When it comes to environmental issues we need an international approach.
There is no point in trying to tackle it at only a national level.
As everyone knows, environmental issues cross all boundaries.
There is no such thing as national borders.
In this area we are not saying that we want to hand over total control to Europe but we need binding legislation.
Otherwise governments just ignore it.
Recommendations are just something that they comply with if it suits them, but not if they do not.
In relation to coastal zones it is extremely important.
Europe has experienced a great increase in pressures on coastal resources.
From 1960 to 1990 it has been estimated that one kilometre of unspoilt coastline has been developed every day and 30 hectares of dune habitat have disappeared every day.
Coastal populations have also further increased and, at present, about 50% of the EU' s population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast.
So there really is an urgent need to tackle coastal zone management.
The draft recommendation leaves out a very important issue in that it fails to identify the threatened biodiversity of our coastal zones.
The coastal zone is one of the most dynamic areas of the earth' s surface with an abundance of unique flora and fauna which need to be protected.
This has to be addressed.
Another issue is climate change.
We can no longer ignore threats from climate change on coastal erosion.
This has to be taken into account.
Everyone, at this stage, will recognise that climate change is having a major impact on our coastal areas.
In the interests of all industries that rely on the coast we have to take action, and take it now.
We can see the quick destruction of our coasts.
This involves the destruction of industries that rely on our coasts such as tourism, fishing industries and others.
It is important that something happens as a result of this recommendation, that there is some sort of legal framework.
Member States who are reluctant to do this do not want to face up to the fact that our coasts have to be protected.
They want to "cop-out" of their responsibilities.
This should not be allowed.
Mr President, integrated coastal zone management is a necessity, but unfortunately many still do not know what it is.
Be it the Irish Cliffs of Moher, the Algarve in Portugal or the Watt mud flats on the German coast, Europe' s coasts have tremendous economic, ecological, social and cultural importance.
Coasts are not conurbation areas, but nevertheless around one third of the EU population live in coastal regions today.
This presents dangers for the fragile ecosystems that coasts represent.
However, the socio-economic problems have grown too, because coastal regions are far removed from the heartbeat of the conurbations and are neglected by politics.
I need mention only the coastal regions' lack of infrastructure links.
So we must do something for the coasts in Europe.
In view of the growing problems, we urgently need to find a system of planning and management that includes everyone connected with the coasts.
We must create an integrated management to ensure sustainable development and preserve the coasts as habitat.
In Germany we have a saying: too many cooks spoil the broth.
I hear the voices of critics raising their fingers in warning and quoting this proverb.
But I say to them, the proverb may apply to broth but not to our coasts.
The problem areas differ a great deal, and a wide variety of sectors are affected, but the links between them are obvious.
Tourists come to my coast, for example, for the crabs.
The artificial deepening of rivers or the discharge of harmful substances threatens the stock of crabs.
No crabs, no tourists, no money!
And there are no alternative job opportunities, certainly not in the fisheries sector.
We are faced with wide-ranging problems that cannot be solved, at least not adequately, by the Member States alone.
What we need is a joining of forces on the coast, and clearly that will not happen without friction.
But it will benefit our environment in the long term.
We will not get very far or make much progress in Europe if we all keep ploughing our own furrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should almost like to say that the quality of our coastal zones here in Europe forms part of our heritage.
Although it is rather late in the evening to talk about coastal zone management in Europe, I believe that it is a subject of particular importance which really needs a legal framework.
Why a legal framework?
Quite simply because the development of our coastal zones is sometimes carried out in such a way as to cause the degradation of those zones, despite the fact that, as a fellow Member has pointed out, the habitat of the coastal zones is sometimes a long way away from the major centres of population.
This is not the case in every country, however.
I come from a country where there are major population centres alongside coastal zones, and those population centres have finally destroyed the quality of the coastal zones, resulting in numerous cases of degradation caused by human activity.
This degradation has very serious consequences for biodiversity, for the conservation of species, whether of fauna or of flora, serious consequences for the quality of the landscape, and very serious consequences for water quality.
On that point, we have the framework directive on water, the one on bathing water, and you know, especially at this time of the year when the tourists start to invade our beaches, how important the quality of bathing water is.
All this is very important, and it is also important for the quality of our fishery resources.
We are aware that it is necessary to have a real political will, on the part of all the countries of the European Union and within the candidate countries, because among those countries which will shortly be joining us within the European Union there are coastal countries and islands which are facing the same problems, the problems that arise between economic development and the protection of our coastal zones.
Economic development and protection are not actually opposed to one another, but there has to be a real desire to develop carefully, at the same time fully respecting the need to protect the landscape, biodiversity and so on.
This will certainly require a legal framework.
On that point I agree with other Members.
However, we must have a legal framework which respects the disparities between our countries, because the coasts of the Scandinavian countries do not have the same problems as those of the countries of southern Europe, whether that means France, Spain, Italy or Greece.
We must give a little more responsibility to local authorities and ask each State to set up a legal framework which is appropriate to the regional and local scale.
In France, a coastline conservation authority was set up 25 years ago.
It has resources to acquire coastal zones which have to be protected, and resources to ensure that, afterwards, land-use plans comply with legal regulations.
This is what we should be doing.
I believe that our coastal zones represent environmental and economic wealth which we absolutely must protect in the spirit of a sustainable development policy.
The issue of integrated coastal zone management is of crucial importance to my constituents in Scotland.
As the Commission highlights in its proposal, this is not just a local problem, but is of critical importance for all Europeans.
As Mrs Langenhagen said, one third of EU citizens live close to, if not on, these areas.
Research has revealed a worrying deterioration in the environmental, socio-economic and cultural resources of our coastal zones.
We see aggressive competition between users of these resources.
The environmental problems include habitat destruction, water contamination, coastal erosion and resource depletion and these are all very serious.
These environmental problems have a knock-on effect beyond coastal regions to inland regions.
The roots of the problem include a lack of knowledge, a failure to involve stake-holders and, therefore, a lack of cooperation between the relevant administrative bodies.
At a recent videoconference in Scotland House, that is the home of the Scottish Executive in Brussels, it was interesting to see how the different local authorities in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland were already working within local partnerships with stake-holders to protect the coastal zone.
It gave me great encouragement that action was being taken and that the coastal zone was being given the importance it rightly deserved.
It is, after all, at local level that a real difference will be made.
In conclusion, we need to encourage strong action at a local level which we are seeing already in Scotland, and we need to exchange best practice across the EU in order that our coastal zones can be enjoyed as much by this generation as by the next.
Mr President, in my country fisherwomen represent all that is strongest and most courageous.
I also think that this evening' s debate, once again involving almost exclusively women, shows that we who are taking part in this discussion may well be descended from these brave and strong women of the coasts.
Ladies and gentlemen, political movements which have long supported the very principles found in this document have been mocked in many contexts.
The movement which I represent nationally has long stood for the principles about which we are now speaking, but we have had to suffer a great deal of ridicule.
It is important that we support the binding recommendations that there is a wish to introduce for Member States, so that we can get away from a situation in which the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and in which fishermen are perhaps in even more danger of extinction than many animal species.
We have an unequal situation with unequal protection of what is to be found in the coastal areas.
We also have a situation whereby we want more sea traffic without wanting to provide protection.
The rapporteur asked why our group opposes a binding legal framework, but the explanations she has given have not convinced us.
We need a legal basis for the matter, but not binding legislation.
We must rely on local action and joint local planning.
Mr President, coastal management which is not only integrated but planned, both in Europe and in every continent, is one of the paramount necessities for the future of humanity.
It is impossible to deal with this issue within the narrow context of the existing Member States.
This is an area in which decisions could be necessary and legitimate at the level of a whole continent, or even of the entire planet.
However, this is also an area in which the European institutions have least power, although they are very fond of finicky regulations in other areas where centralisation is not required.
In this way they demonstrate that they do not represent an authority which imposes its will on national States, each with its particularisms and selfish interests, but rather that they are the result of those interests.
The European institutions, like the national States, are in the service of the private interests of the major industrial and financial groups.
They are incapable of imposing on those groups the policies which are of utmost importance to society as a whole, and there is a real risk that future generations will die as a result.
The solving of major ecological problems is totally incompatible with the private ownership of the major means of production and the use of those means with the exclusive aim of making a profit.
The cases involving the Erika and the Ievoli Sun were a good illustration of the extent to which private interests are opposed to collective interests.
In these circumstances, to vote in favour of a strategy for integrated coastal zone management would be pure hypocrisy.
We shall be abstaining from the vote.
Mr President, everyone agrees that it is necessary to protect natural areas in general and the coastline in particular, especially since our coasts are deteriorating as a result of demographic and economic expansion.
We have yet to decide how to provide this vital protection.
Will it respect local populations and their activities, or are we going to put nature in a glass case, as the Natural 2000 network intends to do?
It will, of course, be necessary to have rules and regulations in order to keep the situation under control and to avoid anarchic development.
In France we did this with our Coastlines Act, which has produced some good results, even if our Green Minister for the Environment, Mrs Voynet, has just allowed an exception to get through in the form of the Corsica Act.
However, these essential regional planning measures have to be the subject of debate with the elected representatives and citizens concerned, because they are the ones who have to live with the coastline on a day-to-day basis, and it is absolutely essential to involve them in this protection if we want it to be admired and respected.
Let us not forget that they are the ones who, when the Erika was shipwrecked, organised and took part in the operation to clean up the beaches and coastlines.
In my opinion, it is better to convince than to constrain.
That way we gain more support, and therefore more effectiveness and more local democracy.
Restrictions from Brussels are always suspect and often unsuitable, because they have been drafted far away from the local area and the local mentality.
This local approach is essential if we want to see common-sense measures negotiated and accepted.
We must also respect traditional local practices, because they express the economic, social and cultural reality. They are an integral part of the coastline, and are often the best guarantee that our natural areas will be respected.
In practical terms, we must apply the rules of subsidiarity and decentralisation, although consistency remains essential.
Responsibility for management should remain at national level and should include a large degree of local consensus.
This is why we shall be voting against this report, which we believe is too restrictive.
Mr President, as Mrs Stihler has already said, this proposal is of major importance for Scotland.
For example, there is one of our local authority areas that has 26 inhabited islands and a coastline as long as that of France.
Scotland, as a whole, has 462 different coastal plans in place, almost three quarters of them locally based.
Whilst management of coastal zones must remain predominantly local, national strategies to support and coordinate action are vital.
We are fortunate in having a Scottish coastal forum to perform this role.
But such good work can be undermined.
As the Firth of Clyde forum recently explained, we lack any measure of security, political or financial, which would give us a strong footing for pursuing longer-term management.
That is why the Commission proposal is so welcome.
I congratulate Mrs McKenna on the extent to which her report has amplified and clarified the text.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, as I have taken over the speech from my colleague, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, I will speak in English.
The coastal zone is very important for Europe, as other speakers have said.
Its resources provide us with food, energy and homes and create opportunities.
However, according to the reports of the European Environmental Agency, conditions in the coastal zone and its resources continue to decline.
Conditions in the coastal zone can only be improved through a concentrated effort involving all levels of the relevant sectors of government based on the principles of integrated coastal zone management.
I would like to stress that this integrated coastal zone management is not a procedure for land-use planning per se.
It is more a methodology for introducing a coherent approach to the management and use of coastal resources with the informed involvement of all the relevant stakeholders.
In order to encourage Member States to assume their full responsibility in promoting integrated coastal zone management, the Commission has introduced the proposed recommendation.
This calls on Member States to develop national strategies for coastal zone management based on an inventory of the actors, laws and institutions involved in the management and planning of the coastal zones.
This strategy aims to introduce a coherent approach to the coastal zones across Europe but the recommendation intentionally leaves the choice of the format of the national strategies to the Member States to ensure that each national strategy is tailor-made to the institutional, physical and social conditions within each Member State.
At the same time, the recommendation presents a list of features which the Member States are encouraged to address through their national strategies, such as the need for coherence between the many plans, policies and programmes for management of the coasts and the need for coordination between the actors that use and manage the coast, particularly those with responsibility for the sea and the land which forms part of the coastal zone.
Let me turn to the key issues raised in the amendments proposed.
I would like to start by noting that the Commission can accept many of the proposed amendments.
Indeed, many of the proposed amendments strengthen the text by clarifying concepts and introducing further information.
We thank Parliament for putting forward these amendments.
There are, however, certain amendments which the Commission cannot accept.
Several of the amendments proposed, namely Amendments Nos 11, 12, 16, 18, 29, 32, 43 and 49, introduce references to a future Community legislative framework.
These amendments are unacceptable to the Commission for the obvious reason that they prejudge the issue of whether a legislative approach is required.
In addition, a reference to a Community legislative framework would not be appropriate in view of the wide diversity of conditions in the Member States and the Commission' s philosophy of coastal zone management.
The Commission' s present decision to propose a recommendation was based on a thorough assessment of the needs for action at the European level through the demonstration programme on integrated coastal zone management and on a broad public consultation.
In the same spirit, the Commission cannot accept amendments which introduce compulsory language.
"Shall" is not the right word in a non-binding instrument, such as a recommendation and therefore the use of this word in Amendments Nos 29, 32 and 34 cannot be accepted by the Commission.
Similarly, the references in Amendments Nos 17, 20, 33 and 45 indicating the need for binding instruments within the Member States ignore the fact that integrated coastal zone management may be best introduced through voluntary measures in some Member States.
These parts of these amendments are therefore not acceptable either.
Otherwise, the six amendments are acceptable in principle or in part.
The Commission is concerned that Amendments Nos 16 and 42 might give an incorrect, narrow impression of the breadth of the integrated coastal zone management approach.
In particular, in Amendments Nos 25 and 47, while the Commission accepts the need to involve all the parties concerned, this text should not be limited to the special planning process, but should make broader reference to all of the actors involved in the planning and management of the coastal zones and its resources.
The Commission would also note that it cannot accept two amendments, which make inappropriate reference to other Community policies which are better discussed in a different context.
The reference to the INTERREG Programme in Amendment No 16 is inappropriate as the guidelines for INTERREG have been set out elsewhere.
Similarly, the reference in Amendment No 35 to the common fisheries policy and the 12-mile derogation is not acceptable as it prejudges the debate on the revision of this policy.
In addition, Amendments Nos 47 and 48 are not acceptable, at least in part, because they could lead to the endorsement of unsustainable traditional practices including those relating to hunting and fishing.
Concerning the remaining amendments - and this list is longer than the non-acceptable amendments - the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3 to 10, 13, 15, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 46; and in addition, it can accept Amendments Nos 2, 14, 24, 36, and 44 in principle.
As a result, two thirds of the amendments can be accepted by the Commission.
In conclusion, Parliament has significantly contributed to improving this proposal.
I would, therefore, like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and the draftsmen from the other committees for their efforts.
I am sure that the final text will be an important step in encouraging the application of integrated coastal zone management in Europe.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
Madam President, I saw a few boats landing at Parliament this week and notified the security service.
Not only were there language difficulties; the telephone line was so poor that it was almost impossible to communicate.
I would be most obliged if the number on which the security service can be reached could also be clearly displayed in the House, so that if anyone wants to report an incident, they can do so quickly and efficiently.
Mr RÃŒbig, we will be very happy to give you that number.
Since you raise the subject, I should tell you that we were faced with some very difficult incidents yesterday.
Demonstrators, they cannot be called visitors, caused a lot of problems.
I must say that our security service really reacted very rapidly and very efficiently, and that efficiency meant everything was soon under control.
I wanted to say that in this House.
Madam President, I understand that over the next few days, the Bureau will be discussing the question of languages and interpretation following the accession of the candidate countries.
Because, as you know, we are all a little touchy on this subject which is, above all, a political issue and cannot be resolved by purely administrative measures, I should like to ask you to tell us what the Bureau's thoughts are on this and how you think we can all take part in this debate, which is absolutely vital.
Mrs Zorba, the guidelines you refer to will be adopted by the Bureau in September and between now and then the groups will have plenty of time to discuss them.
I think it is very important that they should be able to do so.
Madam President, one comment perhaps, as the question of language has already been raised twice.
I should like to point out that the question of language is regulated in the Rules of Procedure, which state that Parliament itself makes the final decision on how languages are to be regulated in the House.
Any concerns - including about decisions by the Bureau - are therefore totally unfounded.
G8 Summit
The next item is the Commission statement on the G8 Summit.
I shall give Commissioner Patten the floor straight away.
Madam President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk about the G8 Summit.
At the suggestion of the Italian G8 Presidency the forthcoming summit in Genoa will focus on the one hand on global development issues, and on the other hand on some key related areas of concern such as the environment and food safety.
The Commission fully supports this focus for the summit.
Indeed, it is the G8 leaders' intention that Genoa should send a strong signal that the G8 countries are taking the concerns of their own citizens extremely seriously, as well as those of the developing world.
Following on from Okinawa last year, the G8 will be looking at development issues in a much more serious fashion.
From the Commission's point of view the summit needs to address the following key questions in this area. First, the fight against communicable diseases.
The European Union has taken a strong lead.
The action plan on fighting communicable diseases was adopted by the Council earlier this year.
Following Kofi Annan's call for the establishment of a global health fund, which was endorsed, I am pleased to say, by the UN General Assembly last week, it is expected that G8 members will provide their political and financial backing for the proposed fund.
Mr Annan's presence in Genoa to take part in an 'outreach' meeting between the G8 and other leaders will help to focus attention on the global health fund issue.
Many issues remain, and we must make sure that the fund's focus and management is in line with the objectives of the European Union action plan.
But a strong signal of European support in this area will be both natural and expected in Genoa.
Secondly, there is the issue of Third World debt.
The G8 took an early lead on the debt of the poorest countries - the HIPC initiative - and we should now seek to go further.
Mr Prodi and Prime Minister Verhofstadt will refer to the Council decision in May this year calling for the total alleviation of all remaining special loans granted to the least-developed countries under the first, second and third LomÃ© Conventions.
Thirdly, there is the question of market access for the least-developed countries.
We strongly support the efforts of the Italian G8 Presidency to broaden the debate on poverty reduction beyond debt relief.
In particular, the links between poverty reduction and trade should be highlighted.
In this context the 'everything but arms' initiative will of course be mentioned, and the Commission will insist that other G8 members should follow suit by providing duty-free and quota-free access for all products originating from the least-developed countries.
Turning now to the environment, G8 leaders will have a discussion on climate change.
This will be President Bush's first G8 summit.
The Commission will be keen, as will no doubt the other European participants, to discuss our concerns about the United States' present stance on climate change and on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
We will work to ensure that the communiquÃ© makes a clear reference to the scientific evidence to back up the urgency of international measures to mitigate climate change.
We, for our part, will reiterate our determination to press ahead with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, and our hope that the reconvened 6th Conference of the Parties to the climate change convention, scheduled for Bonn, can find a means which allows the United States to stick with the process.
As regards food safety, the Commission is keen that the G8 conclusions include a reference to the precautionary principle.
We remain committed to making systems responsive to the growing public awareness of food safety issues, the potential risks associated with food and the accelerating pace of change of developments in biotechnology.
These are not the only issues on the agenda of the three-day meeting.
Beyond the principal themes of development, environment and food safety, there will be a discussion on regional issues focusing on the Middle East and the Balkans, as well as on conflicts in Africa.
Those subjects will be discussed by the Foreign Ministers' meeting, at which I will be present just before the main leaders meeting.
As usual the G8 summit will also be preceded by a G7 session, that is, without Russia, where the main topics of discussion will be the world economy, including oil prices and financial architecture.
Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan will announce his plan for structural reforms in the run-up to the elections in his country.
Leaders will also discuss trade with the aim of sending a clear unambiguous message on the launch of a new round at the fourth WTO ministerial meeting in Dohar in November.
