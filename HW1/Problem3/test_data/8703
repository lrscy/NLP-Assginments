For instance, for data collected concerning a flight between Boston and London Gatwick, the United Kingdom authority would be the competent authority, whilst for data collected on a flight between Boston and Amsterdam, the Dutch authorities would be responsible.
As I said at the outset, I have not enough material to give a more comprehensive answer to the Member.
I am sure the Member will understand that, within the range of material I have, this is as comprehensive as I can be.
Â Â  Of course, I understand that the Council has not had the opportunity to obtain information.
I must, however, also point out to the Council that there was plenty of time to obtain it.
We are, in fact, talking about disclosure procedures, that is to say about access to documents and about procedures that make these documents public.
We have provided you with all the details of the documents in question, and it seems to me very strange that there was no time to read them.
It is, for example, very clear from these documents that, as we know, Northwest has a cooperation agreement with KLM and that there is therefore a huge overlap between airline reservation databases, including those relating to air traffic internal to the European Union.
You said that the issue is the Commissionâs responsibility.
This is not the truth, because the international agreements are commissioned by the Council; it is the Council that gave the European Commission the mandate to determine adequacy finding of privacy protection in the United States.
Political responsibility therefore falls to the Council.
Is the Council therefore considering including this point in the current negotiations or is it of a different opinion?
Â Â  . â I would draw the Member's attention to the fact that it is not an issue of time, it is more an issue of competence.
The competent authorities in this particular case, as I said in my main response, are the privacy authorities in the individual Member States.
The competence lies at national authority level, not at this level.
Â Â  Mr President, I am utterly amazed at the President-in-Office's answer.
At the moment, the Council is discussing a European agreement with the United States, whereby the Article 31 Committee, which is competent in this area, has given, or as good as given, the green light on behalf of the Council, to the conclusion of an agreement with the United States.
The annex to this agreement also refers to CAPS II (Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-screening System II).
It is therefore highly unlikely that the Council is unaware of what is going on, and Mr Cappato's question is in my view very plain: he has asked whether this is not a case of illegality and of violation of our regulations.
The Council cannot say that this is a matter for the data protection authorities alone, which have themselves indicated that this is illegal.
Action is indeed needed.
The Council is right to say that this should be done at national level, but it too has a task to perform here.
The Council has, to some extent, passed this task on to the European Commission, being apparently unfamiliar with the facts involved, and â what is worse â has not informed the national parliaments.
I therefore ask the Council to ensure that this is still done.
Â Â  . â The supplementary question touches on the issue of the transfer of name records.
The general question of the transfer to the US authorities of name records for transatlantic flights is of great concern to the Council.
We are not questioning either the concerns of the Members or particularly the concerns that Mr Cappato outlined in his original point.
This matter is the subject of ongoing discussions and negotiations with the United States.
Following the unilateral introduction last year of a US requirement on European airlines to provide passenger name records on flights into the US, the European Union has been working to establish a legally secured framework for passenger name record transfers to US customs and to border protection bureaux.
Every effort is being made in the current negotiations to enhance the legally binding nature of the undertaking so as to protect the privacy of European passenger data, which is the point made in the supplementary question.
However, this is not simply an EU-US issue, as it is fully expected that passenger name record transfers will also be required by a number of other countries in the near future in order to enhance passenger security in general.
The European Union is therefore pursing a global approach with regard to the transfer of such data for border and aviation security purposes.
This is largely an initiative to create a multilateral framework for passenger name record data transfers under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
It is proposed that any arrangement agreed with the US will be of an interim nature and will in due course be confirmed by international agreements.
As regards the proposed EU-US international agreement on the transfer of name records, I would specifically mention that, as honourable Members will be aware, negotiations are still ongoing between the Commission â and it is the Commission that is handling those negotiations â and the US authorities.
Once negotiations have been concluded this agreement will be submitted and it will be considered by this Parliament.
Â Â  I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mr Cappato.
The Council is wrong in trying to say this is the Commission's responsibility.
It was quite clear yesterday in relation to another issue, Guantanamo, when Commissioner Patten said 'We cannot do anything without the Council'.
Mr Cappato asks, 'When will the Council raise this issue with the competent US authorities?'
The Council is trying to wriggle out of its duty here.
It is not just an issue for the Commission, it is an issue for the Council.
Surely it can be raised at the forthcoming EU-US summit and also during the ongoing negotiations in relation to this issue.
It is completely unacceptable that European citizens and their rights to privacy are not being protected.
That is a responsibility for the Council.
The Council should at least answer that part of the question.
Â Â  . â The Council has answered that part of the question.
I would draw Ms McKenna's attention specifically to the points I made with regard to the competence of national authorities â in the case of the United Kingdom and in the case of the Dutch authorities â in the area of data protection.
The Member is also wrong when she chooses to ignore the reality that the Commission is conducting negotiations with the US authorities.
It is misrepresenting the role of the Council to suggest that it is a Council function.
It is not, as the Member well knows.
Â Â  . â I should like to thank the Member for putting that question.
The Council has duly taken note of the European Parliament's resolution on the arms embargo on China.
We will consider it, together with other elements in the ongoing examination of this topic.
On 26 January the General Affairs and External Relations Council, in line with the invitation from the European Council of 12 December 2003, invited Coreper and the Political Security Committee to look into this matter.
The Council would like to stress once more that it has not set any specific date for decisions regarding the arms embargo on China.
There seems to be some idea that a date has been set.
There has not.
The current rules for transparency will apply to the decision.
Â Â  I thought the Council was going to say again that this is not its responsibility.
I still totally disagree with the Council's position on the last question.
In relation to China I would hope that the Council would take a position which reflects the position of Parliament: the only democratically-elected institution within the European Union.
Clearly there is a major problem with the lifting of the arms embargo on China, particularly in the light of what has happened in recent years.
I would hope that the Council will take this issue very seriously and not give in to pressure, despite the fact that there may be some countries in the European Union that would wish to do so.
I hope that the Council will not give in to this.
The arms embargo should remain in place until we can see a justification for lifting it.
I do not think there will be a justification, because arms embargoes are a good idea on all countries internationally.
Â Â  . â I am aware of Ms McKenna's views on arms embargoes, which are not a million miles away from my own.
The Council has taken account of the European Parliament's resolution and will continue to do so.
Â Â  . â This is a very serious matter.
With regard to trafficking in human beings, the Council would like to refer to its reply to Oral Question H-0575/03.
As already pointed out in that reply, the comprehensive issue of trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed both at national and international level and needs to be dealt with within a broader context, which involves criminal law, asylum, immigration policies and preventative measures.
A general agreement has been reached in the Council on a proposal for a Council directive on the residence permits issued to third-country nationals who have been victims of trafficking and who cooperate with the competent authorities.
The purpose of the proposal is to offer victims who are willing to cooperate in proceedings against traffickers the possibility to remain in Member States for the duration of those proceedings and to obtain other benefits to assist them in escaping from the influence of the traffickers and returning to a normal life.
Such other benefits may include, for example, access to employment, vocational training and education and other special programmes.
This instrument, when adopted, will have an important role in the fight against traffickers.
Formal adoption will be possible when Parliament has delivered its opinion.
In addition to the framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings, which was adopted on 19Â July 2002, the Council adopted a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography on 22 December 2003.
As far as border controls are concerned, the Council recalls that in 2002 two plans were submitted which contained a series of measures designed to achieve a higher level of security at the external borders and to combat trafficking in human beings.
The first is a comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, which was approved by the Council in February 2002.
The second was the plan for the management of external borders of the Member States of the European Union, which was approved by the Council on 13 June 2002.
Both plans contain short- and long-term measures aimed at creating integrated border management.
Since 2002, various pilot projects and joint operations have been launched at the external borders.
A network of Member State liaison officers has been created; a common risk analysis model and a common core curriculum for border guard training has been established.
They are very welcome measures.
Various ad hoc centres were set up or are in the process of being established by Member States, each of which focuses on a specific type of border, for example an air-border centre, a land-border centre, or a sea-border centre.
Furthermore, a centre for ad hoc border guard training and a risk analysis centre are also being set up.
Â Â  â Mr President, obliged though I am for that exhaustive answer, my question had to do with the EUâs present borders with the candidate countries, with their future eastern borders with the states of the CIS, and more specifically with the programmes that are meant to keep in check the prostitution that is prevalent there.
What is currently going on in the area where the Czech Republic borders on Bavaria is this: most of the victims and many of the culprits are from further to the east, that is, from Russia and Romania, states that are not yet due to join us.
The scene of the crime is generally in the Czech Republic, which is an accession country, and the customers, those who spend the money, are, lamentably enough, mainly from the present EU â from Germany, in fact, so this is a cross-border problem.
What I am specifically interested in is what is being done in the border regions to sort out the great deal of prostitution that is going on there.
Â Â  . â I understand the Member's concerns.
This is a particularly pernicious and dreadful trade.
Someone said earlier that it is the 21st century equivalent of slavery.
It is something that belongs to the dark ages and I believe that every civilised human being would rightly criticise what is happening.
I mentioned a number of events and the response I gave was comprehensive.
Other joint operations are planned and will be carried out in the near future at land, sea and air borders in Member States and the accession countries â which is the concern raised by the speaker.
Furthermore, the Council is awarding special attention to the setting-up of a European agency for the management of cooperation at external borders, which will integrate ad hoc centres into an institutional framework within the Community.
That would be very much in line with the Member's thinking.
On 27 November 2003, for example, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted a conclusion on the main elements of this agency.
It was agreed that this agency would, inter alia, coordinate the operational cooperation between Member States in the management of their external borders, assist Member States in the training of border guards, carry out the type of risk analysis that I have already mentioned, and assist Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical cooperation at borders.
I hope that this answers the Member's question.
One of the extraordinary things about this particular pernicious trade is that its perpetrators have been extremely astute in the manner in which they have managed to smuggle their victims.
The framework decision on combating the exploitation of children and child pornography relates to this whole area.
It was adopted on 22 December 2003 and requires each Member State to take the necessary measures to ensure that all conduct relating to child pornography and child exploitation at an international scale is fully punishable.
As I said, this is a pernicious trade carried out by ruthless people.
It is the 21st century equivalent of slavery.
However, any fair, objective analysis would suggest that the Union is addressing the issue on a significant number of fronts.
Â Â  Notwithstanding MrÂ Posselt's angle on this question, and the Council's response â neither of which I disagree withÂ â would the President-in-Office agree that, sadly, forced prostitution, child prostitution and trafficking in human beings are all also consequences of and an inevitable feature of poverty-ridden states which lack better economic opportunities.
Whether we like it or not, it is true.
The parallel that the Minister makes as a 21st century equivalent of slavery may be true on one hand, but there is also another angle on it.
Does the Council consider that much greater investment in and economic support and assistance for these countries bordering the new external frontiers of the European Union â and in the Balkans â will be essential when we have enlarged the European Union?
President-in-Office, what action do you personally feel would be a good idea for either the Irish presidency or any future presidencies to take?
Â Â  . â When you address the issue of the specific measures that I have mentioned, you are addressing the symptom and not the cause.
The cause, of course, is poverty, criminality and a breakdown in civil society.
The cause is also the extraordinary transition that countries go through when one system that seemed secure has diminished and another is being put in place.
You are right, Mr Evans: if you look at all the Union policies in the broad sense, that is exactly the approach that the Union is adopting.
It is adopting a holistic approach.
In the Balkans, which you mentioned, there is a very specific Union policy, which is well-informed and well-focused.
It gives people, particularly Member States and their governments, the prospect of closer union with the European Union and indicates very clearly that we have certain standards that they have to set.
So on the one hand we are encouraging them and on the other hand we are discouraging certain actions.
We are taking a holistic approach.
I agree with Mr Evans.
Â Â  â I should like to thank Mr Roche of the Irish Presidency for his frankness in saying that this is our eraâs equivalent of slavery.
It is, in fact, in the rich world of Western Europe that despicable men exploit women and children.
This is not something that is purely related to poverty.
It is here in rich Western Europe within the EU that they are degraded.
My question relates to the following.
Is the Irish Presidency prepared to prioritise the fight against trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children and women so that this question of decency is elevated to its rightful position as the most important of all issues of civilisation relating to Europeâs respectability?
My second question is whether the Irish Presidency is prepared to strengthen European police cooperation and to engage Europol and Eurojust in this necessary fight for respectability in Europe and for human dignity.
Â Â  . â I should like to thank MrÂ SacrÃ©deus for his comments.
The points that he mentioned were touched on in my original response and fleshed out in the supplementaries.
This is an issue that requires a very wide range of responses.
I take issue with Mr SacrÃ©deus at only one stage: unfortunately, the women and the children who are the victims in this particular case are exploited from birth.
They are exploited because of the conditions that exist in their states.
They are also exploited by being exported like products to the rich West.
It is something that all countries have to take responsibility for.
I am proud of the work that the European Union is doing in this regard because it is a model for the rest of the world â I have no point of disagreement with Mr SacrÃ©deus on that.
Â Â  . â I should like to thank MrsÂ Morgantini.
The Council is fully aware of the restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities on entry to the occupied territories as described by Mrs Morgantini.
In a recent joint report requested by the Council of the European Union, heads of mission in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Ramallah confirmed these restrictions, which have been progressively identified and which have a considerable impact on the freedom of movement of European Union citizens, representatives of churches, journalists, NGOs and even European Union officials and diplomatic staff.
Their application on the ground often appears to be unclear and disproportionate.
The European Union and its Member States closely coordinate their approaches to these issues.
They raise the problems of access to the Palestinian territories in their regular dialogue with the Israeli government officials.
Moreover, the European Union plays a leading role in the task force on project implementation established by the international community to deal with problems of access for development assistance workers.
Â Â  I see that the results that have come out of this survey also confirm what I claimed: among them, the fact that whenever foreign citizens travel to Israel to get to PalestineÂ âÂ because the Palestinians do not have any borders that they monitorÂ âÂ they are constantly subject to this procedure, and we ourselves have experienced obstacles to movement.
There is another issue, over and above our freedom of movement, that I believe the Council must take into consideration, that is to say Palestinian sovereignty.
In the current situation, not only can Palestinians no longer receive voluntary workers, officials or citizens but, in effect, they are also prisonersÂ âÂ partly due to what is currently happening with the WallÂ âÂ within Palestine.
Therefore, the Oslo agreement, which instead provides for autonomous Palestinian areas, is being rendered totally ineffective by Israel when the latter restricts the movement of foreign citizens too.
I therefore believe that the Council should consider this aspect too and, above all, take specific action to stop Israel preventing freedom of movement, partly because, as things are, we can also respond in kind.
If we have problems entering Israel, then perhaps Israeli citizens could also have problems entering Europe.
Â Â  . â The point I made earlier is that the Council and the European Union continue to monitor the situation in the region.
We have continuously highlighted our concerns and I am not at all convinced that some form of reciprocal action would actually be helpful.
The Israeli authorities know that we consider the actions they are taking to be regrettable.
The European Union and both the political and official contacts in the region have been very clear.
I am not certain, however, that reciprocation would be either helpful or fruitful.
The Member can be absolutely assured that the Irish presidency has devoted a great deal of time and attention to this issue.
We do not wish to do anything that would further inflame the situation in an already difficult part of the world.
As you know, Minister Cowen has visited the region.
The authorities there are fully aware of our concerns and they are fully aware of the concerns of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to pose a supplementary question to the minister.
Do you consider that it might be difficult to maintain full freedom of movement bearing in mind the situation that prevails in the Middle East, Israel and Palestine and the terrorist attacks that Israel is subjected to?
Can you agree with the political assessment that it might be difficult for Israel to maintain freedom of movement bearing in mind the fact that the country also has a right to protect itself against terrorist attacks?
Â Â  . â I said in a previous reply that one must understand both sides in this difficult situation.
I said that it would be foolhardy to suggest that circumstances do anything other than contribute to the situation.
Mrs Morgantini's specific question referred to the impact.
I said in a previous reply that what we all aspire to in the Middle East is a situation where the Palestinian and Israeli peoples can live side by side in peace and respect each other's cultural positions â a situation where young Palestinian men and women do not aspire to becoming suicide bombers and where young Israeli women and men do not have to consider going into the army or the dangers of being blown up on their streets.
The Council is, of course, fully aware not only of the history that lies behind the Israeli State, but also of the horrors that lie behind the type of suicide bombing seen there.
Nothing I have said should be taken â and I am sure this was not the Member's intention â as in any way detracting from the horrors of daily life in that region.
Â Â  I completely concur with what you have just said, President-in-Office.
I would like to bring to your attention a delegation that has gone from this House to look at the construction known colloquially as 'the wall'.
I did not go myself, but I have had very shocking reports of it from fellow Members of this House.
I attended a meeting this afternoon with some Israeli citizens talking about their aspirations for peace.
At that meeting a proposal was made that a delegation should go from this House, not to Israel again or the Palestinian territories, but to Dublin to ask the Irish presidency what can be done urgently in the way of conflict resolution.
If such a delegation were to come from this House, would the presidency receive it affirmatively?
Â Â  . â As Ms Ahern knows, any delegation of which she is a member would be met with an open door.
She is quite right that this is a very serious issue.
To refer to the earlier supplementary question, we have, for example, consistently condemned suicide bombings, which are part of this spiral of violence. Suicide bombings play no legitimate part in any agenda.
With regard to the wall, separation, barrier or fence â whatever euphemism one would wish to use â the Union has expressed its concern.
It has particularly expressed its concern that the route envisaged for the wall has in a number of places departed significantly from the green line.
I cannot use stronger words that those I used on a previous occasion: this is not the way to create peace. Separating people never works.
At the end of the day we know that it is dialogue that works.
When people get together and have a dialogue they can resolve their differences.
Â Â  . â Article 314 of the EC Treaty and Regulation No 1/58 determine respectively the authentic language versions of the Treaty and the official languages and working languages of the EU institutions.
Regulation No 1/58 is based on Article 290 of the EC Treaty which states: 'The rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the rules of procedure of the Court of Justice, be determined by the Council, acting unanimously.'
Historically, these provisions, which came under primary law as regards Article 2 and 4 of the Treaty and under secondary law as regards Regulation No 1/58, have been adopted only on the occasion of accessions, by means of successive accession treaties.
Thus, Article 61 of the Athens Accession Treaty provides for the translation into the new languages of the text of the original treaties and of the Treaties amending or supplementing them.
These translations are annexed to the Act of Accession and are authentic under the same considerations as the original texts of the Treaties.
In other words, after accession the Treaties will have to be interpreted on the basis of the text existing in twenty-one languages and not just in the four original languages.
Regulation No 1/58, as most recently amended by the Treaty of Athens, brings to twenty the number of official languages and working languages of the EU institutions.
On the accession of Ireland to the Community, the original Treaties were translated into Irish.
The Irish language version is an authentic version of these Treaties.
Although Irish has not been added to the list of official languages and working languages of the institutions, each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the eleven other working languages.
The texts in Irish are equally authentic and have equal status with those in all the other languages.
I might add in my capacity as a Member of the Irish Parliament, and more precisely in my capacity as an Irish citizen, that the honourable Member will be aware that a public debate is taking place in Ireland as to whether or not the Irish language should be recognised as an official working and official language of the European Union.
The Irish government has established a working group that is analysing the options available for further strengthening and enhancing the status of the Irish language within the European Union.
That working group is examining a range of issues with a view to identifying additional opportunities in this regard.
I thank the Member for the question.
Â Â  Mr President, is it in order for me to put a supplementary question to the President-in-Office following the questions raised by Ms Ahern and Mrs Morgantini?
Â Â  Mr Beazley, I have applied the Rules of the House that allow for two speakers, of different groups, in addition to the Member formulating the question.
I have followed the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  I know that.
I am not aware that Ms Ahern or Mrs Morgantini are members of the PPE-DE Group.
Â Â  They belong to different groups.
Â Â  So I may not put a question to the President-in-Office?
Â Â  I am sorry, Mr Beazley.
You can be sure that I am following the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  .
I thank the President-in-Office for his answer.
I would also like to ask a supplementary question.
Would he agree that there are already an increasing number of Irish people who speak the language and that the number of people being educated through Gaeilge in Ireland has increased dramatically, particularly over the last 20 years?
Would he agree that the European Union, as well as the institutions within the European Union, should encourage and support this development and also that these further developments would strengthen the case for the Irish language to become a working language of the European Union and the institutions of the European Union?
Â Â  . â â thank you very much Brian.
I agree wholeheartedly with the opening point.
The extraordinary thing that has happened in the last 30 years has been the explosion of interest in a language that 30 years ago looked as if it was threatened.
One of the arguments made 30 years ago was that minority languages would be crushed and in particular the Irish language would disappear in the European Union.
That has not happened.
Mr Crowley is absolutely correct when he says that one of the extraordinary features has been the explosion of interest in the education sector in the Irish language.
The most rapidly growing part of education in Ireland is the Gaelscoileanna, the all-Irish schools at first and second level.
He is correct in that.
The Irish Government welcomes that.
We always said that the European Union would not bring about the end of our language; our cultural identity is stronger now than it ever was.
The language has been accorded a quite distinct status within the Union since Ireland joined in 1973.
The Treaty status of the language was agreed in 1973 and that right was re-established in the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice.
It is also set out fully in the new Treaty; there is a little additional progress there.
In practice, a number of positive steps have been taken by the Union in relation to the Irish language, for example, the Treaty of Amsterdam confirmed the right of citizens of the Union to correspond with any institutions in any of the Treaty languages, including Irish.
If my memory serves me correctly, ArticleÂ 42 in the new Treaty makes a specific cross-reference to that.
I regard such steps as clearly beneficial moves towards the Irish language.
They reflect the sort of constructive measures that can have a meaningful impact on the citizens' relationship with the Union and its institutions.
In short, they are practical measures that make a difference.
Irish is the only language other than those specified in Council Regulation No 1 of 1958 to which these rights apply.
Additionally, Lingua, the Union's programme for the promotion of language teaching and learning recognises the Irish language for its purposes.
As I pointed out in my answer, the government of Ireland has set up a working group to establish what further steps can be taken.
It is not, as some people believe, simply a matter of knocking on the door, .
We are engaged in the matter; I am aware of the debate; it is a debate in which I take an interest.
Indeed, as someone who comes from the Gaeltacht part of Ireland, I â like Mr Crowley â take a passionate interest in it.
Â Â  President, as a former British European Commissioner once said: 'I hesitate to intervene'.
I understand your ruling and respect that you are following the Rules of Procedure of this House.
Formally, the Rules of Procedure permit elected Members present to put supplementary questions to the President-in-Office of the Council.
May I put a question about the Cornish language to the President-in-Office of the Council?
Â Â  Yes, Mr Beazley, but after Mr Paisley, who had requested the floor first.
Â Â  I should like to ask the President-in-Office a question in relation to this important issue that is before us today: would he look also at the Scotch-Irish language in Northern Ireland?
As with the Irish language, there has been a great interest in it and more people are speaking Scotch-Irish today than have spoken it for many years.
However, in Northern Ireland there is a feeling that neither the United Kingdom Government nor the European Union are looking at it favourably, as compared with other languages.
I would ask the President-in-Office to undertake to look into this matter of the Scotch-Irish language and see to it that the principle of equality be implemented with regard to this language, along with all the other languages of the European Union, so that they can all stand on a level playing field.
Â Â  . â In answer, Dr Paisley, I am of course aware of the extraordinary and unique work that has been done on the Scotch-Irish language.
I am aware of the board, and in fact I receive correspondence regularly from the board; it is a great joy to receive a Christmas card in the language from the board.
The lesser-used languages â whether we are talking about the language of Ulster or, for example, the Cornish language â are a matter which has concerned the Union.
However, support for the languages is not purely a matter for the Presidency-in-Office.
In the case of the Irish language a specific and unique measure was made in 1973.
Maybe it should have been made for the other lesser-used languages that have been mentioned here.
To answer Dr Paisley directly, I am aware of the blossoming of interest in a language which had one stage virtually disappeared.
Â Â  I should like to put a question to the President-in-Office that has been already answered in part.
I support the drift of the question from Mr Paisley that all minority languages should be given equality of esteem.
The Breton language exists in Brittany.
I had the honour of representing Cornwall and Plymouth in this House for ten years.
Speaking as an Englishman, I find it sad that the Cornish language died out in the 18th century.
It may not be within your, power, President-in-Office, to fully answer Mr Paisley's question, but I support what you said about the importance of the Irish language.
Could you reconfirm that you would give equal weight to other minority languages â by which I mean cultures â throughout the whole of the European Union, including the ten new Member States?
Â Â  . â I would ask the honourable Member not to trespass on my concerns about minority languages.
As it turns out the part of Ireland in which I was born is very close to Cornwall.
In fact, in parts of Wexford, where I was born, there was a minority language that borrowed very heavily on the Cornish language.
The Union should have a concern and a generous policy for the lesser-used languages, because they are part of the extraordinary cultural diversity of the European Union.
I do not want to say that the Irish language is in a special category.
For me, it is in a special category, but legally it has a status that is rather different to some of the other lesser-used languages.
However, I take the point that you made.
Do not trespass on my concerns, because I have a concern on this and on the issue of the Scotch-Ulster language and the extraordinary revival of this language.
Perhaps I have said more than I should as President-in-Office.
Â Â  . â Mrs Ahern has raised a very serious question.
The recent revelations about the secret network illicitly trading in highly sensitive nuclear equipment and technology organised by the former Pakistani chief scientist, Abul Qadeer Khan, are of very serious concern.
During the recent European Union ministerial troika to Islamabad, these concerns were raised at the highest level with Pakistan and we were assured that new controls have been put in place in order to prevent proliferation.
As far as the European Union is concerned, exports of sensitive equipment and technology are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000.
With regard to the export of weapons-usable materials â for example plutonium and highly enriched uranium â from the European Union, this can only be authorised in accordance with the above-mentioned regulation, as well as other relevant international rules and practices governing such exports.
Furthermore, all nuclear material within the European Union â as long as it remains in the civilian nuclear fuel cycle â is safeguarded by the nuclear inspection services of the Commission and, where the material is to be transferred outside the European Union, by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In the case of export to third countries, the IAEA will also apply safeguards to the third country and will, inter alia, verify the declaration on quantity and composition made before the shipment of any material.
In the specific case of Pakistan, the issue raised by the Member, there is an additional consideration.
Unlike all European Union Member States, Pakistan is not a party to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and does not have a full-scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The principles and the objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and the disarmament agreed at the 1995 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference state that full-scope safeguards should be a necessary precondition for transfers of source and special fissionable material or specially designed material thereof.
The nuclear suppliers group and the export control regime in which all EU Member States participate designates full-scope safeguards as a condition of supply for sensitive nuclear and related technology.
It follows that no Member State should authorise the export of nuclear material in any form to Pakistan.
The Council is committed to continuing to strengthen export control policies and practices in cooperation with our partners in various export control regimes and in other third countries.
This is reflected in the EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the last European Council meeting in December in Brussels.
Â Â  I accept that the presidency views this as a serious problem.
However, all of us, and the EU institutions in particular, need to recognise that the plutonium being sent across the seas to Japan from both Sellafield in the UK and La Hague in France is directly usable in nuclear explosive devices.
If terrorists were to get hold of this material we would be facing devastation.
We have already had the example of 11 September.
This trade undermines all attempts to halt proliferation, and I would draw the presidency's attention to a statement made in Washington by President George W.Â Bush on February 11, when he said that reprocessing is unnecessary for civil nuclear energy programmes.
The tenor of his remarks is to condemn reprocessing as a sinister activity.
We need to get a grip on proliferation, and in this context the trade in nuclear technology undertaken by the EU is similar to the trade in heroin in that it is equally lethal.
I urge the presidency to take the lead in strengthening the European Union's non-proliferation credentials by pressing the UK and France to stop this commerce in plutonium, which was not named after Pluto the God of the Underworld for nothing.
Â Â  . â I know full well the passionate concern of the Member on this particular issue.
She is quite right when she says it was not named by accident: perhaps it was a happy accident that it was named after the God of the Underworld.
The issue raised in the first part of the question is absolutely terrifying.
Since that report became available, there have been further reports of people travelling with caesium in the boot of the car.
These reports, and their implications, are terrifying. They are, if anything, more horrific than heroin.
The Community is engaged in the issue; we have made the concerns of the Community known to the Pakistani authorities.
I take the point Ms Ahern made in her supplementary about matters nearer to home, but it is not up to me to provide a definitive solution.
The general point about non-proliferation is that the strengthening of the Non-proliferation Treaty is obviously the way to go and that is the way that civilised countries will go.
Since September 11 we have a different view on security, and we should all be very conscious of the implications in this particular area.
Â Â  As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 9 to 26 will be replied to in writing (1).
That concludes Question Time to the Council.
(2)
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0064/2004) by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on a common position of the Council adopted with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning protection against subsidisation and unfair pricing practices causing injury to Community air carriers in the supply of air services from countries not members of the European Community (rapporteur: Nicholas Clegg)
- Report (A5-0061/2004) by Jan Dhaene, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security
and
- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0088/2004) by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators (rapporteur: James Nicholson).
Â Â  . Mr President, let me melodramatically apologise in advance.
For some reason a nasty virus has descended upon me in the last three quarters of an hour so if I do not make a great deal of sense and if I leave early I hope the reasons are at least forgivable.
I would like to summarise where I see this legislation has improved or changed for the better during our deliberations.
In a sense the proposal from the Commission had quite a faltering and uncertain start.
I was struck as rapporteur by how weak the apparent support from a number of European airlines was for this measure.
They expressed a fear, which I certainly shared at the beginning of the discussions, that the instrument being proposed and discussed here could, if mishandled, be a pretext for protectionist behaviour rather than, as is intended, a targeted instrument to deter unfair pricing and excessive use of subsidies elsewhere.
The original draft was a little too open-ended.
It rather bluntly stated that the European Union would have the power to extend for the first time anti-dumping disciplines from the trade in goods to the trade in services, without a great deal of detail about how that would take place.
Our efforts in Parliament during the first reading in particular have been to fill in some of the gaps, to make it a more usable and credible instrument, rather than a sort of blunderbuss threat which might arguably have been too crude to use at all.
To that end we are all pleased that the Council has adopted some of the amendments we tabled at first reading, notably, and probably most importantly, those specifying in the legislation itself that the Commission must develop a detailed methodology by which dumped, unfair prices are calculated so that there is a coherent and credible methodology to distinguish dumped prices from normal pricing.
I am very pleased the Council has adopted that.
I am very grateful to the Commissioner and the Commission for accepting those amendments too.
As rapporteur, I would have liked both the Council and the Commission to move a little further towards our position as adopted at first reading.
I remain a little concerned that there is no caveat in the legislation to the effect that this instrument should only be used if significant material injury is inflicted upon European Union aircraft carriers.
There is a theoretical, potential danger that this instrument will be used to pursue frivolous or insignificant cases.
This instrument needs to be used sparingly and I would have preferred to have seen greater adoption of our wording, which targeted it at the really important cases.
Having said that, I accepted the wisdom of my wiser colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to which I am only a very occasional visitor, who told me in the debate ahead of the second reading that this was a good package to settle with.
I happily did so, except on one issue, in a sense on behalf of the Commission, which had understandably expressed concern about the provisions of recital 5, and which suggested that this regulation would be subservient to existing bilateral agreements.
I am extremely grateful to the Irish presidency for persuading its colleagues in the Council, according to all the accounts I have received, that the offending wording should be deleted so that a rigid hierarchy between bilateral instruments and EU instruments would not be established to the detriment of the latter.
Let me take the remaining seconds to thank the Commission services, which have been enormously helpful in providing a lot of technical detail to a complete ignoramus like me.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for proposing this in the first place and accepting the final settlement, the Council and, most importantly, my colleagues in the Committee on Transport.
I am, as I said before, an interloper from the trade community and it was certainly an interesting and useful exercise for me to see how trade policy and transport policy have in this case come together in an extremely satisfactory manner.
Â Â  Given the bug you have picked up, MrÂ Clegg, I am sure that no one would be offended if you wished to go home to have an early night and a hot drink.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the broad consensus about my report and that of my fellow Members Mr Clegg and Mr Nicholson, I can be brief, and shall be using no more speaking time than is necessary.
According to the Commission, the safety measures in very small airports had to be adapted because they were difficult to put into practice.
It was necessary to alleviate the distress that was caused by the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of 16 December 2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
Safety in aviation has always been important to the public and therefore also to this Parliament, even more so after 11 September 2001.
That is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism carefully studied the topic in 2002 and insisted on 100% control, appropriate technical standards and attention to the question of who should pay for everything.
On 16 December 2002, a Regulation was approved, and entered into effect a month or so later.
I was still new to this House at that time and was not really in a position to follow those discussions.
The Regulation in question had been prepared by the Commission in a short space of time, in order to respond to the increased sense of lack of safety in civil aviation.
Parliament was very keen to approve the Regulation at the earliest opportunity.
From the first experiences with applying it, it transpired that there was room for improvement in some areas and that some terms needed clarifying.
That is how this amending proposal, which is mainly technical, came about.
It appeared inefficient and expensive to apply the same safety regulations to airports for small aircraft only and for adjacent zones for light aircraft in larger airports.
Even so, safety must be guaranteed in those places too.
That is why safety measures established nationally will now apply each time when the Regulation provides for measures that are, objectively speaking, impractical or disproportionate.
Accordingly, for general aviation involving small aircraft, delineated areas have been introduced which are separate from the rest of the airport.
In addition, a criterion for the eligibility of being a small airport has been clarified.
The word 'control' has also been clarified, and a number of inconsistencies have been removed.
I take the view that it is important for the Regulation to be made clearer and for the mistakes in the legislative text to be corrected, but, above all, to ensure that the regulations are practical and applicable.
We once again have an excellent working relationship with the Commission, but if at first reading, the Council adopts a position as a result of which the Regulation is altered dramatically, we should probably review our position.
I suggest at this stage to approve the proposal amending the Regulation, and would thank the services for the support that I have had during the compiling of my report.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report evolved from the need to look at insurance cover for aircraft carriers after the atrocities that took place in New York on 11 September.
It seems a long time ago, but it still remains in our memories.
We had to try to achieve a level playing field between European airlines and the airlines of the United States, which then received even greater support than our airlines.
We also have to keep the necessary balance between the rights of travellers, their security and, above all, the safety of air travel against these new terrorist challenges that threaten everyone in Europe, and indeed in the greater world.
We have come a long way towards achieving this.
After the first reading, the Council accepted 16 of the committee's 26 amendments, which included the provision that the depositing of proof of insurance in one Member State should suffice for all Member States.
It also accepted the definition of a passenger.
State aircraft have been exempted.
The application of global amounts in accordance with commercial practice has also been accepted as have, in a range of other areas, the inclusion of local flights, measures to be taken when aircraft land without adequate insurance cover, and withdrawal of operating licence if the insurance cover is not sufficient.
But there still remain areas of difference between us.
The Council did not share our view on how to regulate for overfliers.
Nor did it agree with Parliament's view on the need for a harmonised inspection regime.
Members will recall my concern on how our proposals would affect the small aircraft operators and how we could resolve that, as also those involved in leisure flying, be it in gliders, hang-gliders or microlights.
I believe it would be totally wrong to penalise any of these areas.
That is why I held out for a fair deal for them.
For all our aircraft in the middle to large categories we are now in basic agreement.
To safeguard the leisure flyer, in respect of gliders and microlights, I have asked my Group to put forward an amendment. I have agreed with the Council and the Commission â and I hope other colleagues will be able to agree with this as well â on what I believe is the best consensus available.
There are those who have said to me that this still does not go far enough, but I think we have the best consensus available to us at this moment in time.
It allows those involved in flying for pleasure to be exempt from insurance cover for war and terrorism.
Microlights have small engines, air stall speeds as low as 35 knots and limited weight.
I believe the amendment covers an adequate compromise.
If the Council and Commission agree, I will withdraw my amendment and there will be no need for a third reading of this particular report. We can then go forward into the future.
I would add one word of caution.
This is an area of legislation that can change rapidly.
We should return to and revise this directive within three to four years, in the light of whatever changes may take place.
We must see and analyse the effects of this directive.
The truth is that the major players in the aircraft industry have been totally unconcerned, it has not affected them.
But it is the small, the vulnerable and the hobby flyer who could suffer most.
I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their extremely positive cooperation.
I would like to thank the Irish presidency because it was, as stated in Mr Clegg's report, positive in ensuring we came to a final conclusion.
Without that we would not have had this result, which I trust will bring forward a directive that will work.
I thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation, which has enabled us to get to this stage, and also my committee colleagues for their cooperation.
For me this has been something of an exercise in bringing a directive to Parliament that, by the time I go for re-election will, I hope, be effective legislation.
That is something that will live with me for a long time.
I look forward to the future.
This is now a very good report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has decided that we should deal jointly with three issues relating to the air sector, but which are of a different nature.
I am therefore going to talk about them consecutively and separately and I am going to follow the order used by the honourable Members in their speeches.
I will begin with unfair pricing practices in the supply of air services from countries not members of the European Community and I would like to thank Mr Clegg for remaining in the Chamber for a while despite his condition.
I would like firstly to say that I am delighted that we have reached the second reading under the best possible circumstances in relation to such an important proposal, which must protect the position of our air sector, although it is absolutely correct to say that under no circumstances must it be used to restrict competition or the entry of third countries into our sector, but rather quite the opposite.
What it must do is prevent our companies from having to face a situation of disadvantage when compared to third countries.
We can expect this text to enter into force soon thanks to the wonderful spirit of cooperation between the institutions and in this regard I would like once again to thank Parliament and in particular Mr Clegg with whom we have worked in close cooperation.
The text provides the Union with new competences in order to defend itself in the event of certain anti-competitive practices on the part of third countries.
This House has repeatedly expressed its concern about the harm which could be done to the competitive operation of the air market by certain subsidies granted by third countries.
Mr Schmitt, draughtsman for the report on the negotiation of bilateral agreements on the part of the United States, has insisted on this very point and I hope that the approval of this regulation on this type of unfair practice at second reading will respond to his expectations and therefore assist development in the field of agreements with third countries.
In its first reading, the European Parliament contributed to clarifying and increasing the efficiency of the mechanisms laid down in the draft regulation, particularly by means of setting of time limits.
The only amendment proposed at second reading will make the text completely consistent, laying down the sequential organisation between the activation of the mechanisms established in the bilateral instrument of the State and that of the Community instrument.
In this regard, the Commission entirely agrees with the objectives of this amendment.
Once adopted â very soon I hope â this regulation will be an essential instrument so that the Union can prevent and correct any practice which may be adopted by third-country airlines which contravenes unfair competition standards.
I would insist that this represents an important supplementary stage to which we can add the other progress made over the last year in the consolidation of our air transport policy with the aim of fully controlling the vitally important international dimension of the air sector and defend the already very prominent role our industry plays.
With regard to the second report, I would like to highlight the work of the rapporteur, Mr Dhaene, and say that in the case of civil aviation security, in view of the numerous proposals presented, the introduction of certain modifications of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 on civil aviation security, is not very significant.
In truth, the intention is to rectify certain deficiencies in the framework regulation which the Member States indicated in 2003 on trying to apply the European Union rules in the field of aviation security to smaller airports, in which, due to their size and activities, there were aspects which did not make much sense.
The proposal does not relate to any point of principle and I am happy to say that both the Council and the European Parliament have expressed their will to adopt it quickly at first reading.
In this regard, the Commission is prepared to maintain a dialogue on possible changes to the content of this important regulation during the next legislature, if we consider that there are still issues to be dealt with.
With regard to the third report by Mr Nicholson, whom I wish every success in the coming elections, on insurance requirements for air operators and air carriers, I must say that I am delighted with the long journey taken by the proposed regulation.
It is an extremely important regulation as we saw after 11 September, when our air companies were stretched to their limits and had to respond with the support of the public sector.
The decision-making process has led to strong support from all the institutions in order to reach a compromise.
I would like to express my satisfaction at the constructive role played by this Parliament and I would stress once again the importance of this institutionâs role and actions in achieving social support and the support of the sectors and people involved.
I would like in particular to thank Mr Nicholson for the vital work he has done.
It has been demonstrated that aviation insurance is necessary in order to guarantee that people and property are adequately insured against possible damage on the ground and in flight. We want to guarantee cover for damage of all types, including that caused by acts of war or terrorism.
The Commission understands and supports the form and the content of the amendment presented by the European Parliament to the common position.
In fact, to a large extent it reflects the Commission's initial proposal in relation to sporting and recreational flying which uses small aircraft, weighing less than half a tonne.
At the same time, with regard to the damage caused by war and terrorism, it makes the insurance requirements for certain aircraft subject to the principle of subsidiarity.
This guarantees, on the one hand, that governments, if they wish, can establish the insurance requirements for such risks and, on the other, that this type of aviation activity can be maintained without excessive costs, since the insurance requirements in the case of war and terrorism laid down in the regulation will not be applied to aircraft of less than 500 kg, which includes gliders and microlights.
I would like to point out that Mr Nicholson is completely right to say that we are dealing with a legislative proposal which will very possibly have to be revised within three or four years because it will depend on the international progress made in this field â and we hope that it is as positive as possible â in relation to liability with regard to third parties and progress on the Rome Convention â which is currently dealing with the issue.
When the time comes, that will oblige us to modify the proposal, which is something we are prepared to do.
In any event, I hope that the general result will be acceptable to Parliament and the Council and that the codecision procedure on this issue can be completed at second reading during the current legislature.
So I would like to end, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by once again thanking the three rapporteurs for their wonderful work, which falls within the framework of our support for the European aviation sector and I hope that, with the agreement of the Council, it can be completed quickly.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President, speaking on behalf of my group, I wish to extend warm thanks to the three rapporteurs.
It is rather sad that there is nobody here â no journalists, no members of the public â but that is how things are.
The three rapporteurs have done an excellent job of dealing with substantial legislative initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress that has been made.
I would like to thank Mr Clegg for having enabled us to come to an agreement with the Council on a joint regulation protecting our airlines against subsidisation and unfair pricing practices.
Both of us â indeed, I believe, all of us â agree that this is not so much about the use of weaponry as about stocking up an ammunition box, one that we hope will enable us to prevent unfair subsidisation in America, among other places.
We can in any case, if a stop is not put to it, threaten them with a whole ammunition depot full of sanctions against their airlines and to the benefit of our own.
While we have no desire to restrict competition, we do want to have an ammunition box for the sake of fair competition at global level.
Mr Dhaene has done well to improve the practical details of the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
I think that Parliament and the Council will endorse the Commissionâs approach, which involves adapting the highly stringent rules that we need, post-9/11, to smaller airports in a practicable and affordable way, so I am grateful to MrÂ Dhaene for his practical solution.
Contrary to what might sometimes be believed, we are not just engaged in enacting meaningless laws.
Mr Nicholson probably had the toughest brief, that of insurance requirements, which is the most expensive issue to deal with.
On these, insurance premiums depend, and they can get very expensive.
I think we have managed to reconcile both the passengersâ interest in having a proper and high level of insurance cover and the airlinesâ interest in premiums that remain affordable.
The amounts involved represent a fair compromise.
It is, I think, a very fine thing that Mr Nicholson has managed to take the right approach to gliders, too.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Vice-President De Palacio.
We are engaged â as we need to be â in adopting every kind of legislation relating to air transport by the end of this legislative period.
One might say that a majority in this House, drawn from every political group, is united in favouring the adoption of these practical rules for really safe air transport, so, on behalf of my own group, let me thank the rapporteurs and the Vice-President.
Â Â  Mr President, the European aviation industry is in full swing and is experiencing exciting times.
Since 11 September 2001, there has not been a dull moment.
Before I comment on the content of the reports, I should like to tell the House how satisfied I am that we have received a European approval for the merger of Air France and KLM and that the competent American authority has also given its stamp of approval.
This is important for the industry, particularly in terms of strengthening the European aviation industry, because there is more to come.
Even more is yet to be done to ensure that the industry has a sound economic basis.
With regard to the report by my colleague Mr Clegg, who has now left the House, I should like to stress the value of the amendment in the light of increasing competition.
Many international competitors of European aviation companies operate unaffected by government measures, and this enables them to compete with European aviation companies in improper ways.
It is good to stand up to this sort of practice.
As far as the report by Mr Dhaene is concerned, I find it extremely agreeable if someone can indicate so specifically and realistically why he is not writing an own-initiative report at the moment.
I think this bears witness to much class and I expect him to organise another bicycle trip; perhaps that is when the next round of discussions can be held.
Finally, as for Mr Nicholson's report, I am pleased that we were able to work together so intensively at a very early stage, across the political divide, to achieve a realistic result which is also in keeping with the ICAC (International Civil Aviation Conference) agreements that refer to a system of international premiums.
Within this framework for European aviation, distortion of competition is virtually ruled out.
The special exemption to which attention was drawn this evening is, of course, extremely important for ultra-light aircraft, government aircraft and historic aeroplanes.
I am delighted with the progress and I also think it is very positive that Mr Nicholson has made every effort, right until the end, to ensure that we have a sound product here before us.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0116/2004) by Bill Miller, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions â Internal Market Strategy: Priorities 2003 â 2006.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have been involved and helped me shape this report.
The report is somewhat like the curate's egg â it is good in parts and not so good in parts; in fact, it is lousy in some parts.
I hope that tomorrow we will be able to rectify the bad bits and remove them.
First, I want to concentrate on one or two of the good bits.
The report recognises that the Solvit project is up and running.
It recognises that there is a need for a consistent and correct application of the CE mark.
It supports the work of the Competitiveness Council.
It recognises that the internal market is about creating more and better jobs; it is about creating wealth, not just for businesses; and it is about social cohesion.
It also recognises the benchmarking of existing liberalised services, based on a broad set of criteria, some of which are social.
There is also the consultation with our social partners.
It also encourages Member States' parliaments to address the whole problem of gold plating.
These are the good bits in this report.
Unfortunately they are only the icing on the cake. Once we get into the cake we find the bad bits.
That is where this report goes wrong.
Reading the Commission's document, step-by-step, there is a clear agenda.
The Commission argues that many of the Member State economies are in a downturn at the moment and that in order to give them a boost and to help those flagging economies we must look at more structural reform.
What does it mean by structural reform?
You read on and it starts talking about liberalising more of our public services.
It argues that because the electricity and gas sectors are smaller than the water sector and have been liberalised, we should liberalise the water sector.
Taking that argument even further, in Europe our health and education sectors are bigger than the water sector is today.
If you go down the road of liberalising our water sector then you go down the road of liberalising our health and education sectors.
That is not what I am about.
I have looked at this report.
This is not what Europe is about.
We have had liberalisation of certain industries in Europe.
I only need to look at British Rail to see what a disaster that has been.
Before we go down the road of further liberalisation of any services we have to take stock of what has happened so far.
We have talked about the Lisbon agenda.
That features strongly in the internal market report from the Commission.
However, when we look at the Lisbon agenda, what comes up time and time again is the economic criteria.
There is another side to the Lisbon agenda â a social side.
That never gets mentioned these days.
We always forget about workers' rights when we talk about the Lisbon agenda. Instead, it is market, market, market.
It is high time that we moved away from that.
I believe that the internal market is about workers; it is about workers' rights; it is about health and safety; it is about living conditions; it is about elderly people; it is about young people; it is about disabled people; it is about employment and unemployment; it is about the training of young, old and unemployed people.
It is not only about profit for major companies.
Tomorrow we will vote on one of the most important issues that faces European citizens: whether we give the green light to the Commission to go down the road of looking at the liberalisation of our water sector.
I do not believe that water is an internal market issue.
I do not think that it should be in this report, but it is.
I hope that we will remove that tomorrow.
Our citizens do not want a liberalised water sector.
Europe has a soul.
If we sell out our social agenda, which is part of the internal market agenda, part of the Lisbon agenda, then we are lost forever.
We cannot let down our citizens.
Tomorrow we must support all the amendments that reject further liberalisation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am sorry I was not here for the initial part of that very passionate diatribe against liberalisation.
I am here wearing two hats. First of all I have had the pleasure to shadow Mr Miller on this report in my own committee, as well as producing the report from the Committee on Industry, during which time we have undertaken the job that we were asked to do, which was to comment on the Commission's strategy document.
Mr Miller produced a very interesting report, with much of which I disagreed.
I am pleased to say that the committee shared my view and therefore we have substantially improved it in committee.
I very much hope and indeed encourage the House to approve our version of the report tomorrow because it addresses a number of the issues that the Commission asked us to address and it was not intended as the forerunner of the PSE Group's manifesto for the forthcoming elections.
I want to pick up one or two points, but first I must respond briefly to what Mr Miller said.
The internal market has been one of the biggest successes of the European Union.
I had the privilege of speaking when Mr Bolkestein produced the ten-year report on the single market last year, and we have seen the figures on that which, I am pleased to say, were included in my report to this committee.
They were challenged by some people who do not accept the fact that markets deliver jobs, deliver economic prosperity and therefore deliver the sort of social benefits that Mr Miller was advocating so eloquently earlier on.
The core of European social policy is having a thriving and active economy. This is because we made the single market work, because we have stimulated competition and, yes, because we have liberated those privatised sleeping giants of state industries and subjected them to competition, which has expanded choice and reduced costs to consumers.
Mr Miller and colleagues need only look at the report from the Commission, look at what has happened to energy costs and to telecommunications costs, to see what can be done.
I do not want to get too hung up on water.
I am interested to see that this is a tremendous preoccupation of colleagues on the other side of the House.
It is referred to here but actually the Commission makes it absolutely clear that policy on ownership is not an issue.
Yet there is no doubt at all that there is a lot of scope for improving the efficiency and delivery of water services.
You only have to look at the immense discrepancy in the cost of water to communities across the European Union to see that something needs to be done about it.
That is all we are asking for and that is what we, by way of my Amendment No 1, hope colleagues will support tomorrow.
In my concluding remarks I would like to comment on one or two points.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on producing for the first time a three-year perspective with a clear view forward and a series of important and coherent policies to make the single market work better.
I would like to congratulate it on putting a higher priority on delivering what we have, on enforcing the measures in the single market, on improving mutual recognition, which I agree with the Commission is entirely at the foundation and the heart of the single market project.
That is going to give us an important perspective.
I hope, with colleagues in the next Parliament, we will be here to revisit it.
In conclusion, this is an excellent report.
I want to thank the Commissioner for taking on board so much of the previous internal market committee report, for which I had the privilege of being a rapporteur.
I am pleased to say that colleagues in my committee have agreed with the amendments and we have adjusted the report to reflect a continuation of what I did before, not the retrogressive views of the rapporteur in this instance.
Thank you for this report.
We look forward to working with you to deliver the continued benefits for all citizens in the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, this afternoon, Commissioner Bolkestein presented here in Strasbourg his latest book on Europe's borders.
Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this presentation, Commissioner, but I should like to congratulate you on it all the same.
This evening, I should like to consider the limits to the Commissioner's urge for liberalisation, which appear to be non-existent.
First of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to MrÂ Miller for the good working relationship.
It is not his fault that the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has produced a somewhat distorted report.
As I understand it, Mr Harbour is taking on the blame for this.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am naturally very disappointed that only three of my amendments have been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
My group has re-submitted the other amendments and we hope that the Christian Democrats and Liberals will be supporting those tomorrow with their Socialist hats on.
As far as the urge for liberalisation is concerned, I can put Mr Bolkestein's mind at rest.
Unlike some of my colleagues here on the left, I am not by definition against liberalisation, but I am opposed to market fundamentalism and to pushing through liberalisation at all costs, if the conditions and public guarantees are not yet in place by a long way and liberalisation is loss-making on all fronts, except for the private monopolies and their adherents who can seize on their chances in this.
It is high time that we in Europe put a brake on liberalisation of that kind and that a framework directive was put in place for services of general interest, thus providing a counterweight for the dominance of the competition rules.
I can see the Commissioner hesitating in that respect, and he is palming us off with one excuse after the other.
One final remark about the new directive on the internal market for services: that really seems to me to be a case of extreme madness, because it undermines everything that we have laid down in Europe in the area of subsidiarity and the precedence of the rules of the country where the services are performed.
The new proposal for a directive is throwing the existing regulation into utter confusion and threatens drastically to restrict the Member States' policy room to determine conditions on the basis of general interest, monitoring the quality of society and the environment and guaranteeing fundamental rights.
In my view, some elements are even inconsistent with the corresponding guiding principles in the Treaty.
It is beyond me why you want to get this through Parliament before your departure, and I am pleased that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has in any case decided not to proceed too hastily in this matter.
In the Miller report, my group urges that no final decisions should yet be taken, about this new directive among other things, until such time as the discussion about the legal framework for services of general interest is complete.
This does not strike me as being unreasonable.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as we are only a matter of weeks away from enlargement it is most welcome for Parliament to be sending a strong signal that it wants the internal market to be strengthened to serve effectively the interests and aspirations of more than 450 million European citizens and well over 20Â million companies.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Miller, and his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for all their hard work in raising the profile of the internal market over the last few years.
Indeed, they can claim credit for some of the measures in the Commission's internal market strategy, as these were originally their ideas.
The internal market is one of Europe's finest achievements.
Since 1993 it has helped to create more than 2.5 million extra jobs and has added nearly EURÂ 900 billion, cumulatively, to our collective prosperity.
There is much more to come!
There are still major gaps in the legal framework, such as on services and taxation.
Furthermore, in a Union of 25 Member States or more, we need to strengthen the foundations on which the internal market is built.
The internal market strategy 2003-2006 sets out exactly what needs to be done by whom and by when.
It is a ten-point plan for making Europe better off.
There is no time now to go into all the details of Parliament's reports or, indeed, of the internal market strategy.
Therefore, I will focus on a few key issues.
I welcome Parliament's support for strengthening the mutual recognition principle.
I know that views differ on where the balance needs to be struck between mutual recognition and harmonisation.
The benefits of mutual recognition are that it respects national traditions and avoids further regulation at the level of the European Union.
We all know that negotiating harmonising directives will be no sinecure with 25 Member States around the table.
Therefore, if we can avoid more legislation, so much the better.
The point, however, is not to impose mutual recognition at all costs.
By getting Member States to notify cases where mutual recognition cannot be relied upon we shall be much better placed to propose a targeted solution which does not go beyond what is necessary to kick-start free movement again.
I share Parliament's concern over the slow implementation of internal market directives.
Late transposition creates legal insecurity and can cause significant harm to businesses and citizens from other Member States.
It is difficult to understand why Member States that fulfil their obligations do not hold to task other Member States that are consistently late in doing so.
The Commission, of course, takes immediate legal action where Member States fail to transpose on time.
Nor do we shy away from hanging Member States' dirty linen out to dry.
Public embarrassment often has more impact than a pile of infringement proceedings in the post.
Late transposition, however, is only a symptom of a larger problem.
The bottom line is that we shall not have a fully functioning internal market as long as Member States treat the internal market like a rented car that they do not need to wash or maintain.
I am therefore attracted by Parliament's suggestion that Member States should establish internal market offices that would be responsible for good internal market behaviour and to which people could apply if they have a problem.
We shall certainly pursue this line of thinking.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of the internal market is truly one of the most important steps in achieving the Lisbon objectives.
If the internal market is to work efficiently there needs to be genuine commitment at supranational level with regard to setting internal market objectives and at national level with regard to the implementation of decisions.
Although the objectives are in place and the necessary laws have now been enacted at EU level, the extent to which they have been brought into effect in many Member States is truly shameful.
The Commission should invest more time in monitoring the implementation of the decisions taken.
I agree with the rapporteur, MrÂ Miller, that Member States in breach of their obligations should be condemned more frequently, expeditiously and severely than is now the case, by imposing fines, for example.
Furthermore, the impact and effectiveness of EU legislation should be continually assessed, as unnecessary laws are something we do not need.
A viable internal market is an excellent way of creating jobs and wealth.
One of the most harmful barriers to the proper functioning of the internal market is restricted mobility of the workforce and inflexibility of the labour market.
The decision by many Member States, including Finland, not to allow the free movement of the workforce from the new Member States is nothing less than blatant discrimination against the nationals of those countries.
So far only Ireland and Great Britain have said they will open up their borders on 1 May to the workforce arriving from the Central European countries that are joining the Union.
Other old Member States are using the opportunity to keep their borders closed, even though one of the pillars of the EU is the free movement of the workforce.
The new Member States certainly could not have expected the decisions that were made owing to pressure by the trade union movement.
The restrictions might even have been accepted if the new Member States had been aware of them at Copenhagen, when the membership agreements were just being signed.
It is short-sighted and pointless on the part of the current Member States to fear change in this way and be unwilling to implement essential structural solutions, and it undermines the prospects of economic growth in both the current and the new Member States.
The opening of the market for net-based industries has delivered significant benefits for consumers, businesses and society.
Competition has increased, prices have fallen, and there is more innovation and choice.
To boost international competitiveness, it is important to address all the problems that are troubling the internal market.
Removing the cross-border barriers to trade in services in the service industry is the most crucial of these.
I hope the directive on services makes swift progress.
Â Â  Mr President, the main virtue of the report by Mr Miller is that it attempts a global approach.
Thus, it is rightly considered that the strategy for the market, together with the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines, are one of the three means for promoting the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
Consequently, proper operation of the market presupposes acceptance of this basic political objective.
If the Lisbon strategy failed to bring about the results we were expecting, this is due to ambiguity about its real content.
We believe that, in the same way as competitiveness of the market is being proposed, the social dimension of the strategy for it should also be jointly evaluated without fear.
Thus, competitiveness, in the sense of âcompetitiveness based on qualityâ rather than âcompetitiveness based on eroding labour costsâ, as well as being a governing principle for economic relations, will also become a general principle for all social relations.
Only thus will it be possible for the European model to be exported and to play a leading role in the global market.
If this strategic objective is accepted unreservedly, we can resolve the individual problems of malfunctions on the internal market more effectively.
Our first concern is for the Member States to be convinced at long last that an internal market cannot function without advanced harmonisation of its legislation, including the lifting of tax barriers, and without increased responsibility for the application of the agreed rules without delay and without distortion.
The current regime for monitoring the application of Community rules has failed and radical reform is needed.
The second concern is to address the phenomena of the development of the internal market by just one section of the companies and the active population.
Unless small- and medium-sized enterprises and consumers are brought on board, any decisions we take at European level will have limited results.
Therefore, above all, we must see what it is that makes the man in the street opposed to the internal market and how we can link its future with the vision of Europe.
Â Â  Commissioner, you want to build the internal market on purely commercial principles and with fiscal and regulatory competition, when an efficient internal market in accordance with the European social model requires the creation of public assets and a substantial harmonisation of the rules at European level.
In order to impose your views, you tend to use the cutlass method.
I would like to take my turn to say that the directive on services represents a real danger, a poison for the European Union.
You want liberalisation in all areas, while in January 2004 Parliament again rejected the liberalisation of the education, health, social services and water sectors.
You want to remove the exclusive rights for services of general economic interest and impose the rules of public markets, while Parliament has asked for these services to have a legal codecision framework and given its opinion in favour of a right of autoproduction for public organisations.
You want to extend the principle of mutual recognition and the application of the law of the supplierâs country of origin across the board.
This can only cause ill-feeling and disputes.
The only method that can unite Europeans would involve establishing common positive criteria in the different sectors of the internal market by codecision, which would produce harmonisation rules in accordance with our social model.
I must also highlight the lack of consultation of civil society in your practice.
This is largely responsible for the bad quality of texts and for the large number of disputes.
The Lamfalussy method for financial services is much more participative than the one that you use in other areas where you seek to obtain a blank cheque to eliminate regulatory barriers.
Nevertheless, the Lamfalussy method is handicapped by many inadequacies that we wish to overcome: the lack of a right of call-back for Parliament, insufficient economic analyses and consultations that are still largely limited to professionals.
For all these reasons, I beseech my colleagues â and I have already written to them all to this effect â to re-establish the political line in Parliament in favour of the social market economy.
This line was sacrificed at the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
In order to re-establish it, we need to adopt the amendments tabled by Messrs Miller and Ortega.
Â Â  Mr President, in supporting Mr Miller's general line about this report and in particular his points about water, I want to draw special attention to Amendment No 13.
It would be a very illiberal doctrine to say that liberalisation should be pursued in an inflexible way, insensitive to local realities.
We ought to look at, for example, the case of remoter parts of the European Union.
We should therefore, for example, welcome the flexibility in relation to local transport services indicated by the recent Altmark judgment.
Unfortunately, however, the Commission has said that this cannot possibly apply to ferries.
Buses are not ferries â indeed they are not â but transport is transport, by sea and by land.
Mr Miller mentioned the problem of Railtrack in the United Kingdom.
Split the ownership of the rails from the ownership of the trains and you get a crazy situation.
In Scotland it seems that we are about to split the ownership of the ships from the ownership of the companies that sail them.
Railtrack by sea!
This is liberalisation pursued in an extreme and inflexible way.
Mr Bolkestein is a frequent and always welcome visitor to Scotland.
I hope that on his next visit to the Hebrides he does not have to travel under an assumed name to hide his responsibility for the fiasco which is about to be wished upon us!
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I too believe that the principle of mutual recognition is one of the keys to developing the single market.
In the few seconds that I have available, I do, however, want to focus on the much-discussed issue of water.
The water, or water services, sector is, and will be, crucial in Europe too.
I believe that it would be unreasonable, especially in this sector, to forego the efficiency that can derive from liberalisation and competition.
The ownership of water is not at stake, contrary to what someone, not in this House, has said.
Nor are we concerned here with the privatisation of water, but merely with opening up the water services market, which is often managed in an inefficient way by public, local and national monopolies.
To those who say âcome and look at the railways in Great Britainâ, I would say, âcome and see the public water mains in Italy, including the major ones, together with the waste of water resources and of public moneyâ.
I am not saying that there has to be a dogma, but I believe that opening up public services to competition and the market is actually a move towards a social Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, we will have to be very careful, when voting on the report on the Internal Market Strategy, not to turn Mr Millerâs work, which is in fact outstanding, on its head, so that this House ends up, after only a few weeks, overturning the decision it took in January on public services of general interest.
Let me clarify what I mean by reference to our water.
In January, we expressed our opposition to the unrestrained privatisation of basic services such as water and sewerage, as well as health services and education.
We set down in writing our recognition that decisions on these things have to be taken, if at all possible, close to the citizen in towns and communities.
Services of general interest are the business of the people who use them; they are not to be the plaything of an unrestricted market.
That is the point that Mr Miller reiterated in his report on the Internal Market Strategy, using persuasive examples to warn of the dangers that ensue if, for example, we make our precious water nothing more than an ordinary item of merchandise.
It was apparent from the deliberations in the committee, though, that there are powerful conservative and liberal elements who believe that there are more, and quicker, profits to be made out of the public services.
This is meant to be Mr Millerâs report; we must make sure that it really is by, in the plenary, stopping them in their tracks.
The amendments needed to make good the fudge for which the committee is responsible have been tabled.
I ask you all to help ensure that our towns and communities are not stabbed in the back, which is what this unholy alliance between conservatives and liberals wants to happen.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would very much enjoy a visit to the Isle of Skye, and perhaps Sir Neil MacCormick would accompany me.
But I shall certainly do that under my own name and not under any assumed name.
I hope Sir Neil would agree to that.
I shall address two points that appeared to be important in this debate.
Firstly, the question of whether the internal market strategy takes enough account of social, employment and environmental concerns.
I must stress that the main aim of the internal market strategy is to strengthen the application of the key principles on which the internal market is based, especially as the Union expands and enlarges to take in ten more Member States.
Hence the focus on the free movement of goods and services, mutual recognition, taxation obstacles, implementation and enforcement, and the simplification of rules.
That does not mean that social or environmental aspects are not important.
However, there are other instruments which are much better placed to address those concerns, such as, for example, the employment guidelines.
Not every document the Commission produces should deal with each and every issue.
I disagree with the view that the internal market is not socially or environmentally friendly.
More than 2.5 million jobs have been created since 1993 because of the internal market.
Nearly EUR 900 billion cumulatively has been added to our combined gross domestic product â money that supports our social security system, pensions, healthcare and education.
Costs of baskets of services and goods include jobs, leaving more money in people's pockets.
The internal market has promoted innovation and the adoption of clean-air technology.
Therefore, the internal market is a good social and environmental policy.
Secondly, on the matter of liberalisation, firstly, I must stress that privatisation is not the Commission's concern.
In fact, Article 295 of the Treaty prohibits the European Commission from dealing with ownership.
Liberalisation and competition are the Commission's concern, but not privatisation.
Concerning the services of general economic interest, the Commission makes no apology for its actions to open up the network industries to further competition.
Industry and citizens have generally benefited, as demonstrated by the results of performance and evaluation measurement.
Quality and user satisfaction are higher than before market opening and prices are often lower.
Further market opening is desirable.
For example, the Commission has just proposed further steps in the railway sector and we are also looking at ways of injecting more competition into the water sector.
This debate is not about deregulation but re-regulation.
The quality of service and respect for general interests remain critical requirements.
However, I disagree that public monopolies are the natural guarantor of such standards.
Competition is the consumer's best friend.
It will always be up to governments to lay down the conditions that services of general interest â public or private â will have to fulfil.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Bolkestein offers to visit Skye.
He is very wise!
It is the only island of the Hebrides now joined to the mainland by a bridge and does not depend upon the services of ferries subject to public service obligations.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  . â This report is of enormous importance.
It is a strategic report, even though it conceals or disguises its class nature, which the so-called Lisbon strategy reveals clearly.
Just four topics.

First, point 38: I welcome the statement that the free movement of workers is the least developed â particularly when compared with the rampant movement of capital; the GUE/NGL draft amendment would make this even clearer and more positive.
Secondly, point 40: the two freedoms of movement mentioned above oppose each other in the management of pension funds by multinational companies, which is presented as highly desirable.
For whom?
Serving what kind of economy?
A speculative one?!
Thirdly, point 10: its welcoming of âthe proposals to continue liberalisation and the opening up of markets in other sectors (notably water and postal services)â inspires in me a feeling that is the very opposite of welcoming and makes me strongly support the amendments tabled by my Group and the rapporteur.
We must be extremely vigilant concerning the Commissionâs proclaimed âneutralityâ as regards the status of water ownership.
Fourthly, point 9: this should quite simply be phrased the other way round: âthe effective and efficient working of the internal market should reinforce rather than hamper the social dimension.â
That is all for now, although there is a lot more!
Â Â  The next item is the second report (A5-0122/2004) by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards value added tax on services provided in the postal sector.
Â Â  . â Under Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions concerning VAT must be adopted to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market.
Directive 97/67/EC was the first step towards the establishment of such a postal market.
For the first time, consumers were given a choice and operators were free to provide their services outside their own small national markets.
As is often the case with European tax legislation, the VAT Directive has lagged behind and now requires urgent changes since it no longer reflects the needs or the situation in the Community.
As they are currently being interpreted by many Member States, the current VAT arrangements are not compatible with the establishment of an internal market since they provide for the exemption of services provided by certain operators in their own market, their taxation once they dare to supply services in other Member States and the taxation of all other operators at the standard rate, wherever they happen to supply their services.
In the event of legislative inaction, there is a clear risk that the European Court of Justice will be called upon to resolve this apparent breach of the neutrality of the tax in order to re-establish a level playing field and ensure that internal market principles are respected.
It could only do so by restricting the scope of the exemption to those services which are still not open to competition.
That would mean taxation at the full rate for all other services.
The Commission, in presenting its proposal, is fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty, in particular under Article 93.
It has done so after extensive consultation with universal postal services and other postal operators, as well as representatives of postal customers.
It has taken into account their opinions, in particular those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to services such as letterpost, small packages and direct mail, which such customers use most.
The combined effect of the savings to postal operators resulting from the right of deduction the proposal would open to them and the application of a reduced rate to a wide scope of postal services is intended to limit or neutralise any increase in postal prices.
The Commission was the proponent of the universal services concept at the heart of Directive 97/67/EC and considers that every citizen in the union has the right to a wide range of affordable, quality postal services.
Universal postal service providers will not be in a position to provide such a service if they are discouraged from investing and modernising and as a result can no longer compete with other operators in the parts of the market which are already open to competition.
The current VAT exemption makes the required investment more expensive.
Universal postal operators in Europe recognise such challenges and accordingly most of them support the objectives of this proposal.
To conclude, I would invite Members of the House to support the Commission's proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, so here we are again, and I am again trying to get this House to realise the importance of changing the current rules on value added tax exemption on postal services.
The committee and plenary rejected my proposal a few months ago, so now Mrs Lulling and I are back with a list of amendments to appease our critical fellow Members.
I would, as the Commissioner says, have preferred that the Commission proposals had been adopted straight off, but there was no majority for doing so.
The market is being liberalised at both European and national level.
Several old government postal and telephone companies have been converted to public limited companies.
They need different rules.
The current unequal tax treatment not only hampers the development of open markets, and thus the deregulation of the postal services, but it also distorts competition and makes it more difficult for both the public and private operators to compete.
The economic impact on consumers would be negligible.
It is the famous increase of a penny per stamp, or no increase at all.
There can even be a price reduction if the Member States use a reduced rate.
Those postal operators mentioned by the Commissioner are subject to VAT.
They will also be able to reclaim input VAT paid, thus lowering their overall costs.
This is good for new investment and the modernisation of old monopoly companies.
I should like to emphasise this.
We have made some amendments since the last reading.
It is proposed that the weight limit for the reduced rate for standard mail be raised from 2 kg to 10 kg.
This is one of the weight limits set by the International Postal Union (IPU).
In this way, important pieces of standard mail would be included in the reduced rate range. This includes newspapers, weeklies and other parcels.
The entry into force of the directive is postponed until 2007. This will give enough time to the Member States and postal operators to adapt to the new provisions of the directive.
This also fits in with the different liberalisation stages envisaged for the postal market.
It is also recommended that the Member States which, on 1 January 2003, applied a super-reduced rate might continue to apply that super reduced rate to postal services.
We also have suggestions regarding various organisations that deal with gifts and the like.
I hope that these compromises are sufficient.
It would be unfortunate if nothing were to happen at all.
The biggest issue that has been dealt with recently is the case of Royal Mail.
Other providers of postal services, according also to the Commissioner, support this proposal.
The industry approves.
Data from the national regulator, Postcomm in Great Britain prove that removing the VAT exemption for public operators would not result in price increases for users.
It would, on the contrary, create a level-playing field ultimately leading to increased competition, greater choice for postal users and lower prices.
I spoke to a leading employee of Postcomm who told me that there was no reason for Royal Mail to retain this VAT exemption as it was not needed to protect either Royal Mail or the users. Rather, the opposite is the case.
It is a shame that I have been unable to convince so many intelligent fellow MEPs such as Mr Goebbels, MrÂ Skinner and Mrs Villiers, and particularly my own party colleague Mr Huhne, to adopt a sensible line of thinking.
This is regrettable, and I can but state that if Parliament rejects my proposal again tomorrow â as, unfortunately, there is much to indicate that it will â then I have failed horribly.
Maybe we can live with this, as I myself can live with it, but it is however Europeâs consumers who have lost.
They are the big losers.
I hope that my fellow Members can consider this, if only overnight before the vote tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, you have just heard that the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and I are not going to give up.
In the run-up to the elections, we face opposition from populists, among others, to our efforts to get this House to say loud and clear what proposals it has to make in respect of the Commissionâs proposal for VAT on services in the postal sector.
It is for that reason that we have resubmitted our amendments to the Commission proposal.
Simply rejecting this proposal out of hand, which is what Mr Goebbels, and others who speak for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have been trying to do for almost a year now, is too primitive an approach.
To be sure, it plays well with the public to proclaim your opposition to VAT on postage stamps, but we are well aware that, as various postal services have been liberalised, there will, in the long term, be no getting away from the need to treat postal services and private service providers equally in order to avoid competition in this sector being distorted.
So it makes more sense to us to tell the Council of Ministers, and the Commission too, what we want done to prevent postage stamps going up in price.
This is what our amendments are aiming at.
In the first place, we want to defer the entry into force of this directive until 2007, in order to give the postal services enough time to implement it without difficulty.
Apart from that, we would like to allow those Member States that have a greatly reduced VAT rate â Luxembourg has been one since January 2003; ours is 3% â to apply it to postal services too.
That is a tangible and positive policy; simply saying ânoâ or adopting some similarly populist approach does no service either to the postal service or to those who use it.
I therefore hope that the majority in this House will vote to approve the sensible proposal that I, on behalf of my group, have joined with the rapporteur in bringing forward.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Lulling is the embodiment of non-populist intelligence.
Nevertheless, the total harmonisation of indirect taxation has never been an objective of the European Union.
An internal market can work perfectly well with fiscal competition, as long as it is fair competition.
The proof of this is the American internal market, in which the fifty States of the Union continue to tax consumption through local taxes of between 0 and 10 percentage points.
The coordination of VAT rates and excise duties that took place with my modest contribution, in 1991, under the Luxembourg Presidency, established the base rates, including zero rates in some areas, and the ceiling rates, allowing the Member States a degree of freedom of action for a national taxation policy.
However, the Commission is still pushing for fiscal unification.
Each Community acquis is fiercely defended.
This is the case in the debate surrounding a possible decrease in VAT rates for some highly labour-intensive services.
Normally, Mr President, people eat wherever they happen to get hungry.
There are very few people who will go abroad to find a hair salon with a better rate of VAT.
There are even fewer citizens who call on the European competition when they have a plumbing problem.
Why does the Commission not take notice when the Member States want, for example, to promote employment in certain sectors in which the VAT rate is too high?
The Commissionâs proposal to abolish the VAT exemption granted to public postal services comes from this same vague desire for standardisation.
The postal sector is still a service organised at national level with a national price system.
Until, for example, you can put an Italian or Swedish stamp on a letter in France, there will not be an internal postal market, or a real distortion of competition between the different postal systems.
The reasons why postal systems are, nevertheless, fighting for the introduction of a VAT rate are basely material.
By charging even minimal VAT on standard postal services, postal operators could deduct the VAT paid on their purchases.
Those who would not benefit are consumers.
They would very quickly face increases in postal prices.
The majority of the Socialist Group will vote against VAT on postal services.
We want to defend consumers.
The harmonisation of VAT on postal services sought by the Commission is in fact just an attempt to create the conditions required for a subsequent privatisation of a public service for the benefit of certain private companies that are already active in that field.
We oppose the privatisation of this universal service which, even in the United States, functions as a public service.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that the VAT exemption should be lifted.
I do not share the Commissionerâs views on liberalisation, but I am not convinced by Mr Goebbelsâ arguments.
I think that there is already an internal market for postal services, except for private use.
Mail to private individuals, for example, only represents 10% of the turnover of the French postal service.
The remainder is mired in competition, and there are inequalities in that competition.
Contrary to what Mr Schmidt said, I think that the traditional public operators are particularly penalised by the inappropriate taxation system and by being unable to deduct VAT from their purchases.
The reasons are not only purely financial; it is about being able to develop.
I would also like to add that there is a tax on salaries to compensate for the so-called privilege of VAT exemption .
It would be paradoxical to claim to want to defend public service companies while allowing them to be strangled.
I think that the correct solution in these circumstances is to keep the Schmidt and Lulling amendments, which are a further step to the left, with obligatory reduced and super-reduced rates for services that are part of the universal service.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my appreciation for Mr Schmidt's work.
Having to submit an amended report twice in order to gain sufficient support struck me as being no mean feat.
I hope that the amendments by Mr Schmidt and Mrs Lulling will be supported in the plenary tomorrow.
In the European Union, the postal market will be liberalised by no later than the beginning of 2009.
You may, or may not, like that, but, now that the decision is before us, it is important to ensure that this does not result in chaos, with the public no longer being able to receive or send mail.
The equal treatment of public and private providers of postal services in terms of VAT basis and the VAT rate is therefore of major importance.
In addition, with a view to the free postal market, provision must be made for equal opportunities within the internal market.
That is why I shall be supporting the amendments tabled by Mr Schmidt and Mrs Lulling.
Â Â  Mr President, the publicly-owned postal company in Ireland, An Post, is currently struggling for survival.
Following the impact of liberalisation, it has lost significant parts of the profitable portion of its market while it continues to bear the burden of carrying a universal service obligation to the furthest corners of the Republic of Ireland.
It must deliver a letter, which may originate in the UK or elsewhere, regardless of the cost and regardless of what area of the country it is addressed to.
It is also losing significant state contracts, which enabled it to maintain its public service obligations, because of the public procurement requirements.
To oblige An Post to now apply VAT to its postal services could well be the death knell of the company.
No doubt many of those free market enthusiasts will be rubbing their hands in glee at such a prospect because they can then pick up what remains of the profitable bits of the Irish market.
But then what happens to the public service obligation?
Who will deliver the letter to the person living alone in the extreme north-west or south-west of the Republic of Ireland?
The Irish Government has recently indicated its opposition to this measure, having kept its mouth shut very tightly since the subject was first mooted by the Commission in 2000.
I welcome its recent conversion and I hope that it is successful in blocking this measure.
There needs to be some common sense in the way we deal with public services like the postal services.
Â Â  . â The Commission hopes for the support of Parliament for its proposal and is ready to take into account a number of significant amendments proposed by Members of Parliament.
The Commission's position as regards the amendments is as follows: the Commission considers that any study of the postal sector, and particularly those carried out under Directive 97/67/EC, should take into account the impact of VAT in the sector.
The Commission undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 5.
In view of a possible compromise with Parliament and with regard to Amendments Nos 4 and 11, the Commission could accept a delay until 1 January 2007 in the entry into force for the actual implementation of the directive in order to allow operators enough time to adapt their systems.
In view of a possible compromise with Parliament, which has stressed the need to protect consumers from price increases on standard postal services, and with regard to Amendments Nos 6, 9 and 10, the Commission could agree to widening the proposed scope of postal services that may qualify for a reduced rate so as to include standard postal services relating to items of up to 10 kg in weight.
With regard to Amendments Nos 1 and 7, recent events have once again shown that Member States are very much attached to the optional nature of reduced rates, and the Commission cannot, therefore, undertake to amend its proposal in this sense.
However, these amendments would indicate in no uncertain terms that this Parliament considers price stability of postal services of paramount importance and certainly sends a political signal to Member States to make use of the option which the proposal includes.
With regard to Amendments Nos 3 and 8, the Commission considers reduced rates under 5% to be temporary measures which should not be applied to new categories of goods or services.
As regards Amendment No 2, endorsing a reimbursement mechanism for charitable organisations, the Commission would like to repeat its view that nothing in the Sixth Directive prevents Member States from introducing such a mechanism outside the VAT system.
However, it would not be appropriate, nor in keeping with the subsidiarity principle, to amend its proposal to advise Member States how they should spend their tax receipts.
Lastly, as regards Amendment No 13, the Commission considers the issues posed by philatelic stamps are no different from those existing today.
Under current legislation, stamps are only exempt when sold at face value.
They are taxable in all other cases.
Since this different tax liability is not causing problems today, it should not cause problems once the proposal is approved.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0115/2004) by Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss with Parliament the issue of scientific and technological cooperation between Israel and the European Community.
I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, and the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for their work and constant interest in science and research matters.
The aim of this agreement is to enable continued cooperation with Israel in the field of science and technology.
This relationship has been developing ever since Israel's participation in the Fourth Framework Programme for research.
I would also emphasise the importance of this cooperation within the framework of the development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, as well as in the implementation of the European Research Area.
The present agreement is an extension of the one associating Israel with the activities of the Fifth Framework Programme for research and technological development.
The latter is based on the fundamental principle of reciprocity, which takes into account the mutual interests of the two parties and covers all the fields suggested by the Sixth Framework Programme, with the exception of nuclear research.
Scientific cooperation with Israel has already resulted in numerous joint projects in the field of research and technological development.
Under the Fifth Framework Programme, 623 projects were undertaken by European research teams in association with Israeli teams, who coordinated 149 of those projects.
The public and private partners engaged in this cooperation have stressed the value of that cooperation and the benefits of it.
This was emphasised during the evaluation of the impact of the agreement associating Israel to the Fifth Framework Programme.
I should also like to stress the value of this type of agreement for the development for Euro-Mediterranean regional scientific cooperation.
For example, the Hortimed project associates Israel and neighbouring countries such as Egypt, the Palestinian Territories, Cyprus and Greece in the search for economic and sustainable solutions for the use of water in irrigated horticulture, particularly by using recycled and cleaned water.
Another major element, mentioned previously, is the contribution this agreement makes to the implementation of the European Research Area and its opening-up to the rest of the world.
More generally, it also contributes to the development of a knowledge-based society.
In this context, the Commission is willing to promote international cooperation in scientific and technological matters with third country partners.
The Cooperation Agreement with Israel fits naturally into this strategy, particularly in respect of the Middle East.
The agreement should also enable scientists to continue their efforts for regional cooperation with the countries neighbouring Israel for the benefit of all, and this in the difficult circumstances currently prevailing in the Middle East.
I am therefore convinced that Parliament should and will give its support to the conclusion of this agreement.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, on 20 November 1995 a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement was concluded between the European Union and Israel by which Israel became associated with the EU in the fields of the movement of goods and services, the right of establishment, the movement of capital and economic and cultural cooperation.
This institutionalised a political dialogue with Israel, which was already taking place on a highly regular basis.
The EU also maintains a special relationship with the autonomous Palestinian Authority and is one of the partners in the Middle East peace process.
I have thus now mentioned the two elements that are crucial to the consideration of this Agreement.
Since 1975 Israel and the European Union had been cooperating in the field of research and development, and in 1983, they began jointly to finance research projects, and, as Commissioner Bolkestein has already said, Israel participated fully in the Fifth Framework Programme; I was the rapporteur on this association at the time.
These agreements were and are a recognition of the international nature of research at the end of the twentieth century, and also recognise that to limit research to EU territory would frequently be contrary to its best interests.
There is a very innovative research climate in Israel, which, relative to its GDP, still spends more on research than does the EU, and is a world leader as regards the number of scientific publications per capita.
I do not propose to repeat the figures to which reference has already been made.
Both sides have benefited from cooperation under the Fifth Framework Programme: Israel gains access to a more extensive network of research institutes, while the EU is able to tap Israelâs innovative potential.
Just how successful this cooperation has been is shown, among other things, by the large number of projects supported.
Some projects have partners not only from Israel, but also from the entire Mediterranean.
Water treatment has already been mentioned; there are also institutes in the areas under the autonomous Palestinian Authority that participate successfully in our Research Programme.
Let me take this opportunity of repeating, for the benefit of some in this House, that this report does not envisage any research cooperation in the sphere of military research or under the aegis of Euratom.
As in the two previous Agreements, Israel is expected to contribute financially to the Sixth FP in proportion to its GDP.
It participates in the programme as a partner with the same rights and obligations as EU Member States: the only exception is the Scientific and Technical Research Committee (CREST), in which it is only an observer.
Israelâs contribution to our research funds and the know-how provided by Israeli institutes can only be seen as positive for EU participants, and so we are very definitely in a win-win-situation here
In order to implement the Agreement, a Joint Committee will be set up, which will ensure the involvement of Israeli officials in the administrative committees and the participation of experts to give their expertise and in programme committees.
There is no obstacle, then, from the research point of view, to the extension of the Agreement.
In order that this statement should not be misunderstood, let me quote from a letter written to me by the Israeli Ambassador, Oded Eran, who had this to say: âAs you pointed out, the overall situation in the Middle East and specifically between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is far from being ideal at the moment.
And the whole Middle East peace process is facing a critical test.âI therefore sympathise with those who tabled the amendments, who are opposed to this and believe that we should put every form of cooperation with Israel on ice until such time as peace prevails in this region, which is so sadly lacking in it.
I have to say, though, that it is my firm conviction that shutting doors prevents us from cooperating further.
Let us be prepared to have frank discussions with all sides, for that is the only way in which we will be able to influence the peace process.
This means that, from the research point of view, the Agreement is very much to be welcomed.
This cooperation will benefit not only researchers and research institutes in the EU, but businesses too, and, where the political situation is concerned, I am persuaded that it can help to ease tensions, as Palestinian researchers and institutes will be enabled to work together with their Israeli and European counterparts, and those who work together are not fighting each other.
Let me conclude by thanking all those, on every side, with whom I have had discussions â those in favour, those against, those who will benefit and those who wanted changes made â from whom I have had a great deal of support and with whom I have, in any case, been able to have very calm and relaxed dialogue.
I thank you all, and hope that my report will make it through tomorrow with the backing of a large majority.
Â Â  Mr President, normally a scientific and technological cooperation agreement is straightforward, very welcome and an occasion for optimism, especially if it is the successor to earlier agreements on which good scientific work has been done.
Sadly, this agreement cannot be straightforward.
From the scientific point of view, collaboration with Israel is no doubt useful in the Sixth Framework Programme.
It is a strong scientific country and, as we have heard, some very useful Mediterranean-wide projects, including research into water treatment, have been carried out and could be carried out in future.
However, we are not discussing a normal country or a normal part of the world.
Israel is not a normal country because many of the present government's actions are completely unacceptable: building a fence, occupying territory, breaching human rights, using repression.
Despite some joint scientific work with Palestinians, I have had complaints regarding barriers to some of that work.
Our Group considered very carefully whether to vote in favour of this agreement.
There are two perfectly valid, tenable points of view.
One could say â as some will â that signing or ratifying this agreement will be perceived as giving the green light and an encouraging signal and endorsement to the actions of the Israeli Government.
That is certainly not the intention.
In the past the European Parliament has very successfully asked for scientific cooperation to be frozen.
Some Members advocate voting against this agreement and indeed taking much further action to show the Israeli Government our disapproval.
A second alternative â and the one that I recommend â is to consider that science and research are positive, that the results of that work are of benefit to human beings and that this allows dialogue and provides an opening for work with Palestinians.
Other points can certainly â and probably will â be made in political dialogue.
There may be cause for action elsewhere.
We have had long discussions and have come to the conclusion, in majority â although not unanimously â that the second alternative, to put faith in the possibility that the scientific dialogue, without any endorsement of the Israeli Government's actions, will bring some progress.
We have great reservations.
We want Palestinian participation without barriers or handicaps.
Of course we want no nuclear, military or dual-use research.
We want a very close monitoring of the situation.
We want the EU-Israel Research Committee to report regularly so that we can see whether this act of faith in the value of science has been worthwhile or has been misinterpreted by a government whose actions we condemn.
Â Â  Mr President, in 2002 this Parliament agreed a resolution not to pursue scientific and technical cooperation with Israel because of the violent and shocking situation in the Middle East at the time.
Nothing has changed since, or at least very little.
Indeed a recent delegation from this Parliament, which looked at the effects of the so-called security fence or wall, had deeply shocking things to report.
I believe that an acceptance of this agreement would be an indication of normality and cooperation and as my colleague Mrs McNally said, this is not a normal country, it is not a normal situation, and it should not be endorsed.
The Verts/ALE Group has therefore tabled amendments asking for the suspension of this agreement in the present situation, particularly because of its unequal benefit for one protagonist â Israel â and until more progress has been made towards realistic conflict resolution in the region.
We have also requested that dual-use technology with a potential military application be excluded from this agreement.
It would be extremely strange if the European Parliament did not support this last request.
However, to my great surprise and disappointment, I believe Members will not be able to vote on that amendment.
That is a political, not a technical, decision.
Europeans have a historic responsibility for the problems in this region.
These are responsibilities that we are far from bearing and properly discharging.
I would ask you to support the amendments I have tabled.
Â Â  Mr President, following an intense and controversial debate, the Socialist Group has decided to support the report we are dealing with.
My group has decided to distinguish between the scientific and technical nature of the report and the political nature of the conflict, while condemning the attitude of the Sharon Government which â with its policy of indiscriminate killings, with the construction of a wall which steals even more Palestinian territory and its failure to evacuate settlements â is blocking the Quartet's roadmap and making it increasingly difficult to establish a viable Palestinian State.
Furthermore, my group believes that on the issue of scientific and technical cooperation we should take particular account of the society which may benefit from that cooperation.
Talking now on my own personal behalf, I would like to say the following: in the explanatory statement, the rapporteur acknowledges that the extension of the agreement, and I quote, âcomes at a politically critical time in which the Middle East peace process is flounderingâ.
I would say that floundering is something of an understatement.
It is in such serious danger that only decisive action on the part of the Quartet, which so far has not been taken, could save it.
The rapporteur also says that, and I quote, âit may help ease the tensions, since it will also enable Palestinian researchers and institutions to work together with Israeli and European institutesâ.
I frankly doubt that this would be the case.
We are dealing with a situation of military occupation which goes much further than the concept of âtensionâ.
And, furthermore, I believe that Palestinian researchers and research institutions will find it very difficult to benefit when they are surrounded by a wall which denies them freedom of movement and which encloses them in ghettos and Bantustans which bring shame on humanity.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and my colleague Mrs McNally have both done a very good job of explaining their divergent positions.
Whenever there is a situation of problematic political conflict â and it goes without saying that Israel is one â this House finds it difficult to come to a decision.
I do believe, though, that it is a good thing to clarify what is involved, what we want to achieve, and what message this House is sending out by endorsing the position taken by the Commission and the Council.
This has to do with the continuation of cooperation and dialogue that are already going on in scientific and technological circles, and that benefit both sides.
Contrary to what has been said by some Members, this is not just about the eventual benefit to Israel; we too will benefit.
Not only will this benefit scientists, university departments and research institutes; humanity itself will benefit from cooperation and exchange between scientists, in which politicians too will have their part to play, and, as a fellow Member pointed out, society as a whole will benefit.
We are investing in a future in which â or so we hope â Europe will be able to do its bit in resolving a situation that is, in political and human terms, extremely difficult.
So I am both proud and glad that Mrs McNally, as my groupâs coordinator, has, in the groupâs discussions, always emphasised that we would endorse this report.
On just one small point, I would like to point out to the Members in the Group of the Greens, who have difficulties with the âdual useâaspect that the European Union does not support any military research, nor does our research programme cover it, so any cooperation in that area is automatically ruled out.
Â Â  . â Mr President, no questions have been put to the Commission and I have nothing to add to the debate.
On behalf of my colleague, Mr Busquin, I would simply like to thank the rapporteur and the other Members who have taken part in this debate.
I have the impression that the majority of Parliament will support this proposal, for which â again on behalf of my colleague, Mr Busquin â I should like to express gratitude.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
Â Â  â I am indignant at the conclusions of our rapporteur that these scientific exchanges cannot be affected by political considerations!
This is denying the political dimension of human rights under Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement and contradicting the Barcelona process based on respect for fundamental rights.
Israel systematically violates human rights in territories occupied by colonisation and occupation, violates democratic principles with regard to thousands of Palestinians, Israeli citizens, victims of discrimination.
Israel is violating the Geneva Convention, international law, the United Nations Charter and the Vienna Convention by not respecting the trade clauses of its association agreement.
This is a real human, ecological and political disaster.
It is an annexation, undermining the creation of a Palestinian State, ghettoising Palestinians and ruining all hopes of peace.
The EU cannot have trade or scientific relations with a third country without taking into consideration the abuses of international law that it is guilty of.
Given that the EU reacted in the former Yugoslavia and in Africa, refusing to be complicit or complacent in the face of violations of humanitarian law, why should it keep silent in the case of Israel?
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0124/2004) by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on Interoperable Delivery of pan-European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens (IDABC) (rapporteur: Imelda Mary Read).
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am delighted to present this report on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on IDABC.
I have been the rapporteur on several previous occasions and have had the pleasure of seeing the IDABC programme grow.
We have seen improvements in the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation between public administrations and what is now being proposed is that this be extended to businesses and to citizens.
The journal that the Commission publishes on IDABC often mentions the IDABC way and it is important to emphasise that the IDABC way is about eMethodology: not only about the projects, but looking at the way in which those projects are developed.
IDABC is a means to an end, a means to interactive government services at a pan-European level and it is absolutely logical to want to extend this now to businesses and to citizens.
I have submitted just three amendments after discussions with the Commission.
They are technical amendments, which will give legal clarification to the original text.
I shall spend a couple of minutes talking about why this is so important.
It is about giving value in terms of quality of services.
It is about encouraging citizens to be better informed in voicing their own praises and their own criticisms of those services.
It is about economies of scale and sharing common services.
It is true that IDABC has been a driver of modernisation of public services and a contributor, as it will continue to be, to eGovernment in the candidate countries.
It is also important that one of the achievements of IDABC is that it can give our citizens practical, very workmanlike examples of how the European Union, the Commission, Parliament, the Council have worked together to bring citizen-friendly benefits from the European Union to the Member States.
I commend the report to you.
I particularly thank my colleagues at the Commission who continue to work so hard and so effectively on this.
I also thank the Council presidency, which took its time, but did so because it wanted to put down constructive and progressive amendments that were born of its own experience of the implementation of IDABC at Member State level.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission would like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Read, for her strong support, her openness and her cooperation.
My colleague, Mr Liikanen, has asked me to convey special thanks to Mrs Read for her excellent cooperation and to say it has been a pleasure working with her over the years.
The Commission would also like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the European Parliament as a whole for its support and flexibility, which almost ensured a conclusion at first reading.
The Commission is very pleased to see that both the European Parliament and the Council have viewed the IDABC programme very favourably.
On 18 November 2003 the European Parliament gave its full support to this programme at first reading, delivering an opinion with five amendments.
The Commission amended its initial proposal accordingly and the Council common position takes the amendments suggested by Parliament into account almost word-for-word.
The Commission, like the Council, fully supports the three amendments suggested by the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry at second reading, and hopes for a favourable vote in this House tomorrow. That would allow for swift adoption by the Council.
It would also allow the Commission to prepare carefully, during the course of 2004, the transition from the current IDA programme to the new IDABC programme.
The new programme will allow the Commission to continue supporting the implementation of Community legislation, which requires that Member States and the Community exchange information, by providing financial resources and infrastructure services while also ensuring interoperability.
It will also allow the Commission to extend further the provision of pan-European eGovernment services to businesses and citizens, and to coordinate the delivery of such services in cooperation with Member States.
In conclusion, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 3.
Â Â  On behalf of the House I would like to place on record our thanks for all the work that MrsÂ Read has done on this, and on related issues, over the last 15 years.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
(1)
Â Â  Colleagues, this morning it is my sad duty to draw to your attention that in Madrid, at the height of the rush hour earlier today, there were at least five bomb blasts at three railway stations â the worst of these on a train entering the Atocha station.
Tens of people have been murdered; scores of people have been injured.
With each report the casualty list is growing.
This is, in terms of its consequence, the worst act of terror in the history of Spain, and could be the worst act of terror in living memory in any European Union state.
It is an outrageous, unjustified and unjustifiable attack on the Spanish people and on Spanish democracy.
On behalf of this Parliament, I express our heartfelt, deep, sincere sympathy and condolences to the families who have suffered loss and injury; to their friends, and, through His Majesty the King of Spain, to the people of Spain and the authorities in the city of Madrid who â even as I speak â have field hospitals in the railway station and in the streets.
A general election is to take place in Spain on Sunday.
What happened today is a declaration of war on democracy.
Let Sunday give the answer that Spanish democracy is strong; let Sunday give the answer that Spanish democracy is determined to overcome terrorism by all of the means available to that process.
In Madrid, in January, I addressed the first-ever international conference for the victims of terror.
I repeat today what I said there: in our political duty to the people of Spain and to the peoples of the European Union, it is our firm resolve that there shall be no safe haven for terrorism and terrorists in our European Union.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our firm commitment to democracy and human rights.
No more bombs.
No more deaths.
Between us, we will put an end to the terrorists.
I have instructed the services of our House, as a mark of respect, to fly the Spanish and European flags at half-mast.
I invite you, in your own way, to show your solidarity by observing a minute's silence.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0058/2004) by MrsÂ Gillig, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.
MrÂ Solbes Mira has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
Allow me, Commissioner, particularly in view of your nationality, to express to you my deepest sympathy.
Â Â  . Madam President, thank you very much.
Unfortunately, we now have to return to our work, but I would like first of all to express my complete solidarity with what President Cox has just said.
Madam President, the objective of the Commission's proposal today is to update Community Regulations (EEC) Nos 1408/71 and 574/72 in order to take account of the evolution of national legislations, to clarify the legal situation with regard to certain articles of these regulations and to take account of the recent judgments of the Court of Justice.
The present proposal, which is based on criteria endorsed by the Council, contains a new list of non-contributory benefits which are subject to specific coordination.
This coordination, based on the principle of residence, was ratified by the Court of Justice in relation to the case.
