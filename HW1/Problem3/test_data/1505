However, I believe that both institutions have demonstrated to the committee that they are on the right track, and that to some extent, they are still trying to cope with longstanding problems.
I believe, however, that discharge can be granted in these cases.
I would like to make a positive comment about MrÂ Mulder's report concerning the agencies.
We now have twelve agencies.
That is a great many and as we all know, the number is likely to increase further in line with political objectives.
However, I believe that as long as we are successful in avoiding duplication of work and setting appropriate priorities, the efficiency of these agencies will be guaranteed to a greater extent than is the case with the Commission, which is a mammoth bureaucracy.
The heads of the eleven agencies are highly qualified and have demonstrated their responsibility for their particular agency.
I would like to pay tribute to that.
I really cannot say the same of the Members of the Commission, and the agencies make a refreshing change in this respect.
After the Eurostat scandal, the dismissal of the Chief Accountant and the discovery of a completely inadequate accounting system deployed by this Commission to manage â or should I say mismanage â a budget of some EUR 100 billion, I will not be voting in favour of discharge for the Commission.
Commissioner Fischler's comments a few moments ago about Eurostat also did not tell us anything we did not already know.
I would like to find out from the Commissioner responsible why this Commission statement has just been delivered by the Agriculture Commissioner â have you concluded that Eurostat is an agricultural problem as well, or was there some other reason for this?
I am sure you will be able to enlighten us.
Combating fraud must of course continue to be a priority.
Mr Bayona's report contains a number of points on this issue.
In my view, the Commission should proceed very cautiously when amending the OLAF Regulation.
In paragraph 90 of our esteemed colleague Mr Bayona's report, we have therefore clarified a number of points to ensure that OLAF can operate independently in future too, that it can focus on internal investigations, and that the rights of persons affected are protected.
Â Â  . Mr President, since I am leaving Parliament this is my last speech and I would like to take this occasion to thank everyone who has helped me here over the past five years, in particular my own staff, my assistants and the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General on the result that we are hopefully going to deliver tomorrow, which would be a positive discharge for the European Parliament.
The cooperation has been excellent and the Secretary-General, together with all his staff, has done a very good job of running the Parliament over the last five years in the face of mounting challenges, not least of which is enlargement.
The criticism contained in my report is not aimed at Parliament's staff or the Secretary-General.
My criticism is aimed at us, the politicians, who give political direction to Parliament.
In 1999, I was elected in the Netherlands with a very low turnout of just 29%.
The main reason why people did not go and vote in the European elections was that they did not have faith in the EU institutions.
This is bad in itself, but it is also a great danger to European integration because if people do not have faith in the institutions it is very unlikely that they will support further steps in European integration.
My mission for the last five years has been to try to reform the institutions to make them more legitimate and credible in the eyes of our citizens.
We have come a long way, in particular with regard to the European Commission.
Here I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Schreyer and her colleagues who have done a great job over the last five years, again in the face of very difficult challenges.
Parliament has made progress.
People who say that this institution is just a 'gravy train' are wrong.
We have made excellent progress in modernising the institution, in modernising the administration and even the rules governing Members.
But two big eyesores remain.
One is our system of expenses, which is still not based on the actual costs incurred.
This system is indefensible to the outside world.
No matter how big the differences in salary between MEPs from different countries, and no matter how unfair that is â especially when the new Member States come in â we cannot continue to justify this system.
The vote tomorrow will be an opportunity for this House to show that we are in touch with the real world, that we are prepared to put our own House in order and to clean up our act.
The second question concerns Strasbourg.
This is a beautiful Assembly and an even more beautiful city, but we should not meet here for only four days per week.
The Commission and the Council are based in Brussels.
If we are to be a credible democratic assembly, defending the interests of the citizens of Europe, then we should be where the other powerful institutions are â with the Council and the Commission.
It was natural to come to Strasbourg when this Parliament was still a part-time Parliament, when the memories of the Second World War were still fresh and we needed a symbol of reconciliation.
But today Europe's citizens are not looking for signs of reconciliation between France and Germany.
I do not believe that anyone doubts those two countries get on together â perhaps a little too well at times!
The citizens are looking for efficient, modern institutions that are capable of managing European integration and the policies we have agreed together.
Without a doubt, the time is right for a move to Brussels. Clearly we must find a purpose for Strasbourg.
It has been built on European institutions and we must give them something in return.
We have suggested the idea of the first European university.
The buildings would be perfect for that.
Another suggestion is to let the European Council meet here rather than in Brussels.
These are the key issues that we need to address.
I hope that tomorrow we will also give President Cox a mandate to go to the Intergovernmental Conference and say that we need to change the Treaty in this respect.
We need to give Parliament the right to decide its own seat.
Today a number of MEPs held a press conference organised by the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform.
We signed a reform pledge which commits the signatories to the reform of our expenses system and to work for a single seat for Parliament in Brussels.
I hope that when we vote tomorrow we will all sign this pledge by voting for the amendments that have been tabled by a number of Groups. I am grateful to them for having done so.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  Before we discuss the two Commissioners' statements on Croatia in line with the agenda, I have a motion from President Pat Cox to read out.
He pointed out on Monday that the inclusion of additional items on Wednesday's agenda could have an impact on the time available for Question Time.
Parliament has now included additional items, namely statements on the situation in the Middle East and a debate about the vote of non-confidence, on the agenda.
Under these circumstances, and having spoken with the Council, I propose that in agreement with the groups, we cancel tomorrow's Question Time with questions to the Council.
In other words, the agenda would now continue with the debate about Croatia.
Question Time with questions to the Commission would then take place at 6.30 p.m.
Â Â  â It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to welcome the diplomatic delegation from Croatia, headed by the Croatian Foreign Minister, which is seated in the public gallery.
Â Â  â The next item is the European Commission's Opinion on the application of Croatia for membership of the European Union.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am delighted to be here today with my friend and colleague Commissioner Verheugen to present the Commission's on the possibility of opening accession negotiations with Croatia.
The Commission is also publishing today its first European partnership with Croatia, which sets out priorities for both the short term and the medium term.
In politics we very often overuse the word 'historic', but this is indeed a historic day for Croatia and this is an occasion which I know gives both Commissioner Verheugen and myself considerable personal pleasure.
Croatia is the first of the Western Balkan countries to get to this stage, although I know that â perfectly understandably â Croatia would prefer a rather different description.
Geography, as I have often said in the past in Zagreb, is not destiny.
It is not a surprise that Croatia has reached this stage well ahead of any of its neighbours.
Had it not been for the legacy of war, it might well have got to this stage on the road to membership a great deal earlier.
Croatia applied for membership in February 2003 and the Council asked us to prepare our opinion in April of that year, so it has taken us a year of hard work.
I do not apologise, however, for the time that we have needed.
Assessing a country's readiness for candidate status is one of the most important institutional duties that the Commission undertakes.
I do not want to keep honourable Members in suspense, so let me tell you straight away that the College has decided today to recommend to the Council that accession negotiations be started with Croatia in due course.
I think the applause is deserved, and if the occasion was less salubrious we could have managed a standing, rather than a crouching ovation!
Commission Verheugen and I would like to set out a little of the thinking behind the Commission's decision, and I am sure you will agree that it is important for us to say rather more clearly why we have arrived at this extremely welcome conclusion.
From the very beginning, it became clear that the most important areas for consideration were the political criteria set out in Copenhagen in 1993.
There are a number of considerations which we had to bear in mind and I will touch on the main ones.
The Croatian judiciary is â unhappily â poorly trained and organised and a huge backlog of cases is waiting to be considered.
However, the independence of the judiciary is not in question.
Croatia has a lot of work to do in improving the quality of judicial decision-making but it has â and we are convinced of this â a strategy for doing so and it now needs to implement that strategy.
Second, Croatia's relations with its neighbours have not been entirely smooth recently.
There have been difficult border disputes with Slovenia, as well as disputes over fishing rights in the Adriatic which were not helped by unilateral action by Croatia last year.
However, since the election last December, the Croatian Government has shown a willingness to resolve these disputes in a sensible way based on mutual understanding.
Third, there is the question of minority rights.
This is extremely important to the Parliament; it is extremely important to all of us as Europeans.
It is important that Croatia implements properly its legislation on minority rights.
The OSCE has also reported to us that more needs to be done to ensure that Serbian refugees currently living in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia are able to return to their homes.
However, the present government has concluded an agreement with the Croatian Serb leader, Mr Pupovac, designed to achieve that effect.
There is still much to be done, however, but progress is being made: we welcome that and we are assured that it will continue.
Perhaps the most difficult issue, as it is throughout the region, has been the question of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia â ICTY.
Our position is straightforward and it is well known: in line with regular conclusions of the European Council, we require that all the countries of the Western Balkans cooperate fully with the tribunal as a non-negotiable condition for progress down the Stabilisation and Association Process.
We rely for our assessment on the opinion of the tribunal itself.
Until recently, Croatia's record was far from perfect â though I recognise that efforts were being made.
However, in recent months, cooperation has been greatly improved.
It is particularly worthy of note that two groups of indictments involving eight people, both Croats and Bosnian Croats, were dealt with speedily and without fuss by the Croatian Government.
All eight were transferred to The Hague within a week or so of their indictments.
There remains the question of former General Ante Gotovina.
He has been indicted for very serious crimes and remains at large.
Commissioner Verheugen and I consulted the chief prosecutor of the tribunal and she gave both of us very clear advice.
She concluded that Croatia was fully complying with the tribunal, and saw no likelihood of that situation changing.
As far as the Gotovina case was concerned, she indicated that the Croatian Government was doing all it could to help locate him and turn him over to The Hague.
We asked the referee, the referee gave us her decision and I do not believe that it is for us to try to second-guess her.
So, both our criteria have been met in full and the way is now clear for a positive assessment on this crucial issue.
I must just add one thing: as we say in the , it is extremely important that Croatia continues to cooperate fully with the tribunal and that, in particular, the Croatians demonstrate very clearly that they are doing everything they can to locate and apprehend the remaining indictee.
It is a matter for the Irish presidency to choose the date for the Council's consideration of our ; I know that Member States will be watching this question very closely between now and then.
I repeat that this moment gives me considerable pleasure.
I would like to congratulate all those with whom we have worked over the past few years, and who have laid the foundations for this decision.
I would like to congratulate the present government on what it has done, and I hope this moment will be one for celebration in Croatia.
With that I will hand you over to my colleague Commissioner Verheugen, who will indicate to the Parliament some of the other parts of the and give you some indication of the next steps.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my immense pleasure and gratification that the great ideal of European unity has once again exerted its powerful appeal.
Yet again, we see that it is the prospect of European integration and membership of the European Union that is the most powerful force driving forward the process of political and economic reform in a country which, until recently, was being torn apart by war, civil war and violence.
My friend and colleague Chris Patten has already spoken about the political criteria.
I would like to add a few words about the other, equally important, accession criteria.
First of all, there is the issue of Croatia's economic performance.
The question is whether the country meets the requirements of a market economy as we expect it to do and whether it has the capacity to cope with competitive pressure within the internal market.
The findings of our analyses are very clear and very gratifying: Croatia is already better placed than most of the countries joining on 1 May at the time when their accession negotiations opened.
Croatia can already be regarded as a functioning market economy, and provided that the policies of economic reform are continued, it should be able to cope with competitive pressure within the internal market in the medium term.
The Croatian economy is already very strongly intermeshed with the economy of the European Union and is clearly outperforming the economies of Bulgaria and Romania, for example, whose accession is envisaged for 2007.
From the economic perspective, we therefore see no problems or risks arising if accession negotiations are opened with Croatia.
As regards the extremely difficult criterion concerning progress in adoption and implementation of the Community : by their very nature, my comments can only be a prospective assessment.
After all, adoption of the is the subject of the negotiations, not the prerequisite for their commencement.
Nonetheless, our prospective assessment for Croatia is very positive, and we believe that Croatia will be able to undertake the necessary legislative alignment in all chapters of the within the medium termwhile at the same time strengthening the structures that are necessary for its genuine and effective implementation.
Here, Croatia will rely on our help, and it goes without saying that the Commission is prepared to grant Croatia the same support and advice that it has provided over the last few years to the countries which are due to accede on 1 May.
Here too, then, our assessment is positive.
As regards the next steps, as MrÂ Patten has already said, it is a matter for the Council to decide whether and when the accession negotiations will open.
Before these negotiations can formally begin, a comprehensive screening exercise needs to be undertaken.
This entails a full review of the entire and the extent to which it has been adopted and implemented in Croatia, so that we know exactly what needs to be covered in the negotiations.
In other words, this is a normal procedure which is likely to take some time.
Only then can the negotiations on the various chapters begin.
A tailor-made pre-accession strategy will also have to be developed for Croatia, and the Commission is already dealing with this.
As regards timing, my advice would be that it is premature to talk about timetables at this stage: we should not take the second step before the first.
The pace of the process will depend on Croatia's capacity and determination to achieve real progress, both during the preparation and in the negotiations themselves.
The Commission will assess progress fairly and objectively and will measure the progress of the negotiations on this basis.
I believe that the Commission's recommendation sends an important and powerful signal not only to Croatia but to the entire region.
It shows the other countries in the region which, for a variety of reasons, still have a long way to go before they come close to fulfilling the criteria, that intensive efforts pay off and that the European Union responds appropriately to the efforts of a country wishing to join the EU, and recognises that country's achievements.
Â Â  Many thanks, Commissioner Verheugen, for providing such a precise analysis for the benefit of the delegation from Croatia.
In line with the system, I have now noted down four requests to speak.
I draw your attention to Rule 38, which states that after a statement by the Commission, Members âmay put brief and concise questionsâ.
Please note that in this instance, âconciseâ means one minute.
Â Â  â Mr President, my congratulations to Commissioner Patten, Commissioner Verheugen and Minister Zuzul, who has worked hard over the last several months to make up the large amount of ground lost by Croatia.
My question is a very simple one, Mr Patten: do you think that Great Britain will take steps to cooperate more effectively with the Hague tribunal by using its troops stationed in Bosnia?
It is in fact now clear that its argument that Croatia was not ready to become a member of the European Union is no longer valid since Mrs Del Ponte has given you and Mr Verheugen assurances that Croatia is cooperating fully with the Hague tribunal.
Can we also expect the United Kingdom to call for the setting up of an international tribunal for Chechnya so that it can further demonstrate its desire to strengthen international justice?
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the prospect of Croatia's accession, not only in itself, but also, as Commissioner Verheugen said, as a practical demonstration of the EU's commitment to the eventual accession of other Balkan countries.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has received assurances from Croatia that it will help other countries in the region qualify for EU membership.
I note in Commissioner Patten's report on the assessment by Carla Del Ponte that Croatia is complying in full with ICTY and doing all it can to find General Gotovina.
Until recently we could not be sure that such efforts were genuinely being made.
Is it the understanding of the Commissioner that the UK and the Netherlands will now ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement?
The UK Minister for Europe has now declared himself convinced of the efforts to find General Gotovina. Previously this was not the case and he pointed out, for instance, that General Gotovina's lawyer knew how to find him, but nobody else did.
This is very important, because if we do not carry on the search for General Gotovina, how can we push for the capture of Radavan Karadzic and General Mladic?
Â Â  â Mr President, as rapporteur for the report on the relevant recommendation to the Council, I am well satisfied today by the positive opinion of the committee on the accession of Croatia to the European Union.
My question, Commissioner, is not difficult, but I understand the difficulty which you have in giving a specific reply.
Will there, in your opinion, be some timetable up to the final stage of the accession of Croatia?
I also have a question for Mr Verheugen: does he believe in the light of his experience that, by the time Romania and Bulgaria join in 2007, Croatia will be ready with these countries to become a member of the European Union?
Â Â  .
Mr President, perhaps I could answer the first two of those questions, since the third was put directly to my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, and in the light of his experience in dealing so successfully with enlargement I can refer that to him â although I will have a go if he likes!
In response to Mr Dupuis, I say with all modesty â and it perhaps reflects the failures of my political career â that is a good 12 years since I have been able to say 'speaking on behalf of the British Government'.
So my ability to respond on behalf of Her Majesty's administration in London is somewhat limited.
I am sure that the United Kingdom Government will, as ever, take close note of what the honourable Member has said and I am sure â this also relates to the point that Baroness Ludford made â that both the government in the United Kingdom and the government in the Netherlands will want to reflect on the issue of ratification in view of the comments of the chief prosecutor at The Hague.
I had noticed what the British Minister of State, Denis McShane, my old school mate, said yesterday in the region.
He felt himself able to announce that we were going to make this very positive decision today, so we welcome his support.
I would like to respond to what the honourable Member said about regional cooperation.
In the last year there have been one or two difficulties, for example the dispute with Slovenia, which we regret and which we hope can now be resolved.
It has, however, been a consistent feature of the way that governments have behaved over the last few years.
Both Mr Racan's government and the present government have played an extremely positive role in working to resolve the problems in the region.
I would like to pay a personal tribute to the former Foreign Minister, Mr Picula, who did a great deal to work constructively with the region, and I know that his successor will not mind me doing this.
I am sure Mr Zuzul will follow that lead and I know that he and the Prime Minister have already taken steps which have encouraged others in the region to regard Croatia as an extremely cooperative partner.
My colleague Commissioner Verheugen may wish to add to what I have to say on the question of the timetable, but in my experience from watching him deal with enlargement over the last few years, the timetable depends above all on the efforts made by the states concerned.
If I may offer one word of advice to the Croatian government it is that it should concentrate its energies, as it has done in the last few years, on substance rather than process.
It should concentrate on getting on with making changes which will still be required, rather than focusing its energies on asking about dates and speculating about dates.
Â Â  Mr President, as there is so little time, two very short questions.
First, the reservation of the British and Dutch Governments up to now has already been referred to.
I know how convincing Mr Patten and Mr Verheugen can be, so I assume that the people in The Hague and in London also listen to them.
May I assume for the time being that negotiations with Croatia will not start as long as the Stabilisation and Association Agreement has not been ratified?
To be certain, I would like to put this question to the Commission.
Second, I am pleased that the chief prosecutor, Mrs Del Ponte, is positive now, but it seems to me important that she also remains so in the future.
Is the Commission willing to recommend that this very specific tribunal, the chief prosecutor herself, continues to be involved in the future with monitoring Croatia's cooperation with this tribunal?
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I would like to say how delighted I am that this day has arrived.
As Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South-East Europe, and on behalf of all those who have no opportunity to speak today, I would like to express my warm thanks to the two Commissioners.
I think we should all be more than satisfied by Mr Patten's and Mr Verheugen's statements, including the factual information they have supplied.
They have amply justified why Croatia can now be granted accession candidate status.
My question is this, and it has already been asked several times: what opportunities do the Commission and, indeed, this Parliament have to persuade the Council that it should grant this candidate status swiftly so that negotiations can be opened soon?
I endorse the points made by MrÂ Lagendijk.
Can we do anything to prevent the failure so far to sign the Stability Pact from being viewed as an impediment to the opening of negotiations?
This is an important issue, and we would very much appreciate a response from one of the Commissioners.
Once again, my warmest thanks and my congratulations on today's momentous decision.
Â Â  . Mr President, on the question of cooperation with the Tribunal, I would confirm again that the judgment on whether Croatia is cooperating fully in this regard can only be made by the Tribunal itself.
We are not in a position to make a judgment from our own knowledge and experience, and as Mr Patten has just said, we have agreed that the International Criminal Tribunal will be the referee on this issue and we do have a clear picture at present.
Should this clear picture change in future as a result of statements by the Tribunal, this would impact on the process that we are initiating with Croatia today.
That is understood, and that is why I reiterate that this cooperation with the Tribunal must be viewed as satisfactory not only on one occasion but of course on an ongoing basis.
On Mrs Pack's question, all I can say is that to my knowledge, the European Council plans to deal with this issue in June.
However, that is a matter for the Irish Presidency.
The Commission will not intervene in any way.
We have timed the presentation of our report so that the Council has enough time to prepare itself before reaching a decision at the European Council meeting in June.
In my experience, the European Council is always grateful for guidance and advice from the European Parliament.
That is not meant at all ironically.
Such guidance from the European Parliament would undoubtedly be helpful.
Â Â  Mr President, as Co-Chairman of the Social Affairs Section of the Stability Pact for the countries of South-Eastern Europe, I am naturally delighted about the fact that Croatia has prospects of accession.
I have always been surprised, especially with regard to the social-economic aspects, that Romania and Bulgaria would be able to enter in 2007 and Croatia, that is further on socially and economically than both these countries, not.
I have two concrete questions.
First, the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange Office for the Western Balkan countries is supposed to have become operational in March.
My question is: has that now finally happened?
Europe has been promising to do a number of things for so long now, but it usually takes a very long time.
My second question concerns the regional coordination centre for social policy for the Balkans.
That was also supposed to be set up somewhere this year.
My question is: where will this be, when will this happen, etc?
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I too would like to voice my very great pleasure at the Commission's Communication, the prior deliberations, and the positive decision.
Above all, I would like to express my thanks to the two Commissioners who are here today.
I believe, and I say this also in my capacity as Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee â Slovenia being Croatia's immediate neighbour â that we have taken a major step forward, and it is a positive step.
I have one specific question: are any efforts being made by the European Commission to assist the two countries of Slovenia and Croatia to resolve their border issue in the Piran Bay so that a solution can be reached here as swiftly as possible in a European spirit?
Let me make one further comment in conclusion, which refers back to Commissioner Verheugen's statements: we have duly noted that the Council is grateful for guidance.
As Parliament, we often wish that the Council would show greater receptiveness to the House's guidance.
However, this comment is directed at the Council itself, not at you.
Â Â  .
The TAIEX operation has been up and running for about six months, and a seminar for the countries in the region was held last autumn.
It is an extremely important part of the strategy we have been developing since the Thessaloniki European Council.
We have worked with both Croatia and Slovenia to try to facilitate the settlement of their disagreements.
Clearly, this is principally a matter for them, but we stand ready to use our good offices where these might be helpful.
This is something that both Commissioner Verheugen and I have already been involved in.
In my experience, parliaments always want to be taken even more seriously than they are, and sometimes even more seriously than they deserve.
That was at least true of a parliament of which I was once a Member.
However, this Parliament in particular deserves to be treated very seriously, not least as its mandate draws to a close.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B5-0071/2004).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr Ebner, the Directives establishing the internal market in electricity include general principles and lay down minimum legal provisions.
Nevertheless, the Member States are free to apply these Directives in the manner they consider most appropriate to satisfying national conditions and needs, and also to establish stricter minimum rules provided that they conform to Community rules and, in particular, the principles of the Treaty.
In other words, we are leaving a margin for subsidiarity in order to adapt and apply the Directives in the most appropriate way in line with the reality and diversity of the various Member States.
The Commission considers it essential to guarantee a common level of true openness of the electricity markets of the various States and under equal conditions.
Within this context, following the adoption of Directive 96/92/EC, that is, the first Directive on electricity, the Commission published an annual comparative evaluation report in which it examined the application of the internal market in gas and electricity in all the States of the Union.
These reports demonstrated a significant difference between the true levels of openness of the market.
This led the Commission to propose a second package of legislative measures to complete the internal market in electricity and to prevent the tensions and distortions which were arising and these measures include Directive 2003/54/EC and Regulation 1228/2003, which Parliament and the Council adopted last June and which will enter into force in July 2004.
The new legislation lays down common minimum rules on market openness which are much higher both in quantitative terms, that is to say, the minimum level of openness of the market, and in qualitative terms: legal separation, regulated access for third countries etc.
With regard to the quantitative measures, two stages are proposed: a first stage, July 2004, when the consumer market other than homes has to be opened up to competition, and in July 2007, 100% of the market.
In any event, this will result in a reduction of the current asymmetries between the various European Union markets, and will make it possible to achieve what has been the aim since the first Directive: to integrate the European area into a single electricity and gas market, doing away with the borders that remain today and preventing something we do not want: 15 markets, or 25 markets from 1 May, in electricity and gas.
This is not our aim.
Our aim is to create a European market, an integrated single market in electricity and gas.
Â Â  Commissioner de Palacio, first of all my thanks for the information provided.
Could the Commission, though, let us know how this control of the application of these minimum standards takes place and to what extent counter-measures are being adopted where these minimum standards are not being observed?
Â Â  . Guaranteeing minimum standards depends on the transposition of Directives, and now also the Regulation, on the part of the various States of the Union, which is carefully analysed by the Commission in order to ascertain whether they are complied with and whether that transposition is carried out in such a way that those minimum standards are applied.
In any event, we are going to continue carrying out periodic analyses of the true picture of the implementation of the measures adopted and naturally â I repeat â if any Member State fails to implement the Directives and Regulations properly and does not put them into practice appropriately, Mr Ebner, I have no doubt that we will bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg, as we did in certain cases in which there was a delay, for example, in implementing the gas Directive or, simply, a transposition not complying with the content of the Directive.
In both cases we referred the matter to the Court of Justice and we resolved them amicably with the States in question without the need for an arduous procedure.
I can tell you that we will naturally use all means available to us to ensure that the markets are indeed opened up to competition but also that they are integrated into a European market.
Â Â  Commissioner, I wish to ask, what is your assessment of the integration of the Iberian electricity market, given that it has recently experienced some setbacks and that the agreement entering into force will only be provisional?
Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the integration of the Iberian electricity market, which is, when all is said and done, our closest market?
Â Â  . I hope that, although some months late, this integration can be carried out.
Integrating the Iberian market is a very ambitious task.
There is also a merging of certain bodies and, furthermore, I believe that recently a certain well-known person has been appointed or selected, who is going to do an excellent job of his new responsibilities in relation to development, specifically on the Portuguese side, as the former Portuguese Minister for the Economy is well aware, and I hope that it will soon be a reality.
Furthermore, I hope that this will serve to facilitate not just an integrated Iberian market, but also the incorporation of that market into the European market as a whole.
In this regard, we have already talked about other chapters, both the infrastructures for interconnecting the Iberian Peninsula with the rest of the Continent via France, which are needed, and also the regulation we have adopted, the application of which I hope will facilitate trade.
The voluntary agreements which have been implemented are functioning in a very positive way and are facilitating exchanges in the electricity sector to an enormous degree.
Our new goal is gas, which is the issue we are currently working on in Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
Furthermore, I am glad to see this Iberian brotherliness in relation to the electricity market.
This is always good news for Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the final high-level meeting of the European Union Multistakeholder Forum on corporate social responsibility will be held on 29 June 2004, when it will approve its final report on its work and on its conclusions and submit it to the European Commission.
The Forum's report is expected to contain three main sections. A confirmation of the principles agreed at international and European level, an analysis of the factors which hamper and the factors which contribute to the success of corporate social responsibility and a series of recommendations on corporate social responsibility for the attention of the members of the Forum or the institutions of the European Union and other agencies.
The report will be based on the results of discussions and the knowledge acquired from a series of round table events held between January 2003 and March 2004 in order to analyse some 50 multilateral case studies.
As stated in the Commission communication on corporate social responsibility in June 2002 and in the interim review of the social political agenda in March 2003, the Commission will evaluate the results of the Forum and will issue a new communication a few months after the submission of the Forum's report.
The European Parliament has been involved in the Multistakeholder Forum procedure since the outset, with the MEP Richard Howitt acting as observer.
Consequently, he will be invited to the high-level meeting on 29 June and will receive a copy of the Forum's report as soon as it has been approved and submitted to the Commission.
The new communication on corporate social responsibility will be addressed to the institutions of the European Union.
I therefore expect the dialogue on this matter to continue and to bear fruit.
Â Â  I understand it must be difficult for the Commission to give more precise answers in these final months.
However, I want to make it clear that to many Members of this Parliament, across many different committees â I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation â this piece of work on corporate social responsibility is extremely important.
We would like to see a clear timetable emerging in June, and not postponement to some vague point in the future.
I am very pleased that the Commissioner responsible for development has come in at this point as I wish to ask which Commission department â Social Affairs or other â will continue to lead in this area, and how coordination will continue within the Commission, because this issue cuts across many different departments there.
I would also like to ensure that a range of parliamentary committees are also involved in the follow-up.
This is an issue of extreme importance to Members of this Parliament and, if we are re-elected, we will keep pushing it forward.
Â Â  . First of all, with the Forum, the Commission wagered on the willingness and ability of the various sides to cooperate in a constructive manner and to develop a joint approach to European corporate social responsibility and, of course, the Commission will endeavour to make the maximum possible use of the results of the Forum's discussions and report.
It is very positive that all the agencies invited to take part in the Forum accepted the invitation and that significant progress has been made and that everyone has agreed, as you said, for the process to continue.
Of course, the Commission sees the Forum not as an advisory committee or as an opportunity for friendly professional discussion, but as a challenging experiment and as an excellent opportunity for the various interested parties to develop a joint approach to this issue.
The Forum's objective is to give credibility to this entire process.
The Commission is therefore waiting for the specific results and, moreover, for a roadmap to be drawn up with the action which needs to be taken not only by the European Commission, but also by the members of the Forum themselves, either alone or jointly with others.
A study is due to be submitted in about October 2004.
Â Â  Following on from the question about the timetable, I should like to make a comment.
Commissioner, you mentioned quite correctly that it has been helpful to have a representative from Parliament and how glad you were that Mr Howitt could be there.
I am glad that Mr Howitt was there for some of the time because he was rapporteur for the Green Paper.
However, I hope that you were also glad that I was there for some of the time as rapporteur on the White Paper.
The intention is that I will be the parliamentary representative on 19 June, as an observer, to which I look forward.
I believe that formal invitations will only be sent on 17 May, which is after Parliament has risen.
It would be helpful if the invitations could be officially sent earlier.
It would also be helpful â and perhaps the Commissioner could confirm this â if the invitations were accompanied by a draft of the proposals that will be discussed in June.
I am sure that those who attend â and not just the observers â would wish to have as much notice as possible of the proposals for discussion rather than just find out what they are on the day they arrive.
Â Â  . We shall try to comply with the requests for invitations and draft proposals.
Â Â  . First of all I should like to say that the Commission wishes to express its deepest concern about the consequences which the factory closures announced by Bombardier will have on job losses.
I must tell you that the vice-president of the company sent me a letter informing the Commission of its restructuring plans.
In the reply which I sent a short while ago, I express our acute concern and repeat the basic principles which we consider are of fundamental importance in managing restructuring.
Restructuring can have serious repercussions on the social fabric of any region, especially in those regions in which there is already little potential for job creation.
The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it is using all its powers in this sector.
These powers are, first, the legislative measures which exist.
We have various directives which seek to guarantee that the workers are fully involved in the decision-making procedure in the event of restructuring.
The directive on collective redundancies, the directive on European works councils and the more recent directive on informing and consulting workers constitute the legal framework for protecting workers' rights and safeguarding equivalent conditions.
Secondly, there are the Structural Funds, which provide important economic support for economic and social change in areas with structural difficulties.
They support the adaptation and modernisation of education, training and employment policies and systems, mainly with the objective of increasing the adaptability and employability of workers.
Furthermore, in 2002, the Commission requested the opinion of the social partners on a text entitled âAnticipating and managing change â a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuringâ.
The document in question advocated an approach to corporate restructuring which balanced the interests of businesses facing changes with the interests of workers in danger of losing their jobs.
The Commission accepted with satisfaction the joint text submitted to it by the social partners in October 2003.
Restructuring is also included as a key topic in the joint programme of work approved by the social partners in November 2002.
The social partners' text is based on experience gleaned from certain case studies on modern restructuring conditions relating to issues of vial importance to successful change management.
We need to make use of these guidelines in order to respond better to the challenges which we face in this particular sector.
They include: the need for changes to be explained and for the reasons for them to be stated, the importance of maintaining and developing workers' skills, the importance of complementarity and cooperation between the various factors when restructuring affects an entire region, the particular situation of small- and medium-sized enterprises and the practical aspects of managing restructuring, which include the importance of investigating all possible alternative solutions in order to avoid redundancies.
I should like at this point to inform you that the Commission started consultations with the social partners today on how the European works councils established by Community directive about ten years ago can respond more effectively to the challenges of a changing economic and social environment.
Finally, we must not forget our important work on corporate social responsibility and the European Observatory for Industrial Change.
I honestly hope that, in the case of the restructuring which concerns us today, every effort has been made to restrict the social repercussions in the area.
Â Â  Commissioner, I am sorry to say that you have taken refuge in broader issues to the extent that you have almost glossed over the behaviour of the multinational as regards the industrial restructuring it is carrying out.
You call it industrial restructuring, but I would call it a âprocess of industrial cannibalismâ: in other words, bought companies as going concerns, absorbed them and then closed down some of these industrial units in various European countries â so far in six, including my own country, Portugal.
I believe, however, that behaviour of this kind is unfair.
The Commission and the European institutions must, of course, concern themselves with ensuring freedom of competition â this is one of our golden rules â but legislation must also be enacted against the behaviour of multinationals or companies undertaking restructuring operations that sometimes border on the criminal because they will destroy the extremely important industrial legacy of knowledge, skills and know-how, as happened at , in Portugal.
Rules must also be drafted to protect against the practice of relocation itself.
We are entering a new phase and the Commission must have an industrial policy and protect its industry, without indulging in protectionism.
Â Â  .
I am not trying to hide behind general observations, I simply have to say and to make clear that the Commission does not have the authority either to prevent or to postpone the closure which, from what I have understood, has already taken place.
It is up to the social partners and other third parties to negotiate a possible re-examination of the closure with the company.
Nonetheless, the Commission does hope that it will be possible to find an acceptable solution in order to moderate the significant impact on the regions affected by this restructuring.
As for whether or not these actions by the company are legal, I have to say that the legislation of the European Union on these issues consists of directives which have been properly transposed into national legislation and specific national laws.
It is therefore up to the national authorities, including the judicial authorities, to assess the extent to which national legislation has been duly and effectively applied.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to start by providing some background to this case.
In a memorandum dated 17Â March, the executive board of informed the workers in its factory in Amadora, Portugal, about the restructuring of the group, in particular involving the termination of 5Â 680 positions in various European countries by the end of 2005.
In Portugal, 400 direct jobs will be lost, not counting the indirect jobs that depend on .
The Portuguese Government has made every possible effort to keep this factory in the country and above all to ensure that jobs are not lost.
Investment in the railways and in high-speed trains has been planned and yet the Amadora factory announced its definitive closure for the end of May, citing a lack of orders for rolling stock.
The situation facing Portuguese workers is of enormous concern and the following questions, therefore, must be asked: is the rolling stock industry crucial to the European Union or not?
Is the Commission or is it not willing to adopt measures, specifically under its transport policy, which will not only save this sector, but also stimulate its development?
These measures must not only ensure that jobs are preserved in this sector but also prevent Europe from becoming dependent on other countries.
Â Â  . Of course it is only logical that we should worry when factories or businesses close and when workers are laid off because, apart from the resultant social problems and unemployment, we also have problems of certain products going out of production, such as the specific products manufactured by this company, which are very important technologically and can, of course, also contribute to technological progress in the countries of Europe.
I must also say that this specific company, Bombardier, has 35 factories in Europe, a large number of which are, of course, closing.
It is closing seven factories, six in the European Union and one in Switzerland, but it nonetheless continues to maintain numerous factories in various areas and employ several thousand workers.
That being so, no one can disagree with what you said earlier about our needing to try to make our industry competitive so that we can also maintain high standards of technology and keep employment at as high a level as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to say the following to you: there have been many relocations by multinationals in Portugal; unemployment today stands at alarming levels, with more than 500Â 000 people unemployed in a country whose economically active population is less than five million.
I think that this demonstrates the seriousness of the situation.
The case of in Portugal, however, formerly known as , constitutes a real economic and social crime because this is the only company that we have in the railway carriage manufacturing sector, which uses high technology that has been developed over the years, because its closure renders our country entirely dependent on other countries and because, with these workers becoming unemployed, we will lose knowledge that has been built up over decades.
This is an economic and social crime.
I wish to ask, Commissioner, how can the European Commission claim to be committed to combating poverty, to creating jobs, to building railways and to environmental, economic and social development, when it allows this to happen with a Canadian multinational in a country like Portugal, which is experiencing serious economic and social problems?
Â Â  . I think what you say demonstrates and underlines the need to make a success of the Lisbon objectives.
We should make our economy more competitive because only if industries and businesses are competitive can we have better technology, produce all the products you mentioned previously (whether technologically advanced or not) and have more and better jobs in the European Union.
Â Â  I should like to point out to the House that significantly more jobs are being lost in four plants in the United Kingdom as a result of this closure than anywhere else.
I am glad, therefore, to have the opportunity to ask some questions and to send our sympathies to those people involved.
My questions are actually directed to Mr Bolkestein, and I hope you will allow him to answer them, as the issue is about how well the European rolling stock market is really operating and whether public procurement rules really are operating successfully ...
...
I hope in that case that Dimas will be able to pass my questions on.
They are important and highly relevant to this discussion.
In France, for example, there is not, according to my information, one single piece of rolling stock running on railways that is not manufactured in France, and yet in the United Kingdom a large number of rolling stock units are imported from across Europe.
I do not mind that because the single market for rolling stock should be allowed to work.
However, it is seems to me that the public procurement market is not working satisfactorily in the area of rolling stock.
We should ask the Commission to look at this.
We should also ask you, Commissioner Dimas, to ask your Observatory for Industrial Change to look at the whole scenario for employment in the railway rolling stock industry, as it is already doing, for example, in the automotive industry.
Â Â  .
Yes, I shall ask the Observatory to have a look at unemployment in the railway sector and the industries connected with it.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Dimas.
We have completed the half hour of urgent questions and we will now move on to the second part.
The Commission has accepted just one question to MrsÂ Schreyer and then several to Mr Bolkestein.
Mr FÃ€rm has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, I have expressly put a question to Mrs Schreyer about the future financing of Info-Points and Carrefour offices.
However, even though she has only one other question to answer, she does not want to have a debate on my question.
I have contacted our services to ask them why.
They tell me that they have been in touch with the Commission and the reason is that this is not the responsibility of Commissioner Schreyer but of Mr Prodi.
The problem is that Mr Prodi never comes here to answer questions, so I will simply receive a written reply.
I would really like to question what the Commission says about whose responsibility this is.
The Info-Points problem is caused by the new Financial Regulation, which is the responsibility of Mrs Schreyer, and the solution will have to be found in the next budget, which is also the responsibility of Mrs Schreyer.
Therefore, it seems to me that this is only a way of avoiding a sensitive debate.
That is not acceptable, and I would ask the President of Parliament to look into this.
I would be very happy if Mrs Schreyer would comment on this.
Â Â  We cannot open a debate on this matter now.
The President has taken very good note and we will forward this communication to the Commission.
You are aware that questions in Part III are not replied to orally but in writing.
We shall return to the agenda, and I promise you that we have taken very good note, and Mrs Schreyer will reply to the next question.
Â Â  .
The criteria that the Commission takes into account for converting pilot projects into preparatory actions and then into multiannual programmes are essentially based on the evaluation of the results of the project or action, the response from the specialised sectors involved and the political will expressed by the budgetary and legislative authorities to pursue the action.
A pilot project may start some three to five years before the possible adoption of a legal base, provided that the results of the pilot scheme are positive and that the preparatory action decided by the budgetary authority is successful.
E-learning and Daphne are examples of this process.
In 2001 the Commission shared with Parliament the idea of proposing a preparatory action to stimulate and accelerate integration of the use of information and communication technologies in education and training, in developing synergies amongst public and private stakeholders.
The results of the preparatory action were positive with regard to the opportunity and convenience of sustained support for these innovative synergy projects, and the e-learning programme was born.
The Daphne programme came into force in 2000, after the Commission had implemented pilot and preparatory actions in 1997, 1998 and 1999, in which year a legal base was proposed and adopted.
Under Daphne, measures were funded to support non-governmental organisations and the voluntary sector active in combating violence against children, young persons and women.
The European Parliament strongly supported both these programmes.
As provided for in Article 49 of the financial regulation, the Commission will, when the preliminary draft budget for 2005 is published, also provide the budgetary authority with an assessment of the results of pilot schemes and preparatory actions entered in the budget for 2004.
The same assessment was provided last year in the preliminary draft budget for 2004.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I understand the point you are making in terms of preparatory action, but I wondered whether you could comment on whether actual budgetary provision will be covered under the action taken in the 2005 budgets.
Pilot schemes, as you say, are being carried out and I was interested not so much in assessments but in whether proper provision within the budgets for preparatory action will be included.
Â Â  .
The means for continuing the preparatory action on the pilot project, which had started, will be in the budget proposal.
As you know, the Interinstitutional Agreement contains clear provisions as to how much can be made available for preparatory actions.
We will leave a margin for this purpose in Category 3, so that when there are new preparatory actions as a first step for pilot projects, there will be the means and a margin available.
In the last two years there were good preliminary discussions between the Commission and Parliament on ideas for preparatory actions and pilot projects.
That exercise was successful and I hope that we can continue in this way.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
Â Â  .
As Parliament knows, the European Union process to review the capital requirements rules is taking place in parallel with the review of the international rules being carried out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
As I recently told Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission continues to make good progress on this matter.
It is intended to put forward a proposal for a directive to be adopted shortly after final agreement is reached in Basle by the middle of this year.
Furthermore, in response to the request by the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, the Commission commissioned an impact study and report from Pricewaterhouse Coopers.
The final version of this report has now been made available to the Commission.
Its conclusions are positive.
The new risk-sensitive framework will be good for financial institutions, good for consumers and good for the economy as a whole, with a more efficient allocation of capital.
The report also identifies some defined areas where the proposals contained in the Commission's third consultative paper should be further improved.
That work is under way.
Arrangements are also in hand for the report to be discussed with interested Members of Parliament very shortly.
The key factor is that the report should be made available in good time to inform the European legislative process.
That will be the case.
The last part of Mr Karas' question concerns the issues on which there is still no agreement in the Basel Committee.
As regards the Basel Agreement, only a few issues remain to be finalised by the middle of this year.
These include the question of the treatment of undrawn credit card lines, recalibration in the light of the Madrid decision to move to an unexpected-loss-only approach and what is termed the 'stress loss given defaults' question.
I am confident that those issues will be resolved by June.
The Commission's proposal for a directive will be complete and stable.
Â Â  Commissioner Bolkestein, I cannot imagine that you feel very comfortable answering my question, for if I have understood you correctly over recent years, you yourself would probably have liked to see more dynamism and more professionalism in the preparation and implementation of the SME study.
You are fobbing me off.
You say that the findings of this study are available.
In that case, why have we not received them?
You say that the report identifies some areas where the proposals contained in the Commission's third consultative paper should be amended.
What are these amendments?
You say that we will receive the report in good time.
However, today is officially Parliament's last sitting.
It seems to me that omissions have been made here and I urge and request you to make the latest information and the findings of the study available to the market, the Council and Parliament as swiftly as possible.
I am certainly not aware of any arrangements for interested Members to discuss the report with the Commission.
Â Â  .
The timetable I discussed with Parliament at various times will be adhered to.
The Basel Committee expects to reach a conclusion by the middle of this year.
Shortly thereafter the Commission will put forward a proposal for a directive, to be discussed under the system of codecision.
The report by Pricewaterhouse Coopers has now been made available to the Commission and it will be brought to the notice of Parliament very shortly.
It is indeed true that time for the present Parliament is short but I can do no more than tell Parliament that the results of that study will be brought to the attention of Parliament very shortly.
I am afraid that Mr Karas and other Members of Parliament will have to take it as it is.
I cannot work on the study any faster but I look forward to discussing these issues, if not before the parliamentary elections then after the summer, even though personally I would be more than happy to discuss with interested Members of Parliament, elections or no elections, the implications of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers study.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, I would also like to thank Mr Karas, because the Basel II agenda is naturally very important for us and the study by PricewaterhouseCoopers is an important basis for the amendments that we can still make to the Basel II rules.
For us in this House, however, it is especially important to find out how the introduction of Basel II will impact on our small- and medium-sized businesses in particular and which tasks still have to be addressed by the finance ministers and others in order to ensure the successful introduction of Basel II.
I think that here, the Commission should demonstrate, with some form of best-practice/benchmark impact analysis, how the successful introduction of Basel II can be guaranteed.
Â Â  .
As I said earlier in reply to a question from Mr Karas, the Pricewaterhouse Coopers study will be made available very shortly and its results are positive: it takes a positive view of the impact of the Basel agreement on small- and medium-sized enterprises.
For example, there are discounts in the capital charges for lending to smaller entities.
SME loans below a certain threshold â namely EUR 1 million â may be included in the retail portfolio, which has lower capital requirements.
The results of the third impact study show that the new rules are good news for loans to SMEs.
As far as venture capital is concerned, there is wide acceptance that such investments have a higher level of risk, which is why it is called risk capital.
The capital requirements proposed in our third consultation paper reflect that higher level of risk.
At the same time, we have been working with industry to see whether there are data that may suggest that for certain types of investment lower requirements may be justified.
We have not yet finalised our proposals in this regard, but, overall, it is recognised in many circles that the results of the Basel exercise â as it is now known â are beneficial for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Bolkestein to go ahead with this initiative and that the work relating to the study and the proposed directive begin as soon as possible.
We must remember that SMEs are the greatest providers of work in the European Union and, specifically in my region, Valencia, are the biggest employers.
We believe that all measures aimed at enhancing the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union are necessary and we would therefore ask the Commission that this proposed directive â which, amongst other things, should deal with the tax differences between the Member States, with a view to harmonising them â clearly benefit small- and medium-sized businesses, which, I repeat, are the biggest employers in our European Union.
Â Â  .
I agree entirely with the statement that employment depends on the health of SMEs.
The Commission will do its best to bring the proposed directive to the notice of Parliament as quickly as possible.
Therefore, we shall do what the honourable Member has just asked.
Â Â  I would like to remind you that today is the last Question Time of this legislature, and, like you, I am very concerned to ensure that all questions can be replied to.
I would therefore ask you, in general â I am not referring to anyone in particular â if possible, not to make statements, because if you refrain, all questions will be answered.
Otherwise time will run out and four or five Members will not receive replies to their questions.
Â Â  .
The Commission has taken note of the relevant Californian law on the disclosure of breaches in security by businesses maintaining encrypted computerised data that contains personal information.
On the basis of its current assessment, the Commission does not, for the time being, intend to propose a directive along the lines set out in the above-mentioned Californian law, since it has not been demonstrated that there is a need for European legislation on that issue to supplement Member States' legislation, in particular penal law.
However, the Commission will follow closely the developments in this area as part of its policy to safeguard the free movement of personal data within the European Union and the protection of individuals' fundamental rights.
Â Â  Thank you for that reply, Commissioner. I am very pleased that at least you have taken note of the idea.
I suggest that the Commission's reluctance to take any further steps and propose legislation will now encourage businesses across Europe that are rather slapdash about protecting private data, as they will now be able to say that there will not be any legislation to punish them so they can easily let this slip.
I fear that our exchange in the Chamber now creates the need for legislation to stop lazy companies from letting private data fall into the wrong hands.
Do you agree?
Â Â  .
To expand on what I said a moment ago, I should like to add that the Commission does not consider it appropriate for the time being to proceed with legislation similar to the Californian law.
There is no information suggesting that theft of unencrypted personal data stored in computer systems represents a serious problem for the proper functioning of the free flow of personal data in the internal market, or for the protection of such data.
Before introducing new legislation which puts additional burdens on business, it is suggested that business itself should enhance security of personal data by using security systems such as encryption.
So, while understanding the philosophy behind the question the Commission wants to be certain that it is absolutely necessary to pass this into legislation.
We want to be careful with new laws; businesses complain of too much regulation.
We all want to deregulate, so let us be careful in this area and only legislate where it is absolutely essential to do so, but not before.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, I have a proposal to make, because I can see the problem the honourable Member brought to our attention.
Could the matter of safeguarding a personâs privacy become part of the job description of the European Network and Information Security Agency which is now being set up, so that the agency would follow developments in the area and afterwards say whether legislation is needed or not?
It would be a professional authority that would do this at pan-European level.
Could this be possible?
Â Â  .
I would like to thank the honourable Member for his suggestion.
If he agrees I shall discuss it with my colleagues, but certainly there is merit in asking that agency to come up with an opinion on this matter.
Â Â  .
In response to the first question, the Commission notes that it is settled case law that the reduction of tax revenue is not one of the grounds listed in Article 46 of the Treaty.
It does not constitute a matter of overriding general interest which may be relied upon to justify a restriction on the freedom of establishment, or the freedom to provide services.
On the honourable Member's second question, the Commission has indeed received a number of complaints from gambling service operators, who contest the application of existing national restrictions to cross-border services.
The Commission will analyse complaints in that area in view of recent rulings of the European Court of Justice.
It will proceed with appropriate action in order to ensure that the principles provided by these rulings are respected.
In addition, the Commission intends to launch a study this year to collect the information required to examine the need for and scope of a possible new internal market Community initiative in the field of gambling services.
Â Â  I wish to thank the Commissioner for a very positive reply.
However, I should like to put a couple of other issues to him.
Firstly, would he agree that it would be desirable for the proposed directive on the internal market for services to cover gambling in this way?
The issues raised by this judgment and by the complaints strike at the very heart of the issues and barriers that he is proposing to sweep away with his excellent proposal.
The second issue â which he did not touch on â was the ability of governments to try and include public interest and consumer protection issues to prevent gambling operators from setting up in their jurisdiction while, at the same time, actively promoting their own state lotteries and gambling businesses.
That seems to be entirely inconsistent and is also an issue that was covered by the Gambelli case.
I would also be interested to have his view on that aspect.
Â Â  .
On the second question, I agree with Mr Harbour and in fact I proposed legal action in a case that concerned Denmark, so we see eye to eye on that matter.
On the first question about gambling and the directive on services, this directive includes for gambling services an exemption to the country-of-origin principle that would no longer apply if a Community harmonisation instrument were in place.
The Commission will assess whether it should present a proposal for harmonised EU-wide rules on gambling services on the basis of a report that it will put in hand this year.
The directive also requires Member States to screen, through a process of mutual evaluation, barriers to cross-border establishment of service providers to ensure that authorisation requirements or licensing conditions are transparent and based on objective criteria, but it does not call into question the existence of state monopolies as such in this field.
Â Â  .
The questions that have been raised by Mr Paasilinna cannot be the subject of an initiative of the Commission based on the fundamental freedoms of the internal market, provided for in Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty, because the purpose of those provisions is to regulate situations with a cross-border element.
They cannot be used to adjust purely internal situations within Member States.
As mentioned, existing Community instruments foreseen by the Treaty have the aim of ensuring a certain equilibrium between economic operators.
They may therefore directly affect the media, but as an economic activity.
These instruments do not affect the media as an information conduit to citizens, or they do so only very indirectly.
For example, the Merger Regulation assigns the task to the Commission to establish whether or not media concentrations with a Community dimension are compatible with the common market.
The Merger Regulation thereby enables the Commission to ensure competitive medium markets and only indirectly to protect media pluralism.
It should furthermore be recalled that the Commission supports the inclusion in the draft Constitutional Treaty of Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which establishes the principle of respect by the Union of the freedom and pluralism of the media.
However, as we all know, that is not yet law.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, I really have to say I am very unhappy with this old-fashioned reply, which is totally irrelevant to the age we live in.
First of all, mobile communications are by their nature cross-border communications.
Their content are products offered by different media companies and they therefore move along the borders of the European Union.
This is the roaming policy.
One cannot avoid the issue with answers like this.
On the contrary, these companies are so big that they operate beyond Europe, offering content that is in a very limited number of hands.
I could name such companies but the Commissioner might be able to think of some of them himself.
This is a modern day threat, and it is not merely a matter of printed communications.
What position are you going to take on this modern form of communications so that you might address the problem?
Â Â  .
Mr Paasilinna is unhappy.
In return may I say that I am also unhappy.
However, the Commission cannot lift a finger if it does not conform with the Treaty, if its action is not based on the Treaty or if it is not supported by the Treaty.
The Articles that I mentioned concern activities carried out under the economic aspects of the Treaty and not purveyors of information to citizens.
Therefore while the plurality of the media is obviously an important subject, it is not covered by the current Treaty.
If Mr Paasilinna wants to call that an old-fashioned approach, so be it.
However, I cannot step beyond the bounds of the Treaty.
Perhaps the Intergovernmental Conference will result in a new Treaty which offers more scope in this area than the present one.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein, for your excellent cooperation this evening and throughout the legislature.
Â Â  . The Commission did not intend to be disrespectful in its replies to oral questions 733/03 and 45/04.
Indeed, the honourable Member did not state that the EU had withdrawn funding for the Biennial; he quoted media reports which the Commission indicated were incorrect.
As to the two new questions, firstly, the Council decided on 5 June 2003 to reduce the profile of Member States' participation in cultural events.
This measure implies limiting the presence of Member States' representatives in cultural events taking place in Cuba and has to be seen as a symbolic gesture.
It is not designed to reduce cultural activities in Cuba, or limit their funding.
Member States with established cultural programmes continued their activities in Cuba.
Only the Spanish Cultural Centre ceased to function in August 2003.
This, however, was not a decision of the Spanish Government but of the Cuban authorities.
Secondly, it would have been more correct to speak about insults towards heads of governments rather than heads of states.
The Spanish Prime Minister was insulted in a speech by President Castro on 26 July and Prime Ministers Aznar and Berlusconi were insulted in a demonstration on 12 June led by the President and First Vice-President of Cuba and directed at the embassies of those countries.
Insults were also addressed to them by President Castro the previous day, according to press reports.
Â Â  I would firstly like to thank Mr Nielson, because for the first time we have had a reasonable reply acknowledging that a series of measures were in fact adopted in the field of cultural cooperation, the first time I have received such a reply following three other questions, to which the reply was that such measures did not exist.
I would therefore like to thank you for making things absolutely clear.
I still believe that these measures restricting cultural relations are pernicious, but now we can return to the tone with which we have spoken over all these years.
He has acknowledged that these measures exist.
I believe they are absurd.
I would just like to make one small point: when he says that it would have been more correct to say that Heads of Government had been insulted, it is not that it would have been more correct, but that it was absolutely incorrect to say that Heads of State had been insulted.
And it is the Commissionâs responsibility not to confuse a Head of State with a Head of Government.
It is true that two Heads of Government were insulted.
One of them has now been relieved of that position by the sovereign population of my country and he will therefore no longer be Head of Government when any insult is directed at him.
Thank you, Mr Nielson, for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed over the last five years, including on the issue of relations with Cuba.
Â Â  .
I would like to stress again that it is not totally correct to talk about limiting cultural cooperation or limiting cultural activities.
What has been decided relates to limiting the presence of Member States' representatives in cultural events in Cuba.
So the non-participation in Cuba of the formal representatives from the different Member States and the Commission is not directly aimed at limiting cultural activities.
Â Â  â I agree with the comments made by Mr Martinez and I should like to take advantage of the debate about Cuba to raise a matter again and ask the Commissioner if the European Commission or the European Union in general intends to intervene, at long last, in order to put a stop to the embargo which the USA has imposed on Cuba for over forty years, an embargo which has caused and continues to cause immense damage to Cuba and its people.
Please do not tell us that this has something to do with respect for human rights because we know that, if there is anyone who cannot talk about respect for human rights, it is the Americans themselves who, apart from what they are doing throughout the entire world, Iraq being a typical example, are also trampling over human rights in their own country with daily executions and keeping the five patriots whose only crime was to uncover terrorist action against Cuba and its leaders organised by the USA in unacceptable conditions.
I therefore request an answer so that this saga can stop in which, more importantly, the European Union appears to assent to this sort of âŠ.
Â Â  Before the Commissioner speaks, I would like to point out that this question is not supplementary to the previous one.
It is an analysis of another issue relating to Cuba.
In any event, you have asked your question, Mr Korakas, and please allow me, as President, to interpret the Rules of Procedure.
The Commissioner will reply.
Â Â  .
I find this supplementary question totally unnecessary.
The European decision against that embargo has been clear for many years.
There is no new line whatsoever on that point, and there has never been any need for Europe to say anything new.
We have had this line all along and the disagreement between Europe and the US stands, as has always been the case.
Â Â  â Mr Nielson, a public debate was held in Greece a very short time ago about possibly inviting Fidel Castro to Greece within the framework of the Olympic Games.
Fidel Castro himself has stated that, were he to receive such an invitation from the Greek Government, he would accept it.
I ask you, Commissioner, to tell me if, first, the European Commission would encourage the Greek Government to invite the President of Cuba to Athens during the Olympic Games and, secondly, if the European Commission sees such an invitation as a positive action.
Â Â  .
I do not intend to get involved in the issue of participation in the Olympic Games in Greece.
I wonder, however, what discipline Mr Castro would be participating in!
Â Â  I would request that we all respect the agenda because, as you are aware, we are running late and the interpreters are working overtime.
We shall take the questions and the supplementary questions.
I would ask the whole House to behave responsibly, please.
Â Â  .
In compliance with Articles 67 and 61(2) of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission only provides general budget support for poverty reduction in low-income ACP countries when the beneficiary country implements a macroeconomic reform programme that is supported by one of the major international donors.
In practice, this requirement is usually linked to the existence of a national reform programme which is subject to support through the International Monetary Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.
The PRGF is designed to contribute to the reduction of poverty and the creation of economic growth.
Such a country being 'on-track' with the IMF's conditions is generally considered as one of the general conditions for EC budget support.
Disbursement of one annual 'fixed tranche' is usually preconditioned by a satisfactory periodic PRGF review of the ongoing reform programme.
During such a review IMF staff examine whether agreed benchmarks and other performance criteria have been respected by the government over a given period of time.
Since the Commission entrusts the periodic review of macroeconomic performance to the institution that is best equipped and holds a natural assignment to do so, it is important that close coordination between Commission services â especially the delegations â and IMF staff is ensured.
In case of diverging opinions on particular issues related to this review, Commission services and IMF staff must enter into a technical dialogue to try to reach a common position â I say a technical dialogue, but politics is also involved, of course.
Should the Commission maintain a position different from the IMF's, it may decide to disburse its budget support, despite the fact that the PRGF review may not be conclusive or that the country in other words goes 'off-track'.
However, such a decision will only be taken in exceptional cases, for instance when the Commission is convinced that the IMF assessment is clearly too restrictive â or based on relatively minor elements of the reform programme â and that non-disbursement of budget support may jeopardise the government's poverty reduction efforts.
In other words, despite linking part of its budget support disbursement directly to these PRGF reviews conducted by the IMF, the Commission takes its own case-by-case decision on whether to carry out a disbursement.
A similar approach is followed in relation to Community assistance to countries in other regions where general budget support for poverty reduction is linked to the same type of PRGFs.
In general, we are satisfied that this cooperation also includes the World Bank.
We are not totally enslaved into this.
It is a partnership and in recent years a more balanced, two-way, equal basis for these discussions has emerged.
Today this partnership works.
History has also proved that for the many formerly very badly managed economies in the Third World, a lot of progress has been achieved, despite the costs involved.
Â Â  I would have liked the Commissioner to be much more willing to disburse budgetary support to a country despite it not being on track as regards certain non-core elements of the IMF/PRGF and where IMF programmes are judged to be too restrictive.
The Commission has expressed concern over recent years about the IMF's macro-economic framework for low income countries.
From your answer, Commissioner, I did not get the impression that you were saying you would continue to disburse budgetary support.
You seemed to say that it would only be in very exceptional circumstances.
How exceptional would those circumstances have to be before you would continue to disburse budgetary support?
Â Â  . It is not possible to give a clear answer â it is a long story.
There are cases in post-conflict situations where budget support is simply necessary â even if a country is not even discussing being on-track or off-track â simply because if we and other donors did not step in, everything would simply break down.
That is one case.
It is also a factor that the IMF and the World Bank have changed in recent years; not that we always agree on everything with them, but we are not discussing this in the context of the 1980s or early 1990s.
The partnership we now have reflects a more poverty-oriented, more socially-responsible view compared to that held during those times.
Â Â  I would like to thank the honourable Member and the Commissioner, together with whom we make up this institutional dialogue during the final Question Time of this legislature.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 35 to 76 will be replied to in writing (3).
Â Â  . Mr President, it concerns two matters.
It concerns a number of agencies that we have looked at and, in particular, it concerns the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao.
I was extremely surprised when I read the Court of Auditors' report, because the Court of Auditors accuses this agency of having carried over far too much. On closer examination, it turned out that this was in connection with an SME programme that we here in Parliament had resolved on.
It took some time to reach agreement with the Commission about where this programme should be implemented, but eventually it was decided to give it to the agency in Bilbao. That, of course, is no fault of the agency in Bilbao, but nevertheless the Court of Auditors made a very negative comment about this.
It would, of course, have been very easy for them to check that.
You ask yourself sometimes: is that so? We all knew it here and rapporteur Mulder has stated that in the final version of his report, albeit rather less bluntly than I am doing.
It would nevertheless be good if the Court of Auditors did not only look at the first level, but also went into things a bit deeper. That is my opinion on this matter; apart from that there are no problems with the agencies that we are dealing with.
As far as the rest are concerned, we confined ourselves in the main to the Structural Funds.
There is always a problem with that and that is the problem that Member States always over-estimate how much they can get out of the Structural Funds. That leads to a budget that does not balance, and that leads at the end of the year to money that has not been spent.
This is especially the case at the beginning of a period.
I think that the Commission needs to be a bit less naive in this respect. Up to now it was the case that when a new period started, we got practically nothing off the ground in the first year.
It would be good, of course, if we could do better than this in the future. This point should be organised better in the future than it is now, otherwise it means that we never learn anything from the past.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the fact that the security situation in Kosovo continues to be precarious prompted the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to give particular attention to the deficiencies in the conduct of the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo, which the Court of Auditors has highlighted. These include the amount of cash held in reserve, the need to avoid making payments to unauthorised persons, and the need for better coordination between the Agencyâs accounting officer and the competent directorate of the Commission.
Statements by the Agency in response to these points have made it possible for these concerns to be laid to rest.
The Foreign Affairs Committee is well aware of the difficult circumstances under which the Agency does its work.
Let me say by way of conclusion, though, that the amount spent by the EU on aid must be rationally proportionate to its political benefit. The discharge report offers an opportunity to make that point.
Whilst giving the agency discharge for the year 2002, we do expect the extension of its remit to the management of EU aid in Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia to result in long-term improvements in efficiency and hence to the political stabilisation of the region.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, speaking on behalf of the Home Affairs Committee, I note with satisfaction that the Court of Auditors has been able to establish with the proper certainty that the accounts for the financial year ending on 31 December 2002 are reliable, with the end result that it has been confirmed that our three agencies in this area have done their work properly and done an outstanding job for the European Union.
As regards the criticisms levelled at the Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, I would like to announce that I will, at midnight tonight, again have the opportunity to respond to these.
It is my hope that we will, tomorrow, be able to adopt a directive for the Monitoring Centre in order thereby, jointly with it, to prevent and avoid many things.
I am therefore happy to be able to make this announcement on behalf of my committee.
Â Â  Mr President, expecting Parliament to discharge the 2002 budget in the face of all the evidence of fraud, corruption and mismanagement endemic in the European Union is akin to our being asked to accept the Enron accounts as a true and correct record.
The European Court of Auditors rejects the EU's accounts on an annual basis and has done so for the last nine years. There comes a time when we have to stop routinely nodding things through like clockwork monkeys in a tired charade of parliamentary scrutiny.
The EU has no money of its own, but is spending taxpayers' money from all the Member States.
We have a moral duty to those taxpayers to see that their money is spent wisely, not frittered away in a seemingly endless stream of abuses that line the pockets of unscrupulous civil servants and their cronies. I ask Members to set an example and vote against formal discharge.
As for the Eurostat affair, it is high time that Mr BrÃŒner, Director-General of OLAF, resigned for having instigated the arrest of the investigative journalist Hans-Martin Tillack on baseless grounds.
The Ombudsman accused Mr BrÃŒner of maladministration in November 2003, yet he has not had the grace to resign.
Meanwhile, Messrs Franchet and Byk, accused of massive fraud, have been allowed the privilege of stating their case at length to OLAF.
However, Hans-Martin Tillack â innocent until proven guilty â has still not been heard by OLAF. Mr BrÃŒner should go!


Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0271/2004) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of PNR data by Air Carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (COM(2004) 190 â C5-0162/2004 â 2004/0064(CNS)).
Â Â  . Thank you very much Mr President, thank you very much Commissioner for your detailed explanation.
We are all agreed that we have to combat terrorists, but that must not be allowed to become a licence for things that we ultimately cannot justify. I have to say to you, Commissioner, you have not convinced me this evening.
First of all, you said that the transfer by the customs bureau is a matter of concern to you. At the moment the Commission, in recital 20 of the decision, refers to passing on to other government bodies, including foreign government bodies.
A few days ago we heard for the first time that it is a matter of concern to you how this is organised. A few months ago you asked Parliament for an adequacy finding.Meanwhile, both Mr Bolkestein and yourself have informed us that there is no adequacy finding as yet in fact.
Then the question of the agreement itself.
Parliament has asked for a real international agreement.
Parliament has asked for non-discrimination in the use of the data for EU citizens.
Parliament has asked for equivalence in the United States and efficient, independent opportunities to correct incorrect data and a clear judicial process for EU citizens who get into difficulties.
You said that there will be reciprocity.
Well, Commissioner, Article 6 of the agreement states that where feasible and on the basis of strict reciprocity, the cooperation of airlines falling under its jurisdiction will be actively promoted.
That is not reciprocity.
Article 1 states what we have to do.
The CBP gets electronic access to the PNR data in the reservation and departure systems of airlines based on the territory of the Member States of the European Community.
Such as is strictly in accordance with the decision and as long as the decision remains in force.
This means that we are legalising something that we wanted to avoid all this time and that is the reason for asking Parliament now for a real agreement, that has the consent of Parliament. You say this is not necessary, because the legal basis that the Council has chosen is Directive 95/46/EC and this agreement would not change the content of the Directive.
How can you say that now when Article 2 of the agreement provides that everything will be handled in accordance with the laws of the United States?
In my view, this means we are introducing the laws of the United States here.
This is not a genuine agreement.
This is an agreement about which Mr Bolkestein says that many matters have still not been resolved. I have not mentioned the connection between this agreement and CAPS II, but the undertakings to that also state that this agreement will shortly also be linked to the new, advanced CAPS II system in the United States.
The US Congress has said that this is no good and has sent it back to the competent bodies.
To cut a long story short, the way this deal has come about is not right. Mr Bolkestein promised in September that Parliament would be treated as a full partner.
Unfortunately, he has not kept this promise. Indeed it is much worse than that, the European Commission and the Council have deliberately tried to sidetrack Parliament.
Under the Treaty, Parliament was required to give its consent, but you have chosen not to do that. That was also the reason why I argued the case in Parliament and got President Cox to recommend through the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that an appeal be made on the grounds of Article 300, paragraph 6, of the Treaty to have this agreement tested by the European Court of Justice.
That is the only way left to us to do something about this agreement and to adequately protect our citizens. At the moment they are not adequately protected.
I think that is extremely regrettable.
I would have liked to see you withdraw the agreement.
I agree with you that terrorism is appalling, but just to use all that as a licence to ride roughshod over our laws and give the Americans access to our data without legal protection, because the American Constitution and the Privacy Actdo not apply to European citizens, is going too far. I beg you therefore once again to withdraw this agreement and to come to Parliament with a real agreement.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0230/2004) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the risks of violation, in the EU and especially in Italy, of freedom of expression and information (Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights)
The President has received a letter from Mr Ribeiro e Castro, expressing doubts as to whether this debate is permissible.
I shall therefore give Mr Ribeiro e Castro the floor for two minutes in order that he may explain this.


Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I tabled a motion of inadmissibility on this report, as regards issues that I had occasion to raise in committee.




I also asked in committee, on the date of the debate, for a legal opinion to be issued by its secretariat, by Parliamentâs legal services or by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market, on serious issues concerning the legality or otherwise of this report; issues that I raised and tabled at the time.



I was under the impression that my request had been accepted but to date I have still not heard this opinion.
In fact, the report makes some legal and factual observations that are inadmissible in Parliament.
In particular, statements are made for which the Commission has never produced any proof, such as, for example, paragraph 50âs accusations about a Polish publishing company; comments on the composition of , which I admit are true but no evidence has been presented in paragraph 57(1); or paragraph 58(1), on the division of advertising revenue in Italy, about which I know nothing.
Even more seriously, the report raises points of law that are completely inadmissible in Parliament because they would force us to discuss the laws of Member States and furthermore, the legislative powers of Member States and even the rulings of Member State courts.
An example of this is the reference in paragraph 49 to a ruling of Germanyâs Federal Constitutional Court on a legislative proposal introduced by the .
I am shocked: how can we possibly question the legislative process pursued in Germanyâs , or determine the legality or otherwise of certain facts in light of Italian national law, or of LawÂ 249/97, of the deliberations of the Italian national authorities or of the rulings of the Italian Constitutional Court?





These are all matters which I am not in a position to discuss for one simple reason: they do not fall within the sphere of Parliamentâs competence and I would therefore ask that this report be deemed inadmissible or referred back to the Commission until a legal study in the true sense of the word is submitted on these issues, which are serious ones.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, despite appearances â that is, the almost 200 amendments I tabled in committee â I am actually not passionate about this debate at all; on the contrary, I find it somehow depressing, because right from the start the subject of the debate has not really been pluralism and freedom of information in Europe but simply an utterly ideological and specious attack. I find it depressing that a certain part of the Italian Left, blinded by their need to indict the Italian Prime Minister and thus the whole government â which, I am pleased to recall, was democratically elected by a majority â should concoct and consent to an inquisitorial report like this, devoted to the situation âespecially in Italyâ, as it says in the title, with the sole purpose of discrediting Italy itself.
I will not accept the unscrupulousness or the pretence at morality of this kind of constant anti-Italian crusade, which is also supported by certain Members of the European Left who first attracted attention for having insulted Italy during the Italian Presidency and then attracted even more attention for falsifying signatures in the attendance register, as suspected by their own party colleagues.
I will not accept moral lessons from those who have still not had the courage to condemn the Commission properly for the disgraceful Eurostat scandal.

In conclusion, I should be pleased if this Italian and European Left could find the time and, especially, the courage to devote an equally detailed report to the conflict of interests of MrÂ Prodi, who is President of the European Commission in his spare moments and Ulivo leader in Italy full-time, and who, to further his political fight with Italy, has, despite our efforts, only succeeded in weakening and damaging the image of the European Commission itself.

Â Â  Mrs Angelilli, I think it is worth saying that there are no documented instances of any Member of this House, or of any observer, signing themselves in with a false signature. I owe it to the Members here present to say that.
Â Â  â I am taking the floor for a personal reason, MrÂ President.
I heard MrsÂ Angelilli refer in her speech to certain Members, whose names she did not give, and she stated that these persons falsified signatures in the European Parliament register. I should like you, MrÂ President, to make her say to whom she was referring â their full names â and to ask her to provide evidence for the statement made in this Chamber.
This is not acceptable.
MrÂ Cox has already had occasion to state quite clearly what the position is and what the rights are of the Members who work in this Chamber.
This cannot be accepted, MrÂ President.

I call on MrsÂ Angelilli to name names.
Â Â  Mr President, let me speak in English to spare the interpreters.

I can only be dismayed and also somewhat amused by the very odd performance in this House by my honourable colleagues in the Berlusconi group.
There are very serious parliamentarians â grave to the point of sounding ponderous â like Mr PodestÃ , who is also Vice-President of this House, suddenly behaving as if they have gone into a rhetorical spasm, with Mr Tajani transformed into the Incredible Hulk and many other respected Members of this House beating their chests like King Kong.
What has happened? Obviously, the gentleman in Rome has issued some very precise orders to his group, which he is quite entitled to do, and the order is to stop the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak at any cost.
Filibustering is more than understandable and more than justified, even as some acceptable form of obstructionism; but I wonder whether we have not gone too far, beyond the rules and traditions of this House, with these continuous attempts â and we will see many more before tomorrow, because rumours circulate very fast in this House â to postpone consideration of this report and take it off the agenda.
Let me say that I disapprove of this behaviour â not because I belong to a nostalgic Communist group or am a Bolshevik, as I have been called, but because I still respect this House, its traditions, its standards and its rules.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe the debate we are holding is not exclusively an Italian one.
I am from Valencia and, historically, the Valencians have close relations with the Italians â in fact two Valencians (Calixtus III and Rodrigo Borgia) were Popes in Italy during the Renaissance â but I believe that this is a fundamental and European issue and I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and the rapporteur, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, for their speeches.

I believe that, by means of subsidiarity and also the Commission's initiative, we should regulate and act on the structuring of pluralism, the media and, above all, neutrality.


I come from a European region â Valencia â which has not seen neutrality in the public media.
I am not talking now about , which is a flagrant case, but about , Valencian television, which is a textbook example of how a public television station is used for party political purposes. Neutrality means not being party political, nor being subject to governmental use, to manipulation of information or being used by a political party in the case of a public media organisation, as in the case of Valencian television.
I therefore believe that, by means of the Commission's initiatives, we should put forward initiatives to legislate to create advisory councils.
In this regard, we admire models of public television such as the BBC and we would like, as Valencians, both and , our Valencian television, to be neutral, and, in the future, to have a neutral television company which gives space to all parties. A party such as mine, which is the third biggest municipal political force in our country, has no presence on our television and I believe this issue is fundamental to European integration.
(1)
Â Â  â Mr President, I have just become aware of a communication from the services of the sitting which tells Members â and it appears that it was announced at midnight last night â that, in relation to the Boogerd-Quaak report, on freedom of expression and information, in view of the large number of requests for roll-call votes, separate votes and split votes, the vote cannot take place today.
You will remember, Mr President, that you and I spoke on the telephone last night at 10.30 p.m., and that I expressed my concern about all the incidents surrounding this case.
I really must say now that this decision, taken by I do not know whom â and we should know this and whether you support this decision â goes against all the practices followed in this House.
My group, and I do not know about the others, has not been consulted and I would request that at the beginning of the vote at 12 noon, we vote on including this item once again in the vote.
Â Â  As we spoke yesterday evening, the House was in session discussing the Boogerd-Quaak report.
I was informed yesterday evening, as you have been informed, so there is no policy of exclusion in the question of the information loop.
I was informed yesterday evening that given the volume of votes and the number of requests that have been received for split votes, roll-call votes etc., the sessional services, between the time the debate finished last night and midday today are simply incapable of producing the required documentation for the vote on the report.
This is not an issue of my political preferences.
I have here a 51-page list containing details on the vote.
This issue of procedure is not a question of expressing some kind of political preference.
I am prepared to take procedural points at midday today but I am informed that it is physically impossible for the services to prepare the vote on this by midday.
Other procedural questions have been put to me.
I will deal with those at midday and make rulings.
However, it is my own belief, notwithstanding various requests, that the House will have to deal with and vote on this matter.
How and when is rather complicated.
I will work my way through this with the services in the course of this morning to see what we can do.
Â Â  Mr President, this report is not about Silvio Berlusconi.
It is a report about media concentration in all countries of the European Union, which is a matter of legitimate public concern.
It is a report that has been drawn up in accordance with the normal procedures of our House and, in recognition of the electoral sensitivities of some, the rapporteur has offered to delete Mr Berlusconi's name from the report.
Nonetheless, some colleagues are seeking to delay, to filibuster, to disrupt our procedures in order to evade the harsh searchlight of an unpalatable truth.
My group calls on the PPE-DE Group to withdraw these wrecking amendments; and if it will not, we are ready to vote on all 350 of them.
We ask you to allow the House to decide whether to proceed and we welcome your assurance that we will have a chance to vote on this report.
Â Â  I seem to be blessed with many friends in many Groups in this House!
I should like to thank my many friends for the amount of unsolicited advice that they have showered upon me in the past 24 hours on this issue!
Let me assure you that I will act as is appropriate.
We will need to deal with this at midday today.
Â Â  In fact, I had not intended to rise, but I must respond to what MrÂ Watson, the Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, has just said.
He urges our group to withdraw its amendments.
Let me point out to Mr Watson that there are 338 amendments, 157 of which have been tabled by our group.
That means that 181 come from other groups.
It is unfair to imply that our group is solely responsible for all the amendments.
A great many Members are unsatisfied with this report, and that is why 181 amendments have been tabled by other groups.
I would urge you, Mr President, to ensure that speakers do not only refer to amendments from our group.
Â Â  Mr Poettering, you can be as sophisticated as you like â the disgraceful conduct of your group colleagues in committee was not the disgraceful conduct of other Members from other groups.
If you had been there and heard the reports, you could have witnessed this for yourself.
That is my first point.
Secondly, MrÂ President, Mr Watson has asked a straightforward question, and we want an answer.
We want to vote at 12 noon today on when we will vote on the report.
Our group is prepared to vote on this report at 2 p.m., at 3 p.m., at 5 p.m. or tonight at midnight, whenever.
What is going on here is scandalous!
The degree of collusion between two groups, aimed at evading a vote on an important report, is a scandal in itself, and this House should respond honourably to this scandalous state of affairs by taking a vote this afternoon or tonight, whenever, in order to demonstrate that these shenanigans will not prevent us from voting on this important report.
We want to vote at 12 noon, so that a vote on this report is held today.
Â Â  I will deal with the voting issue at midday.
Thank you for your advice.
I refuse to be instrumentalised in this House during my Presidency.
I want to work systematically through the volume of amendments to see if I can find ways to reduce them.
I need time this morning to do so.
I will come back and, with as much good faith as I can, report to you with regard to the possibilities.
In the meantime I refuse to be bounced by anyone into prematurely announcing when we will vote.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, I would not dream of trying to bounce you into making an announcement, but I am offering advice.
You will find that, certainly in the committee, when the two Groups called for a separate vote in order to keep the amendments on the plenary agenda, they did not vote against a single one.
Although the Rules of Procedure allow any Group to call for a separate vote on any amendment, we ought to try and flush out which ones they wish to vote truly separately on.
I do not think we will find that there is a single negative vote in the two Groups against the amendments.
There is a high degree of collusion, as others have said, in terms of one Group calling for split votes on all the others' amendments and that Group calling for split votes on all their colleagues' amendments.
It is an attempt to subvert democracy and filibuster to a degree which is ludicrous.
Mr President, you have your responsibilities, but you and your services are in danger of being subverted.
Â Â  Thank you for your concern for me and the services.
Let me be quite clear.
The House debated this issue until midnight last night.
I have been in the House since 7 a.m. this morning trying to prepare the way for today.
You may rest assured that this will get my undivided attention, but between 7 a.m. and now it has not been possible to resolve some of the questions that you have put to me.
Between now and midday it may or may not be possible.
At midday I will report to the House on such progress, if I can make any in the meantime.
Â Â  Mr President, I have an extremely urgent and quite unusual question for you.
I have invited Mr Akhmed Zakayev, who, as you know, is Deputy Prime Minister in the Maskhadov Government, to a meeting to be held this evening and tomorrow morning right here.
Akhmed Zakayev, as you also know, lives in London, and I have asked the French Minister of Foreign Affairs to speed up the visa procedure.
Mr Zakayev has been refused a visa on the grounds that he is facing a request for extradition.
Now, you know that the extradition request has already been rejected by the Danish and British Governments and that MrÂ Zakayev was also recently able to visit the Bundestag in Germany.
I am therefore asking you please to intercede with Mr Michel Barnier, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, so that Mr Zakayev and his son, who acts as interpreter for him, can attend the meetings this evening or tomorrow morning, or both, which would be ideal.
Â Â  I would ask you to supply my office with the relevant details and we will try to follow it up for you.
Â Â  Mr President, I wanted to rise in connection with the previous item.
I also have no wish to pass comment on the debates and events that took place in committee, nor on what apparently happened here last night.
On behalf of my group, I would like to voice my support for your endeavours and simply make the point that we want a vote to be held on this issue.
We believe this topic is far too important to vanish from the agenda, however that might happen.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to say something on a different matter.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
On Mondays, when the session is resumed, we generally have half an hour on the topical issues which each member wishes to raise.
This Monday, for procedural reasons, you pushed this half hour to the end of Monday's sitting, to midnight and perhaps even later.
However, this debate and this possibility are given to members so that they can, as I said, raise topical issues which, at one o'clock in the morning, are no longer topical.
I should like to protest because I had requested the floor on a very serious issue.
You did not allow me to speak and you did not accept the debate.
I would ask that this sort of procedure not be repeated.
Â Â  I am very conscious that Members use this new possibility of intervening at the beginning of sittings wisely and well.
As you saw when you were here and wishing to speak at the beginning of the part-session this week, I found myself in a dilemma.
We had an important exchange of views on another matter, so at 6 p.m. â one hour into our session â we had not yet started our debates on an evening when we had already extended the sitting to 11 p.m.
I extend my apologies to those who wished to speak and had to do so either later in the day or in writing, but it was exceptional.
I hope it is not something I will be obliged to repeat.
Â Â  Mr President, a few weeks ago in Parliament we voted on the Maat report on the welfare of animals during transport.
The Irish presidency has proposed a compromise on this issue and the House needs to be aware that this compromise is completely unacceptable if the way Parliament voted is taken into account.
I was not happy with the end result in the Maat report. people concerned about animal welfare felt that it did not go far enough.
At the very least the Irish compromise should have taken into account the will of Parliament, particularly in relation to a number of crucial issues, for example the temperature of the vehicle in which animals are transported and the fact that it will not be mandatory to unload them temporarily at ports.
The most important and crucial issue is that Parliament voted quite clearly for a maximum overall journey time for slaughter, which was also reflected in the declaration signed by over 400 Members of this House.
The compromise proposed by the Irish presidency completely ignores the will of Parliament.
Many animal welfare groups that are very concerned about this have contacted me.
They feel that, if this Irish compromise goes through, it will be a retrograde step in relation to animal welfare.
The Irish compromise should at least take into account the transport of animals for slaughter with a maximum overall journey time.
Â Â  â Mr President, I give such a reduction in journey time my wholehearted support.
As far as I am concerned, eight hours must be the absolute maximum.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the prospects for unification of Cyprus before its accession to the European Union.
I should like, in starting this debate, to quote UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, as he spoke to the Security Council at the end of last week.
He said 'The plan is complex and delicately balanced.
Inevitably, as in any negotiation, it is a compromise.
The presentation of the contents of the plan to the public has not always been equally balanced.'
I am bound to say, in following the debate with great intensity I very much share the concerns expressed by the UN Secretary-General in that regard.
I should also like to add a personal concern: we should note, in particular with regard to broadcasting in Cyprus, that there is an evident degree of manipulation of prime time slots; that there has been a deliberate exclusion of foreigners, such as Commissioner Verheugen â who will be the of our Cypriot colleagues in the next few weeks; and that this represents an unwholesome spectacle unworthy of a state that otherwise seeks to, and should, fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
I would greatly welcome it if those comments, as a modest suggestion of an alternative view, were to be broadcast in the place in question, despite the lack of balance there as regards broadcasting.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am sure all Members, as well as the President, will be aware of the significance of this debate.
I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Council and the presidency.
Our discussion this morning comes just three days before a truly significant date for the people of the island of Cyprus.
On 24 April they will vote in separate but simultaneous referenda on the text of the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem which has been presented recently by United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in an agreed negotiating framework.
The European Union is deeply grateful to the Secretary-General, and in particular to his Special Adviser, MrÂ Alvaro de Soto, for their tireless efforts to bring about a settlement.
They have worked closely with the parties and in collaboration with the governments of Greece and Turkey.
They have created a unique and historic opportunity for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.
If the people of Cyprus vote 'Yes' in the two referenda on Saturday, a united Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May, along with nine other new Member States.
The accession of a united Cyprus remains the strong preference â I emphasise the strong preference â of the European Union.
Let me recall today the commitment, made by successive European Councils, that the Union is ready to accommodate the terms of the settlement in line with the principles on which our European Union is founded.
The origins of the European Union are in the most terrible war in human history, which almost destroyed our continent.
The Union was born of a deep desire to encourage European nations to work together for the betterment of all their peoples and to resolve their differences peacefully, without resort to conflict.
Membership of the European Union has enabled nations and divided communities in Europe to bridge deep and bitter divisions between them.
I am confident that, over time, this will be the case also for a united Cyprus within the European Union.
The accession of ten new Member States in just nine days' time will formally end the tragic post-war divisions of the continent of Europe.
There is now an opportunity to end yet another division in Europe.
The decision on the Settlement Plan, presented by Secretary-General Annan, now rests ultimately with the people of Cyprus.
The choice and the decision is theirs.
They should be assured of the solidarity of the European Union as they contemplate, individually and collectively, a decision which will have a profound effect on their future and indeed on the future of their children and their children's children.
As the people of Cyprus exercise their democratic rights, they will be fully aware of the historic nature of this decision and of the opportunities at hand for Cyprus, for its neighbours and, indeed, for the rest of Europe.
They will have heard â as we have done â the words of Secretary-General Annan, that the plan 'is the only available and the only foreseeable route to the reunification of Cyprus'.
The European Union and the wider international community stand ready to assist in the implementation of that settlement, both politically and economically.
The commitment and the hope of the international community was evident at the high-level preparatory donors conference chaired by Commissioner Verheugen last week in Brussels.
I was at that conference and successive speakers expressed their readiness, their wishes, their hopes and their desire to provide financial assistance for the implementation of this plan.
A number of very significant and definite commitments have been made.
Should the plan be approved, the European Commission has already earmarked significant funds for the economic development of Cyprus and for the betterment of the people of Cyprus.
Many Member States, including Ireland, have stated that they will announce significant and specific funding in support of the implementation of the settlement at a full donors conference which we hope will take place in the autumn.
The results of last weekâs international conference have been welcomed in a significant statement issued by the President of the UN Security Council on 16 April.
In noting that it is now for the Cypriots to take a historic decision concerning their future, the members of the Security Council gave the commitment that, should the plan be approved, they stand ready to take further actions as provided for in the plan, including the establishment of a new UN operation in support of its swift and full implementation by all parties.
The members of the Security Council would also be committed to helping ensure that the parties fully meet their commitments under the settlement.
The United Nations has been deeply involved with Cyprus for the past forty years.
The UN Force in Cyprus was established in 1964 and is one of the longest running peacekeeping operations in the history of the UN.
Member States, including my own country, have been proud to contribute military, police and civilian personnel to the force in the interests of all the people of Cyprus.
The European Union has stayed the course with Cyprus.
Now, on 24 April, the people of Cyprus will make their democratic choice â and it is their choice â on the settlement proposals before them.
They have a unique and historic opportunity.
The choice is theirs, and it is theirs alone.
We wish the people of Cyprus well in making those choices.
It is a difficult time.
We understand that.
We understand the history.
We understand all the passion that goes into this, but the choice is theirs and theirs alone.
We will respect whatever choice they make and hope that the decision is one that will allow for the peaceful integration of a united Cyprus into our Union on 1 May.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental principle underlying European unification is the common desire to work together and pursue policies which guarantee peaceful coexistence among the nations of Europe.
That is the reason why we have united, and that is the reason why we are gathered here this morning.
What we expect, first and foremost, from all our Member States, and what we expect above all from the countries which are due to join the European Union in less than ten days' time, is full endorsement of this basic principle of European unification as a peace project.
That is what I expect from the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as well.
Cyprus is the last country in Europe that is still divided.
Cyprus is the last country in Europe whose capital is divided by a death strip with barbed wire and minefields.
Never before, since this conflict started, have we been as close to achieving a solution as we are today.
Centimetres separate us from our goal, and yet I must tell you that I now have very little hope that we will progress this last few centimetres.
Let me explain why.
The situation which has now arisen is as follows.
To everyone's complete surprise, the Cypriot Government led by President Papadopoulos has said that it fundamentally rejects the United Nations peace plan and is urging the Greek Cypriot community to vote against it.
From my perspective, this is a deeply depressing situation for two reasons.
Firstly, when we changed our strategy on Cyprus in 1999 and, at the urgent request of the Cypriot Government, pledged to the Greek Cypriot Government that the solution to the Cyprus conflict would not be the precondition for the island's accession to the European Union, this was based on the clear understanding that we would do everything possible to facilitate Cyprus's accession, and, by the same token, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus would do everything in its power to achieve a settlement, and that under no circumstances would a settlement fail as a result of Greek Cypriot opposition.
I have held dozens of talks with ex-President Glafkos Clerides and President Papadopoulos on this basis.
There can be no misunderstanding.
We had a clear agreement: we would arrange Cyprus's accession, and they would ensure that no settlement collapsed on account of the Greek Cypriots.
We could not speak for the Turkish Cypriots.
I urge President Papadopoulos to fulfil his part of the deal now.
The second point that I wish to make is this: the negotiating process launched under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General was paralysed for a very long time by the outright opposition of the Turkish Cypriots.
Thanks, not least, to the European Union's efforts, this blockade has been overcome and at every stage of the process, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus reaffirmed that it endorsed the basic framework of the Annan Plan, saying that it wanted minor points to be amended, but within the parameters of the plan â I quote: âwithin the parameters of the planâ.
President Papadopoulos's statements after the end of the talks in Switzerland amount to the fundamental rejection of the basic principles set out in the plan.
Based on what President Papadopoulos said, I can only conclude that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus now rejects the federal solution to the Cyprus problem, which is based on the coexistence and equality of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots and is endorsed by the United Nations and the entire international community.
Let me be quite undiplomatic.
Ladies and gentlemen, I feel personally cheated by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.
For months â for months â I have done my utmost, like everyone else, in good faith and trusting in the promises made by the Greek Cypriot Government, to establish parameters which would enable the Greek Cypriots to endorse this plan.
Sadly, this has not been achieved.
The very least, however, that can now be expected from a country which wants to join the European Union in less than ten days' time is that it must ensure, at the very least, the provision of fair and balanced information about the objectives and content of this plan.
Never before in the history of the European Commission has a member of the European Commission been banned from making statements on a key European issue in a Member State on the grounds that it constitutes interference in its domestic affairs.
I call upon President Papadopoulos to ensure that in his country, the basic freedoms of information and opinion are strictly guaranteed, and that from today onwards, free access is granted in the Cypriot media to all those who are able to provide a full explanation of this plan in line with the United Nations' intentions.
As before, I am willing to do so.
Let me make one point in conclusion.
The solution is not intended to be a transaction in the interests of trade.
I think it is very regrettable that in the many statements I have heard from the Greek Cypriot side in recent days, the word 'peace', the word 'reconciliation', the word 'mutual understanding', and the word 'different communities and religions living together' are hardly ever mentioned.
The focus is almost entirely on trade aspects.
Let me make it clear: our objective is to provide a model, in this part of the world, that demonstrates that the concept of European integration is strong enough not only to avoid conflicts but also to resolve existing ones.
That would send out a very strong signal, especially in this region, where the coexistence of communities from different cultures and religions has produced the most profound and difficult global crisis that we have faced for some time.
That is why the importance of this issue extends far beyond Cyprus itself.
The Commission has fulfilled its pledge.
As envisaged, we presented a file to the Council in which the provisions of the UN plan are adjusted in line with the .
After careful analysis, we ascertained that the new Republic of Cyprus, the United Republic of Cyprus, can speak with one voice, meet its international commitments, will not block international forums, and will be equipped with structures which are robust enough to enforce international law.
We have stated that in our role as the guardian of the Treaties, we will apply stringent monitoring to ensure that these provisions are upheld.
Finally, we have made pledges to assist with financing the costs arising from this agreement, and these pledges are very far-reaching.
Let me make one thing very clear to the Greek Cypriots: there will never be a plan which fully satisfies either one of the parties.
That is impossible to achieve.
What we can do is come as close as we can to such a plan, and there will be no better plan than this one.
To those who now argue, âyes but then too many Turkish soldiers will remain on the islandâ, let me say this: rejecting the plan perpetuates the presence of 30 000 Turkish troops in Cyprus.
Another complaint is that too many Turkish settlers will remain on the island.
Let me tell you this: rejecting the plan opens the door for a further 100 000 Turkish settlers to come to Cyprus.
This plan offers a solution which is in the interests of the Greek community and in the interests of the Turkish community.
It is a solution which is in the interests of the European Union, and I send out a final appeal to the citizens of Cyprus to make a decision on Saturday which will enable this country to join the European Union with an entry ticket testifying that it is a country that stands for peace and understanding in Europe and the world.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for the frankness of your observations.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, at the request of the Conference of Presidents, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has drawn up a report, based on Mr Poos's work, which is intended to provide assurances from our perspective too that guarantees will be upheld and that the Annan Plan can indeed be implemented without any major problems for citizens.
We must understand that on issues of this kind, the people will ask questions, and that this type of solution cannot regulate every aspect to every individual's full satisfaction.
This is true, for example, of property issues, resettlement, or the compromises on the stationing of troops.
It must be clear that everyone can exercise their rights, and this includes the lodging of complaints to the courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg.
However, we must also make it clear that a positive solution to these questions and the unification of the island will generally improve conditions for people on both sides of the demarcation line, and therefore no individual issue should stand in the way of this chance to achieve an overall solution.
I believe â and this is the view of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which I have the honour to represent â that a compromise had to be found, and that under the present circumstances, the compromise put forward is fair.
However, as the European Community, we must also ensure that the people have confidence in this plan, and we should work actively to ensure that this confidence is underpinned on our side too.
That is why I think it is important that paragraphs 13 and 14 of MrÂ Poos's motion for a resolution clearly urge all the international institutions which have a stake in this process to provide guarantees that the Annan Plan will indeed be implemented, and that the European Parliament, through its permanent bodies, will monitor implementation to ensure that these guarantees are being upheld, thus ensuring that the reunification benefits the people themselves.
I myself became a Member of this House at a time when my country was still divided.
The situation is not entirely comparable.
Cyprus is not a divided nation; here, there are two different nations in one country.
That is the difference.
Nonetheless, I believe that we must recognise that although problems may arise with this type of reunification, overall, the benefits for both sides far outweigh the costs.
For this reason, we are saying that the citizens of Cyprus have the right to decide for themselves on an independent and sovereign basis.
We must also recognise that in a community such as Europe, we must support each other in order to ensure that we can live together within our community on the basis of trust, and that means that pledges must be honoured.
On that basis, we are asking the people of Cyprus to endorse the plan.
We can do no more than that.
At the first donors conference which took place last week, we agreed substantial sums of money and signalled our willingness to support this process by appropriate means.
I hope that on this basis, and in the spirit described by Commissioner Verheugen, who has been highly committed to this issue for years, a positive outcome can still be achieved on Saturday.
Â Â  Mr President, in the history of a nation, there are moments when citizens are faced with a fundamental choice.
It is as if they were halfway across a ford.
They can carry on towards the far bank or turn back.
In front of them lies the path to reunification, reconciliation and civil peace, drawing a line under the past.
This is the path which the European Parliament has always favoured.
We put our hopes and trust in the negotiating and mediating skills of the Secretary General of the United Nations.
We are not about to abandon him with the end in sight.
Since the resumption of negotiations, the European Parliament has also set out some fundamental conditions: the ability to speak with one voice, a single legal status and no permanent derogation from the Treaty.
The Commission has assured us today that these conditions have been met in the final version of the Annan plan.
Consequently, there is no reason to doubt that the plan conforms with the Treaty.
The second path open to the Cypriot electors is to reject what MrÂ deÂ Soto has called the culmination of thirty years of striving for a political solution.
This means turning back.
If the plan is rejected, the island will be divided indefinitely.
It is actually an illusion to believe that the final document will be opened up for renegotiation in three months or in three years.
Who with?
Under whose auspices?
With what international support?
It is also an illusion to hope that, if the plan is rejected, the difficult problems surrounding the return of refugees, property, Turkish troops, etc. will be able to be solved.
The opposite is the case.
The present situation will be frozen.
Not a single refugee from either side will return to his or her home village and not a single Turkish soldier will leave the occupied zone.
Our draft resolution delivers a clear message.
We hope the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot electors will have the courage to go forward right now.
Before you join the European Union, we say to you: Leave nationalism behind you,
the European Union will help you overcome any difficulties arising during the construction of a united Republic of Cyprus.
Â Â  Mr President, on Saturday, Cyprus votes on the Annan Plan and its future.
Cyprus stands at a historic juncture.
European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have consistently urged all parties to support the plan and we do so again now.
The Annan Plan offers Cyprus a chance for reconciliation and renewal.
It is a door to a better future on an island that has endured too much for too long.
The plan makes important concessions to both sides.
With goodwill on both sides it could be a first step away from years of partition.
My Group thanks Commissioner Verheugen for the leadership he has shown in this matter.
We regret that more EU leaders have not expressed the same commitment more volubly.
The European Union will underwrite a huge amount of the reunification process and the Court of Justice will provide a legal framework for its resolution.
This is the last, best hope for a unified Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May.
We salute the leaders on both sides in Cyprus who have supported the Annan process and have commended it to their fellow Cypriots.
'No' would have been the simple choice: the answer which rhymed easily with resentment and suited political expediency.
'Yes' took courage.
There are many Cypriots, particularly on the Greek side, who ask what business it is of ours to be having this debate at all.
In the face of all our concern and consternation they offer simply the shrug of self-determination.
They can and will vote as they please and they have the right to vote 'no'.
But I believe it would be a sad and sectarian choice, the wrong choice for the wrong reasons.
Moreover, if the purpose of self-determination is the freedom to go on nursing old resentments and the right to weigh the money in your pocket today against reconciliation tomorrow, the Cypriots who have turned their faces against this process are welcome to it.
I would just ask them to reflect on this.
What if the West Germans had chosen that kind of self-determination in 1990?
On our scarred continent with its crowded history there are some old scores where restitution and compensation can only ever be relative.
Only the historically illiterate can believe that we can somehow fix what has happened in Cyprus, anymore than we can fix Kosovo and Serbia or Israel and Palestine.
What Cyprus needs is a : some way of living that looks forward rather than backward.
The Annan Plan is a .
If it is lost on Saturday it could put back the reunification of Cyprus by a generation.
The European Union would have to face up to a new reality on the ground: the possibility for a peaceful transfer of land will be lost; the Turkish army will continue to guard what will remain a militarised border; UN peacekeepers will patrol within the European Union.
The English writer Lawrence Durrell, who lived for many years on Cyprus, recorded a Greek Cypriot proverb that says there is no fire in old ashes.
Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House hope beyond hope that Sunday will not find Cypriots stirring the cold old ashes of a sad history.
Â Â  Mr President, I visited the island for talks last week.
The process of EU accession has raised hopes of a solution to the conflict, but many expectations are still unfulfilled, especially among the Greek Cypriots.
The fact that negotiations have been taking place in New York and Switzerland has barely been reported to citizens in the towns and villages of Cyprus.
The efforts made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan merit great respect, but it is difficult to communicate 9Â 000 pages of treaty text to both communities on the island within a matter of weeks, and this has clearly failed due to the different political interests at stake.
There are different interpretations of the plan even within the governing coalition of the Republic of Cyprus, as the statements made by the President and the coalition partners demonstrate.
These different assessments cannot be ignored, Commissioner.
For the reasons I have stated, there have been serious calls for the postponement of the referendum in order to gain more time for information and opinion-forming.
The governing party, AKEL, which is affiliated to my group, is not opposed to the Annan Plan, but given the situation, it is deeply concerned about the possible failure of the referendum, as has already been discussed here.
Now there is a need for clear signals from the EU and the UN again.
We should not downplay the situation.
The country has undergone a war.
Northern Cyprus has been under Turkish occupation for thirty years.
In view of the concerns that exist, signals on peace and security must be sent out more clearly, and with these concerns in mind, it must be made clear there are no unilateral advantages for either side.
