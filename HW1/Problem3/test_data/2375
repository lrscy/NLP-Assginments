On the other hand, we would support a recital referring to the work of the relevant international fora, in line with the Councilâs conclusions on ship dismantling of 24Â JuneÂ 2005.
We could therefore fully support the compromise proposal on this point.
In addition, there are a number of amendments concerning further restrictions on the free movement of waste for recovery which would, in the Commissionâs view, not correspond to the objective of creating clearer and better regulation.
The Commission, on this basis, could not accept the proposed amendments 4, 27, 30, 31, 33, 37, 54, 56 and 68.
The Commission maintains its statement with regard to Article 12(1)(c) in the common position to which Amendment 31 is linked.
However, we could support the compromise proposal on other points.
The question has been raised of coherence between the waste shipment regulation and the waste framework directive, which is now coming up for review.
We can confirm that we will ensure that full coherence is maintained between this regulation and the planned revision of the waste framework directive and, of course, we will ensure consistency with regard to definitions in the thematic strategy on waste.
With regard to animal by-products, the Commissionâs proposal fulfils the same environmental objectives as Amendment 91.
Our objective is to ensure that the necessary environmental safeguards are in place for the shipment of animal by-products.
Therefore, our proposal says that the stricter of the two regulations should apply.
However, the Commission does not want both regulations to apply at the same time to the same shipment and therefore we cannot accept Amendment 91.
In conclusion, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept 87 of the 113 proposed amendments, fully or in principle.
These proposed amendments include strengthening the enforcement of the regulation, clarification of its provisions and further alignment with the Basel Convention.
I will provide Parliamentâs Secretariat with a complete list of the Commissionâs positions on the amendments.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
Annex â Position of the Commission
The Commission can accept the following amendments in full: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 84, 85, 90, 100.

Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation (A6-0301/2005), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases [16056/5/2004 â C6-0221/2005 â 2003/0189A(COD)] (rapporteur: Avril Doyle); and
the recommendation (A6-0294/2005), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC [16056/5/2004 â C6-0221/2005 â 2003/0189A(COD)] (rapporteur: Avril Doyle).
Â Â  . Mr President, this is a package of two pieces of legislation and I am rapporteur for both; hence the time allocated to me.
I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and all the political groups for a wide-ranging discussion and debates.
We did not agree on everything but we have had a lot of discussion on the very interesting issues contained in both these pieces of legislation.
The background is that the fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs.
They are used in all sorts of applications, some essential, others less so: in insulating foams, aerosols, refrigeration and air conditioning systems, in fire protection equipment and even in the soles of air technology jogging shoes.
As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases, owing to their high global warming potential or GWP, became recognised as a major contributor â 5% and rising â to the âgreenhouse effectâ.
Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, three are fluorinated gases.
The aim of this legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases.
Whereas the original Commission proposal to Parliament was in the form of one regulation with a single market legal base â Article 95 â the Council reached a common position which took the form of two separate texts: a directive based on Article 95 and a regulation based on a dual legal base consisting of Articles 175 and 95.
The rationale for the split of the Commission proposal into two different texts was to move all the requirements relating to emissions from air conditioning in motor vehicles from the proposed regulation to the framework directive for type-approval of motor vehicles, Directive 70/156/EEC.
The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining stationary applications.
As far as the mobile air conditioning or MAC Directive is concerned, I am of the opinion that a balance has to be struck between, on the one hand, being technology-prescriptive in relation to the global warming potential of the gases to be allowed according to the directive and, on the other hand, promoting the development of alternative environmental technologies.
As it now stands, the ban in the directive applies to gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, meaning that HFC-152a â which has a global warming potential of about 120 â can still be used.
This will allow further innovation and development of alternative technologies with regard to air conditioning systems.
Reducing the GWP threshold in mobile air conditioning will effectively mean that the development of CO2 technology is the only option for European car manufacturers at the present time.
While I recognise that European industry is a world leader in this technology and I commend its achievements, the current state-of-the-art CO2 systems have a number of disadvantages which make them unsuitable for export outside the EU.
First of all, they involve very high pressure equipment, which would present health and safety risks to mechanics who do not have the expertise to service them.
Outside the EU, where F-gas technology will remain mainstream, the service networks for such systems will simply not exist.
Secondly, CO2 technology is not suitable for use in certain extreme temperatures, in very hot climates for instance.
Setting the threshold at 150 GWP does not exclude the further refinement of CO2 technology, but it would allow our car manufacturers to maintain market penetration in all areas of the world.
By coming down from the present position to 150 GWP, there is at least a ten-fold decrease â 1000% â in emissions and there would be negligible extra benefit â about 2.6% â in setting a GWP threshold at 50.
I know some colleagues are attached to this proposal, but it would be hard to defend it at world trade level because of this insignificant extra environmental benefit and because of this it could be perceived as a technical trade barrier.
To reiterate, what is important is that, by adopting this directive, we are blocking the use of HFC-134a, which has a global warming potential 10 times higher than HFC 152a.
With regard to the phase-out dates proposed by various Members, our aim should be for this legislation to enter into force as soon as possible, so that industry can begin to get rid of the gases with very high global warming potential, while maintaining the six-year type-approval timeframe.
I am therefore in favour of approving the common position on the directive as it is, without further amendments.
On the regulation on certain fluorinated gases, there has been serious debate over the legal base: whether the legal base of the regulation should be the environment (Article 175 of the Treaty) or the single market (Article 95 of the Treaty) or whether the dual legal base proposed in the common position (Articles 175 and 95) should be maintained.
We as a Parliament have a duty to settle this issue; above all, industry needs legal certainty.
As rapporteur, I have consulted widely on this issue and examined every option from one end of the spectrum to the other.
My main priority has been to achieve legal certainty for industry.
After considered deliberation, I have come to the firm conclusion that the only logical and legally watertight option in the spirit of the aims and scopes of the regulation â I would advise colleagues and others interested to read the recitals â is to opt for a single legal base that corresponds to the preponderant purpose or the âcentre of gravityâ of the legislation.
In this case, as in the ozone depleting substances regulation to which this proposal is related, that is environmental protection.
It is clearly explained in the recitals to the regulation that the main aim is to contribute to global warming reduction targets.
The scope of the regulation is absolutely clear on that as well: global warming reduction targets, air quality improvement.
The European Parliamentâs legal opinion stated categorically that an unevenly weighted dual legal base, as in the common position, is legally unsound and will be struck down by the ECJ.
All the precedent case-law confirms that the Court will quash the reference to the subordinate legal base â Article 95 in this case â and interpret the whole regulation as founded on the main legal base â Article 175.
However, this outcome will only come about after years of wrangling and protracted uncertainty for industry.
We should keep control of legislative decisions in this political arena â even if it means conciliation it is still political control â rather than letting the courts decide on legislation for us.
Article 175 will also allow those Member States which already have more ambitious legislation in force as part of their Kyoto strategy to keep that legislation where it is appropriate for the functioning of the internal market and not, as would be the case with the current common position, force them to bring their environmental standards down to lower EU levels.
It is important to remember, however, that Articles 175 and 176 do not give Member States a free hand to introduce whatever measures they want.
The internal market will still be protected from unjustified trade barriers under the environment legal base, Article 175, which is predicated on protection of the single market.
It is clearly stated in Article 176 that no stricter measures can be taken by a Member State unless they are compatible with the Treaty, i.e. unless they are proportionate, non-discriminatory and do not create unjustified barriers to the single market.
The effect of the environment legal base is substantively the same as the single market (Article 95) base, which also allows Member States to take stricter measures.
It is only the burden of proof â on the Commission under Article 175, on the Member State under Article 95 â and the enforcement procedures which are different.
In this respect, I call on the Commission to make a declaration, on the record, that it will be assiduous in pursuing its obligations as enforcer of the Treaty in relation to this regulation and that it will take particular care to police and monitor any stricter measures that are proposed by Member States, in the interests of furthering the internal market within the bounds of Article 175.
While the Commission may not have been proactive enough to date in using its infringement powers, I hope that its recent case against Denmark will be a sign of things to come and will assuage the worst case scenario fears of industry with regard to the single market.
As a further safeguard, and to assist SMEs, I have proposed an amendment to introduce an online register where any stricter measures that are compatible with the single market under Article 176 would be recorded in an easily accessible single document.
I urge colleagues to support this proposal.
In an enlarged Europe of 25 â soon to be 27 â Member States, the Council may well resort to more frequent use of a dual legal base in order to try and satisfy various national interests.
This will result in fragmentation of the purpose and focus of legislation.
This trend towards cobbling together sloppy compromises at the Council negotiating table when Member States cannot reach an acceptable political agreement is extremely worrying.
I believe that the European Parliament is uniquely placed to overcome the constraints of national positions and to provide policy coherence in areas where Community-level action is required.
We as a Parliament must resist the dilution and emasculation of legislation.
The bottom line is that, if the common position on the dual legal base is maintained, this regulation will end up with a single Article 175 legal base after the ECJ has examined it and struck down the subordinate legal base, Article 95.
I would prefer this Parliamentâs decision to prevail and I cannot put my name to a regulation that is not legally sound and will not withstand legal scrutiny.
One key argument that has received little acknowledgement in the heated debates so far is the competitiveness case of employing Article 175 to achieve our Lisbon targets of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, with sustainable growth as an integral part of that objective.
The proposal to use a single market legal base and also impose additional bans in the annex is a blunt instrument that industry, the Commission and the Council cannot accept.
At present, none of the proposals to include additional bans on the use of F-gases in certain applications have been subjected to impact assessments or comprehensive health and safety or even cost-benefit analysis by the Commission.
I do not believe we should use them without prior technical examination.
I believe in containment and recovery as very sensible and effective means of mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases.
However, I also see the need for promoting the development of alternative technologies which are more environmentally benign than the existing ones.
By allowing more ambitious legislation in some Member States, subject to the close scrutiny of the Commission, and by restricting the marketing of certain products where better alternatives exist, the objectives just mentioned will be given impetus.
Industry must be given long-term certainty.
It is our duty to lay out the directions for the future and it is for us as politicians, together with the Council and the Commission, to decide on legislation and not allow the ECJ to direct it all.
Â Â  . Mr President, to start with I wish to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, for her excellent work on the present report at second reading.
The proposals we are debating today are an important part of Community policy on climate change.
Fluorinated gases are very strong greenhouse gases.
In the European programme on climate change, legislation which limits emissions of fluorinated gases has been called one of the measures of crucial importance in order for the European Union to achieve its objective within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol.
The draft proposals being debated today will help considerably in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union.
This reduction is calculated at approximately 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year up to 2010 and at 40 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year after 2020, once the proposed measures have been fully applied.
The Commission proposal on fluorinated gases was debated in the Council during the Irish and Dutch Presidencies and it soon became clear that it would have to be reformulated to some degree.
The Council decided, in the end, to change the form of the Commission proposal, but kept it as a package of measures, with a directive especially on the question of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in vehicle mobile air-conditioning systems (MACs) and a regulation covering the remaining issues in the original proposal.
The Council also agreed that the directive should be based on Article 95 alone, in that it would come under the type approval system, and that the regulation should have as its legal basis Article 175, in conjunction with Article 95 as far as Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the regulation are concerned.
The Commission agreed to this change, given that the two elements qualify as an overall package which safeguards the environmental aims of the original proposal.
The change in form also reflects Parliament's wish to address the question of MAC systems through type approval legislation.
I should like to emphasise here that I shall be closely monitoring developments with certain outstanding issues in Parliament and in the Council, especially the very serious issue of the legal basis, it being the wish of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that the regulation on fluorinated gases be based solely on Article 175.
The outcome of the vote on this question in plenary will be especially important.
I should also like to add that the Commission welcomes measures which have been taken by various Member States to reduce greenhouse gases.
Recent reports show that several Member States will need additional measures to achieve the objectives to which they have committed.
Consequently, actions to restrict fluorinated gases are one effective means towards this objective.
The Commission merely wishes to ensure that these measures and these actions do not infringe other obligations in the Treaties which the Member States must honour, especially with regard, for example, to the internal market.
As regards the amendments proposing additional bans on the placing on the market, the Commission has always maintained that, before a decision is taken as to the extent to which a product or item of equipment containing fluorinated gases must be banned, a full technical and economic evaluation is required.
However, this has not been done for the new bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment.
It is worth noting that, within the framework of the review, four years after the regulation entered into force, provision is made for examining possible additional bans.
The Commission considers many of the remaining changes incorporated into the common position and the amendments proposed in Parliament to be improvements to its original proposal.
They do indeed improve the definitions and clarify the text; at the same time, they strengthen transparency and accountability.
The Commission has also accepted certain amendments in the common position, such as the new article on labelling, which goes far beyond its original proposal, and such as the article on the review of the regulation, which has been considerably strengthened and is now more specific.
As far as the directive on emissions from MAC systems is concerned, the Commission supports Parliament's proposal for the gradual abolition of fluorinated greenhouse gases from MACs, using the type approval procedure, rather than a system of transferable quotas.
There is convergence of opinions between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on this issue.
The Commission is willing to look positively at every possibility for compromise which may arise in relation to the amendments voted by Parliament.
I hope that we shall manage to complete the procedure on the present matter as quickly as possible.
We need the new regulation and the new directive without delay, so that they can start to contribute towards the limitation of emissions of fluorinated gases.
They will thus make it easier for us to honour our commitments within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and beyond.
In addition, it is clear that this will send a real positive and timely message as we set in motion â today to be precise â the second stage of the European programme on climate change.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Doyle has done a splendid job and considerably helped our imminent and major improvement in the protection of the environment in Europe.
It has to be said, though, that it is becoming more and more difficult to get people to show any sympathy for environmental protection measures when Article 175, the legal basis for them, is transposed in different ways in different countries, thereby endangering the smooth functioning of the internal market.
The fact is that things are not the way the Council would like them to be; there are indeed differences between countries, and the internal market does get disrupted.
All I can do, then, is urge that we accept Articles 175 and 95 as a dual legal basis, which is necessary in this instance; in any other, I would be in favour of a single legal basis, although I would then have to argue the case for Article 95, which does not fit the bill exactly.
We in this House have always defended the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is particularly with regard to air-conditioning units that our objective gives rise to concern and criticism on their part.
While the goal â an ambitious one, and important in terms of environmental policy â of changing air-conditioning units over to non-fluorinated gases by 2011 is to be welcomed, it has to be said that it does create problems for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is why, at first reading, this House adopted a derogation, according to which, if the number of units produced is less than 50Â 000 per annum, the new arrangements can be introduced two years later â that is, in 2013.
It is regrettable that the Council did not see fit to take this on board, but, as I regard it as necessary that flexibility in transposition be guaranteed if the changeover is to be successful, I have tabled an amendment, which enjoys support from all the groups.
What is this amendment about?
The intention is simply to make it possible for small-volume manufacturers, after 1 January 2013, to be given type-approval for vehicles operating in accordance with the old regime.
We should give small businesses this opportunity, and not only the manufacturers of vehicles, but also the suppliers.
I therefore ask you to support this amendment.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating an important topic this evening, namely greenhouse gases, and f-gases, to be precise.
Everyone is agreed that measures must be taken urgently in order to reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases.
First of all, though, I should like to thank Mrs Doyle who, as rapporteur, has taken a number of important initiatives in order to safeguard the environmental quality of these proposals, and has shown much commitment in this.
She has opted to change the legal basis from the internal market to the environment, which I believe to be of the utmost importance and which enjoys the warm support of the majority of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
The common position is disappointing.
A number of countries in the Council have voted against it because they have already more far-reaching measures in place.
With the internal market legal basis, Austria and Denmark would have to withdraw their more far-reaching measures, which is really unacceptable.
The internal market must provide a high level of environmental protection.
If that is not the case, the environmental legal basis is more suitable because it allows the Member States to introduce more far-reaching measures themselves.
Europe is not there to impose changes for the worse on the Member States or to deny Member States the opportunity of adopting proper environmental policy.
Europe is there to improve the conditions under which all of us live.
The environmental legal basis is also clearly less complicated and as such, fits in with the better regulation project, which we all want.
For the record, the environmental legal basis is not a licence to start issuing all kinds of bans arbitrarily; it goes without saying that any ban should be underpinned by a sound environmental reason.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, an overwhelming majority were in favour of reducing the use of f-gases.
Many companies work with f-gases and a large number of companies have sent lobbyists in order to get this House round to their way of thinking.
The army of lobbyists claims that there is no alternative to using of f-gases, that their use is either not that harmful or negligible relatively speaking.
Although, needless to say, I can appreciate all these arguments, I think that innovation is necessary and that we should really phase out the use of the most harmful greenhouse gases as soon as possible.
We must, of course, carefully consider the environmental impact bans have and we must ensure that the restrictions to market access are proportionate; we would be happy to do this in consultation with the Council.
There is broad consensus in this House about the need for adopting an ambitious climate policy.
Sadly, it appears that a broad consensus for a strong climate policy is not equal to the automotive industry.
The Socialists would have liked to push car manufacturers into replacing f-gases in air-conditioning systems more quickly.
Unfortunately, they were unable to do so.
By way of compromise, our group proposes putting the latest date of introduction forward by one year, from 2017 to 2016.
This is not a shocking change, but sufficient for the car industry to launch a strong lobby to make it clear to MEPs that that is really unacceptable.
The production cycle of a car model is six years, but I would ask the car industry out there whether that attitude is not too defensive.
Innovation is of paramount importance if the car industry wants to survive the competition from China, and it is then inappropriate to put innovation on the backburner.
If we continue to do this, the Lisbon agenda will not come to anything either.
As for Mr Schnellhardtâs proposed exemption for small volumes, we regard that as unnecessary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank MrsÂ Doyle for drawing up the report and also for having overseen the debate.
We have to oppose global warming because of the enormous impact that it has on the environment.
I should just like to mention the fact â as we can see in the newspapers every day â that extreme events are getting worse: heavier rains and longer droughts.
The European Union regards this problem as central to the issue of sustainable development, which, in turn, is one of the fundamental principles for the Union: solidarity with future generations, on a par with the dignity of the individual and democracy.
The more complex the molecule, the more intense is the greenhouse effect.
Organofluorines belong to this category and must be taken into serious consideration.
There is all the more reason, then, to think systematically â that is, looking at the whole system â that the impact has to be minimised in relation to the global greenhouse effect, and thus we should not be concerned just with the gas in question but also with the way in which it is used.
Therefore, it is essential to minimise its overall global warming potential: that of the gas and that of the equipment.
If the emissions trading method works â as it does â I believe we should first of all apply a kind of internal emissions trading to the systems where the method is being used, reducing the effects of the gas and equipment to a minimum in the first place and analysing the costs and benefits.
The systems I am referring to are, for instance, mobile air conditioners, fixed air conditioners, and the system comprising the gas plus the energy needed to make the equipment work.
Gas is used to extinguish fires and, like fire, is a source of greenhouse gas, so the effects of both the gas and the emissions from the fire must be evaluated.
It is therefore important not to be prescriptive and over-attentive to detail, but to aim at minimising the greenhouse effect as a whole.
There are gases, such as sulphur hexafluoride, for which there are no alternatives and which thus constitute exceptions, because vital equipment depends on such gases.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent work on this issue.
My Group fully supports the change in the regulation's legal basis to Article 175.
The sole objective of this regulation is, clearly, climate protection.
It should be remembered that these gases were already included, in 1997, in the basket of gases to be controlled under the Kyoto Protocol and that this regulation emerged from a specific programme called the European Climate Change programme.
So we should not be fooled by the pro-F-gas lobbyists who argue both for avoiding a change of legal basis and for maintenance of the status quo for their climate-destructive products.
Climate-friendly alternatives exist for almost all applications, or are in development.
None of the phase-outs and bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is unrealistic, as some would claim, since they all take into consideration exemptions where safety standards require.
I would also point out that f-gases were pushed onto the market as replacements for CFCs, which cause ozone depletion and skin cancers, precisely by the same big chemical companies â like DuPont or, in my own country, Ineos, as ICI is now known â that were, themselves, major producers of ozone-destroying substances.
This Parliament should stand firm and put the environment and the well-being of Europeâs citizens before the narrow corporate interests of those chemical giants.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when we debate climate issues in this House, we are usually in complete agreement.
We usually agree that they are the greatest environmental problem of our time, and we usually agree that we must do more.
Now, we are here; now, we can do more; now, we can ensure that some of the most damaging greenhouse gases disappear or are phased out, or at least have restrictions placed on them.
We know that there are alternatives, so it is a question of coming up with the goods.
I fully support the rapporteurâs demand that ArticleÂ 175 should be the legal base.
This is an environmental issue.
It would be absurd if we wanted to reduce the environmental requirements that already exist in some of the EU Member States when the requirements should in actual fact be made stricter.
Not to let countries take the lead prevents invention and innovation.
It may be objected that allowing them to do so might interfere with the internal market.
Certainly, that is possible, but my political group believes that democratic countriesâ right to tighten up environmental requirements if doing so is good for the environment - as, indeed, it is â should take precedence over companiesâ right to sell exactly the same product across a particular market.
We have seen shameless and unprecedented lobbying on this issue by a range of different companies.
Quite a few of these companies attack the Member Statesâ democratic right to tighten up their legislation.
The same companies often wish to call themselves friends of the environment, or they maintain that they have modern environmental policies.
This attitude can be summarised in a single word: hypocrisy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent report.
While she has moved a reasoned proposal particularly where the legal basis is concerned, my group would like to see the Member Statesâ right to take additional measures made more explicit in the directive.
That is why we have tabled Amendment 45.
I hope that the rapporteur can endorse this in addition to the change to the legal basis.
As for the bans that are added to Annex 2, especially Amendments 34 to 36, I can tell you that I do not support them.
In time, I would like to see the use of fluorinated gases phased out in those applications, but we do not know whether the alternatives are actually more energy-efficient.
It is therefore too premature to impose a ban at present.
In future, a ban could be instituted when this directive is reviewed, but only if research were to prove that this is really more energy-efficient.
I would be interested to hear what view the Commission takes of these product bans.
The last thing I would like to say has to do with Amendment 19.
We have just discussed my own report on cross-border waste shipments.
Like many other substances, used fluorinated gases are waste substances that may be processed more effectively in a different country.
Fluorinated gases are therefore not as unusual as this amendment gives us to believe, and so we should not make an exception to the normal licensing procedure for waste shipments.
It would be very strange indeed if during tomorrowâs vote, we first demonstrated our allegiance to a more coherent approach to waste shipments, only to shoot this uniform approach to tatters the next day.
I would therefore ask the rapporteur, and the House, not to back Amendment 19.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done, which above all has the merit of bringing the intent of our legislation closer to the criteria that we promised to fulfil at Kyoto.
Even in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I felt it necessary to distance myself from certain positions that appear only to favour sectional objectives and are likely to produce a much more disastrous outcome both for the environment and for many Member Statesâ economies.
First of all, on the issue of the legal basis, the shift to Article 175 may result in a distortion of the single market concept, since it allows individual Member States to introduce more restrictive requirements and measures.
Choosing Article 175 as the legal basis might lead to a paradox whereby some countries may decide to prohibit the use of SF6 but then resort to current alternatives that are more polluting and less safe than fluorinated gases.
We must not forget that the purpose of the regulation is to contain fluorinated gas emissions and not to ban them.
Any ban â I am referring to Articles 7 and 8 in particular â should be preceded by a study assessing both the economic impact and the environmental benefit.
I must emphasise that it is pointless to cause serious economic damage to countries that base part of their economies on the responsible use of those gases when there is no likelihood of gaining appreciable environmental benefits, while even causing greater harm in some cases.
It is pointless to resort to bans that cannot offer any feasible scientific alternatives, when at the moment it would be enough to reduce emissions.
It is pointless to hinder harmonisation, when this move puts even safety at work at risk.
Fluorinated gases have high energy efficiency, are non-flammable and non-toxic, and can be handled and managed by workers in total safety.
Statistics show that the alternative solutions have caused many deaths in the workplace.
An approach based on responsible use, with the same rules for all the Member States, has the clear advantage of being a win-win solution.
It provides a reduction in the energy costs associated with a guaranteed high degree of safety, and the environment benefits as greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the absolute minimum.
Â Â  â In my contribution, I would like to express my appreciation for the fine and undoubtedly demanding job performed by the rapporteur Mrs Doyle in preparing and debating the legislative proposal in question.
I agree with her that we must do our utmost to protect the environment.
We must give serious consideration to the ominous progression of global warming and recognise our responsibility also for the fate of future generations.
To this end, we should strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum.
If there are substitutes for fluorinated industrial gases that offer more advantages in terms of environmental protection, energy efficiency or health and safety, we should not hesitate to replace such gases with the more environmentally friendly substances.
Let me stress, however, that this should apply only in those cases where a substitute is available.
I believe that in the automotive industry, for instance, there will be no problem finding such substitutes by 2010.
I would like to point out, however, that there are also plans to ban the use of sulphur hexafluoride SF6, which would have negative consequences for the treatment of cancer, since this substance is used in radiotherapy and no substitute is available.
Should it be banned, many patients in Europe would lose a highly effective form of treatment.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking my colleague Mrs Doyle for doing such an outstanding job.
I am in complete agreement with the line she has taken.
That the Kyoto Protocol was able to enter into force was primarily a result of the efforts of the European Union.
Three of the six gases listed in it are f-gases, the use of which has been prohibited outright by both Austria and Denmark.
It is abundantly clear, not only from experience in these countries, but also from innovations in other Member States, that technically and economically workable alternatives to fluorinated gases are available, and that they do less damage to the environment.
Alternatives to a wide range of products and installations are available, and are capable of bringing about a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; some of them even reduce energy consumption at the same time.
A large number of European manufacturers are capable of putting alternatives on the market.
Consumers are already able to shop in supermarkets in which the refrigerators use alternatives to f-gases.
The German Federal Office for the Environment has produced a comprehensive study of the availability and efficiency of the alternatives showing that alternatives are indeed available for many important applications.
Something else that needs to be mentioned is the lack of ambition apparent from the Common Position.
The proposal for a regulation on certain f-gases takes insufficient account of tried, tested and already available developments.
The imposition of bans and restrictions that can simply be neglected not only stifles ecological innovation in this area, but also robs the Community of any credibility where the development of eco-efficient solutions is concerned.
Moreover, the Councilâs Common Position on the Regulation does not allow the Member States to do anything ambitious and of their own free will and accord about seeking technical alternatives.
The EUâs burden-sharing agreement commits different Member States to very diverse targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases, and so individual Member States need to take different measures to achieve them.
That is why it is absolutely crucial that Article 175 should be the legal basis for the whole Regulation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to say thank you very much to MrsÂ Doyle who, I think, has done some very creditable work on this report.
I see it as our duty as legislators to encourage and facilitate the development of new and more environmentally friendly technology.
When there is new, environmentally friendly technology at a reasonable cost, there is no reason for us to permit older, environmentally polluting technology.
In the legislation, we must also, if possible, avoid confining ourselves to a particular technical solution just because, at precisely the time we legislate, it is the best in environmental terms.
Instead, we must lay down requirements regarding upper limits for emissions and for other environmental pollution.
In the light of this, I am in actual fact quite satisfied with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safetyâs proposals for limiting the use of greenhouse gases, even though I should obviously have liked some of my own amendments â which went a little further, for example regarding the use of fluorohydrocarbons â also to have been sanctioned by the majority of the committee.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has, however, decided, despite everything, to demand that more substances be phased out than those put forward by the Council for such treatment.
I am, in actual fact, particularly glad that the Committee has supported having ArticleÂ 175 as the legal base, something that quite a few speakers have already mentioned.
It is important that the Committee wishes to make it possible for countries that have stricter rules for the use of greenhouse gases to be able to retain these rules and for those that want to introduce such rules to be able to do so.
Environmental requirements within the EU must not be harmonised downwards, but upwards.
When it comes to air-conditioning in cars, we are not convinced that there is at present good reason for requiring that the gas used should not be permitted to have a warming potential higher than 50, partly because the climate benefits of such a reduction would be extremely small and, at the same time, very expensive but mainly because the technology involving carbon dioxide has not yet been tested sufficiently for us to commit ourselves irrevocably to it.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament therefore support the rapporteur on this specific issue.
Finally, I wish to call on everyone to support the changes proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in tomorrowâs vote and, at the same time of course, the amendments tabled by the PSE Group, for example those about introducing the stricter rules for air-conditioning in cars at a time earlier than that proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in voting on the directive on mobile air-conditioning systems, my group, like the majority of this House, will follow the rapporteurâs sensible path and adopt the Common Position without major amendment, for it represents a good compromise.
A GWP threshold value of 150 reduces emissions by 90%.
The deadlines â 2011 for new types and 2017 for new models â are ambitious enough, and it will also be possible for the manufacturers to meet them.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has already voted to reject the demand for the reintroduction of GWP 50.
Compared with a threshold value of 150, a GWP threshold value of 50 has no significant impact on the greenhouse effect; that is confirmed, not by the car industry, but by the British impact assessment, the Commission and the Swedish Environment Ministry.
Setting the GWP at 50 would exclude all the alternatives to CO2 as refrigerants for mobile air-conditioning systems, but it is not for the legislator to prescribe one single technology to the industry.
We should instead leave that to the engineers and promote competition between environmentally-friendly alternatives.
The core issue with the f-gas Regulation is its legal basis.
There is no apparent reason why we should have different legal bases for stationary air-conditioning systems on the one hand and for mobile ones on the other.
In both instances, we are dealing with product-oriented legislation for the internal market.
If the confidence to plan ahead, legal certainty and common standards in the internal market are to be guaranteed, then the legal basis should be Article 95.
This expresses a clear commitment to both high environmental standards and a functioning internal market in which all are subject to the same ground rules.
At a time when we frequently find ourselves discussing better regulation, I would, in this specific instance, remind the House of the problems involved in transposing the electronic waste directive, which is based on Article 175.
Â Â  Â Â  MrÂ President, I should first like to thank MrsÂ Doyle for the splendid job she has done.
When you consider what we are up against and the way in which the fluorinated gas industry is lobbying us at the moment, it is simply hair-raising.
They misinform us when they, for example, talk about its being more energy-efficient to use their poisonous gases.
The fact is, just about all energy-efficient refrigerators, that is to say those rated AA+ and A++, use natural coolants rather than these gases.
Nor is it the case that there are no alternatives.
By virtue of tough legislation and industry that is up-to-date and well disposed towards the environment, we in Denmark have in actual fact developed alternatives, and we can say that, in general, we are in a position to comply with the most stringent requirements.
It would be completely scandalous if we were knocked back again by an old-fashioned sunset industry that thinks only of itself.
Let me just say a word, finally, about mobile gases.
When you consider how few countries in the world actually need air conditioning in cars, I do not see that there is any reason at all for there to be so much environmental pollution from this source.
It is ludicrous that we cannot get something done about this too.
Â Â  MrÂ President, fluorinated gases can destroy the ozone layer, and it is therefore important for all countries to be called on to make an extra effort to get rid of them.
A direct ban, as has been implemented in Denmark, would be best.
As MrsÂ Auken said, Danish industry has got used to the ban and is developing environmentally friendly alternatives.
However, neither the Commissionâs nor MrsÂ Doyleâs proposal refers explicitly to this viable ban.
Mrs Doyle deserves praise for using the minimum provisions of ArticleÂ 175 instead of the internal marketâs total harmonisation.
We know that she has been under heavy pressure, but MrsÂ Doyleâs proposal is scarcely enough to preserve the Danish ban.
Together with MrÂ Blokland, I have therefore tabled AmendmentÂ 45, which specifies that all countries should be permitted to go further in protecting the ozone layer against fluorinated gases.
I want to be satisfied that we can keep our ban and thus the incentive to create sustainable alternatives.
We know that the Commission administers ArticleÂ 175 very strictly and always wants to see uniform rules instead of supporting those countries that wish to lead the way.
The Commission represents total harmonisation rather than promotion of the environment, the hole in the ozone layer rather than the ozone layer itself and the past rather than our common future.
I would therefore call on all my fellow Members to support AmendmentÂ 45. It reads: âThis Regulation shall not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing stricter protective measuresâ.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there is often considerable confusion, as well as demagogy, about the deleterious effects of human activities on the environment: either people deny that we bear any responsibility, or there is a mad rush to declare that we do, so far with the support of scientific arguments that are not universally accepted.
In any case, we can definitely be more certain that the gases that we are talking about have destructive effects on ozone molecules than we can be about the supposed increase in mean atmospheric temperature, which is blamed on higher carbon dioxide levels.
Overall, therefore, I can support the Doyle report, although there are some points on which I cannot agree.
One of these is Amendment 38, which proposes banning fluorocarbons in the semiconductor industry, although this industry so far does not seem to have used them to any great extent, thus adhering to the targets set by the Kyoto protocol.
I shall therefore vote against this amendment.
I also harbour some doubts about Amendments 34, 35 and 36, which propose introducing bans on the use of fluorinated gases in professional equipment; I shall abstain on these.
I intend to vote for Amendment 45 instead.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I ought really, according to the German working time directive, to have been on a rest break for the past six hours and 26 minutes, but the debate is nevertheless a very interesting one.
As a fellow-Member of the same group, I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for the outstanding work she has done.
The message that this Common Position carries from us to the world at large is a positive one.
We are showing ourselves to be taking the Kyoto Protocolâs targets seriously, and endeavouring to be an example to the rest of the world in this respect â an example of how to pursue ambitious climate targets and make less use of f-gases.
I would, however, have been glad if this Houseâs Legal Affairs Committee had done as it needed to do and produced its opinion in good time, in order that we might have a few pointers on the legal position.
I am myself in favour of the dual legal basis using Articles 95 and 175, as described in the Common Position â not, I have to say, out of any antipathy towards the environment, but because I would like to see the whole of the European market, and Europeâs environment too, maintained and developed in accordance with the same high standards.
If we are to have a common legal basis, I see Article 95 as a good starting point, for it enables us to find more common ground than we would if we followed Article 175 and left too many options open to the individual Member States.
I also think it problematic that the derogation in Article 175 gives the public the impression that we are not acting together in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, three of the six gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol are fluorinated greenhouse gases, and it is these that this legislation is intended to regulate.
If we are to achieve the Kyoto goals and move towards sustainable development, it is desirable that the regulation we are discussing today should enter into force without delay.
In his speech, Commissioner Dimas said that the intention was that the adoption of this piece of legislation should send out a positive signal, but that is possible only if either Community-wide targets are ambitious and stringent enough â and we know that that cannot be said of this proposal â or if we take Article 175 as our legal basis and thereby offer those Member States that have already gone further the opportunity to implement a more rigorous and more environmentally-friendly policy that will be beneficial to the climate.
It has already been pointed out that both Austria and Denmark have adopted general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and it is clear from the experiences of both these countries that alternatives to such gases exist.
Reference was also made to a comprehensive study by the German Federal Office for the Environment, which shows that there is potential for reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and the use of energy.
We must use this legislation to ensure that more rigorous regulations can be retained.
That is important if the Member States are to be enabled to meet the obligations imposed on them by the Kyoto Protocol.
This option also reflects a legal opinion given by Parliamentâs legal service, according to which Article 175 is the right and proper legal basis.
It would also, in effect, send a positive political signal if we were to refrain from bringing back into line those countries that are already taking action that is more likely to prevent damage to the environment and to the climate.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, fluorinated gases are a grave threat to our environment.
It seems that the world is warming up; we are aware that significant measures must be taken to combat activities that contribute to this problem.
We must also be firm in our commitment to honour the Kyoto Treaty and to go beyond the rhetoric of environmental protection.
We must replace fluorinated gases with safer alternatives and take real action towards stopping their release into the environment.
However, it would be counterproductive to ban these gases in such a way that we simply destroy European companies, while simply moving manufactured products that use F-gases to countries that do not ban them, countries that may even see an EU ban on fluorinated gases as an opportunity to capture the refrigeration and other related markets.
The whole globe shares the same ozone layer.
Phasing out the use of fluorinated gases in favour of competitive alternatives is an important step towards making real environmental progress.
However, in phasing out substances, we must also ensure that existing F-gases are not simply released into the environment.
Regulation of F-gases has led to toxic graveyards of leaking fridges in some countries.
We have to ask ourselves the question: what is the best way to keep F-gases from being released into the environment?
More focus must be put upon controlling the gases that have already been produced.
We must ensure that a mechanism is put in place to effect the safe elimination of existing fluorinated gases as well.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, important though this regulation undoubtedly is in how we approach climate change, since it will in any event lead to a reduction in the use of f-gases, it is only a first step.
That is why I think it is best if it is taken with caution.
The Commission will need to table an assessment report in a few yearsâ time, and the important measures that are now being proposed must also have the chance of being implemented in the sector.
As science and technology develops, it will become evident whether additional restrictions are viable, and more analyses are required for this purpose.
After all, the sector involved is a global industry, and since goods must be able to circulate freely in and out of the EU, it is impossible for each country to impose its own rules.
We must prevent disparity between the different legislations from leading to different playing fields for the market operators.
That is why it is also important to state that a happy balance should be struck between solid environmental progress and not too many restrictions for the internal market.
This is best accommodated, in my view, by the mixed legal basis proposed by the Council.
That is also the ideal approach in the framework of which research and development can be stimulated on a large scale.
The EU sets out the guidelines that guarantee the responsible use of the f-gases and the sector can further develop research in a creative manner.
Consequently, it is wholly unacceptable to us if at present, more unviable restrictions were to be imposed on the sector unilaterally, without consultation, on applications for which there are insufficient alternatives available or for which alternatives are not more energy efficient, taking into consideration the environmental cost as a whole, if possible within the provisions of Article 175.
I would like to hear what the Commission has to say on the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, on the directive on mobile air-conditioning, I think we have a sensible compromise in Parliament.
My only reservation concerns the amendment from Mr Liese and others about low-volume cars.
It seems to me that low-volume cars are often high-spec cars with all kinds of features and I wonder what the Commission thinks about the amendment to somehow exempt them from the requirement of having sound technology for mobile air-conditioning.
On the regulation, I think you have heard that the consensus view in Parliament is going to be in favour of Mrs Doyleâs approach, and I am very loathe to use EU legislation to reduce environment standards in different Member States.
We have heard from colleagues from different countries who have said they feared this would happen.
We need the Council, the Commission and Parliament to bang their heads together to get a resolution on this issue.
By the same token, I am also loathe to agree, when we come to vote, on a series of prohibitions on the use of F gases, which have not been tested or assessed for their health and safety, nor for their economic or environmental impact.
Although many of the letters from lobbyists on both sides of the argument may well be valid, before we ban things, we ought to have proper assessments.
Therefore, Commissioner, I agree with what you said when you spoke about the prohibitions and the need for them to be examined and to come forward in the review.
I thank Mrs Doyle for her work.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues.
It has been a very interesting debate.
I also thank Commissioner Dimas.
As I came here to speak tonight, the Committee on Legal Affairs was only beginning to consider â as is its duty â the proposed change in the legal base in the common position.
I should like to put on record that it was considered, but without much debate at all, and the Members of the Legal Affairs Committee were never even advised that Parliament's legal opinion to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was that the dual legal base would not withstand a challenge before the ECJ.
They agreed that the dual legal base, as proposed in the common position, should remain.
But our clear legal advice is that this will not withstand a challenge before the European Court.
On that basis and according to what everyone else has said, I appeal to colleagues for support for the legal base of Article 175 tomorrow, with the proper Commission policing â please â of the internal market, as required of them under Article 176.
That is most important.
Under the better regulation announcement by President Barroso some weeks ago, the F-gases were mentioned in terms of impact assessment and analysis.
The four-month time frame that we have in Parliament at second reading did not allow a proper teasing-out of exactly what was in the Commission's mind.
It is unacceptable to ask us to pass this legislation â but we have no choice, because of the time frame â without a proper and full impact analysis, as many colleagues have requested, particularly in relation to bans.
I do not, generally speaking, support the extra bans, particularly on SF6 and others.
I am generally in favour of Article 175 but against extra bans.
It is not acceptable at this point for that industry to bear that particular burden.
The political reality is that if we do not get a qualified majority for legal base Article 175 tomorrow â and we need a qualified majority for a second reading â the common position will remain: the dual legal base.
That will be challenged before the European Court of Justice, as we have been told, and we know the countries that are going to do it.
All legal advice tells us that they will find in favour of Article 175 as the legal base.
So for those who do not want that to happen, ironically, they should support Article 175 tomorrow so that we go into conciliation and politically we decide the shape, which will not be purely Article 175 because there will have to be compromises.
We should decide in conciliation and not let the ECJ decide, even though I would be very optimistic that my personal opinion will come out of the ECJ.
We are politicians; we want to decide it ourselves.
Thank you for your support.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches of the distinguished parliamentarians and I should like to make some comments on the specific amendments.
Amendments relating to the legal base of the regulation are of particular importance.
Amendments 1, 4, 5 (first part) and 45 concern the establishment of Article 175, and Amendments 33 and 40 concern the establishment of Article 95 as the sole legal base.
The Commission has accepted, as part of the compromise, that the directive should be based on Article 95 alone and that the regulation should have a legal base of Article 175 and Article 95 in relation to Articles 8, 9 and 10.
However, the Commission will closely follow further developments on this issue in both Parliament and the Council.
I have most certainly taken note of your concerns on this issue.
Amendments 2 and 7 specify in Article 1, with a corresponding change to the recital, that specific actions are needed in order for Member States to reach their individual Kyoto emission targets.
As I have already said, the Commission can support these amendments provided that the Member States do not infringe other Treaty obligations.
Likewise, it can support Amendments 6 and 31 on the promotion of alternative technologies, provided there is a change to the text.
There are a number of amendments of a technical nature specifically addressing containment.
The Commission can support most of those amendments, provided that in some cases there is a change in language to reflect the technical realities.
We can also agree in principle to Amendment 25, as regards the need to indicate the global warming potential on labels for the applications covered in this regulation, although we believe the issue of labelling would be best resolved by the Commission through the committee, after careful preparation.
The review provision is very important since the regulation is only a first step.
In this context, we can be positive on some of the amendments that strengthen this review process.
However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 27 and 30, which would require the Commission to provide a proposal by a specific date, irrespective of the findings of its review.
This would undermine the Commissionâs right of initiative with respect to legislative proposals and cannot be accepted.
The Commission cannot support Amendments 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 41, which introduce new âplacing on the market bansâ.
The Commission has always stated that a full technical and economic evaluation is needed before establishing whether a product or equipment containing fluorinated gases should be prohibited.
The review provides for this four years after the entry into force of the regulation.
Amendment 26, which requires the use of HFCs only where safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally sound alternatives do not exist, is also unacceptable.
In practice, this would allow any Member State to do as it wished with respect to products containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, because there are no established criteria to determine that alternatives are safe, technically feasible and environmentally sound, etc.
A number of other amendments that improve some of the general provisions of the regulation can be accepted.
However, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 12, which provides a new definition of placing on the market.
Although it supports the principle of Amendment 19 on the need to facilitate the shipment of recovered fluorinated greenhouse gases in the Community, the Commission believes it is unnecessary here since this matter is covered by the new waste shipment regulation.
As regards the directive, the Commission believes that Amendment 1 on fiscal incentives does not provide any new value added to the proposal.
Member States are already allowed to grant fiscal incentives, provided that they comply with state aid rules, particularly the guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, as well as on Commission notice on the application of the state aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.
The same goes for Amendment 2, as the 1999 directive already requires Member States to ensure that the label indicating carbon dioxide emissions is affixed on all new cars for sale in the European Union.
However, as part of its review of this directive, with a view to making an amending proposal in 2006, if necessary, the Commission will also investigate the possibility of including on the label information on the greenhouse gas effect of mobile air conditioners.
This will cover information regarding both the refrigerant used and the impact on fuel consumption.
I believe this will satisfy all concerns.
Many of the new amendments that have been tabled seeking to shift the final date in the common position from 2017 to 2016 will not be supported by the Commission, since we believe that the existing dates achieve our environmental ambition and would allow industry sufficient time for compliance.
It is important that the phase-out is achieved in a smooth, effective and technologically sound manner.
In summary, the Commission believes that, given the relatively small environmental gain that would result from advancing the deadline for the phase-out, the case for a change is not justified.
Likewise, we cannot support amendments that change the threshold for the global warming potential from 150 to 50, since this would in our view be determining the technology that the industry has to apply for little environmental gain.
We also believe that the proposed exemption for small car producers is not compatible with the type-approval system.
In conclusion, out of 45 proposed amendments to the regulation, the Commission can accept five fully, and a further 18 in principle or in part.
For the directive, the Commission cannot support the 10 amendments proposed.
I shall give a complete list of the Commissionâs position on the amendments to Parliamentâs Secretariat.
Finally, I would just like to add that, in a letter from the Director-General to Mr Florenz, the Commission has given details of the discussion we had in the college regarding the proposals pending before the legislator.
This is just to provide Parliament with the existing available information, but no further economic studies are necessary.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 26Â October.
Annex â Position of the Commission
Regulation (2003/0189A (COD))

Directive (2003/0189B (COD))
The Commission rejects 10 amendments in full: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the statements by Mr Barroso and Mr McCreevy on the latest statements by Mr McCreevy on the Vaxholm case.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to exchange views with Parliament on issues that are at the forefront of our concerns.
On 12 October, when Parliament expressed its wish to have this debate, I made myself available on the very same day and I was ready to go to Parliament the same evening.
Unfortunately it was not possible to make a suitable agenda arrangement.
I am glad that it is now possible to have this discussion.
This debate was triggered by a case pending in the Swedish and European courts.
It concerns what is known as the Laval case.
I realise that there are strong political sensitivities on all sides and difficult issues to be dealt with.
I have personally discussed this case with the Prime Ministers of Sweden and Latvia and I am fully aware of the importance that is attached to it.
The Commission is still waiting for the European Court to forward to us the question referred for a preliminary ruling.
We will then examine the case carefully and submit our views in an brief to the Court, as we do in all proceedings of this kind.
Obviously, once the Court has given its judgment the Commission is at the disposal of all parties to analyse the situation and possible solutions as required.
Given that it was possible to find equitable solutions in other situations, of which the posting of workers directive is but one example, the Commission remains convinced that it is possible to reconcile the four freedoms under the European Treaties with the different social models chosen by the Member States.
The role of the Commission is to ensure that both the social and the internal market legislation are respected and fully implemented in all Member States, without discrimination.
As a matter of principle, the Commission respects the different social models chosen by the Member States.
It recognises that the Swedish model has a successful record of combining high employment with flexibility for companies and also with social justice.
The Swedish system is clearly a model which provides adaptability in a globalised society.
In particular the Commission acknowledges that, in view of its successful record, Sweden did not feel it necessary to request transitional periods for the access of workers from the new Member States to the Swedish labour market.
The issues raised must also be seen in their broader economic and political context.
They demonstrate the need to advance our agenda for growth and jobs in order to achieve stronger social and economic cohesion.
As I said at the beginning, this debate was triggered by a court case.
First and foremost we should wait for the court to deliver its judgment.
Let me make it clear: this Parliament is not a court, it is a political body and a political debate is needed.
This is a matter of substance, not just of legal interpretation.
The essential questions are clear.
Are we for or against solidarity in an enlarged Union?
Are we for or against economic and social cohesion to reduce imbalances in a Union of 25 members?
Are we for or against the free movement of workers, with full respect for the national legislation and social frameworks of the Member States?
Are we for or against a European budget capable of effectively promoting economic and social cohesion?
Those are the questions that lie behind this debate and on which we need to express our views.
We have to be prepared for cases like this in the future.
In an enlarged Union, these problems might well arise.
It is interesting to recall that in 1986, when Spain and Portugal became members of the European Community, Spanish and Portuguese workers were seen as a threat by many of the existing European Community members.
The solution was not protection within each market but the promotion of economic and social cohesion.
The general issue, therefore, is how we reduce imbalances and actively promote prosperity, so that our Union is really united and has no artificial divisions.
I hope that all those who are for social solidarity, social cohesion and economic cohesion will fight for the ambitious financial perspectives and active social and economic cohesion policy we need in an enlarged Europe.
We need to promote union, not artificial boundaries.
Let me now give the floor to Commissioner McCreevy.
As you know, as the Commissioner for the Internal Market he has special responsibility for defending the internal market principles that are enshrined in our Treaties.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me confirm that the Commission does not call into question the organisation of labour relations and the system of collective agreements in Sweden or indeed any other Member State.
It is entirely a matter for each Member State to determine how labour relations are organised and whether or not its system includes collective bargaining.
The Commission recognises the important role that collective agreements play in bringing stability and predictability to economic and social relations in the many Member States that utilise these methods.
At the opening of the Brussels sitting earlier this month, reference was made to the fact that I had recently stated that the Scandinavian model of collective agreements was not compatible with the EC Treaty.
Those who know me will be very much aware that I have vigorously supported collective agreements in the Member State I know best.
In my home country, I have been directly involved in more national partnership negotiations than any previous Irish Minister for Finance.
In my time in that office, I was regarded, together with my Prime Minister, as the leading government defender of the of Irish social partnership.
During a recent visit to a number of Member States, including Latvia and Sweden, the press asked me about the ongoing investigation in what is known as the Laval case.
It is a case involving a Latvian construction company, Laval, that won a tender to build a school in Vaxholm in Sweden.
As a result of a dispute on whether Laval had to sign up to the Swedish collective agreement and whether it had to pay the average Swedish wage in the construction sector, the Swedish construction trade union blocked the construction site.
The action taken by the Swedish construction trade union eventually led Laval to terminate the contract and the company ultimately went bankrupt.
The matter was brought before the Swedish Labour Court, which in turn referred the matter to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.
The fact that the Swedish Labour Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice demonstrates that the legal situation is complicated.
Whether the Swedish authorities and the trade union were right in how they handled this case will be determined by the Swedish Labour Court in the light of the ruling that will be given by the European Court of Justice.
The Commission will be invited to present its analysis of the situation and all the legal elements, including Article 49 of the Treaty on the freedom to provide services and the application of the posted workers directive.
This analysis is complex and will take some time.
The Commission has not yet formed a view on this.
Those are the facts of the matter.
As to the broader question of how the Commission sees the development of the internal market and the European social model, let me stress that, for the Commission, the development of the internal market and the preservation of the European social model go hand in hand.
They are not mutually exclusive; they reinforce each other.
The internal market creates new opportunities for businesses, consumers and workers.
This allows the preservation and further development of social rights, in accordance with the collective preferences of each individual Member State.
The Commission has an onerous duty in making sure that the basic rights and freedoms set down in the Treaty are respected throughout the Union.
As guardian of the internal market, I exercise my responsibilities in an even-handed manner.
To be credible, there is no alternative.
I find it extraordinary that I should have to justify remarks I made on an incident that raise questions about its compatibility with Article 49 of the Treaty.
I was not the first to raise this question.
It was the Swedish Labour court that asked whether there is incompatibility with Community law, in particular the posting of workers directive, Article 49 on the free movement of services and Article 12 on non-discrimination.
This happens to be a âsensitiveâ issue in a Member State.
But does the mere fact that an issue is sensitive deprive me of my right to express a view or carry out my duty?
I believe in the necessity for the Commission to be impartial and fair in the exercise of its duties.
I will continue to voice my opinions loud and clear.
I do not care if it means upsetting some people.
I passionately believe in the primary role of the Commission to ensure the rules of the Treaty are applied and I will vigorously defend that role.
I have sworn to do so.
There are 25 Member States in the Union.
I make no distinction between them.
Just because Latvia is a new Member State and one of the smallest, that does not mean its complaints are less important.
Latvian trade union members are entitled to have their interests defended as much as Swedish trade union members.
Neither I nor the Commission call into question the social model of any Member State or the way in which it organises labour relations.
One of the strengths of the Union is its diversity.
I have my views about what is good for the economy.
I have never hidden these views.
I also have my views about how the challenges and opportunities arising from globalisation should be addressed and I do not believe it is an option to maintain barriers and try to pretend that competition does not exist, or can be kept outside the borders.
However, I have never said that there is a single recipe for running every economy.
There is no single recipe for organising labour relations and there is no single recipe for a social model.
What works in one country might not work for another.
I will therefore not express any view on whether the social model of one Member State is better or worse than that of another.
That is a matter for political choice in each country and I know that every system will find supporters and critics.
The truth lies, most of the time, in the middle.
No single system has only advantages.
Every system and every choice has downsides.
Choices and preferences may also change.
What is good now may not necessarily be so in five yearsâ time.
The subject being discussed today is not whether the social system of a country is under threat or whether that system is an example to others.
The real issue for me is what we mean by an internal market.
What do Article 49 of the Treaty and the freedom to provide services mean?
What do Article 12 and the principle of non-discrimination mean?
No one has questioned the enormous benefits the internal market brings, the extra growth and the extra jobs it has created.
We should not be afraid of the internal market.
We should embrace it.
We have a Union of 25 Member States.
The world is not waiting for us to take advantage of the internal market we live in.
Others will do it for us if we do not wake up.
I will defend the rights laid down in the Treaty.
I will continue to apply its provisions in an even-handed way.
But if members of this House expect me to creep around quietly and not upset some Member States and some Members of the European Parliament, then I am afraid that they are going to be disappointed.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group takes the view that this House possesses the self-evident right to call Members of the Commission â including its President â before it and to ask for their opinions.
The President of the Commission has indicated that he was very much prepared to appear in Brussels, as, indeed, he is obliged to do when Parliament demands it.
That he did not has something to do with those who were asking him to do so, and nothing whatever with him, so we thank him for doing his duty and being here today.
Commissioner McCreevyâs statements in Stockholm were not intended to call into question the Swedish social model, or to attack the Swedish social partnersâ right to determine wages.
The EU Services Directive was not a point at issue, nor was he talking about any decision to be taken by Parliament, the Council or the Commission; on the contrary, he was referring to a case before the European Court of Justice.
When Commissioner McCreevy, at the beginning of October, told an audience in Stockholm that the Commission supported a Latvian building firm in its dispute with a Swedish building workersâ trade union, he was doing what the Commission is obliged to do by the Treaties, that being to act as the guardian of the law and of rights â in this instance, the right to the freedom to provide services.
In so doing, far from calling into question Swedenâs traditional system of collective agreements, he was trying to make it clear that this system, like all others, has to respond to the establishment of the internal market.
Let me take this opportunity to point out that other countries â for example, the country from which Mr Schulz comes â have already responded by availing themselves of the provisions made by the Posting of Workers Directive for the building sector, or of the option provided for in the accession negotiations, namely of enacting transitional regulations for workers from the states that most recently joined the EU.
It is evident that the Swedish Government is trying to draw attention away from its own failings.
There is no other explanation for the attempt by the Swedish Minister for the Economy to exert pressure on the European institutions by threatening to withdraw his countryâs support for the Services Directive.
His motives are transparent and his actions unacceptable to us.
The Services Directive has nothing whatever to do with the case under consideration.
What is at issue is the interpretation of the law as it stands, which nobody wants to change.
I would like to say, on behalf of my group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that nobody in our ranks has any desire to use the Services Directive to alter labour law or the laws on collective bargaining, and certainly not to impose restrictions upon them.
Those who make assertions to the contrary are trying to frighten people and whip up anti-European sentiment.
We must, of course, be very sensitive and take peopleâs concerns seriously. That was brought home to us by the two failed referendums earlier this year.
There is nothing clever, though, about politicians who keep trying to shift blame towards Brussels and get it to carry the can.
If statements by a Member of the Commission are used as a pretext for covering up oneâs own mistakes and omissions, then that is something of which this House cannot approve.
The people of Central and Eastern Europe have stood up for freedom, democracy and self-determination, and have done so with great success.
In so doing, they have won for themselves the right to become members of the community that is the European Union.
As we see it, there is no doubt whatever that they can therefore lay claim to all the rights associated with that status, and must not be treated as second-class Europeans.
That is what this is about.
By that shall we be judged.
We will not allow this European Community to be divided up, with citizens and states allotted to first or second class within it; on the contrary, we are one single common European Union, and, as such, we practise solidarity.
We defend our social model, and the internal market forms part of it, for it offers us the only opportunity to make ourselves competitive on a global scale.
These are the principles by which our group stands.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a helpful debate, in that it is clear even from the applause where this Commission stands.
Far from it standing in the centre, in the middle ground of European politics, it has become apparent this morning that it â not all its Members, but Commissioner McCreevy and President Barroso â have taken up an unequivocal stance and set a right-wing, neo-liberal course, against which my Group campaigns â today, tomorrow and every other day.
Yes, it is true to say that we welcome all the new states of the European Union â all of them.
We Social Democrats are fighting for Romania and Bulgaria as well, and we urge you to do likewise, with the same dedication, but the one reason why we welcome them is that we want social progress in Europe and we want the social standards we have achieved to be secured.
We do not want Swedish workers to be played off against their Latvian counterparts, but you do; that is how you go about destroying Europe.
In preparing us for todayâs debate, the chairman of the European Socialist Party, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, recast this topic in the form of three simple questions.
Those three questions I shall now put to you, and I want clear answers to them from you.
Here comes the first question, Mr President of the Commission: does the Commission take the view that trade unions â those in Sweden, for example â have the right to campaign in defence of collective agreements, which may involve them taking strike action?
Secondly, does the Commission take the view that the Nordic version of the social model is compatible with the rules of the internal market?
I put this question to you, Mr Barroso, for to judge by what I hear Commissioner McCreevy saying, it is apparently not.
The message we get from Commissioner McCreevy is that, in the event of his interpretation of Article 49 becoming accepted, there is no longer any room in Europe for the Swedish model.
Our response to that, Mr McCreevy, is that your interpretation of Article 49 will not prevail in Europe, at any rate not while the Social Democrats in this House have any say in the matter.
The third question we want to put to you, Mr Barroso, is this: we need an unequivocal statement as to what the Commissionâs position is in relation to the European Court of Justice in the Vaxholm case.
Where, in fact, do you stand on that?
The reason why we have demanded the President of the Commissionâs and the Commissionerâs presence here is that this debate is about nothing more and nothing less than the question of in which direction we want to develop this European Union of ours, of what this European Unionâs purpose is.
Europeâs citizens have their own worries and their own aspirations; these they address not only to us in this House, but also to the Commission.
The people of Europe want employment, but not at the price of Chinese wages and Asian working conditions.
They want living wages from secure jobs, an income with which they can achieve some sort of workable and secure future for themselves and for their children.
That is what the European social model is, and that is what we want to defend.
What I hear from you, though, Mr McCreevy, is that the free market in Europe means that the lowest standards for incomes, the lowest standards for social security and the lowest standards for workersâ rights are the best way of promoting competition and growth and that they must prevail.
No, that is the wrong way to go about it.
The European social model, which involves partnership between capital and labour, is a recipe for success.
Let me repeat that we want to put our Latvian and Czech comrades in a stronger position; my colleague Mr Falbr, who is a Czech trade unionist, will shortly have something to say about that.
European social policy cannot have the driving down of wages as its objective.
Far from it: one of the effects of the EUâs structural policy is to unleash progress and economic growth in the new Member States, in the Baltic states, in Slovakia or Slovenia, and this technical advance, this process of economic growth, must be inseparable from the workersâ sharing in this growth, and what that means is higher wages and more trade union rights for the workers in those countries, rather than fewer rights in Sweden and lower and lower standards.
That would be a system after Mr McCreevyâs heart, and we will not have it.
What we expect of you, Mr President of the Commission, is that you should now come out and say, once and for all, where you stand.
Last week, you delivered a speech on social policy, in which you proposed, indeed demanded, the establishment of an intervention fund.
That is something we support, with the proviso that such an intervention fund must not be used for the victims of Commissioner McCreevyâs policies.
To that we are opposed.
I urge you to say once and for all what your Commission stands for; if you want to put your commitment to the European social model beyond doubt, then you must, at last, put the brakes on Charlie McCreevy, Neelie Kroes, and other members of your Commission.
You have the means to do so, and if you do it, you can count on our support, but if your system is about continuing the downgrading of mobility and social standards in Europe, then your Commission will have to contend with the opposition of the Socialist Group in this House.
Â Â  . â Mr President, on Thursday our national leaders convene in London to discuss what sort of Europe we want to build.
A Europe that is open to the world, dynamic and competitive, or one which seeks to shelter its industry and workforce from globalisation?
A Europe which can offer security, prosperity and opportunity to its citizens, or one which, enslaved to the precepts of the past, slides further into recession?
This debate is fundamental to Europeans; it must be conducted honestly, rationally and directly.
It is therefore disappointing that those who have brought Commissioner McCreevy and President Barroso here today seem more interested in stalling debate than furthering it, perhaps for the sake of a few more votes in the upcoming Swedish election.
They accuse the Commission of being off-centre.
Have they not noticed that the centre of opinion has shifted?
Their political manoeuvring aims not only to derail the Services Directive; it is aimed at one of the fundamental pillars of the Treaty: the free movement of persons and freedom of establishment.
Mr McCreevy should not be made the scapegoat for their scepticism.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market, he has a duty to defend it against its detractors.
Nor should his comments be seen as an attack on the Swedish social model, which Liberals have defended for its ability to balance the brutality of the marketplace with a sizeable social safety net.
They should be seen as an attack on the Swedish Builders Federationâs hypocrisy, xenophobia and protectionism.
Laval bid in a fair and open competition for that contract, fulfilling public procurement criteria.
The company has a collective agreement with its workers, just as Swedish employers have with theirs.
What is more, when challenged by the unions over labour rates, Laval offered to raise its wages to the level agreed by the Swedish collective agreement.
However, that was not good enough for the union.
It demanded that the rates should be the Stockholm average, rather than the Swedish national average.
Finally, in a breathtaking lack of worker solidarity, that union prevented work from going ahead, which led to the company withdrawing from the contract and filing for bankruptcy.
Now Latvian workers are out of a job thanks to the Swedish trade unions.
Is that situation the fault of Laval, or is it the fault of a syndicate which puts protecting Swedish jobs ahead of the common market principles we have signed up to?
It is not by turning inwards and embracing protectionism that we will overcome sluggish economic growth and compete with China and India.
The British historian James Anthony Froude once wrote that the practical effect of a belief is the test of its soundness.
What better rebuke to the defenders of protectionism than this sorry affair?
Perhaps we should not be surprised that Liberal economic and social thought is in the ascendant.
One reason is that more and more people are so painfully aware of the alternatives.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner McCreevy, you have made a frontal attack on the Swedish right to strike, which is protected by the Swedish Constitution.
You maintain that you accept the Nordic modelâs collective agreements but, at the same time, you wish to undermine them with your legislation.
You must realise that our legislative objective is to protect each worker against unfair working conditions, not Swedish workers against Latvian workers.
You are making the most common mistake of all among EU politicians. You believe that something that worked in your own country for a certain period â your one-sided policy on growth and the internal market, through which Irish finance ministers succeeded for a time in reducing unemployment and increasing income â has to operate in the EU for evermore.
That policy depended, however, on certain temporary, national and accidental circumstances.
Progress was made not because of, but in spite of, deficient social protection.
In Sweden, we have managed to make some tough adjustments because of the security provided to us by forms of social protection.
The Nordic model too is based, however, on unique basic conditions that cannot be exported to the EU as a whole with the help of legislation.
The right thing is to learn from each other but to allow the legislation to permit adjustments according to the basic conditions that prevail in each region.
Otherwise, we shall end up with a centrally administered form of âeurosclerosisâ.
The EU is like a football team. As coach, you see that you have a good player in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, so you come to the conclusion that all players should wear shoes his size and that you need to have 11 attackers in your team.
With tactics like that, our football team would lose against both India and China.
Instead, you need to see each playerâs potential for development and what each can give to the team and to do so without crushing playersâ individual creativity as long as they follow the basic rules of the game.
Only then will there be a chance of winning the World Cup.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, my group naturally supports the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the dispute that has brought it into conflict with MrÂ McCreevy and with the Commission in general.
How could we, on the left, accept a concept of Europe founded on creating competition among workers and on organising social dumping?
It is exactly this kind of policy that we have in mind when we say ânoâ to liberal Europe.
What really grates is the fact that that brutal agitator, MrÂ McCreevy, and all those who share his opinions unfortunately can rely on rules in force in the EU in giving their support to a Latvian business claiming not to know about Swedenâs system of collective agreements and in applying more restrictive social standards.
The provision to which, in this case, the Latvian service provider and its promoters in Brussels are referring is called mutual recognition, which was introduced into Community law, via the case law of the Court of Justice, in 1979 for the free circulation of goods and was then expanded to incorporate services around 15 years ago.
This is a strategic choice.
Instead of legislating on upwards social harmonisation, the market and competition are being allowed to pull the social downwards: in Community jargon, this is what is known as better regulation.
Moreover, the Commission issued in 1999 a communication to Parliament and to the Council that was extremely explicit on this matter.
I quote: âThe application of mutual recognition is fully consistent with the Single Market philosophy according to which the rules of the Member State of origin normally prevail, and the Member State of destination can only derogate from that rule under very strict conditions challenging the overriding requirements of general public importance, such as health care, consumer protection or the environment.â
With the most recent enlargement, this rule has become explosive: the more social disparities increase among Member States, the more they reveal the diabolical consequences of this rule.
From now on, everything will depend on what the Court considers to come under the âoverriding requirements of general public importanceâ.
It is therefore not only a question of attacking MrÂ McCreevyâs zeal, but also of opposing the harmful provisions themselves of the .
From now on, let us consider this matter from the perspective of the forthcoming votes on the draft Bolkestein Directive, whatever MrÂ Poettering might have to say about it, and let us use this experience more generally to enhance our collective thoughts on the future of Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Vaxholm case is another example of the great risks we run when we in this way allow our pluralistic Europe slowly to be squeezed out in our efforts to standardise.
In Sweden, we have a special tradition which has been very successful and which is based on collective agreements.
This is now under severe threat.
All I want to observe right now in this Chamber is that the June List asserts in no uncertain terms that the Member Statesâ own legislation must apply in these areas.
Their own traditions and collective agreements etc must apply and should not be exposed to threat from action taken in Brussels.
We therefore absolutely reject any action that might be taken whereby it is the country of origin principle that is applied to these issues.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I welcome President Barroso and Commissioner McCreevy to the Chamber today.
It is unfortunate that we have not been able to utilise our time with them to discuss the document which they presented to the Conference of Presidents last week with regard to the future European social model.
The reason why we are not discussing upcoming events, where we can have influence with regard to decisions that will be taken by the 25Â Member States, is because certain Members of this House want to re-run previous battles, previous elections, and to try to insist in future elections.
These arguments and this debate are predicated not on real divergence of opinion with regard to a better form of social model, but merely on maintaining an archaic, protectionist system.
When you fail to win the argument, you then attack the man: you carry out a personal attack because of his accent, because of the way in which he expresses himself.
That is the most despicable form of political discourse or activity that I have ever come across.
Let us look at the clear facts before us. We have a statement by the Commission that the social model of each Member State is its own business.
Questions concerning collective bargaining or collective agreements are a matter for the Member States themselves and not for anyone else.
The Commission has reiterated what we have known since 1969: the Commissionâs role is to defend the European Treaties, whether it be Article 49, Article 21, Article 95 or Article 99.
We also have a new document from the Commission, agreed by the College, which puts forward the best parts of the social models that are available to us within the European Union and states that this should be our minimum standard, our starting point.
But what do we see happening?
We see Member State governments â the Swedish Government in particular â utilising an opportunity given to it by the Socialist Group in this Parliament to express its opposition to the Services Directive when, for three years, it has been in favour of that directive.
We now have a situation where Members are standing up in this House to say that they are defending workersâ rights in Latvia as well as in Sweden, despite the fact that the only exact information we have is that Latvian workers have lost their jobs because of the actions of some Swedish governments and trade unions.
It does not behove the future negotiations and discussions on behalf of Europe that, within this House, we cannot even set down proper debating time to discuss real issues rather than abstract principles.
Â Â  â Mr President, I rarely say that it is a function of mine to defend the Commission, but Commissioners have the right to freedom of expression and, just occasionally, they may even say eminently sensible things, like President Barroso when he accepted that the Constitution is unenforceable and that we need to move on.
So, Commissioner McCreevy had the right to express his opinion.
If that opinion was that, in some way, a âone size fits allâ approach to the social model is required, then that opinion is wrong.
The European social model cannot be defined with singularity; it must take account of diversity and respect the various traditions across Europe.
What is right for Sweden is not the choice of others.
Social policy must be tailored to the needs of the individual countries.
Subjecting social policy to the same regulation as business will not work.
Save us from the oppressive uniformity that some would impose upon us and let the needs of each rule the day.
Â Â  â Mr President, when the Commissioner spoke, the Swedish Laval Case was still pending in court, and still is.
If a case is pending, politicians such as ourselves, and certainly the Commission, should refrain from passing judgment.
That is my first observation.
Secondly, it was imprudent of the Commissioner to decide to give the free movement of services precedence over the collective agreement.
Why?
Because that self-same Commissioner also has to defend the services directive here in this House, in which we do not want to put those very values at risk.
Thirdly, as a Christian Democrat, I regard the socially-oriented market economy as the principle on which politics, my politics, our politics, are based.
In this social market economy, we give our social partners the responsibility of concluding their own collective agreements.
This is the value of delegating and sharing responsibility.
That means that if you do that, you can accommodate issues such as globalisation and the problems involving an ageing population that you have in that society.
Only by giving and sharing that responsibility can this be done.
As for the social debate, which everyone refers to as the social model, I am in favour of it, as long as the social values prevail.
I am in favour of a debate in which we, on the basis of those social values, can demonstrate that we are capable of providing answers, because they need to be given.
This is where I would beg to differ from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
I do not want a liberal market economy, but a socially-oriented market economy in which the social values are used as a basis, in which we find the answers to globalisation together, secure jobs, and ensure that the social security systems will be set up in such a way as to allow people to contribute to prosperity and thus employment.
On a final note, although I do not expect any initiatives that will defy the judgesâ rights, I do expect some that will have that effect on Parliament and the Council.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, what was it really that MrÂ McCreevy said in Stockholm?
He said that the Swedish Government is offending against the internal market and that he intended to take action against the Swedish Government when the case was dealt with by the Court.
He is saying the same thing today.
If that is not bringing the Swedish collective agreement model into question, then I do not know what, in fact, is.
MrÂ Watson, who is not in the Chamber, says that the Latvian company paid its employees under the Swedish collective agreement model, but that is untrue.
It paid just over half of the amount payable under the Swedish collective agreements in the Stockholm area, namely SEKÂ 78 instead of SEKÂ 140 per hour.
MrÂ McCreevy recommends that there should be 25 different collective agreements: one for each country.
That is a race to the bottom, not a race to the top.
So is the Swedish model less successful than other models?
No.
If we look at the Lisbon process, we see that it is perhaps the most successful.
Is it more protectionist?
No, Mr Poettering, Sweden has no transitional rules like Germanyâs.
On the contrary, it is open to labour from around the EU coming in.
Is it discriminatory?
The answer is no.
All companies are treated equally, irrespective of whether they are Swedish or Latvian.
Collective agreements are drawn up on the basis of the existing collective agreements.
You talked about Spain and Portugal, MrÂ Barroso.
Spain and Portugal have got themselves up to the same levels as other Member States.
What is it you are advocating now?
Yes, a race to the bottom.
You should think carefully.
You have launched this debate on the social model by recommending that we have a race to the bottom by having different collective agreements in different countries, that is to say 25 different collective agreements.
This will not create a European social model.
I therefore advise you to launch the debate in some other way.
Otherwise, there will be a war regarding the debate on the social model.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the work on improving and clarifying the incredibly important Services Directive is now well under way in Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
It is therefore odd and quite tragic that, in country after country, the directive is now being used as a weapon in what is basically a debate characterised by protectionism and nationalism.
Instead of standing up for the proposal and constructively trying to improve it, ministers in, for example, Sweden have shamelessly exploited peopleâs anxiety about globalisation and jobs by portraying the Services Directive as a great threat.
The words âsocial dumpingâ are hissed like an evil incantation, denoting one more wicked stratagem from Brussels.
No one wants to see social dumping, but the Services Directive does not lead to social dumping.
Nor does it threaten the Swedish model or the Swedish collective agreements.
The all but hysterical tone adopted by Social Democratic unions and politicians in Sweden is irresponsible.
The Minister for Trade and Industry, MrÂ Ãstros, has completely lost the plot when he accuses the Commission of intervening against a Member State on behalf of a âforeign companyâ.
It cannot have escaped MrÂ Ãstros that the foreign company is Latvian, that Latvia is a member of the European Union and that freedom of movement is one of the cornerstones of EU cooperation.
How is it that there are no problems when Swedish construction workers travel to Germany and work for higher wages than in Sweden but for lower wages than those earned by German construction workers?
That being said, there is an election campaign in Sweden, so that is the way things are.
Free trade, competition and mobility of services are good for Europe and good for Sweden.
Sweden is one of those countries that has most to gain from obstacles to the knowledge-intensive services being removed.
To oppose the Services Directive for reasons to do with election tactics and to threaten to block it in the Council is an historic act of folly.
Â Â  â Mr President, with all due respect to Commissioner McCreevy, I have to say that his claims that Swedish collective bargaining practice was contrary to the European Treaty and the freedom to provide services show that he has been led astray.
Not only has he pre-empted a court ruling, but he has also, and above all, put a question mark against the protection of workers as an element in the European internal market.
In the past, the freedom to provide services has always â not least in the Posting of Workers Directive â been seen as compatible with workersâ protection.
The freedom to provide services must continue, in future, to include protection for workers if âsocial Europeâ is to be something we actually want to establish rather than a mere form of words.
The reason why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stated that the Services Directive, which Commissioner McCreevy defends, is compatible neither with the Treaty nor with the Charter of Fundamental Rights is that it calls into question the protection of workers.
It was for that reason that we, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, struck out those very parts of the Services Directive by which the protection of workers was eroded.
If Europe is to be competitive, it needs a social dimension.
Competitiveness also demands that working conditions be fair and that workers should enjoy equal rights.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market, Mr McCreevy is bound to pursue a policy of worker protection and not just one that defends one partyâs interests.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Vaxholm conflict is a matter for the European Court of Justice.
Parliament is no court, but nor is the Commission or any individual Commissioners.
On 5Â October, you succeeded, Commissioner McCreevy, in using a couple of sentences to challenge the whole of the Swedish trade union movement, the Scandinavian model of labour law, the European trade union movement, Member States and citizens.
Does your statement reflect thoughts and ideas that really are discussed behind the Commissionâs closed doors?
In that case, it is good that we citizens, the Left and the trade union movement have now obtained proof that all the fine talk about social dialogue and the social dimension is just fancy words.
The Commission has shown which side it is on when it comes to working conditions etc. You need to know, however, that you have issued a challenge to the whole of the Left and of the trade union movement.
We in Sweden have the EUâs lowest share of working days lost to labour market disputes.
We are a country that welcomes workers and service companies from other countries, but we can never accept discrimination and situations in which workers are pitted against workers.
We refuse to accept discrimination in the labour market too.
Employeesâ rights are not for sale, not even in the EUâs internal market.
Employees are not commodities.
We are flesh and blood people, and we shall defend our rights.
We on the Left and in the trade union movement have embraced the struggle before, and we are fully prepared to do so again and to take up the fight for solidarity and justice.
Â Â  â Mr McCreevy, you did not need to say anything in Sweden.
In fact, I am surprised that your words about social models have caused such a stir.
Being Irish I have long known â but perhaps others have not â of your opposition to the so-called European social model.
You became Finance Minister just as Irelandâs Celtic Tiger was transforming the country from one of the EUâs poorest nations to its financial summit.
Despite our wealth, when you left office last year, we still had one of the lowest social spends in the EU.
You had more money at your disposal than anyone in Irish history, yet the Irish health system remained an under-funded disgrace, with long waiting lists for the simplest operations and patients crammed into hospital hallways every weekend.
Special needs children were regularly denied appropriate education and therapy, and you left public housing lists to grow and grow.
Your budgets denied rights and services to the most vulnerable in Irish society.
Therefore, the opposition you express to Swedenâs social model is not news to me.
However, here is my question: Mr McCreevy, what is the point of a society that does not serve its people?
What is the money we create for?
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised that the European Parliament is spending its time and that of the President of the Commission and CommissionerÂ McCreevy on political demagogy.
I am from Latvia, a country that long before its accession to the European Union considered all four basic freedoms of the European Union to be important and fulfilled them.
Many of those who have today expressed their indignation are political representatives of people who profiteered in my country and other new Member States, since it was possible to buy cheap property, cheap shares in businesses, because they could pay our workers 10 or more times less than theirs for the same work.
Social model advocates â where were you then?
I am convinced that only competition which is based on the four fundamental values of the European Union will enable the companies and workers of the new Member States to escape their permanent poverty, and competition will also be the only chance to preserve, to some extent, the high social standards of the so-called ârichâ European Union Member States.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, my fellow Member MrÂ Andersson from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament emphasised just a few minutes ago that Sweden did not introduce any transitional rules when the new Member States entered the European Union.
It was good that he said that, as what he was boasting about had in fact been a defeat for him. He and his party had taken the lead in combating freedom of movement and had wanted to introduce transitional rules.
They lost, however.
As a result, Sweden is the country that now has freedom of movement.
He and his party conducted a scare campaign about social tourism.
We know the outcome: last year, the social tourism about which MrÂ Andersson and other Social Democrats were scaring people cost Sweden EURÂ 18Â 000.
That is almost nothing, but we have acquired a host of people who have been able to contribute tax income and labour to our country.
We should be pleased that you lost, for Europe was the winner.
This is not about the Services Directive.
We are now seeing a scare campaign of the same kind as that we heard a year ago.
This is about neither the Services Directive nor Chinese wages.
Scaring people by saying that the freedom and opportunity to work in Europe will lead to Chinese wages is a downright piece of insolence directed against our new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe.
Nor is it about placing a question mark over Swedenâs collective agreements, for we are not concerned here with the country of origin principle at all.
What it is about is people from Europe with collective agreements being able to work in a country in which the laws and rules applicable in that country are also complied with.
This is the matter about which you are conducting an outright scare campaign, and one directed not only at the Services Directive but also, ultimately, at our new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe which have made the European Union richer.
I can state one thing, namely that we Swedish Conservatives will defend and safeguard our being able in Sweden to make decisions about our labour market and our rules, but we shall also defend openness.
To the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which uses the European Union to legislate on the Swedish labour market or working time directives and âsunshine directivesâ, I want to point out the following:. we will safeguard the Swedish labour market and Swedish freedom, but we will also safeguard the European Unionâs freedom.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have focused mainly on the political aspects of this whole issue.
If I may, I should therefore like to make a few comments from the point of view of a trade union member from a new Member State. I should like to start by using a phrase coined by MrÂ Chirac, the French President; CommissionerÂ McCreevy missed a good opportunity to keep quiet, and is therefore merely reaping what he sowed.
Do trade unions have a right to take action if they believe the interests of their members to be at risk?
They most certainly do.
Much uncertainty surrounds the case as a whole.
While on the one hand there has been talk of starvation wages of SEKÂ 35-45 per hour, on the other hand it has been reported that the Swedish minimum wage of SEKÂ 109 per hour was paid.
There have been claims that certain articles of the Treaty establishing the European Community have been violated, and criticism has also been levelled at the Swedish labour model.
Questions also need to be asked with regard to whether the Swedish labour inspectorate took any action.
All EU Member States are members of the International Labour Organisation, and have ratified treaties that grant far-reaching powers to trade unions.
Workers not only have the right to form trade unions and to negotiate collectively, but also to defend themselves if their jobs are at risk.
Sweden is one of only three countries to have allowed citizens of the new Member States to work within its territory almost immediately after the latter joined the European Union, without imposing any transitional measures.
The only demand the country makes is that its rules and customs be observed.
It is quite absurd to accuse Sweden of attempting to seal off its labour market, and it would be regrettable if the whole incident were interpreted as a Swedish attack on workers from the new Member States.
Czech trade union members have also always taken the view that foreigners working in the Czech Republic must receive the same wages and have the same status as Czech citizens, as well as being subject to the attendant obligations.
Unfortunately, we have not always managed to stand up in the face of blatant violations of Czech rules.
Whenever the Commission talks of the need to adopt a directive on services, it assures us that the Posting of Workers Directive, the provisions of which are intended to prevent social dumping, will continue to apply.
We should therefore ensure that the Posting of Workers Directive becomes more than just a piece of paper in our Member States.
In conclusion, I would note that sit-ins are one of the most effective weapons in the trade unionsâ arsenal.
I am quite sure that our Swedish counterparts only resorted to this weapon after much thought.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in my country we have spent more than 100 years developing an efficient labour market. Employees and employers enter into voluntary agreements on wages and working conditions.
The idea is that everyone is welcome to work on agreed conditions.
We have also developed a Nordic welfare model with social rights for all citizens, financed by high taxes.
It has given us a flexible labour market in which it is easy to fire, and still easier to hire, people.
Moreover, we are creating more jobs than we are losing through globalisation.
The Commission should therefore say: âWhat we have here is a recipe for social protection, giving us the necessary flexibility.
That is what we all need. Let us study this remarkable model.â
Instead, the Commission says: âLet us deem the Nordic social welfare model and agreement-based model to be unlawful.â
MrÂ Mc Creevy, I am not saying that you should adopt our model, but the Commission should understand and respect the fact that we have chosen that model, and we are never going to give it up.
Moreover, I would ask MrÂ Barosso to withdraw his support for the Latvian firm in the Vaxholm case.
Thank you, MrÂ President, even though I have nothing to say thank you for.
Â Â  â Mr President, what we have heard here this morning is, regrettably, vintage McCreevy.
Commissioner, you have to recognise that vintage McCreevy does not work at European level.
You have to build consensus here or you fail.
Commissioner, you have done it again: having given the Commission the âtwo fingersâ when you were an Irish minister, you have now outraged the Swedish population with a similar gesture towards their social partnership model as well as the European Parliament today.
You will not achieve market reform with those bulldozer tactics.
The Celtic Tiger, for which you claim credit in Ireland, has given us 150Â 000 children living in poverty in Ireland.
A man died last week because he could not have simple surgery in our hospital system.
Sweden spends EURÂ 200 per person as a proportion of GDP, compared to EURÂ 100 in Ireland, yet Sweden is the third most competitive economy in the world, compared to Irelandâs position at 26th.
We need a high-quality European social model which uses social infrastructure as a building block for a prosperous and fair society.
Setting Latvian workers against Swedish workers will destroy the Union, Commissioner.
That is the nub of the debate on the deeply flawed Services Directive.
Take note or fail.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I believe that we have already set out very clearly our position.
Nevertheless, I should like to respond more precisely to the questions posed, in particular by MrÂ Schulz, who cited questions by MrÂ Rasmussen.
On the first question, concerning trade unions.
Do they have the right to strike?
Of course, it is a fundamental right and a fundamental freedom, in accordance with our European principles.
We entirely respect the right to strike of all trade unions in Europe.
On the second question: is the internal market compatible with the Scandinavian social model?
There is no doubt about it.
On the third question: if that is the case, what will the Commissionâs response be?
First and foremost, we need to know what the Court of Justice requires from us.
Until I have been consulted by the Court, I am unable to tell you what our position will be, legally speaking.
On the other hand, I am able to tell you what our position will not be and what it will be in essence.
We will never attack the Scandinavian or Swedish social model, but we will fight tooth and nail for the Treaties, because the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
We must strictly abide by the Treaties.
We will therefore be issuing a response that is compatible with the Treaties and with the .
I believe that the core issue, MrÂ President, MrÂ McCreevy, is preventing the dichotomy between the internal market and social rights.
In the debate, this at times seems to be a contradiction in terms: those who are in favour of the internal market, on the one hand, and those who are in favour of a social Europe, on the other.
I will say to you frankly that the role of the Commission is to try to combine these two principles.
The key to the growth that we require in order to strengthen our social ambitions is an internal market that is truly active and operational.
We are therefore issuing a communication for consultation by this weekâs Informal Summit, and I am delighted that it has been positively received by all of the political forces.
We are proposing, for example, to create a Globalisation Adjustment Fund by attempting to bring together two elements: an open internal market free from artificial protectionism in our Community, on the one hand, and a stronger social ambition, on the other.
In this respect, I should like it if certain parties, which are in favour in this House of a more social Europe, gave their support within their governments to a European budget drawing greater inspiration from these very values.
We are not going to resolve the problem currently facing an enlarged Europe through the use of artificial barriers between our countries. Rather, we will do so by harmonising upwards, which means using a more active economic and social cohesion policy that promotes the development of all of the regions of our Union.
In fact, there are 25 of us now.
We have to carry out a more ambitious policy, aimed at social redistribution at EU level but, in doing so, we must avoid raising artificial barriers between our countries.
That is the issue at stake.
I can assure you that the European Commission will continue to work along these lines in order to see an internal market put in place, of course, but also in order to see economic and social cohesion occur in a Europe in which we want not only more prosperity, but also more fairness.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the strategy against an influenza pandemic (O-0089/2005 â B6-0334/2005).
Â Â  . â Mr President, the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have issued extremely serious warnings, based on scientific data, of a possible influenza pandemic in the future.
We are therefore debating a topical issue which relates directly to public health and, of course, from our debate today, in the presence of the Commissioner, I expect us to draw conclusions and commit to action.
The possible source of the pandemic â I shall be brief on this because everyone knows this â is the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 which, following recombination with the human seasonal influenza virus, may produce a highly aggressive influenza which is not covered by existing vaccines, which is precisely why there is the risk of a pandemic.
I should like to say here that the Commissioner has already told us that he has initiated certain discussions and plans for us to produce the new vaccine needed and to produce it as quickly as possible, not in the usual six to eight months required, but much earlier.
Consequently, as the influenza virus â this pandemic â could spread from one continent to another within a few days, it is obvious that, in order to combat this pandemic, a series of measures, vaccines and medicinal products are needed; in other words, a proper master plan.
How many of these does the European Union have today?
The Commissioner is here to tell us exactly what provisions have been made to date for these plans against a possible pandemic.
Of course, it is a question which we also need to answer in relation to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.
These plans must seek to:
- secure the necessary coordination between the Member States, and this will be done by the European Commission;
- avoid panic among the general public;
- combat any speculation, if larger quantities of vaccines and medicinal products are required;
- determine the areas in which movements have to be restricted somewhat, because of course the virus travels with people;
- ensure fair and universal distribution of anti-epidemic products;
- identify the population groups to be vaccinated as a priority; here, for example, I would say that we should have started vaccinating with the seasonal influenza virus people working with poultry, in order to minimise the possibility of one person carrying both viruses at the same time, which would be exceptionally dangerous, and consequently to reduce the risk of a pandemic.
Consequently, we need to strengthen the Union's ability to react to an influenza virus, including with a network of laboratories, mechanisms and public health resources.
The key element in efficient preparedness is the timely development and quantitatively adequate production of vaccines and antivirals.
For example, the World Health Organisation says that we should have stocks of about 25% of the quantity of these medicinal products.
Do we have 25%?
I greatly fear that we are below this threshold and will suddenly find that we need to produce huge quantities.
I hope, and the Commissioner has already told us at another meeting, that he has been holding talks so that we can bridge this gap somewhat.
In addition, we may need â as I believe the Council has also said â some sort of solidarity fund, so that we can cover urgent requirements.
All this has to be done.
Another question â which you can answer, Commissioner â is how efficiently the early warning and response system of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is operating and if it is connected to other Community warning systems relating to the health of animals, food, feedingstuffs and civil protection.
The Commission must basically strengthen its coordinating role and we are here, Commissioner, to give you effective support in that role.
You must be ruthless with the Member States which do not submit plans or which have submitted unsatisfactory plans.
We must help them, of course, but you must be exceptionally strict with them because, as we have said, the pandemic is something we need to avoid or, at least if it happens, to deal with correctly.
We need a comprehensive communication strategy.
It is very important for there to be no panic and for there to be a constant exchange of information with neighbouring countries, inspections and random sampling of animals and, finally, we need to regulate everything needed in relation to restricting the mobility of citizens, especially in countries in which this influenza may emerge.
Consequently, Commissioner, we shall wait for you to tell us what you have done so far, and we know that you have done a great deal, and what needs to be done in the future.
We shall support you in this procedure so that we can have a comprehensive and effective plan so that, if â God forbid â this pandemic happens, we deal with it correctly, without panic and with good results for the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Members for today's debate, both for the question and for the motion for a resolution.
It is indeed very, very important and I welcome it, because I see that we and Parliament are on the same wavelength, we have the same priorities and, of course, the same concerns.
As time is limited, I should like today to cover the most basic issues referred to in the motion for a resolution and the question and to add that I shall send Mr Florenz, the chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Health, a detailed memorandum on the various issues raised today, so that the House also has some of the technical details at its disposal.
First â and I feel obliged to do this after everything I have heard recently â I should like to clarify the difference between avian influenza, which is the veterinary issue concerning birds and animals, and the possible influenza pandemic, which is a possibility which has been identified by the World Health Organisation, as Mr Trakatellis said, and for which we need to make intensive preparations, because we do not know exactly when it will strike.
The presence of avian influenza in Europe â and I shall emphasise this so that European citizens hear it too â does not affect the probability of a possible pandemic.
That is why there is no need for panic, but there is need for concern, so that we make the necessary preparations.
I also wish to emphasise that the European Union and the Member States have the best and the highest levels of preparedness in the world.
Of course this does not mean that, because we compare favourably with other countries or other areas on the planet, we can feel satisfied or that we have reached the point of preparedness needed in order for our citizens to feel safe.
There is still plenty of room for improvement and further preparation, even though I acknowledge that, since we last debated this subject in the relevant committee, progress has been made on the part of the Member States and I need to emphasise that.
Of course, there are different levels of preparedness between the Member States and what is important for us is not to grade or categorise the Member States, but to put pressure on them â and my thanks to Parliament for precisely this support for me â so that all the Member States have a satisfactory level of preparedness.
Today I am in the welcome position of being able to tell you that we have in our possession all 25 national preparedness plans from all the Member States, which was not the case when we held the debate in committee.
Of course, I must accept that some of these are still in the form of preliminary drafts, but that does not matter; they exist and they are being examined today, in Copenhagen, with the European Disease Prevention and Control Centre and the World Health Organisation.
At the same time, we are in the process of revising our Community preparedness plan, which was adopted in March 2004 and will also take account of the national plans and the preparedness exercise which we shall carry out in a few weeks, when we shall test these plans to see how effective and efficient they are and to examine how they mesh with each other and with the relevant Community plan.
As far as the question of drugs â the question of antivirals â is concerned, they are not a panacea and do not resolve all the problems; they are the first defensive weapon which we have at our disposal.
We have today at least 20 Member States that have ordered or started stocking the relevant drug and, according to my information, the remaining Member States are also moving in this direction.
Without doubt, there are problems because the industry cannot respond at the moment to the orders which have been placed.
I shall be in contact shortly â now that I have a full picture of the situation in the Member States â and shall be holding new meetings with the industry, so that we can examine how they intend to resolve the production and supply problem.
During the informal Council in England two days ago, the idea was also mooted of a Community stock of antivirals.
Of course, on the basis of the Treaty, we do not have the competence for that, but if we are instructed by the Council, we are willing to discuss it so that â just as the World Health Organisation has stocks in the event of crisis or emergency â there is something similar at Community level.
However, it is important that we advise citizens that these drugs are not preventive, that they are not vaccines and that they have to be taken on prescription and that individual citizens cannot treat themselves.
As far as the pandemic vaccine is concerned, and this is my last point, we need first of all to distinguish â as Mr Trakatellis quite rightly did â between the seasonal influenza vaccine and the pandemic vaccine, which does not yet exist.
We are encouraging the Member States to increase seasonal influenza inoculation among high-risk groups, and we shall most probably examine this issue with the experts as regards workers on farms and in danger areas, but not â I repeat â for the whole of Europe.
The Member States must define the high-risk groups, so that inoculation against seasonal influenza can be increased â I repeat â among the high-risk groups only.
This will help in the way which Mr Trakatellis indicated earlier and it will also help cooperation with industry, by giving financial incentive â that is how the system works â to increase production and meet requirements in the event of a pandemic.
Of course, the vaccine also needs to be created in the event of a pandemic once the virus appears; this is not possible now.
However, as Mr Trakatellis rightly said, this takes six to eight months and certainly no less than six.
We are working together with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and the industry and making all the relevant preparations and we are confident that all this will cut the time needed by three months, which is a fairly considerable timesaving.
I wish we could achieve more, but this will cut the time needed from when the virus is recognised by the World Health Organisation to when it will be possible to produce the corresponding vaccine by about half.
Four companies have already expressed an interest in commencing cooperation with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and I am confident that others will follow.
However, what is important â and I shall discuss this when I meet them â is the finding that: firstly, shortages are starting to emerge even for seasonal influenza vaccines, and I want them to tell me how they intend to resolve this problem and, secondly, that in research for the production of the vaccine, we want the companies to coordinate with each other so that they do not do the same work, so that there is no overlap, so that they move in different directions at the same time and we can cover all eventualities.
I shall therefore be meeting with the industry and I shall, of course, update the House accordingly, as soon as I have some results.
I shall close here.
Thank you for your attention; I shall, of course, listen to the debate with a great deal of interest and I am always ready to update Parliament fully because, as you know, you are the strongest allies I have in this endeavour.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the theme of this debate is, I believe, that we want a sense of urgency, not a sense of panic.
That applies to the Commission and to Member States.
I was pleased to hear that we have had a simulation exercise.
As I understand it, one of the problems found was the overload of information.
I would be interested to hear how that is being managed.
What we really need for the public, who are beginning to panic, is clarity.
They need to be informed and reassured.
They need to understand the difference between winter flu â which is not what this debate is about â and avian flu â which is not what this debate is about, even though 67 people have died from it, all working or living with birds and poultry in Asia.
It is the combination of those factors which could lead to a pandemic flu, because it mutates from human to human.
It has not happened yet, but our resolution must be to âprepare, prepare, prepareâ!
The key is clearly vaccines, and it is the new vaccines we will need, once we know the strain.
We need capacity and speed.
Last week we heard from the WHO that world capacity for producing vaccines is only 300 million doses a year.
My own country â the United Kingdom â is going to place an order for 120 million doses.
If it does, then where are the vaccines for everyone else?
It is not possible without a dramatic expansion of production capacity.
As for speed, six to eight months under the egg-based vaccines is not good enough.
We need to look at the cell-based vaccines of one month and even the possibility of DNA vaccines, which could be as low as one month, but still need a lot of development.
We need that central supply to which the Commissioner referred, because it must be said that no Member State is going to give up its own supplies when the pandemic hits a less-prepared country inside or just outside the European Union.
I believe we need central supplies under the Solidarity Fund which he and the ECDC can then direct swiftly to where they are needed, so that we can smother the outbreak and prevent it hitting the rest of us even more seriously.
Lastly, we need that information from all Member States in complete form â the stocks, antivirals, vaccines, masks, the health checks at ports and the quarantine facilities â in order to know that we are genuinely prepared against this threat throughout the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I agree that Commissioner Kyprianou commendably treads the narrow line between effective prevention and pressing the panic button.
Our populations need to know that influenza always has been a global disease, and nowadays, of course, there are additional means by which it can be spread.
They need to know that the HN51 virus has been present in some states now for several years. We need to know that the pace of spread has not actually accelerated in the way that the wilder speculation about pandemics would lead us to believe.
Could the Commissioner tell us, firstly, what we now know about the incubation period in the bird population, and whether there is any sign that the virus has spread to other species?
It is not yet obviously affecting humankind.
What will the lead time for an effective monovalent vaccine stockpile be?
The industry has communicated to us that it may take four years to produce an effective stockpile of everything we need to deal with the virus if it mutates in the way that is predicted.
In his statement of 12Â October 2005, the Commissioner did not mention the importation and trafficking of wild birds.
We have seen in the recent case in the United Kingdom that the enormous number of birds now imported into the European Union â some legally, some illegally â is a potent source of further infection.
We have seen that.
What can we do throughout all the Member States to have an effective control on these imports and, indeed, their ban?
Â Â  . â Mr President, according to the Commissionâs latest action plan on health and consumer protection, the EU must protect the public from risks and threats which are beyond the control of individuals and cannot be effectively and completely tackled by Member States on their own.
We have been warned that the world is facing the real threat of a dangerous influenza pandemic.
Effective preparedness planning includes the stockpiling of appropriate antivirals, as well as implementation by Member States of the existing WHO vaccination recommendations during seasonal flu, in order to protect the public and at the same time increase the vaccine production capacity of the European vaccine industry.
Additional investment is needed for the development of prototype influenza pandemic vaccines, as a key intermediate step towards establishing a manufacturing process and the characteristics of future pandemic vaccines.
Last week, the EU Health Ministers recognised that no country can solve these problems alone.
Bearing in mind that the Member States have very different financial resources for stockpiling vaccines and antivirals, as well as for the national advance purchase commitment to establish national pandemic vaccine needs, we have to suggest an early mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund as a precautionary instrument, allowing for pre-emptive action to be taken in preparing for an influenza pandemic.
It is our belief that the Solidarity Fund envelope must be used now for the Communityâs centralised activities, including the strengthening of the European Centre for Disease Control, as well as for Member States that apply.
The stakes are high and time might be short.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at present avian flu is an animal disease which is not easily transmitted to humans.
The major potential danger lies in the fact that the killer virus may mutate into a pandemic virus that spreads from person to person.
This risk can be lessened by controlling the bird epidemic and reducing the chances of the virus spreading from birds to humans.
EU-internal solidarity and the help we give to our neighbouring countries, and to those countries in Asia where the avian disease has become an epidemic, will have an important role to play here.
The EU and its Member States constitute the worldâs largest supplier of developmental aid.
Now it is important that we help the poorer countries take action to conquer the epidemic among poultry, and it is also important that people in direct contact with birds are vaccinated against normal human flu, so that the bird virus does not get a chance to form hybrids with the human virus.
We must help the poorer countries do this.
We have to guarantee that the necessary drugs and vaccines will be where they are needed first, in order to control any pandemic.
Through solidarity, we can help both ourselves and others.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a doctor I consider that prevention is the key element of the strategy.
Preventive measures, therefore, such as frequent periodic inspections of migratory birds and of poultry farms are of vital importance in this instance and I welcome all the efforts made to date to detect cases immediately in different countries.
Another point which I also consider important is proper information for the general public, especially poultry farmers, and measures to prevent panic, which we have already caused, without there being sufficient indication, Commissioner, with the result that we keep telling people to get inoculated with a vaccine which we know in advance has nothing to do with the new virus which will emerge.
The only thing we shall achieve by inoculating the populace in general and not the high-risk groups such as poultry farmers will be to reduce the levels of common influenza which strikes Europe every year.
Antivirals are also important, although I doubt if they could combat a new virus.
That is why, Commissioner, I think that there should be cooperation and solidarity between countries, given that this sort of epidemic has no frontiers.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, first we need to ask ourselves if there is a pandemic.
There is no pandemic.
Is there an epidemic?
Perhaps there is no epidemic either.
We have 60 recorded deaths; in other words, as many as from road traffic accidents throughout the world in ten minutes.
Has the virus attacked man?
Yes it has.
There was the case in Thailand two months ago where the poultry farmer died, while his son fell ill but survived.
Is there a vaccine?
If we accept what was said by the Hungarian Ministry for Health, Mr JenÃ¶ RÃ¡cz, yes the vaccine exists and he personally has been inoculated.
So if, according to an institutional agent, the Minister for Health of a European country, the vaccine exists, then why do we not take the vaccine and distribute it to the entire world?
Many industrialists earned a great deal of money from each drug, but the poultry farms lost.
So what are we doing for these poultry farmers who have lost so much money?
My country is killing 25 million chickens.
So will we give them all an allowance?
Tomorrow we debate the budget.
Is there a heading for this sort of pandemic?
We need to look at things from the other side as well, Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in managing the risk of a pandemic, we need to monitor the current situation, coordinate the response and, above all, avoid creating panic, while ensuring that antiviral drugs are distributed widely and fairly.
That is why we have proposed some amendments designed to promote monitoring, using all resources available.
The European Union must have an active role in managing the possible risk of the H5N1 virus spreading among animals.
We therefore need to act in advance with preventive measures.
We also need to give priority to reassuring consumers and thereby avoiding a pointless panic, which would be harmful both to the population itself and to the poultry industry.
Our proposal to introduce the compulsory labelling of white meat, as already applies in the case of beef, aims at achieving precisely that objective.
We also consider that a timely campaign of information would be useful, advising consumers of the true risks, the possibility of prevention and the availability of drugs.
Finally, we need to ensure there is a strategy to enable all Member States to produce antiviral drugs in sufficient quantities, with the direct involvement of pharmaceutical companies, and to devote our available resources also to that end.
Â Â  â It has been repeatedly stated here that the question concerning the next flu pandemic is not âifâ, but âwhenâ.
Although we all know that the risk of flu pandemics is and will continue to be present, I have the impression that, in spite of the timely warning, the European Union as a whole is not as well prepared as it should be.
We have heard that the 25 Member States have their national action plans and programmes.
However, the European Union needs a common plan, and I feel that we have erred in not having prepared such a plan.
I would like a clear answer as to who will be in charge of coordination.
Will it be the WHO, the ECDC or the European Commission?
Every day, the media bring information about new cases and about the countries where new discoveries of dead or infected birds have been made.
