Congratulations to everyone.
I would like to remind you that during the presentation of the draft general budget 2008, the European Commission allocated the biggest share of expenditure to investments in the development of economic growth.
This is an unprecedented case in European financial history, when finances allocated to the development of economic competitiveness constitute the biggest share of the budget.
This is a new, historic quality of the EU budget and it reflects the EU's political priorities - competitiveness, economic growth, cohesion and social harmony.
A significant element in negotiations on the 2008 budget was the need to make a decision on two innovative trans-European projects - the GALILEO project and the development of the European Institute of Technology.
The budget negotiations have been really complicated.
However, the constructive position taken by both the European Parliament and the Commission have enabled positive results to be achieved.
I would like to thank the European Parliament and especially the budget rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, for having considered the Commission's explanations regarding certain reserves.
At first reading these reserves for appropriations were lifted.
However, I would like to point out that there still are several outstanding problems that the Commission has drawn Parliament's attention to.
However, there are still some reserves that will make budget implementation more difficult and complex, and I hope that they can be lifted as early as possible.
Two reserves are a specific source of our concerns, and I would like to draw the attention of the plenary to them.
One reserve reduces by EUR 17 million the preparation for staff salaries at headquarters in the policy area of external actions, and that would force the Commission to leave posts vacant and to block recruitment from the beginning of January.
This means, in fact, that there would be EUR 22 million in the combined reserve on staff salaries, and I really hope that Parliament will be able to reconsider its position on this in the plenary session.
As regards the general reserve for EUR 5 million on staff salaries, the Commission is firmly committed to delivering the required study on the ABM implementation and the reports requested by Parliament on the follow-up or the screening exercise and on the implementation of Article 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
However, regarding the requested action plan on the reorganisation of the coordination and support activities, I want to be very clear on behalf of the Commission.
The European Parliament will be fully informed of all different steps in the follow-up to the screening exercise.
On this we can give you the Commission's commitment.
However, I also want to stress that the Commission cannot launch a major reorganisation exercise during the last year of this Commission and, therefore, there will be no action plan in this regard.
Major organisation can only be decided by the next Commission.
The Commission is committed to implementing progressively the results of the ongoing assessment of the number of activities identified in the screening.
We are moving on a step-by-step approach.
We have started working on the communication activities, the delegation network, the balance and the category structure of the Commission's establishment plan.
This we promised, and we will deliver.
We hope that Parliament will take into account our commitments and our capabilities to deliver in this matter and, during the vote on Thursday, will reconsider its proposals.
Member of Commission. - (LT) I would like to finish by thanking the European Parliament, especially the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr BÃ¶ge, and the budget rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, as well as the Council, especially Mr Santos, for their very efficient cooperation and their constructive role.
I do hope that today's discussions will prove useful and fruitful and that they will contribute to the results of the vote on the European Union's budget for 2008.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, this 2008 budget is a good result and for that I must compliment my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets, especially our chairman, Mr BÃ¶ge, and our two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr ItÃ€lÃ€, who I think have done an extremely good job.
Like the Commissioner, I believe that this budget reflects more adequately the changing priorities of the Union today and it is more appropriate to the challenges which we face.
I welcome the fact that it represents 0.96% GNI and I am also happy to see that the funding for Frontex is much more appropriate to the challenge that this organisation faces.
There are, however, two areas of concern.
My first area is Galileo and, while it is not for me to comment on the technical merit of this project, I can and I certainly must comment on the financial disciplines which I see imposed.
It was of concern to me that the private sector appeared to show a very low appetite for investment in this project.
It would appear to me that there is little or no provision for cost and time overruns with the project, which are almost inevitable, and it does concern me that the vision for the business model after the development phase leaves a great deal to be desired.
The second point which I want to mention is that this budget falls under the shadow of the Court of Auditors' report.
I have to say that, after 13 failures, this is something which must be taken very seriously.
It is something which is extremely damaging to the public perception of the European Union.
Two points are absolutely clear.
I make my points here to the Presidency, the Member States and the Commission.
They must give greater urgency to achieving a positive DAS because - I repeat my words - it is very, very damaging to the perception of the Union.
Secondly, and on that point, I believe it is time for Parliament to be more assertive in ensuring that the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement are met.
on behalf of the PSE group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, the EU's general budget reflects the serious tendencies of economies marked by current financial prospects.
There will be EUR 120 billion in payment appropriations, accounting for 0.96% of the Member States' total GNI.
All this is quite modest, and a far cry from the actual needs of the political project announced by the European decision-makers in the Council, in the Commission and also here in Parliament.
We have often cited the causes of this in the House: national egoisms rocking the common boat, excessive caution by the Commission when implementing our budgetary guidelines, or the EU's general inability to come up with innovative, realistic projects.
This year, once again, led by our excellent rapporteurs - including Mr Virrankoski - we had to find solutions to develop policies that we feel are essential and new pilot projects that our fellow citizens expect.
This year, once again, we have witnessed the slender financial framework for the EU's international action, which does not make it any easier for us when taking up our commitments concerning Palestine and Kosovo.
This year, however, one project managed to overcome such rigidness: Galileo.
I would especially like to thank Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ, Mr Romero, Chairman BÃ¶ge and Mr Virrankoski, and all the members of the Committee on Budgets, both Members and administrators, whose firm conviction and negotiating strategy were rewarded by a financing agreement with the Council.
I feel like saying: 'Luckily the Commission and Parliament were there', but I cannot neglect the role played by the Portuguese Presidency and Mr Santos, who got things moving with his know-how and his ability to listen.
We should remember that after the negotiations it is Europe as a whole that has secured the financing of Galileo entirely through Community funds.
With the European Technology Institute, the package totals EUR 2.7 billion, without jeopardising any EU policies.
This example of a joint political demand is a rare item in the EP's budgetary history.
The Socialists interpret this as a sign of hope not only for the autonomy of the EU's satellite navigation as of 2013, but also as an indication of Parliament's ability to make use of its powers and fulfil its responsibilities in the preparation of the EU's budgetary future.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I would also like to highlight the excellent negotiation result that we can celebrate in connection with the adoption of the 2008 budget on Thursday.
I congratulate my colleague Mr Virrankoski as rapporteur on the Commission's budget.
He has succeeded in doing what many had thought impossible, namely to strike a compromise involving the revision of the multi-annual budget framework and the financial perspective, without us having to involve the Heads of State or Government or have a large-scale negotiation drama in late December.
The results of the negotiations that we have before us provide the billions necessary for financing the Galileo satellite navigation system without us having to reduce funding for other essential programmes.
It is available agricultural money, it is money from the flexibility instrument, and it is money that would not otherwise have been used that will now be spent to ensure that the EU can go ahead with the important investment in Galileo.
It will place basic infrastructure and important skills at the EU's full disposal.
Extra money has also been found for Palestine and Kosovo through use of the flexibility instrument.
Overall, we have arrived at a historically good solution here.
We need a more flexible EU budget, where each year we can secure funding for essential needs.
This does not necessarily mean a more expensive budget, but a more rigid implementation of the rules and a focus on relevant problems.
Many people have contributed to the excellent solution.
Mrs Grybauskaithas guided us both prudently and with authority.
Parliament has stood united and ensured that there was support for the wishes of the Commission.
I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr BÃ¶ge, for his strong and capable leadership, and also the coordinators of the other groups for their excellent cooperation.
Thanks are also due to Mr ItÃ€lÃ€ for his sound efforts and to the Portuguese Presidency for the work done towards achieving an excellent result.
This has been a victory both for the EU and for common sense.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are today discussing the draft 2008 European Union budget for the last time.
It appears to correspond to our expectations, though the most heated debate has centred on its size, as is usually the case.
Nonetheless, we have to operate within the agreed framework and adjust individual positions to it.
We endeavoured to take account of all the amendments, but sometimes this proved impossible, as they were mutually exclusive.
I am especially pleased that discharging Europe's responsibilities as a global partner we tried to increase resources for action of this nature as much as possible.
On the basis of today's address by Mr Salih Mahmoud Osman, the Sakharov Prize laureate, the world is most certainly counting on the European Union.
In this connection I should like to say that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on whose behalf I am speaking, will vote in favour of the draft budget tabled.
I should like to thank all colleagues very much for our achievement.
Everyone has commended it.
Thank you again.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the Verts/ALE Group too, the crucial question is whether the European budget is truly geared to future needs and responds to the formidable challenges of the coming years, particularly as regards our responsibility in the field of foreign policy but also in relation to research and development, education and, of course, the struggle against climate change.
We do not believe that the budget as a whole is good enough yet to rise to these major challenges.
Nevertheless, we find it gratifying that the decision in favour of Galileo has now been taken.
That represents something like a bridgehead from which we can go on to change the budget and fit it more adequately for the future, and it is also a historic step for the European Union to put on track such an ambitious project in the realm of industrial policy.
I believe it is very important, particularly in the light of the Lisbon agenda, that Europe should not leave these new technological developments, this navigation system, to the United States or China but that our aim should be to play our own self-assured role in the world and in the global marketplace.
For this reason, I believe we must do even more in the coming years to engineer these changes and to find appropriate answers to global issues.
I am also delighted that we have managed to reallocate resources from the Euratom programme to fund Galileo.
In my opinion, spending existing money on better and less environmentally harmful technology is another step forward.
I would like to add my thanks to my fellow committee members, to Mr BÃ¶ge and to the two rapporteurs for their hard work on this budget.
I certainly believe it is a step in the right direction.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, tomorrow we shall adopt the EU's budget for next year, one in which payments clearly fall below the 1% ceiling, to say nothing of the fact that it will be 1.24% of GNI.
In that respect the outcome is satisfactory to those in our group who want to save their own countries' taxpayers' money.
On the other hand, there are many in our group who would have liked the Commission's budget to follow the policy that Parliament adopts in the way it uses its resources, which smacks of poorer budgetary discipline.
It is always trying to find new areas for expenditure, although there may be no good use for the money.
In our group there are also two attitudes to the Galileo project.
Some want to see it financed out of the EU's budget; others entirely reject Galileo on account of its huge cost.
It is feared that it will be poor value for what is public money.
As the private companies have pulled out, Galileo's future now depends on financing by the EU.
Our group takes a dim view of the militarisation of the Galileo project, which was originally meant exclusively for civil use.
We also take a dim view of the additional financing out of the EU's budget for the Union's foreign, security and defence policy.
We adhere to the notion that the EU is a peace organisation and that it should not be militarised and become a superpower's agent.
For that is what it will be if the Council wants to put more money into financing the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
We do not want to be involved in the use of EU budget funds to prop up the political heritage of old transitional states in Africa or the illegal actions of the United States of America, which has acted as a torturer in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In view of all this, our group will vote, in a spirit of amicability, against Mr Virrankoski's budget report.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, I would like to thank and pay tribute to the rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr ItÃ€lÃ€.
They have done a very competent and responsible job and, in so doing, have also been able to keep the budget down at a lower level than I had thought possible at the outset.
But they were, of course, obliged to work within the limits imposed on them and I would point out that these limits are unreasonable.
Firstly, the revenue side is essentially a predetermined amount.
About 1% of gross national income goes to the EU.
But that is not how it should happen in a rational system.
The right approach is first to decide what the EU has to do, then see how much it will cost, and finally collect the money for it.
What should not be done is first to collect money and then wonder what it can be spent on.
That is quite the wrong way to proceed, and everyone knows it.
So let us change it!
Secondly, we know that at least 75% of the money spent by the EU is devoted to completely useless and harmful causes.
Hence we have a huge amount of money to spend on useful projects.
Roughly half is still spent in practice on the agricultural policy and a further quarter to a third on something called 'the structural funds on the structural side'.
In fact the EU should not be doing any of this.
What the EU should be doing is to develop and monitor regulatory systems for the internal market and for environmental cooperation. This costs amazingly little.
If we switch to this for the future, we shall be able to reduce the EU contribution and still have money left for other things that the EU should be doing.
In my opinion, these include Galileo, which is now to be financed.
That is a success.
We should invest heavily in basic research, since that would enable us to develop fusion energy.
This is the proper task of the EU.
Not agents to combat forest fires, structural adjustment to globalisation and other schemes which are pure propaganda spending.
(SK) Mr President, Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, many of the common policies which receive financial support from the EU budget are not good.
They neither foster the effective development of the European Union's production structures nor do they increase their competitiveness.
The agriculture sector, which receives almost 40% of the EU budget, is typical in this regard.
In the context of the overall developments, the EU's common agricultural policy appears very inflexible and rigid.
It has been deformed in the course of its history by various compromises based on gradual concessions, predominantly to large Member States.
Up to now, with all the reforms we have more or less preserved the inefficient redistribution of resources.
We still have a situation whereby 80% of European resources are being used by 20% of companies, concentrated in the old Member States.
This creates unequal conditions for the new Member States and discriminates against them.
It clearly runs contrary to the basic rules of the market to create the national envelopes on the basis of the so-called historic principle, as is being considered in connection with the wine sector reform.
The EU common agricultural policy must guarantee that its tools have equivalent effect and that there is equal access to the EU budget as well as the national budgets of the Member States.
They say that budgets reflect or mirror the intended economic policies.
I am afraid that through no fault of its own, the part of the European budget dealing with agriculture unfortunately offers a distorting mirror.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, this is a fine draft budget, and we all ought to congratulate ourselves on it.
Enough, however, has been said as to the content of the draft document.
I wish to state how pleased I am with two aspects: implementation of the budget and the successful conciliation procedure.
To start with implementation of the budget, I think this year we have managed to add value to the money spent from the budget, we have fulfilled our commitments more successfully and we have had good cooperation and sound exchanges of information with the European Commission.
I think we can safely say for most areas of the budget that implementation has been satisfactory in 2007, and among other things this means that we can have lower reserves vis-Ã -vis the Commission than in previous years.
This in turn entails a much smoother procedure, even in the knowledge that we are in one of the initial years of financial programming, of the new financial perspective period: this means that that implementation of the Structural Funds will be a little low, but I feel sure that it will pick up pace.
With respect to conciliation, the basis of this fine agreement, I wish once more to congratulate the European Commission on all the assistance from the Commissioner, the EP delegation and of course the Portuguese Presidency, which operated in such cohesive fashion.
They have operated as a genuine team and its members even come here wearing the same ties, meaning they really do operate as a team: it is certainly thanks to them that we have been able to finance technological development and protect taxpayers through non-excessive use of payment appropriations.
We should not change this formula in the years to come, and for future budgetary conciliations we must always bear in mind that this House represents citizens and that their will is expressed through the political groups.
Nor should we forget that the budget is a political act in itself.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the budgetary procedure for 2008 has shown how far the European Parliament can progress in negotiations with the Council if we are determined to implement our ideas for a European policy.
From the outset we have said that, following the demise of the public-private partnership idea, Galileo would have to be financed with European funds on the basis of the Community method.
Anything else would have been unacceptable to Parliament.
Parliament stood its ground on that point and then pressurised the Council - or, let us be honest, forced the Council - to break new ground in voting by a majority - not unanimously, mind you - to approve the compromise with us, which includes what is termed a small revision.
I say that here as a German who is grateful to the Portuguese Presidency.
As a result, we shall be able to fund Galileo and the European Institute of Technology properly until 2013.
While this makes me proud of our Parliament, I am not forgetting, of course, the extremely helpful role that the Commission has played in this budgetary process.
My sincere thanks go to you, Commissioner, and to all the staff of your departments.
You unquestionably helped to ensure that the Council was put on the right path, not only in relation to our competition and innovation policies but also with regard to the arrangements on foreign policies.
Our compromise will also provide us with enough funds for the time being to honour our European commitments in Kosovo and Palestine.
It goes without saying that Parliament has had to pay a price for this progress.
In 2008 an appropriation of EUR 285 million will be made to the common foreign and security policy.
While this is EUR 125 million more than the 2007 allocation, we are all well aware that heading 4 will remain chronically underfunded until the end of the period covered by the financial perspective.
However delighted we in Parliament might initially be at this shift in the Council's position, we must also strongly emphasise that the Council has not only remained focused on its main aim of paying out as little as possible but has actually achieved that aim.
Total planned expenditure amounts to EUR 120.3 billion, which represents only 0.96% of the combined gross national income of the Member States, whereas the financial perspective provides for 1.04%.
In 2008, then, we shall have a tight-fitting budget, although we should have preferred something more comfortable.
All the more reason for a concerted effort on our part to ensure that the Commission implements the multiannual programmes swiftly and correctly, that it acts on our comments on specific budget lines in ways that match our intentions, that its initial response to our proposals for pilot projects and preparatory measures is to seek ways of implementing them, not to describe all the obstacles to their realisation.
I call on all Members, including those who serve on specialised committees, to monitor the implementation of the 2008 budget systematically and critically.
Let me conclude by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, all my fellow Members and the secretariat for their wholehearted constructive cooperation in 2007.
I hope for the same parliamentary solidarity in 2008 whenever I have the task of drafting a report.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I would like to compliment and congratulate our rapporteurs and the general rapporteur, our friend KyÃ¶sti Virrankoski, and the entire EP delegation, expertly led by Mr BÃ¶ge.
I also congratulate the Commission and, more unusually, the Council Presidency, which dared to take up its responsibilities.
Minister, if there were a European lÃ©gion d'honneur, I feel you would richly deserve it.
The main concern I and many of my colleagues had in relation to the 2008 budget was ensuring full Community financing for the launch of the Galileo project, and consequently the European Technology Institute, without jeopardising the funding for programmes aimed at implementing the Lisbon Strategy.
The result has been achieved: this is good news for Europe as a whole, and also good news we can explain easily and simply to our fellow citizens, who understand its scope.
If I can put on my LIBE Chairman's cap for a moment, I wish to express my satisfaction that the Commission on Budgets supported the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs concerning the elimination of the reserves in connection with SIS II and Frontex.
These are two essential instruments for the surveillance of the EU's external borders, and we must increase their operational capability.
On the other hand, I request that we leave in reserve all appropriations relating to the European Return Fund until Parliament and the Council have adopted the proposal for a directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals.
(PL) Mr President, it is hard to be optimistic regarding the 2008 budget, because it is the lowest for many years in relation to the gross national income of the Member States, in terms of both commitment appropriations and payment appropriations.
I should like to remind the House that in the financial perspective 2007-2013 the ceiling for commitment appropriations for 2008 was set at 1.08% of gross national income. It was set at 1.06% of gross national income for payment appropriations.
There is therefore a significant difference between what the European Union was prepared to finance only two years ago, and what it is now prepared to finance.
We cannot have more Europe for such limited funding in any of the areas to which the European Union allocates financial resources.
I welcome the fact that the conciliation procedure resulted in an agreement on financing the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology.
I hope, too, that the European Parliament will agree that budgetary reserves may be drawn on to finance the Frontex Agency.
This is particularly significant for countries such as Poland.
As early as December the borders of these countries will become the external borders of the European Union in the full sense of the term.
(DE) Mr President, at the heart of a policy without any '-isms' is credibility.
Credibility has a great deal to do with the purposes to which available tax revenue is put, and people can see this most clearly in the amounts spent on administrative bodies.
Regrettably, this budget once again fails to indicate precisely how much is actually to be spent on administration.
We have an item with EUR 6.6 billion there, but administrative expenditure is also hidden away inside many other appropriations.
Besides, whether the lifestyle of the political classes bears any relation to the living conditions of the vast majority of the population or not says something fundamental about the democratic nature of a society.
We have a glaring example of a gulf between the two inside the European Union in the form of the pension scheme for officials as well as for those in this House who are in the luxury-class supplementary pension scheme.
In the case of officials, the total volume of annual payments now stands at EUR 963 million, to which these officials themselves contribute no more than a third.
The bill, moreover, just keeps rising.
The number of pension recipients alone is set to increase by 5.5%. The inflation rate is automatically factored in.
In this way Brussels is becoming increasingly remote from those it claims to represent, and that is bad for democracy.
This would be a starting point for rational budgetary reform, and it is also a call to action for you, Commissioner.
(DE) Mr President, let me begin with my warmest thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr ItÃ€lÃ€ and Mr Virrankoski, who have done a very good job over the past few months and have produced extremely sound reports.
I extend these thanks to the coordinators and staff of the political groups and also wish to express my sincere gratitude to the committee secretariat.
Let me pick out the names of Anne Vitrey, Ian Vollbracht and Marie-CÃ©cile Bernard as a way of thanking the entire team, who have worked extremely hard for all of us.
I must also say that we could not have arrived at this final cumulative outcome on which we shall be voting on Thursday without the great solidarity shown by the European Parliament.
Commissioner, with your knack of seizing the right moment, as you did once again at these negotiations, you made an absolutely vital contribution to their successful outcome, for which I warmly thank you.
As someone who has experienced a good few budgetary coordination processes, I wish to pay glowing tribute to the Portuguese Presidency for the way it conducted the Council's negotiations in this difficult situation.
It wrote a new chapter in the history of the EU institutions in securing the final vote and consent of the Council, an achievement which we deeply and keenly appreciate.
All in all, then, we have a budget for year two of the financial perspective period with a volume of EUR 120.3 billion, corresponding to 0.96% of the Member States' aggregate gross national income, a budget that is very heavily geared to fiscal discipline.
We have a budget that safeguards the programmes which create added European value, such as the ones we have just adopted here.
We have a budget that safeguards the foundations of the strategic Galileo project until 2013 in the first instance, and the secret lay in a mix of revision, flexibility and reallocation.
We have a budget that provides extra resources for Frontex, thereby permitting essential responses to pressing challenges, and we have a budget that funds the common foreign and security policy, albeit only for 2008, and makes it possible to draw on the flexibility instrument for CFSP purposes.
Let me say here that we should have preferred a long-term, multiannual approach that would have shored up the chronically underfunded heading 4, 'the EU as a global partner'.
That, however, is a subject to which the CFSP, Palestine and Kosovo will surely compel us to return in connection with Mrs Haug's forthcoming report on the priorities for the following budget.
I commend to the House the present budget in its agreed form.
(SK) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me a brief summary in the area of 'other sections'.
The European Parliament's work on the budget has resulted in major achievements and I will mention just a few.
Firstly, we reached a compromise on the overall size of the budget.
Secondly, as regards providing EU citizens with information about the work of the European Parliament and its results, we now have the tools for better cooperation and communication with citizens.
It must be stressed, however, that making progress in improving Parliament's information and communication strategy, would not in itself be sufficient.
If it is to be effective, the strategy requires the involvement of the Commission and of the European offices in the individual countries.
It must be coordinated and its results evaluated on a regular basis.
In that way we can achieve not only better access to information but also more transparency and a better use of resources.
Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for supporting our efforts in building our knowledge management system.
It will help you in your future legislative work.
Fourthly, we have achieved more flexibility for groups of visitors.
Fifthly, I believe that the measures taken to support language services will result both in higher quality services and a better use of resources.
Finally, we reached agreement on several points concerning the environment and access to employment for the disabled.
What is important for the budget for 'other sections' is to assess each institution individually.
I would like to mention the Court of Auditors as an example of good practice in terms of drawing up a budget.
Savings were made in some budget lines by working out the budget on the basis of real expenditure rather than index-linked calculations.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteurs as well as all the teams from the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.
Our meetings, debates and conciliation procedures have all left me feeling very satisfied.
When you feel that all those involved want to reach an agreement, it makes for a positive environment, which can only lead to good results.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know in 2006 many of us voted for the multiannual budget for the financial perspective with a heavy heart .
We were in fact fully aware that the contributions by the Member States would not be enough to take up the major challenges facing an EU comprising 27 nations and, notably, half a billion citizens.
This inadequate budget, aggravated by the withdrawal of the private partners who had hitherto been stakeholders in the Galileo project, made us vulnerable to serious problems and was the source of much concern.
I am therefore glad that Parliament has been heard this time after a very long battle with the Member States in the Council.
This 2008 budget is in fact a victory for Europeans and for the House, and I also wish to express my most sincere thanks to our general rapporteur and his entire team for their difficult negotiations, and also of course to Chairman BÃ¶ge and the COBU Members and administrative staff.
I am pleased that after hours of intense negotiations we have secured total credits of almost EUR 120 billion, representing 0.96% of the EU's GNP. This is due in particular to use of the flexibility instrument, which will allow us to considerably increase CFSP appropriations (heading 4), with particular emphasis on Kosovo and Palestine.
Finally, as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, like my colleagues I welcome the payments secured for Galileo, which is a major crucial project that will enable Europe to retain and even improve its ranking as a space power and guarantee us independence from other countries.
This is a great success, not only politically but also in terms of employment, attractiveness and, notably, visibility of European integration for our fellow citizens: quite simply it is a great success for our future.
(HU) Mr President, 'And yet it moves!' Galileo Galilei allegedly said.
Now, after many years of fault-finding, the Galileo programme moves yet.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission, the Commissioner and Parliament on forcing an agreement.
But why is force needed?
Why did the Council not act sooner?
Why is it shocked and horrified that the Union has to pay again?
Why are we not glad that the Union is willing and able to implement important programmes like Galileo?
Why did we need to scrape together the necessary amount from left-over money instead of everyone bearing the costs of investment as well as the profit?
Why does the Council try to reduce resources for cohesion policy from one year to the next - by more than EUR 100 million this year?
Why was it necessary to withhold agricultural aid for the new Member States for ten years, and to make European citizens who are aided in different ways compete with each other in the common market?
When the Austrian emperor and king of Hungary asked for help with the wars of Maria Theresa, the Hungarian nobles gave the spirited response, 'Our life and our blood!' But they added 'No oats,' in other words, we will not bear the costs.
It is difficult to be successful with such behaviour.
We should not regard the Union's budget as wasted money.
It is an instrument through which European citizens get value for their money.
Parliament, the Commission and finally the Council have worked on this.
If only the thoughts and intentions had clicked sooner.
Thank you for your kind attention.
- (NL) Mr President, once again we can congratulate ourselves that an agreement has been reached after so many attempts.
It was a long and painful process and everyone who played a part can now look back on it with a clear conscience.
The big question is whether this is the best procedure for adopting the budget.
I think that it would be a good idea, once the new Treaty has been ratified, for us to look again at whether we cannot find a quicker and more effective way to do this.
We could also, for example, consider the question of whether deciding on pilot schemes and preparatory actions at this late stage is the best method or whether we should do that at an earlier stage.
I think the latter.
If we look at the negotiations, the major successes of this budget are the Galileo project and the European Institute for Technology.
When I read the press reports about all the negotiations, it always seems as if there is only one institution that matters and that is the Council of Ministers.
Once the agreement was concluded and you read the press reports, it was always 'agreement has been reached in the Council of Ministers'.
Is it not possible to get the message through to the public for once that it was not exactly like that?
It was difficult to persuade the Council to adjust the multiannual budget.
In itself that is commendable: the Treaty is still new, but there was a pressing need for it.
I think that we should adhere to the Treaty and to the multiannual budget, but that also applies to the Council, especially as regards the point in Article 44 on the presentation of country statements concerning sound financial management.
Perhaps the Council could also give that some attention.
(PL) Mr President, in terms of both structure and size, the 2008 budget indicates that we are still at the early stages of introduction of new generation multiannual programmes linked to the financial perspective 2007-2013.
One relevant example is the record low level of payments in relation to gross national income.
I am cautiously optimistic that in 2008 the beneficiaries of this budget will give the European Parliament a pleasant surprise, and simultaneously give an unpleasant one to the Finance Ministers by calling for a so-called amending budget as a result of higher implementation than currently estimated, notably concerning the Structural Funds.
Conciliation was extremely successful, and was indeed a joint success for the three participating institutions.
I congratulate Mr BÃ¶ge on his role as the head of Parliament's delegation.
Congratulations are also due to the rapporteurs, the secretariat and others involved.
As has already been mentioned in today's debate, however, the conciliation procedure generated an unpleasant impression.
It felt as if rather than being actively involved in reaching the agreement and party to it, the role of Parliament's delegation was that of some kind of observer in a deal-making arrangement between certain national delegations.
The latter were particularly interested in the method of financing and even more so in the public procurement contracts related to the Galileo programme.
This unpleasant impression was subsequently reflected in media comments on the event.
It should be remembered that the main purpose of the latter was budget conciliation.
It was more than simply a meeting between the Finance Ministers of interested countries.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I hereby undertake that we will draw conclusions from this experience for future meetings of this nature in 2008.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, allow me to begin by paying a compliment to the President of the Council.
I believe you have greatly adorned this Chamber with your Portuguese Presidency ties, and you have generated an esprit de corps in the Council that we should never have thought possible.
From the perspective of budgetary control, there are two points on which we wish to lay particular emphasis for this coming financial year.
The first point, to which the Commissioner has already referred, is the continuation of the screening exercise focusing on the staff establishment in the realms of coordination and administrative support.
We know that the Commission itself has doubts as to whether it actually needs to have 1 700 employees assigned to communication or 3 500 to document management or 1 700 in the personnel directorate.
All of these together amount to almost a third of the staff in the support and coordination services.
We seek to ensure that the administration is not concerned with itself but that its workforce contains employees who can implement the political priorities of the Commission as well as those of Parliament.
For this reason we continue to call on the Commission to shed further light on these areas of activity in an action plan.
This issue must remain on the agenda, and it will remain on the agenda, with or without the reserve, with or without paragraph 11 of our resolution and even with or without the fulfilment of prior conditions.
I urge you very strongly to continue to pursue this matter.
You have commented on it; I have heard those comments, and I shall judge you by them.
I believe that this Commission certainly can draw up an action plan, for this particular Commission is in a position to do so.
Its successors, however, will not be.
This is why I believe it is important for you to fulfil this prior condition, to carry out the appropriate preliminary work.
I myself am very interested in this matter and am always willing to discuss it with you.
The second point to which we attach importance concerns national management declarations for funds that are subject to shared management.
Mr President-in-Office, during our conciliation procedure you made certain statements in which you indicated to us that you would deal with this matter.
So far you have not said precisely how you intend to set about this task.
Our call for action on this issue also extends to the Slovenian Presidency.
We strongly urge the Commission to use the relevant guidelines to establish the conditions in which we can initiate talks with the Member States in the first place.
Without recourse to these guidelines and without corresponding activities on the part of the Member States, it will be difficult to take any action.
(RO) Mr. President, the European Union budget for the year 2008 is a pragmatic one, of results, guided by the current development priorities of the European Union.
All through the budgetary procedure, the European Parliament used its prerogative of control over the other institutions for promoting the main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, economic competitiveness and employment.
The Parliament transferred funds designated to the Commission to reserve, due to deficiencies in the approval system for operational programmes, because exceeding of deadlines means money lost by the European citizen.
The same thing happens in the case of delays in recruiting personnel from the new Member States, which has generated important costs and affected the activity of the European institutions.
Thus, I consider it is very important that, after the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, the competence of the Parliament will significantly increase, co-decision will become a general rule and the veto of the Parliament in adopting the budget will be extended to agriculture as well.
The solutions found for financing the great technological projects of the European Union, namely Galileo and the European Institute of Technology, result in significant assistance for research and development.
Nevertheless, we have to make sure that the European assistance will be distributed uniformly and will not deepen the already existing technological and informational development gaps between the Member States.
Although it is a technical solution for financing these programmes, the use of the agriculture margin should not become a rule.
Agriculture should not be a field whose fate is decided beforehand and whose funds are systematically deviated.
I am very glad about the support you provided for increasing the amounts designated for the European programme for financing the school milk scheme and expanding it to other products as well.
Last but not least, I consider the increasing involvement of the European Union in the educational field, in general, and the expansion of scholarship and continuous training programmes, in particular, to be very important.
For this reason, I thank you for supporting the amendment regarding the significant increase of the budget in this field for the next year.
(EL) Mr President, this year's budget is resounding proof that the Community method works.
This year we have demonstrated the added value that the European Union can provide in resolving complex problems where the original plans failed.
This is borne out not only by the spectacular success of Galileo, but also by the way in which we were able to provide Frontex with new, necessary funding to meet new challenges; and by the pilot schemes, and the European Institute of Technology.
Simply put, the European Union shows that it can provide Community solutions to large-scale, complex problems where others have failed.
This is the first positive message.
However, there is another, negative message connected with the broader trend of the budget figures: the fact that this year we are spending, for next year, 0.95% of the Community GDP does not strike me as good news.
I have heard that some fellow Members regard it as a success.
For me it is not.
It proves that we are spending as much now, with 27 Member States, as we were when there were 15.
Budgets at this level do not represent the scale of ambition of the European enterprise.
Building on this year's success, we should start preparing the future allocations in good time, and I am glad that discussion of this has already begun.
Let me end on a personal note: on Thursday when we vote on the budget, it will be a year since Loyola de Palacio - the architect of this great European project - passed away.
A great European, a great woman, a woman who initiated this process, the successful conclusion of which we shall be voting through on Thursday.
I believe that for a politician who speaks through her work, there can be no better memorial.
- (MT) Thank you, Mr President.
One of the points on which Parliament and the Council are agreed is to substantially increase the Frontex agency's budget - in fact this has been doubled.
I would like to state that between this budget's first reading and its second reading, at which it will be approved this week, Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs had an intensive session with the Head of the Frontex agency, in which we spoke and were given a detailed presentation about the agency's work programme for the coming year.
This presentation, Mr President, convinced us that we are doing the right thing in increasing this agency's budget and that with more means at its disposal throughout the coming year, the agency will be more effective than it has been so far.
The Head of the agency also supplied us with the details of several new missions to be carried out in the course of next year on the external borders of the Union - land-, air- as well as sea-based missions.
As regards sea-based missions, it gives us great satisfaction to see that Frontex's activity will increase substantially on maritime borders, especially in the centre of the Mediterranean, but also in the Eastern Mediterranean, where we have recently seen problems increase substantially.
Meanwhile, missions will also continue near the Canary Islands.
Mr President, I am in no doubt that the citizens of the countries affected will welcome Frontex's more effective presence to help them meet the influx of migrants, which, as we all know, is a main preoccupation for citizens of these countries.
They will therefore appreciate the decisions we have taken as regards budget.
Moreover, I have no doubt that with this budget we are going to send a clear message to the organised crime network that is benefiting from the trafficking of migrants, a message that their activity will not be tolerated.
Thank you.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the Members' speeches and I must say to you that, while I indicated at the beginning my delight at the success achieved, I now have all the more reason to feel extremely satisfied, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Council, at the results that we have all managed to achieve together.
Please allow me to add that not only do these results allow us to feel satisfied, but they also give prestige to our institutions: Parliament, the Council and the European Commission.
In the eyes of European citizens, we have demonstrated a common will and a common ambition to continue building the European Union, now with 27 Member States, as an area of peace, democracy, freedom, justice and also prosperity.
I must take advantage of this occasion to express my great hopes, not only for the correct implementation of the budget to be adopted, but also for the correct implementation of the projects which were covered by these negotiations.
Many thanks to everyone for their generous words addressed to the Council.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (FI) We should congratulate Parliament's rapporteurs on their successful budget: Mr Virrankoski for the Commission's budget and Mr ItÃ€lÃ€ for Parliament's budget and that of the other institutions.
The outcome is an historic one.
The Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund for the first time now receive the largest slice of the budget. This reflects the changes in the Commission's priorities.
The size of the budget has long been known: just under 1% of GNI, which means around EUR 120.3 billion for 2008.
The budget also looks to the future, with the result that EUR 3.4 billion will go on the Galileo satellite radio navigation system, and EUR 309 million on the European Institute of Technology (EIT).
There was also further investment in the Common Foreign and Security Policy. This is immensely important for strengthening our credible international role.
As regards Parliament, Mr ItÃ€lÃ€ has highlighted the importance of budgetary discipline and that of the responsible use of public funds.
I therefore consider the new budget to be excellent.
Annual report of the European Union on Human Rights (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Annual report of the European Union on human rights.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be here today to witness this debate on the ninth EU Annual Report on Human Rights.
This report covers the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007 and was formally presented to the European Parliament on 26 November in Brussels.
As in previous years, the ninth EU Annual Report on Human Rights 2007 is a genuinely joint report prepared by the Presidency, the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council.
The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the human rights-related work of the European Union during the Finnish and German Presidencies.
The report aims to illustrate how the common values on which the EU is based translate into concrete human rights-related activities in its bilateral relations with third countries, in multilateral fora and in relation to a number of thematic issues.
A second objective of this report is to ensure transparency in the EU's human rights-related activities and also to ensure the visibility of these multiple and extremely important activities.
I should now like to highlight the most striking general aspects of the EU's policy on human rights during the period in question.
These were as follows: implementation of the EU guidelines on human rights - as you know, we already have guidelines on torture, the death penalty, human rights defenders and children in armed conflict; the development of new more comprehensive EU guidelines on the rights of the child, initially focused on the issue of violence against children; the first year of functioning of the UN Human Rights Council; the conclusion of the institution building process of this new body and, finally, the mainstreaming of human rights into all aspects of EU policies, including crisis management in operations and missions of the European Security and Defence Policy.
Although the structure of this report largely follows the same format as last year, this year's edition strives to provide additional focus on analysis in order to offer a more comprehensive and in-depth overview of the impact and effectiveness of EU action in the fields of human rights and democratisation.
This focus on analysis stems from the suggestions made by the European Parliament contained in the Coveney report from April.
This report therefore presents the EU's human rights-related activities from both thematic and country perspectives.
This year two new sections have been added: one on the neighbourhood policy and the other on freedom of religion and belief.
We wanted, in this way, to underline the importance we place on the fight against intolerance based on belief or religion.
The annual report includes comments on the resolution sponsored by the European Union on this subject during the 2006 session of the United Nations General Assembly.
I have pleasure in informing you that this year we again sponsored a resolution on intolerance based on religion or belief which was adopted by consensus in the UN Third Committee.
In the Human Rights Council session which began yesterday, 10 December, in Geneva, another EU resolution on religious intolerance will be presented.
This particularly aims to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur.
We hope that this resolution will also be adopted by consensus.
The report also includes a more comprehensive section on the European Parliament's activities to promote and protect human rights and democracy, particularly through resolutions, but also through hearings and debates organised in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development and with representatives of third countries.
The European Parliament's vital contribution to our joint efforts to promote and protect human rights is undeniable.
The report also mentions the mechanisms developed within the EU to guarantee respect for and protection of human rights.
Mention should be made in this respect of the establishment of the Agency for Fundamental Rights on 1 March of this year, replacing the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
The report highlights, among other activities, the steps taken to implement the EU guidelines on human rights.
I should like to start by mentioning the steps taken throughout this year to implement the guidelines on the death penalty.
By cooperating with countries in all regions, the EU has given great impetus to its campaign against the death penalty.
Throughout the reporting period, the EU took numerous steps on the death penalty, trying to convince countries to change their positions on this issue and also trying to save human lives.
It was also in the context of these guidelines that we presented a declaration on the death penalty in 2006 to the United Nations General Assembly which led this year to the adoption of the resolution against the death penalty on 15 November.
We have also reinforced our position against torture within the context of the guidelines and continued to improve the implementation of the guidelines on children in armed conflicts and also on human rights defenders.
This year, the EU has also taken a new initiative and developed a set of guidelines on the rights of the child which will in all likelihood be adopted by the Council at the end of this year.
The core of the report continues to be the EU's activities in the area of the common foreign and security policy, dialogues on human rights with various countries and troika consultations.
Information is given on the development of policies and actions in relation to 20 different thematic issues, including not only those areas in which the EU has adopted human rights guidelines, but also other thematic issues, such as women's rights, children's rights, the fight against racism and the trafficking of human beings.
The report includes an analysis of the EU's activities in neighbouring countries and provides an overview of the EU's activities in international organisations.
I would remind you in this respect that the period analysed in this report coincides with the first year of activities of the Human Rights Council, with the European Union having actively contributed to the latter's work.
Another priority for the EU in relation to human rights has, as in previous years, been the streamlining of human rights into all aspects of EU policies.
I am thinking of the planning and execution of crisis management operations and missions under the European Security and Defence Policy and the assignment of dedicated human rights and gender advisers to missions.
The mandates of the special representatives of the European Union have also now become concrete instructions in this area.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I also welcome this EU report, which is a joint report by the Council and the European Commission.
Those of you who were present the first time I spoke here as a Commissioner will know that it has always been my wish for us to address this issue together.
I would also like to thank those in Parliament who have contributed to our report.
At the end of the day, this is a very good document which expresses what we have to say, and shows what we have been doing, in the field of human rights.
Yesterday the world celebrated International Human Rights Day, which is particularly significant this year as it marks the start of the celebrations to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
That was the first step in establishing a comprehensive international framework for the protection of human rights, which has now been followed by an impressive codification of international human rights law over the past decades.
Today, the challenge is to turn implementation into reality, worldwide.
For instance, the deplorable human rights situations in Burma/Myanmar, in Sudan/Darfur, Iran and Zimbabwe are a stark reminder of the challenge we face, and one brought home to us today by the winner of the Sakharov Prize, Mr Osman.
He has clearly shown us the way.
I would like to draw your attention to four key developments which have particularly marked the European Union's activities over the past year.
First, we have seen important changes within the United Nations human rights system.
The institution-building phase of the Human Rights Council has been more or less successfully completed, and there is ground for cautious optimism, provided the Council addresses human rights violations in a timely manner whenever and wherever they occur.
In that light, we were pleased to see that, further to the EU's initiative, the Human Rights Council has taken steps to address the grave violation of human rights in Burma/Myanmar, and also in Sudan/Darfur.
Moreover, we also welcome the creation of the system of the Universal Periodic Review which, as of next year, will also allow for a regular thorough examination of the human rights records of every UN member state.
Despite the creation of the Human Rights Council, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly remains, of course, an equally important forum for human rights issues.
The European Union will continue to make full use of that Committee to propose both thematic and country resolutions.
At this year's session there was a particular success - namely the adoption for the first time of a resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty.
Thanks to the EU's initiative and the building of a cross-regional coalition, the historic condemnation of the death penalty marks a crucial step in building an international consensus towards its eventual eradication.
Secondly, one of the most important tools at our disposal for raising human rights issues with third countries is the human rights dialogues.
They also enable us to raise particular human rights concerns with a partner country, make recommendations for improvement and also discuss possible ways to promote reform through training projects or cooperation.
The last year has seen a considerable increase in the number of human rights dialogues.
We now conduct dialogues with around 25 partner countries.
For example, we have established human rights dialogues with most of the European neighbourhood countries, and initial meetings have generally been quite - and sometimes highly - constructive.
The first round of the human rights experts' dialogues, including with the African Union, has opened up new possibilities for engaging with the African continent on human rights.
In May 2007, the European Union held the first human rights dialogue with Uzbekistan, and the EU strategy for Central Asia foresees the establishment of such dialogues with all Central Asian countries.
However, as the number of dialogues increases, we must be vigilant to ensure consistency and effectiveness - a point that the European Parliament rightly underlined in its resolution of 6 September 2007.
Thirdly, let me turn to the EU human rights guidelines.
I am pleased - and the Council Presidency has already noted this - that 2007 has seen the adoption of the new guidelines on the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, jointly with an implementation strategy.
As a first priority, we shall address under those guidelines the crucial issue of violence against children.
As in the case of all EU guidelines it is, of course, implementation that counts.
The European Union has, in particular, been active under the guidelines on the death penalty, torture and ill-treatment, with numerous general dÃ©marches, but also with many specific representations on individual death-penalty or torture cases in a range of third countries.
We will consistently raise these matters in political dialogue meetings with third countries.
Finally, I must mention the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which has been in place since January 2007.
The EIDHR enables us to provide funding directly to civil society organisations worldwide, without the intervention of governments.
This has become a vital instrument for strengthening grass-roots organisations throughout the world, without which human rights and democracy could not flourish.
The EIDHR puts a new emphasis on the promotion of democracy and also allows us to provide support for actions in support of the EU human rights guidelines.
A further innovation is that funds can now be mobilised to assist human rights defenders who are in danger as a result of their activities.
In total, some EUR 140 million will be available each year under this instrument, and the first calls for project proposals are now open.
Time allows me only to touch on those few points today.
However, I think any reader of this good and interesting annual report cannot fail to be struck both by the sheer geographic scope of our activities on human rights and by the range of thematic issues covered.
In addition to the topics I have already mentioned, I would like to say that the European Union has been active on issues as diverse as promoting membership of the International Criminal Court (ICC), women's rights and the rights of persons with disabilities.
The year 2007 has been a year of achievements.
Nevertheless, we are also aware that human rights violations remain, unfortunately, endemic throughout the globe.
In this 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we will, of course, continue our efforts to ensure that the rights contained in that Declaration eventually become a tangible reality for all of us.
First of all, I would like to thank all those who have prepared the annual report.
Not only the European Parliament, but also such institutions as The United Nations Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and NGOs that continue to work in the sphere of protection of the human rights, a dialogue that cannot be overestimated, have been looking forward to this document.
I am talking about the dialogue between the European Parliament, its Subcommittee on Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council, society and the groups within them.
I agree with the ideas expressed by the country holding the EU Council Presidency and by the Commissioner.
Nevertheless, I would like to highlight several points.
The annual report is a detailed survey of the actions taken by the EU globally in the sphere of human rights.
It covers the activity of the EU Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament.
The report gives an account of situations in certain regions of the world, but I feel there are several issues missing that would have made the report even more valuable.
First of all, the report is lacking in the evaluation of the EU human rights policy.
At the end of the year it would be good to learn the opinion of the Council and the Commission of the results and the effect of the actions mentioned.
Such an account would be of much greater value than one that simply provides a list of actions taken, no matter how long that list might be.
A result-oriented outlook would highlight all the actions taken by the EU in the area of protection of human rights and would underline the insignificance.
This also applies to the individual cases mentioned in the report: what results has the European Union actually achieved?
Could it be that our tactics and activities have yielded no results at all or have even had negative consequences?
On the other hand, I am missing a clearer explanation of the European Parliament's work and the recommendations for resolutions that we have adopted.
The European Parliament would benefit from having information on which of its recommendations have been taken into consideration by the Commission and the Council, which of them have been implemented and what the results have been.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to make three rapid remarks on this ninth report, followed by a brief reflection on future reports.
The remarks are positive remarks.
First I wish to say that, although this report follows the structure of previous versions, there is greater concern for detailed analysis.
Some issues are even examined from a dual perspective: geographical and thematic.
This is a positive feature.
Secondly, another positive feature is the report's increased emphasis on abolishing the death penalty, torture, children's rights and greater concern about the protection of human rights defenders.
We should also be pleased with the increased concern about the particular vulnerability of women in situations of abuse, and consequently the need to reinforce their protection.
My third remark is that this report covers the first year of the UN's Human Rights Council.
The EU has played an active role in the introduction of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, and this could create some extremely positive synergies.
Finally, I wish to share a reflection partially coinciding with the thoughts of Mrs AndrikienÄ.
We are making good progress towards the establishment of a much more comprehensive diagnosis every year, but we still have a long way to go to turn this exhaustive and discerning analysis into more tangible and effective results of the European Union's action.
This means, therefore, that we must develop a conceptual and analytical device that allows us to assess our own instruments.
The way in which we approach dialogue with third countries, conditionality, the terms of the discourse we use to speak out against certain situations, whether or not we apply double standards depending on the proportions or the strategic importance of such-and-such a country, all of this we feel ought to be thoroughly examined, and we hope it is considered in future versions of our annual reports.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I think the European Parliament has started off well towards the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the impressive Mr Salih Mahmoud Osman.
But he told us that we are failing in our duty to offer protection to the people of Darfur and that the EU needed to put determination and resources, including troops, into that effort.
How can it be that an EU that preaches human rights allows the murder of 600 000 people and the displacement of four million?
The EU must build up its capacity to intervene in crisis situations such as this.
Without action, our words on the promotion of shared values are so much hot air.
I think many of my constituents and the suffering people of Darfur will have been astonished at the sight of EU leaders enjoying cocktails in Lisbon last weekend with the Presidents of both Zimbabwe and Sudan.
A major gap in the Council and Commission's 2007 human rights report is any response to the revelations, not least by this Parliament, of EU governments' collusion in extraordinary rendition.
We are told that the EU has been active on the issue of torture.
How can it be that an EU that stands for human rights and the elimination of torture has offered no true accountability or establishment of the truth, but only blank denials and bland assurances for its own involvement in this barbarity?
The signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights this week - welcome as it is, not least as it will be the first time that sexual orientation discrimination is banned in an international human rights instrument - rings hollow if we see hypocrisy in practice.
Lastly, Mr Osman also warned that justice and accountability must not be compromised by a political deal and that the cycle of impunity must be broken.
I think we can apply that warning to the current situation in the Balkans.
The European Union must not allow itself to be blackmailed by Serbia into signing the Association Agreement as a sweetener for the loss of Kosovo, unless and until Ratko MladiÄ and Radovan KaradÅŸiÄ are delivered to The Hague.
We cannot sweep aside the judgment of Hague prosecutor Carla Del Ponte that the Serbian Government has deliberately failed to deliver MladiÄ and KaradÅŸiÄ to justice.
We cannot reward Serbia for holding back from a violent reaction over Kosovo.
Mr President, defence of human rights should be a matter of conscience, rather than of keeping up with whatever the latest intellectual fashion happens to be.
I therefore call for the European Union's activities in this area to be imbued with greater sensitivity towards the issue of religious freedom.
Believers' consciences are coming under attack ever more frequently, and the problem has now reached dramatic proportions.
I could mention China, Burma, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Vietnam and also Russia, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Cuba.
Is that a long enough list?
It is therefore striking that so little attention is devoted to this problem, especially in the first part of the report.
I welcome the fact that gender issues and children's rights have been prioritised on our agenda, but regret the lack of attention to religious freedom.
This may be interpreted as an indication that certain people in Europe are prejudiced against faith per se.
The European Union should develop general guidelines on religious freedom as a matter of urgency.
Religious freedom is the human right most commonly infringed with impunity in the contemporary world.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I welcome this annual report.
It is an important piece of work providing us with a comprehensive view of the initiatives taken over one year and two presidencies to implement EU policy on human rights.
It is obviously no mean feat: it is a practical tool and a reference document.
For all that, I feel Mrs Andrikienis right. The report lacks a certain amount of objective appraisal, analysis and critical spirit, and as it does not draw any conclusions from the issues it considers, it lacks any recommendations.
The successes or failures of this policy are not sufficiently developed in the report.
That, I hope, and I feel sure this will be the case, will be the work of Members in the report to be drawn up by Parliament in the spring: their work must move in this direction.
There are also some disturbing silences in this report.
As Mrs Ludford mentioned, the section on human rights in relation to the fight against terrorism fortunately concludes with a reference to Parliament's work on CIA flights and extraordinary renditions, but it says nothing about the Council's lack of action in pursuing inquiries, charges against those responsible, and even less about compensation for the victims unjustly transferred, imprisoned or tortured.
Likewise, the section on asylum and migration says nothing about the mass violations of the rights of migrants; no assessment is made of the implementation of agreements for a series of readmissions, nothing on the quasi-militarised administration of borders, nothing on the thousands of people who die trying to reach our coasts, although the work of Members is extensive and regular on these issues.
Nor, on reading this report, can one understand the reasons why our Member States have placed themselves in an extremely embarrassing position vis-Ã -vis our partners and vis-Ã -vis international law by refusing outright to ratify the Convention on migrant workers and their families.
On these issues our internal policy has consequences on human rights outside our borders.
I welcome the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which will help us take a much wiser look at ourselves, including Great Britain and Poland.
Analysis of our successes could also be useful for inspiring our future strategies.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is right: the decisive role of the EU in the UN Human Rights Council's adoption of promising and demanding work mechanisms, such as the recent adoption of a resolution calling for a moratorium on the death penalty, must be analysed.
An active presidency, a mobilised Council, a European Parliament on the offensive and tenacious civil organisations are helping fashion Europe as an effective world player: this is very good and encouraging news.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, 'a new man of human rights has been born who has nothing in common with his ancestor of 1789 but the name': that was the piqued description used by the philosopher Marcel Gauchet to describe the Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed here and made binding made by Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty.
We know that in many respects the large number of rights it contains contradict the rights and freedoms protected by our national constitutions.
European law is superior to national law, even constitutional law.
In that case, what will be left of the secular principle when faced with Article 10 of the Charter, which states that religious freedom includes freedom to manifest one's religion both publicly and privately?
What will be left of the principle of equality when faced with Article 20 and subsequent articles of the Charter, which draw up a catalogue of victims' rights based on their belonging to a particular group?
What will be left of the principle of liberty, which includes the right to self-determination, when faced with Articles 6 to 19 which confuse this with personal rights and the simple power to demand a service from others?
What we are trying to do is speed up the transformation of citizens who control their own future into mere consumers, passive service-providers, and we could not do this any better.
To my fellow Members who appreciate their countries' secular freedoms and rights as protected by their constitutions, I can only say two words: wake up.
(NL) Mr President, a human rights policy that is not consistent is hypocritical and lacks credibility.
The European Union is right to want to support human rights in third countries, but to be credible, we must also respect all fundamental democratic rights among ourselves.
We do not always do that, especially in the case of the right to freedom of expression.
That right is one of the most basic rights, if not the most basic right, but it is increasingly being seen as a problem.
In particular, criticism of the failed immigration and integration policy is always labelled as racism and so is criminalised.
The report we are discussing now also makes this mistake.
People risk being prosecuted and convicted, not because of something they have done, but because of their opinions and the expression of those opinions.
In this way the policy being pursued does not produce solutions to the problems, but the policy itself becomes part of the problem.
Mr President, I am grateful for this report, but would like to point out that our human rights are still selective - they are politically correct.
Even in this House we could not hold a photographic exhibition on the atrocities in Chechnya, because we were afraid that the Russians would not like it.
Concerning our human rights dialogue with China, there was no mention of the 30 to 40 million girls who are missing, demographically-speaking, in China.
Where are those children?
They have been aborted, murdered after birth or abandoned, or are in the hands of organised crime.
Therefore, next time, our mission should be to take up this matter with the Chinese authorities.
Are things any better in the EU?
I by no means want to make anyone feel guilty.
All I am asking is for you to consider what the basis of humanity is.
Why do we point a finger - quite rightly - at those countries which have the death sentence when we also have a death sentence in the EU, with over one million children in the EU being murdered before they can be born?
All I am asking is whether this is humane.
Can we build a sounder society when human life does not have an absolute value?
Our first mission is to defend the defenceless, those who are the most vulnerable.
That is called real solidarity.
This may not be politically correct thinking, but we have to ask where the values lie.
Are they negotiable?
Can human rights values depend on a majority reached one day, which may be a minority another day?
To put it simply, the first human right is to be born.
I am very happy I was born, and I am sure my colleagues are happy that they were born.
By seeing the absolute value of human life, we can build a society of compassion and love.
We cannot build a better tomorrow on sand that is wet from the tears of unborn children.
(PL) Mr President, we have before us the EU Annual Report on Human Rights.
This is an excellent report.
It is actually one of the best documents produced recently in the European Union and is a positive example of coordinated action in the area of human rights across the main European institutions, in this case the Council and the Commission.
The European Union's policy on human rights is the best developed of all its policies.
It symbolises what the European Union stands for in contemporary civilisation at the start of the 21st century, over and above the common market.
The European Union does speak with one voice on human rights on the international stage.
It has no hesitation about presenting its own stance that is not always in line with that of the United States.
The Union is proving increasingly effective and helpful to individuals persecuted under undemocratic regimes the world over.
Nonetheless, Mr President, we do realise that much still remains to be done.
The winner of this year's Sakharov Prize, Mr Salih Mahmoud Mohamed Osman, has made this clear for instance in today's address to the House.
We should consider what action is required to make the European Union's human rights policy more effective.
I have in mind in particular a study of the situation regarding human rights in Russia following the elections in that country.
I am also thinking of the situation in China in the run-up to the Olympic Games due to take place there next year.
There is a lot for the European Union to do there, especially regarding human rights.
(FI) Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council said that human rights issues should be taken into account in all policy.
That is true, and that is what should happen in foreign affairs, but the EU should also take a look in its own backyard.
Are foreign workers within the EU treated in a way that takes account of everyone's human rights?
There is much poverty here.
In fact, that does not come under the EU's official policy.
It is outsourced to the Church and charities.
The EU must take a more determined stand on human rights; only deeds mean anything, not words.
Finally, I would like to raise the issue of the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, which is about to reach catastrophic proportions.
Some 4.5 million people have had to leave their homes, and the Iraqis last year represented the largest group of asylum seekers in Europe.
The EU has responded to the crisis by allocating EUR 4 million to the work of the UN Refugee Agency and the Netherlands Red Cross, and a further EUR 11 million is planned for the country's health services and schools.
Is this sufficient support, however, from a rich European Union for these 4.5 million people who are, through no fault of their own, in such a plight?
The Iraq crisis is now one of the world's worst.
(PL) Mr President, in this report I particularly welcome the section on the actions of Members of this Parliament.
The award of the Sakharov Prize to Alexander Milinkievich, along with the strong and unequivocal condemnation of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya showed that Europe will not stand idly by, ignoring infringements of human rights beyond our Eastern border.
Much remains to be done in this regard, however.
The latest parliamentary elections in Russia proved that fundamental principles and freedoms are being infringed there as a matter of course.
The events that took place in Russia call into question the regular consultations between the European Union and the Russian Federation in the area of human rights.
The time has perhaps come to redefine the nature of these meetings, to introduce sanctions for lack of progress in implementing commitments made and to establish mechanisms for monitoring their implementation.
One thing is certain. Russia is moving ever further away from democracy.
We can but hope that next year we will have more grounds for congratulating ourselves on not having wasted time and opportunities to make the world a better place.
(DE) Mr President, the report contains good innovations. There is, for example, a chapter on the European Neighbourhood Policy.
The report also describes the worsening human rights situation in Russia but sounds a warning against any moves to isolate that country.
Nevertheless, it is important that subsequent dialogues should involve further discussion of issues such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and religious freedom, anti-NGO and anti-extremist legislation, the fight against terrorism and the Chechnya question.
The Council and the Commission should establish a follow-up mechanism.
Moreover, there is a complete lack of willingness on the Russian side to engage with the NGOs.
We must hope that the Russian Government will agree at long last to take part in the consultations leading up to the human rights dialogues.
The report shows that the EU has become more active in the field of human rights, but it regrettably misses the opportunity to engage in more critical reflection on the human rights situation within the EU itself.
That, however, needs to be done if we are to pursue a credible policy on human rights.
(RO) Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the European institutions for drawing up this report, which represents a true indicator of the importance the European Union gives to human rights and the promotion of democratic values worldwide.
It is a detailed report and I appreciate the initiative to extend it to other fields as well.
At the same time, in the same theme of improvement, I would like to point out three aspects of major importance, which should be the priority of European action in the future.
First of all, I would like to emphasize the importance of promoting and respecting human rights, in the capacity of peace guarantor in Europe.
Today's Europe is a globalized and multiethnic Europe, and recognition and mutual respect of our rights and freedoms should lay at the basis of promoting tolerance and understanding.
Therefore, guaranteeing the rights of minorities, especially in the Western Balkans and in the Neighbourhood Policy, as well as intensifying the European Union's efforts in this direction, is of major importance.
At the same time, promoting the rights of the Roma and their integration into the European community, including by creating an agency responsible in this field, should continue to be consolidated.
The situation of human rights on the territory of the European Union, which aspires to the role of human rights promoter, is not less important and, therefore, of reference.
In this regard, I express my concern regarding the recent deterioration of the situation of Romanians in Italy, which has resulted in massive infringement of their rights.
Therefore, I request the Commission and the Council to take firm actions in order to restore the rights of Romanians and prevent this type of situation in the future.
In the end, I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the need to consolidate the European Union evaluation mechanisms within the annual human rights reports.
Only by knowing concrete results will we be able to develop these actions in a coherent and efficient manner.
Also, the examination and evaluation of the European Union's regional actions, including in developing the Black Sea synergy, should be integrated in the future reports.
Mr President, may I also welcome this year's Council and Commission annual report.
It certainly makes progress in terms of extra detail, which we have called for in past years.
But, if I can say so, it is still a little longer on description and a little shorter on analysis than we would like.
However, I want to wholeheartedly congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on their new guidelines on the rights of the child - a major step forward.
I hope in the next year that successive presidencies will ensure an effective role for the Fundamental Rights Agency and the upgrading of EU legislation to provide effective protection against discrimination on all grounds, and maintain pressure on the countries of the Western Balkans to bring war criminals to justice.
I also want to call today for specific European support in the next year for the final report of the UN Secretary-General's personal representative on business and human rights.
As Parliament's rapporteur on this issue, I am deeply concerned that in Bangalore this week Indian courts will seek to execute an international arrest warrant against seven Dutch activists from the Clean Clothes Campaign because they posted a report on labour violations at the Indian supplier of the fashion label G-Star, including forced overtime and physical and verbal abuse, on the internet.
This is in contradiction of the Indian Government's responsibilities under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
I ask the Council and Commission to investigate this case, and I appeal for all EU governments not to cooperate with this arrest warrant on a fundamental issue both of labour rights and of freedom of speech.
(PL) Mr President, the report contains information on talks with Russian and Chinese leaders regarding respect for human rights.
Unfortunately, the information is not very specific.
In the meantime, the conflict between the police and the army in Russia over organs belonging to Chechens continues.
Chechens are being seized from their homes, and when all organs suitable for transplantation have been removed from their bodies, they are dumped.
In China, organs are taken from political prisoners.
The Council of Europe issued statements on these cases earlier in the year.
All our Parliament managed to do was dismantle a display illustrating crimes committed by Russia against the Chechen people.
The display was taken down one evening because it was deemed too shocking.
I should stress that it was the display that was considered too shocking, not the actions it illustrated.
How long will we condone genocide?
I should like to ask for clarification as to whether the problem I have referred to was raised in the talks with Russia and China.
(PT) I must congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on this report which contains a detailed description of the valuable work carried out, in particular, for me, the moratorium on the death penalty.
However, it is lacking one critical and, above all, self-critical analysis.
I am referring to the lack of a response from the European Council on the recommendations of this Parliament and Senator Dick Marty on the so-called CIA flights.
Despite having been confronted with proof that the territory and agents of various Member States are implicated in the kidnap and torture of terrorism suspects, who were therefore denied justice, the European Council, and the Portuguese Presidency in particular, have done nothing to date to properly find out what happened, to apportion blame and to prevent such criminal actions happening again.
Despite admissions and investigations in the US, the European governments still have their heads firmly in the sand, thus offending basic European values and interests and seriously compromising Europe's credibility in terms of the universal promotion of human rights.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to say how glad I am that my country, Poland, decided to withdraw its reservation regarding establishing World Day Against the Death Penalty.
Not only does this decision accurately reflect the feelings of the Polish people, but it also allows the Union to speak with one voice.
With regard to the report before us, I welcome its Chapter 4.5, entitled Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
It is good that the European Commission included gender equality and women's rights amongst its priorities and action frameworks for 2010.
Every Member State must now keep these issues in mind and take them into account in all political initiatives and cooperative actions aimed at development.
We would do well to consider the situation on the ground with regard to these issues.
Can we really feel satisfied when we hear what is actually happening?
I could refer for instance to a 24-year-old Iranian woman named Delaram Ali who was sentenced to 32 months in jail and 10 lashes simply because she took part in a demonstration against the persecution of women.
In addition, in July of this year, the bodies of 42 women were found in Basra.
How do we react to the fact that those women were murdered simply because they had failed to cover their heads or had worn make-up?
Surely we cannot condone the needless deaths of those women?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief.
Firstly, on the report presented and debated here today and on the manner of this debate, I must thank you for your support.
In fact more than that, I must thank you for your recognition of the work carried out by the Council, the Commission and also the General Secretariat of the Council in preparing this report and its contents.
The comments we have heard have been music to our ears as they have recognised the detail, the merits and the effort put into this report.
We have also heard criticisms, specifically that we could here and there have improved the analysis and gone deeper into the causes and consequences.
This report is definitely heading that way: it is more analytical, or aims to be so, than previous reports and you should not be in any doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that we will continue along these lines as you have advised and suggested.
Comments were also made on the substance.
There was one Member who said that Europe has done something, or has done a great deal, but there is still a long way to go.
I believe that Europe is probably the greatest area of freedom, justice, human rights and rule of law.
It has followed a consistent and constant path in its ever stronger and more solid defence of human rights.
However, it is clear that there is always more that can be done because we will never reach the end in terms of freedom and human rights: there will always be something to defend, to develop, to protect and to safeguard.
However, we should recognise that, both internally and also externally, the European Union has done a great deal.
A recent case was cited: the decisions or measures that we have adopted in the area, for example, of the protection of children's rights.
We have done this.
I would also point out four or five initiatives in the area of human rights that indisputably prove what the EU is trying to do in terms of defending these human rights.
Here, tomorrow, we will solemnly proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
In this half of 2007, the European Union has secured the adoption, in the United Nations, of a resolution on a moratorium on the death penalty.
We have established the European Agency of Fundamental Rights which is in its final stages of preparation.
We have also created the European Day Against the Death Penalty.
These are concrete, specific and recent examples of how our work to defend human rights is continuous, persistent and solid.
We must accept that there will be problems and that there will be measures or actions or attitudes that may be less than perfect!
Yet we must also recognise the great successes that we have had in this area.
Specifically in terms of external action, reference was made to the EU-Africa Summit which will be debated next.
There can be no doubt that the issue of human rights and good governance was an important, in fact, a very important issue in the dialogue that we held in Lisbon during the EU-Africa Summit.
You all know, ladies and gentlemen, as do all European citizens, that, in our dialogue with third countries, the issue of the defence of human rights is a constant and priority theme on our agenda and in our bilateral dialogue.
This is proven by our condemnation whenever violations of human rights occur in third countries and by the measures that we have taken in response to violations of human rights in third countries, in particular by adopting sanctions which are specifically aimed at preventing these violations from reoccurring.
We should therefore recognise our merits and the efforts that we have made.
Of course we must also correct what can be corrected, but we should have, on this issue, a confident and positive attitude and a belief that we are on the right road in line with our humanist traditions.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, before responding to some of the issues that have been mentioned here in the debate, let me say that we have brought a number of copies for you, just in case you would like them.
They are available.
Going into the discussion, let me begin with the general remarks about the report.
I am glad many of you find it a useful report and we also take note of the suggestions and the recommendations that you mentioned in this debate.
On the question of analysing the effectiveness of our own policy, which was raised by some of you, I would just like to point out that, in Chapter 7, which is dedicated to this issue, there are evaluations and analysis, but it is also true that we can do better; we can do more.
Let me also say that there is a certain limit, because very often human rights questions also relate to changing the whole society, therefore they are not as easily measurable as other things that are quickly implemented.
Let me also say a few things in general.
Religious freedoms have been mentioned.
The European Union is, of course, strongly against discrimination affecting any religious groups and our dialogue with third countries is expected to reinforce the respective governments' own efforts to pursue and apply human rights principles, including, for instance, through national institutions for human rights.
With regard to the other questions that have been mentioned here, for instance the situation of the Roma in the candidate countries, it is stated in this annual report that we are committed to respecting fully the human rights of all persons, including those belonging to minorities.
Roma communities, in the mean time, have been identified as one of the most vulnerable minorities, both within the EU and in the candidate countries.
I think we still have to go on to tackle this question and to have it improved.
There was also the question about renditions in general.
In our opinion, practices referred to as 'renditions' or 'secret detention' constitute a violation of fundamental rights.
This has been clearly mentioned.
Here the Commission has from the beginning actively supported and facilitated the investigations launched by both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament into the renditions and the secret detentions.
I would just like to mention that here.
Things have been done.
On Sudan: we heard Mr Osman here today.
One of the key elements of the joint strategy at the summit was the question of partnership on security and peace.
Here we provide substantial support for conflict prevention, peace operations, and reinforcement of Africa's capacity to tackle conflicts at regional and national level.
President Barroso and Commissioner Michel have used every opportunity, including the last Africa-EU Summit, to remove remaining obstacles.
I was present today when Mr Osman spoke and he also expressly said that he has received a lot of support from the delegations of the European Commission.
So there is great support there, but, of course, one can always do more.
Concerning the human rights situation in Iraq, which was also mentioned here: we know that this is still an alarming situation, particularly in the light of the bad security situation there and also with regard to women, children, minorities and displaced persons.
Here, I think, good governance, democracy, human rights and the rule of law are the focus of our policies, in order for them to slowly go in the right direction.
We have often called on them concerning the abolition of the death penalty.
This is just to highlight a few of those issues.
On Russia: we hold EU-Russia human rights consultations twice a year and Russia is also mentioned in our report twice, on pages 72 and 73: first consultations were highlighted, and, secondly, we spoke clearly on the human rights situation, including in Chechnya.
So, again, Chechnya is not forgotten.
Let me finally say a word on India.
We are aware of the legal action that has been taken by Fibres and Fabrics International against the Clean Clothes Campaign.
This issue is particularly important to those of the Commission's directorates-general that are concerned with fair labour practices.
We have asked the Commission delegation in Delhi to keep us apprised of the situation that is proceeding in the Indian courts, and we have to look into the detention that has been mentioned.
There remains a lot more to be said, but I think it was a broad debate and I do not want to take up any more time.
The debate is closed.
Second EU/Africa Summit (Lisbon, 8 and 9 December 2007) (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the second EU-Africa Summit which was held in Lisbon on 8 and 9 December 2007.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner Michel, ladies and gentlemen, the second EU-Africa Summit that was held last weekend in Lisbon was undoubtedly a success and marked the start of a new relationship between the European Union and Africa based on strategic dialogue.
Almost 80 Heads of State and Government, the Presidents of the European Parliament and Pan-African Parliament and representatives of civil society sent strong messages to the European people, to the African people and to the world.
The concrete expression of the new relationship between the EU and Africa can be found in the documents - in my opinion high-quality documents - that were adopted at the summit: the Joint Strategy, the Action Plan and the Lisbon Declaration.
These documents set out the specific details of the relationship between Europe and Africa.
The new approach firstly favours multilateral channels and, secondly, tries to deal in an integrated manner with all the various dimensions of the relationship.
This approach constitutes the difference that the EU can bring, particularly in comparison with other international actors.
The treatment of Africa as a partner in strategic dialogue was also reflected in the method followed when both preparing for the summit and producing the documents that this summit was to adopt.
The strategy - for the first time a genuinely joint strategy - and the action plan were the result of intense and in-depth work with the African side, in particular with the African Union, and were, in the end, prepared and concluded by a joint group of experts.
I must also highlight at this point the constructive role played by the European Parliament in the process of producing the documents and preparing for the Lisbon Summit.
The Joint Strategy identifies four interlinked areas of common concern: peace and security, democratic governance and human rights, trade and regional integration, and development.
For the initial period from 2008 to 2010, the first action plan provides for eight partnerships in areas of common concern which primarily aim to have a positive impact on the day-to-day lives of African and European citizens.
The Lisbon Summit confirmed the major changes that have occurred in Europe, Africa and the world.
In the Europe of today, with 27 Member States, there are very diverse external policy priorities and approaches.
The African Union is emerging as a favoured discussion partner of the EU, with the agenda also including the issue of human rights and good governance.
There is also a widespread perception that a series of global challenges, such as peace, security and international trade, require concerted action on the part of the international community, thereby justifying the emergence of new forms of cooperation.
The same can be said with regard to finding answers to problems affecting both Europe and Africa, in particular the effects of climate change, management of energy resources and migration flows.
Africa and the EU understand that there is a need to raise their relations to a new level, with the summit representing the moment when this common desire became clear and unequivocal.
However, the second EU-Africa Summit must not be presented as the end of the road, but rather as the turning point in relations between the two continents.
Therefore, of particular importance in the documents adopted, especially to guarantee a medium- and long-term view, is the explicit reference to the follow-up mechanisms for decisions made.
In addition to setting a three-year frequency for these summits, sectoral ministerial and expert meetings are planned for the various areas of the action plan, together with regular contacts between the Commissions of the European Union and the African Union.
However, civil society, NGOs, trade unions, business forums and think tanks will also have a very important role to play in implementing and monitoring the planned measures.
Finally, I must stress the central role of the European and Pan-African Parliaments in implementing the new partnership.
Existing ties between the parliamentary representatives of Europe and Africa must now be reinforced.
The Presidency is delighted, as you must be aware, at the joint statement presented by the Presidents of the two Parliaments at the second EU-Africa Summit.
There can be no doubt that a new and very exciting road is opening up in the relationship between Europe and Africa following the Lisbon Summit.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to report to you on the results of the Lisbon Summit.
There is not much more to add since I feel that the President-in-Office of the Council has described the results splendidly.
I also wish to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency for arranging and organising this summit - as I feel it was urgently needed - and especially for its great success.
The summit evidently brought home a new and clear message: that of a radical change in relations between Africa and Europe.
The Lisbon Summit marked the adoption, as has already been said, of a new common vision within a joint strategy, a political partnership of equals - complex-free, liberated and pragmatic - and a mutual responsibility.
Having said that, the summit also adopted eight strategic plans to specifically implement this new vision.
The summit featured intense, rich, high-quality debates pointing to the new nature of our relationship, and thus its genuinely and essentially political nature.
Yes, we discussed Zimbabwe, and many new European leaders, such as President Barroso and Chancellor Merkel, made it clear that Mr Mugabe's policy is totally unacceptable, that we cannot tolerate violations of human rights, and that the policy operated there damages the desires for reform on the African continent.
Many African leaders share these criticisms, and I feel the EU ought to lend its full support to African mediation under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and led by President Mbeki.
Yes, we talked about Darfur and the unacceptable humanitarian and security situation, and we criticised the uncooperative attitude of the Sudanese Government.
At a troika meeting with the President of Sudan, we clearly set out our expectations and demands for him to take the decision to permit rapid deployment of the hybrid force in order to put an end, as soon as possible, to the violence we know is being committed there.
It should be noted that, as a general rule, democracy, governance and human rights are no longer taboo, and many African countries have embarked on the road to progress, as they say, not in response to Europe's expectations, but in response to the expectations of their own people.
Yes, we also talked about economic partnership agreements (EPAs), and yes, agreements were reached with many African leaders.
President Barroso and I explained time and again the real issues behind EPAs.
We also explained that the real challenge in the short term is to draw up interim agreements, not EPAs, before 1 January to ensure compatibility with WTO rules and thus prevent non-least-developed countries (non-LDCs) from being left in a more unfavourable situation as of 1 January 2008.
I was told about the example of the CÃŽte d'Ivoire which would have lost around 750 million euros in commodities trade if it had not drawn up the interim agreement.
President Barroso suggested that next year the EPA discussions should be held at the highest level with each of the regions concerned, to finalise the agreements with a view to reasonable economic integration.
These are, of course, difficult issues.
We brought them up with no fear of divergence.
I feel that this will obviously give our new partnership quality and depth but, ladies and gentlemen, as of tomorrow we will face the even greater challenge of transforming this new political vision into specific action.
It is our political duty to present specific results by 2010, in other words when we meet up again for the Third EU-Africa Summit.
We have a collective obligation to produce results.
The joint strategy and the first action plan form the roadmap for our partnership and divide it into very specific, operational, thematic objectives, as the President said.
These two joint documents adopted at the summit were unanimously welcomed in view of their quality and their ambitious nature.
This success is the result of a very long period of preparatory work which began in December 2005 with a communication by the Commission on a strategy for Africa, which in 2007 became the EU-Africa joint strategy.
The European Commission fully intends to assume its responsibilities during the implementation phase.
Success, however, is not only the responsibility of the Commission.
The Member States and our African partners must ensure that their mechanisms are in full working order.
One of Europe's major responsibilities in implementing this partnership will consist of mobilising funds for finance.
I wish to remind you that the Member States undertook to disburse an additional 20 billion euros per year by 2010.
The latest results show we are on the right track but that, if we take account of the effect of debt cancellation in certain countries, the current good results are quite relative.
Secondly, one very important aspect is a better distribution of the work between donors.
This is why the Code of Conduct on Division of Labour is a vital component.
Thirdly, I also wish to remind you that the Member States committed themselves at Gleneagles to finding one billion euros per year for Aid for Trade, half of which must be paid over to Africa.
These are public political commitments.
I wish to remind you of this because these are components that will consolidate the feasibility and achievement of the strategic plans.
I have another thought on this subject: it is now clear that the commitment of the Commission and the Member States must not be the monopoly of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs or of the Ministers for Development.
I would like us to institutionalise the principle of joint and regular sectoral ministerial meetings on these issues.
Obviously sectoral ministers, for example in the areas of scientific research, trade, agriculture and finance can make an enormous contribution to the new relationship with African countries.
As I explained at the conference of the European and Pan-African Parliaments in Lisbon, we are also relying heavily on the European Parliament and the African and European national parliaments to gather and relay the opinions and expectations of civil societies.
The central place given over to democratic actors and African and European civil societies at the very heart of the strategic partnership and its implementation is also an innovative feature which I hope will produce a genuine partnership focusing on people.
The speeches by the Presidents of the European and Pan-African Parliaments to the Heads of State and Government marked the official implementation.
I also wish to tell you that I took due note of the request by your colleagues in the Pan-African Parliament for financial support for this institution with respect for its autonomy.
We are obviously willing to consider, with the budgetary authorities, more direct access to finance.
I reiterate to you my hope that one day we may include the European Development Fund in the budget, for I think it is right and fair for you to perform your function of democratic control over the process of allocating public development funds.
Ladies and gentlemen, before the summit I said that the main challenge there would be to strike the right note on this EU-Africa political partnership and send out a clear message of a complex-free, joint and pragmatic relationship.
I think this is precisely the message emerging from the Lisbon Summit.
As the Portuguese Prime Minister JosÃ© Socrates said, I have the feeling there will be a before-Lisbon and an after-Lisbon in relations between the EU and Africa.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the summit is behind us, a historic moment, a turning point in our relationship with Africa.
The basis of the relationship has really changed: from domination to cooperation, from monologue to dialogue.
It is right to talk about a partnership of equals.
After all, both Europe and Africa have a responsibility when it comes to the development of Africa.
Europe is responsible for European policy; the African governments are responsible for their policies.
A joint strategy, based on shared values and mutual respect, and geared to the welfare of people, was sorely needed.
A joint strategy was also needed to enable us to tackle the problems that affect both continents together.
I am pleased that the summit was not taken hostage by Mugabe.
The situation in Zimbabwe is unacceptable and it is right that his policies are severely criticised.
However, the summit was not just about Zimbabwe.
There are other disasters going on in Africa which are claiming many victims.
Just think of Darfur, Somalia and, let us not forget, the Congo.
Mr President, Parliament adopted its report on the strategy in October.
The joint declaration of Parliament and the pan-African Parliament was signed at the parliamentary pre-summit .
Both presidents presented this at the opening session of the summit.
The parliaments should indeed not only have a role in preparing the strategy, they also have an important monitoring role with respect to its implementation.
When it comes to the action plan, unfortunately this is still vague, as are the issues of financing and the structural involvement of the parliaments.
I am pleased with the Commissioner's promises on this.
The action plan talks about seminars, studies and evaluations.
They are all very important but ultimately it is about the results.
We all know that there is enough water, know-how and money to give Africa a better existence.
A great deal is dependent on political will.
Let this strategy be a genuine new start for sustainable development in Africa.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to add my congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency.
It was completely wrong that for seven years the world's largest trading entity and the poorest continent had not sat down together to talk.
That stumbling block has now been overcome.
The summit has been held and has doubtless achieved many successes, the first success being that it was actually held.
The Parliaments, and this House especially, are ready to take our inspiration onto the stage, as we say in Spanish, meaning to match words with actions.
However, Commissioner, I regret that the reference to the parliamentary dimension was mere lip service, for none of the requests we made at the previous summit in relation to specific courses of action and funds to develop the role of the Parliaments were included in the summit's conclusions.
Despite this, the House will continue to work and point out areas where we have not done well.
It must be said we have not done well in connection with those famous economic partnership agreements.
What has happened is that we have a complex-free relationship, a relationship of equals.
Certain African leaders have clearly stated the problems posed by some of the approaches we have fiercely defended.
It is not enough to be right, or to have reasons.
What we have to do is reach agreement.
Agreements are agreements, and cannot be impositions.
We ought to work harder and better to secure agreements on this equal footing that we proclaimed in the spirit of the summit.
This trade disagreement will go down in history as one of the main features of this summit.
The other main feature was human rights.
Substance was in short supply here too.
Yes, Commissioner, you discussed Darfur, but not much.
Not much, no, and in fact nearly not at all, because some of us here had to write to remind you that it was not on the agenda, and that it was a disgrace that Africa and Europe should meet up and not discuss Darfur.
Once again people were concerned, but did not actually concern themselves much in practice.
As we were reminded this morning, it is certainly time for us to be concerned, but it is also time for us to concern ourselves much more, and more effectively too.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to come back to the interparliamentary encounter between the Pan-African and European Parliaments to comment on two points where a common vision is needed within a common strategy.
As in love, words are not enough: we need action and proof.
Thus I feel there are two points where we could implement a common vision to really make it part of a common strategy.
The first point, Commissioner, as you said, is budgetary control.
Our job is to control outgoing funds and so it is absolutely essential, and it is up to us, to include the European Development Fund (EDF) in the budget in such a way as to allow parliamentary control to be exercised.
Our outgoing funds are, of course, incoming funds for our colleagues in the African parliaments.
It is vital that they can use national parliamentary controls to handle incomings which, particularly in a budget-support policy, can often be an important lever in their national policies.
It is high time, therefore, for us to get down to including the EDF in the budget and provide them with budgetary control mechanisms, with assistance if necessary.
The second point I wish to make concerns joint action within the context of international humanitarian law.
International humanitarian law - as you said, Commissioner - is flouted and trampled on, and this is totally unacceptable, and it is often for the extremely surprising reason that there is a war on.
International humanitarian law is precisely a law which is applied only in a war situation: it is not a law for times of peace.
Thus on this issue we may all insist together, the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament in unison, that any person who has ever violated international humanitarian law, especially during a power struggle, cannot be excused, and that we can then impose sanctions on those responsible.
These sanctions, however, will serve a genuine purpose and will be properly perceived only if they are transmitted on the ground in Africa, and if the kind of passive complicity we occasionally observe in such cases is curtailed.
I believe our parliamentary colleagues would be honoured if we undertook joint reflection on this issue.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Presidency and also Commissioner Michel and the African leaders for all the progress that was made at the summit.
I think very often we look at the negative side but I think that an awful lot of good things came out of it.
The theme that emerged from the summit was one of partnership.
This was a summit of equals.
But we must make sure that this is more than rhetoric.
Let this pledge to partnership be reflected in practice.
To this end we should both demand equal standards from our partners on human rights and deal with them as equals on trade and economic issues.
We want to build a new strategic partnership with Africa, one that helps to establish a peaceful and secure future for the people of Africa, one that helps to strengthen investment, growth and prosperity through closer economic ties, and one that is based on a shared vision of Africa.
Before the summit there were some concerns about President Mugabe - but I do believe that he got the message very clearly - and also about EPAs.
I know that I was delighted to hear the Commissioner say that he and President Barroso had explained and re-explained to African leaders the benefits of this.
I want to thank him again for the meeting that I and other groups had with him.
They were very clear on the advantages of EPAs for the long-term economic future of Africa and, obviously, for the people of Africa.
I would like once again to congratulate the people involved in the summit and I think a lot of momentum and progress has been made.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish first of all to say that we in the European Parliament delegation attended two summits: first the parliamentary pre-summit with our colleagues from the Pan-African Parliament, and also the official summit.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think you cannot be aware of the status we had there, in other words the degrading status of observers: Members of the European Parliament, even if they had worked well on previous occasions, had no access to the official summit.
I very much wished to inform the House of this, and I feel that we, as Members of the European Parliament, represent European citizens in the same capacity as heads of state or government.
Thus it would be right if we were also represented at the next summit.
The official summit, however, was a splendid initiative, and it is good to know that it has been held after seven years of failed attempts.
I do feel, however, that the main lesson to be learned from the summit is that the African continent is finally becoming emancipated and organised as an African unit, and this is certainly good news.
This reminds me of the discussions we had at our parliamentary pre-summit with the Commissioner, where we stressed the contradiction between, on the one hand, the political display of the EU's vision and the new approach to its partners, and, on the other hand, the pressure exerted by the EU to get the economic partnership agreements signed.
I now wish to ask the Commissioner about the status of these partnerships, these interim agreements to be signed, because I must remind you that the African countries rejected this type of agreement and this kind of pressure.
Finally, Commissioner, another question on a matter of some concern: the nuclear issue.
The question from the Group of the Greens is as follows: why did nuclear talks commence with African countries?
African countries are now in need of renewable energy.
Our technology, our solar energy, photovoltaic systems and wind-energy systems are truly suited to Africa.
What, then, was the reason, particularly when we are aware of the difficulties this can entail, such as with Iran at the moment?
Why, Mr Vice-President? This is a very important question.
I would also like to know which country forced the EU to add the nuclear issue to the strategy.
Was it my president, the worldwide nuclear sales representative?
This is totally unbelievable.
It is renewable forms of energy that Africa needs at the present time.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we can be satisfied with what happened in Lisbon.
At last, despite its differences - and after all we too have ours - Africa is showing that it is united and capable of overcoming the paternalistic relationship that arises between donor countries and recipient countries.
Building a political, economic and social partnership forms part of our strategy.
We can therefore be pleased that what we have asserted in our documents ever since the Treaty of Rome in 1957 is today becoming a reality.
Mr KonarÃ© stated that Africa wishes to draw up its own agenda: this is quite extraordinary, and I hope it really does mean that Africa assumes responsibility for jointly tackling poverty, desertification and disease.
Criticism of economic partnership agreements (EPAs) has long been expressed in this House, and in my opinion we should bear in mind that not only social groups but also African governments are now expressing such criticism and hence try to find alternatives.
The Pan-African Parliament and the European Parliament have now entered the field with determination, with a joint statement, and this is something exceptional.
It will also be a challenge, however, with regard to the policies to be pursued together with civil society organisations.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Mr Mugabe claimed a diplomatic victory at Lisbon in that he had 'defeated the British'.
In a way he was right.
Instead of attending the conference himself, Gordon Brown sent Baroness Amos, who is, with no disrespect to the Baroness, a relatively minor figure in the British Government.
In the same way, he will send his errand boy, Mr Miliband, off to Lisbon on Thursday to sign up to the Lisbon Treaty.
It fell to Angela Merkel to rebuke Mr Mugabe with wonderful, almost British understatement that 'Zimbabwe damages the image of the new Africa'.
Well, you could certainly say that!
Mr Brown should have attended the conference and taken the opportunity to tell Mr Mugabe to his face that he is a bloodthirsty tyrant who has no place in the modern community of civilised nations.
That would have given heart to oppressed Zimbabweans, and it would also have required real leadership - which is precisely why it did not happen.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to have the courage to see the truth before our eyes.
The EU-Africa Summit last weekend was in fact a failure and you do not need to look far to find the reason why.
People may well make fine statements about a new strategic partnership, but the fact is - as I said in Lisbon - that a satisfactory partnership between Europe and Africa has to be based on shared values and principles, such as democracy, human rights and good governance.
That is not the case at all today.
Europe rolls out the red carpet for Gaddafi and Mugabe: for Gaddafi in order to secure lucrative contracts, for Mugabe so as not to offend the other partners.
However, if the member states of the African Union continue to support the dictator Mugabe openly, the question will arise as to what their own promises on democracy and human rights are actually worth.
I will say it again therefore: if there is one signal that Europe should have given at this summit, it is that only democratic systems based on the rule of law offer a guarantee of improvement in one's lot and that development aid should be made contingent upon the fulfilment of these conditions.
(PT) Mr President, we will only find out if the EU-Africa Summit was worth the effort in 2010 when the next summit will be held, depending on whether the issues discussed at that time are new or the same as today.
That will be the criterion and the time for assessing the results of what happened this weekend in Lisbon.
However, in the meantime, we can take stock to a certain extent.
This summit was presented as a summit for dialogue, genuinely bilateral partnership and common sharing of responsibilities.
These are worthy aims.
In the new relationship between Europe and Africa, there can be no one leader as Africans must be responsible for their own destiny.
It is up to us, the European neighbours, to be generous and consistent in our development aid.
If, in 2010, we are well on the way to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and if there are fewer deaths, less hunger, more democracy, more respect for human rights, more fair trade and more growth and development, then this summit will have been a success.
If the same dictators are still in power and the same deals are still being done, bringing many benefits to very few, then it will sadly have been an opportunity lost.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, following the EU-Africa Summit I wish to make a few remarks as a kind of summary of this important encounter.
As the Commissioner said, the results of the summit would certainly appear to be positive.
First of all, for months, or more than months, we have been asking the Commission to review the economic partnership agreement agenda and contents.
On each occasion, the Commission, or Commission representatives, told us that our criticisms were not shared by any African government officials or partners, and that we were merely relaying, for I remember the response, the perverse arguments of a number of large NGOs.
In Lisbon, there was a stream of criticism from the vast majority of African Heads of State and Government with regard to methodology and also the contents of negotiations.
A clear call went out to take the time to sign up fair and balanced agreements in compliance with EU commitments towards African development.
For a long time now we have been asking the Commission to ensure genuine coherence among its various policies.
We agree that several decades of European development cooperation with Africa have failed, but we would maintain that the limits of this cooperation have been constantly set by the Commission, taking back in one area what it gave in another.
Post-Lisbon, it is therefore obvious that the issue is not about substituting trade for cooperation, but about making both policies pursue the same objective of sustainable development.
In relation to food security, the fight against disease, human rights and migration, especially support for more fragile states, we have also constantly asked the Commission to do more and better for and with Africa.
We can see that this will be the case from now on, and that is good.
It can no longer be ignored, however, that the demands of this Parliament are the demands of ordinary African citizens, and also of their political representatives.
We are therefore pleased that the Parliaments, so long ignored in this process, have finally been included.
We hope that the next summit will provide the opportunity to gauge the effectiveness of the new strategy more rapidly and without too much delay, in order to confirm the suitability of the objectives and achievements.
(PT) This summit took place because the Portuguese Presidency insisted and the African Union took a gamble.
Those in Europe who wanted to diminish the summit on the pretext of Robert Mugabe's presence in Lisbon have lost.
Yet those who receive the King of Saudi Arabia in London with all due pomp and circumstance have no place to talk about human rights.
At the same time as the summit, numerous civic actions denounced this duplicity of words and deeds, the duplicity of those who were missing but also of those who were there.
In Portugal, the summit allowed people to talk about Africa and its problems and only for this reason was it worth the effort.
However, those who have listened to the Presidency and the Commission will believe that this was a genuinely historic event, a moment with a before and an after, which is clearly an exaggeration.
In fact, for the Portuguese, this was a kind of Luso-tropicalist provincialism, as apparent from the European press.
Progress was made: in fact, the main element of progress was that the African countries drew up their own agenda.
However, in all other respects, there was a gaping hole between the vanity of the words and the meagreness of the results.
This summit was better than the Cairo Summit, but that was hardly difficult!
What is difficult is to accept joint responsibility when starting from the fixed idea of economic partnership agreements.
(DE) Mr President, it is good that the EU-Africa Summit has taken place.
We see more clearly now.
We have a strategy and a first action plan. We in the European Parliament shall monitor their implementation closely.
As chairman of the delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament, I can tell you that we shall be doing that together with our African counterparts.
In the realm of good governance, we issued a joint statement at our parliamentary pre-summit meeting which included an expression of our conviction that measures to strengthen the capacity of African parliaments would enable those institutions, which had previously been overlooked, to make an effective contribution to good governance and to scrutiny of policy implementation.
To this end we need adequate resources to be earmarked in the specific programmes of the Commission and the Member States.
On human rights, we see Africans closing ranks whenever warranted criticism of conditions in specific countries is voiced in Europe.
Sporadic remarks from delegates dissociating themselves from Robert Mugabe's policies before the summit gave way to a united front at the summit itself.
My thanks go to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, for expressing herself clearly on Zimbabwe on behalf of all of us.
On the subject of economic partnership agreements, however, I believe we have a real problem.
It cannot be the aim of the EU to bring about the effective disintegration of the Southern African Development Community or the Southern African Customs Union by concluding interim agreements with some countries and not with others.
On this subject, President Mbeki argues objectively, whereas on the subject of Zimbabwe he tends to adopt a more partisan stance.
With regard to economic partnership agreements, I call on the Council to give the Commission a more flexible negotiating mandate so that unwanted effects like the interruption of trade flows for non-least-developed countries (non-LDCs) do not occur on 1 January simply because of the expiry of the present trade arrangements.
Yes, WTO-compatibility is essential, but it must also be possible to exercise a certain degree of creativity in order to achieve it.
Sometimes the stopwatch can be put on hold for a limited time.
All of our countries, after all, are WTO members too.
Mr President, as Michael Gahler said, clearly the Summit was somewhat overshadowed by the fact that there have been these acrimonious negotiations over economic partnership agreements (EPAs) and a relationship has indeed been soured by these negotiations, as much as the Commissioner and the Council have tried to work for a good partnership.
A number of heads of state raised their concerns, including the head of the African Union, Mr KonarÃ©, who said that the Commission was playing African regions one off against the other.
The General Affairs Council this week - rather disappointingly, for some of us - did not recommend the flexibility that many of us wanted to see, particularly towards the non-least-developed countries (non-LDCs), although, as I understand it, the UK and the Netherlands in particular were pressing for this to happen.
Still that sword of Damocles is poised over the heads of the non-LDCs and they face the consequences, both economic and social, and economic shocks which, for us, ought to be absolutely unthinkable.
There are still concerns that have not been addressed on EPAs, on development assistance, on rules of origin and on commitments on the impact of agricultural subsidies.
These are all things which the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states, in general, and Africa, in this case, were asking for.
It is not enough for the Commission to say that those of us who criticise EPAs are somehow in the pockets of the non-governmental organisations, that the ACP states are misinformed and misled by people and that it is only trying to comply with World Trade Organisation rules.
These kinds of argument really do not wash when we see the kind of dangerous situation the non-LDCs are in.
I want to say, finally, that our citizens in Europe will not accept any situation where, in 2008, any poor countries are worse off than they are at the moment, and we cannot stand and allow that to happen.
We urge the Commission to show flexibility.
(DE) Mr President, allow me to refer to some results of the summit which, I believe, reveal more than anything else the lack of a consistent development policy.
The good frameworks that were created for the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals and climate goals are being demolished again by the build-up of pressure in relation to the economic partnership agreement negotiations and, to an even greater extent, by an energy policy driven by the needs of the conglomerates.
Free trade agreements are to be wrung out of individual partners, which will ensure that even established regional economic areas in Africa are segmented once more.
In the field of energy policy, the only concern is to serve the interests of major European investors, and the drive to export nuclear plants to Africa is, in my view, a scandal.
On the subject of management of migration, you have once again made significant promises.
These, however, run counter to the draft directives on selective migration that Commissioner Frattini has presented.
I believe there is an urgent need to withdraw these drafts, otherwise mobility and freedom of movement between Europe and Africa will remain a pipe dream.
(FR) Madam President, Africa and Europe talked politics in Lisbon at the highest level, and this is very good news.
Having said that, I would like to be sure they are speaking the same language, and particularly on three major issues.
First of all, a partnership of equals.
Alpha KonarÃ© told the forum that Africa does not need either charity or paternalism.
The Lisbon Declaration confirms this: we will be setting up a partnership of equals.
Europe, however, has often treated this commitment rather lightly or Ã  la carte by imposing its own agenda whenever its interests were at stake: on terrorism, migration and, at the present time, economic partnership agreements.
Secondly, a partnership of peoples.
We also expect some action on this issue.
The new partnership must bring together civil societies much more systematically, and also the people's representatives, in other words the parliaments, especially by assisting with the capacities of African parliaments.
This is the message conveyed by the common statement made by the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament, and I hope this message will be heard.
Lastly, in relation to migration: Europeans and Africans had the chance in Lisbon to send a clear political signal which would have placed human rights centre stage in our partnership.
I truly believe that Lisbon was, regrettably, a missed opportunity.
The new strategy still places the emphasis on protecting borders rather than on the rights of migrants.
This means Europe can continue to flout the rights of migrants either here or there, for it has actually made very few commitments in its 'Migration, Mobility and Employment' action plan.
(PT) The EU-Africa Summit was held thanks to the diplomatic and political persistence of the Portuguese Presidency.
Europe has reported a success but it is doubtful that Africa will do the same, particularly those men and women fighting oppressive and kleptomaniac regimes.
They know that the majority of their representatives have absolutely no intention of abiding by what was legitimately agreed at the summit.
Future trialling of the joint strategy and the action plan adopted will be in the hands of the Portuguese Presidency.
As the terrible tragedies that Africa is facing in Darfur and Somalia were only briefly mentioned at the summit, we need to move on to practical measures.
When will European forces advance into Chad, as promised for last summer?
When will the EU take vigorous action against the Sudanese regime which is preventing the hybrid force mandated by the UN Security Council from protecting the civilian population in Darfur?
When will European troops or other contributions be sent in to make the invading Ethiopian troops withdraw from Somalia, as decided by the UN Security Council?
The organisation of summits does not justify allowing such urgent issues to be forgotten, as this calls into question the EU's credibility among millions of Africans and Europeans.
We need to demonstrate that the protection of lives in the Sudan, in Somalia, in East Congo and other countries in Africa counts for more than the signature of contracts in the tents of the criminal Gaddafi.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I am going to be frank as some Members have been, some more than others.
The EU-Africa Summit was a success.
Without the constraints of a written text, here are my comments.
I remember very well when, at the beginning of the Portuguese Presidency or in fact during the preparations for the Portuguese Presidency, we indicated that holding an EU-Africa Summit was one of our objectives, there were comments, doubts and sometimes even criticisms expressed about us setting this summit as one of our objectives.
Some said: 'Africa does not raise, among public opinion, society, Member States or the institutions, the necessary interest and commitment for a summit to be held: you, the Presidency, will be alone with very little support.
Africa is not on the international agenda and there is no interest'.
Others said: 'there are participative and organisational issues which will be difficult, if not insurmountable'.
We were discouraged from taking this idea forward.
However, the fact is that we managed to hold this summit, as we say in Portugal, 'against wind and sea', or in other words against all odds.
We managed this because we did have the support of many Member States which collaborated with us, with the Presidency, in preparing the texts and also in the direct negotiation of the texts with the African representatives.
We also had the support of the EU's institutions, the Commission and Parliament, to the annoyance of the critics and sceptics.
We also managed to resolve certain delicate and difficult diplomatic issues.
I would not presume to say whether or not this summit was historic: that is for the future to tell us.
However, there can be no doubt that this summit marks a new phase in the relationship between Europe and Africa and the fact that it was held was, in itself, a success.
As Commissioner Michel said, we did not avoid at this summit, in our comprehensive dialogue with Africa, the problems, difficulties and differences of opinion.
On the contrary!
We talked about the problems, the difficulties and what divides us.
We talked about trade, security, conflicts and violations of human rights, eye to eye, with frankness and with transparency.
However, the aim of the summit was obviously not to negotiate trade agreements - it was not the right place for that - and it was certainly not intended to immediately solve the problem of the Sudan.
It was also not intended to immediately solve, with a wave of our magic wand, the situation in Zimbabwe.
However, both sides together tackled these issues, discussed them, gave our opinions and, when there were differences, did not shy away from saying what these differences were.
The message conveyed by the European Union on all these issues was absolutely unequivocal.
