The establishment of the External Borders Agency in Warsaw should offer just such an opportunity, because education must be provided for the children of the officials employed there.
Institutions of this type will play an important part in promoting the idea of European integration amongst future generations.
Â Â  . As author of the report on tourism in Europe, I have followed MrÂ Cornilletâs work with interest.
I feel that we both work on the basis of the same opinion that tourism is an industry with the potential to revitalise societies, and that this should not be neglected.
Nevertheless, I believe that this report proposes measures that go beyond the Unionâs remit and harm private initiative, which lies at the heart of this industry.
The scope of the Cornillet report stretches even further â it cuts across our policies on development aid.
In this respect, tourism can make a significant contribution towards democratisation and political balance in these societies, as it promotes job creation, helps to develop new technology and contributes towards vocational training.
Yet it is through private initiatives that this process will develop and there is no doubt in my mind that we do not need regulatory or interventionist measures, which could prove counterproductive.
I therefore abstained in the vote on the Cornillet report.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the debate on major and neglected diseases in developing countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to wholeheartedly endorse the congratulations that greeted Mr Bowisâ report this morning.
I am sure that will come as no surprise to him, for he has presented a very even-handed and forward-looking report on an important subject, and I hope that it will receive the backing of an overwhelming majority in this House.
The subject of major and neglected diseases in developing countries has a considerable human rights dimension to it.
The rights to health and to access to medication are primarily social issues, for it is above all the developing countries that are affected by the neglected diseases, and in them, as so often, the poorest of the poor.
It is for that reason that I think it is a good thing that the Bowis Report explicitly puts these in the context of other political issues, such as, for example, the cancellation of the poorest countriesâ debts.
If these countries carry on spending 40% of their gross domestic product on servicing debts, then there will be no changes in the situation or in the health systems of the countries themselves, no matter how many resolutions we adopt in this House.
I am very glad to see that Mr Bowis devotes a large part of his report to the problem of HIV/AIDS, and, as usual, takes a very progressive line on them.
We must be tireless in making the point that the most important thing that can be done to combat HIV/AIDS is to prevent it, and the statement in the Bowis Report that 2004 saw new and extremely high levels of infection is an indication of a political situation of which this House has been critical for a long time, namely that there is too little funding and too little support to enable preventive measures to be properly implemented, and this criticism is primarily directed at the Bush administration in the United States.

I believe that it is wrong to approach this dogmatically, as if it were only a matter of principle, without looking at the reality of the developing countries.
I am grateful to Mr Bowis for enabling us in the European Parliament to join with the Commission in showing that the European Union is going down another road.
In all the statements, whether from the non-governmental organisation âMÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃšresâ or from the World Health Organisation, one point is underlined, and that is that we will not resolve the problem by relying on market forces; rather, we will get a grip on it only with massive public investment and a greater role for the public sector, not only in Europe but also in the developing countries that are affected.
I believe that this point is all too seldom made, while we very often hear demands for less public intervention.
If we are serious about wanting to resolve this problem, we need an affirmation to that effect, and I was very glad to hear the Commissioner speak today about how consideration is being given to concrete measures of support, which would also involve investment in fundamental research.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Bowis has indeed written an excellent report that deserves our all-out support.
I think that he is right to call for the extension of the Commissionâs campaigns against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to include other neglected diseases.
People seem insufficiently aware that diseases like African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and dengue form a major threat to the health of very many people in the poorest countries.
If medicines are available at all, they are either of very dubious quality or completely obsolete.
Virtually no research and development is being done into these neglected diseases.
The pharmaceutical industry is mainly interested if the sales are profitable and only invests if there are sufficient incentives.
Possible policy measures that could boost investments include tax credits, innovation rewards, pre-qualification assistance and commitments to the purchase of patent rights.
As rapporteur for the regulation that is intended to ensure the implementation of the WHO decision on intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and access to medicines, I hope that the Council and Parliament will reach agreement very quickly on a text that will make it possible for this important decision to be applied immediately in the 25 Member States.
Moreover, while the Commission and Member States must actively support the implementation of the Doha Declaration and oppose any measure taken by the WHO member states that could undermine these commitments, African leaders should also accept their responsibility in the fight against the major and neglected diseases.
It is important that they too should make health care a priority.
In this connection, it is irresponsible for certain African governments to levy a tax on the sale or import of medicines, putting these out of the reach of the poor.
The international community will, however, need to supplement the public and private investments at national level with long-term financial support.
We in the European Parliament must continue to press consistently for 35% of development aid to be spent on health and education.
Only in that way can we give renewed hope to tens of thousands of people who are still dying of diseases that could, and should, have been wiped out a long time ago.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ Bowis for his very constructive work, above all because he goes beyond well-known diseases such as AIDS, malaria and TB and deals with sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
These are forgotten diseases here in the West, but they make their presence all too sharply felt in the South, with millions of victims every year.
The tsunami brought peopleâs suffering to light, and aid flooded in.
If we can give these diseases a higher profile and mobilise the same resources, it will be possible to reduce the suffering of millions of people.
Yesterday, we voted on the need for paediatric medicine, and Parliament unfortunately accorded additional patent extensions worth many billions of euros to the pharmaceutical companies as compensation, so we need in all fairness to be able to find the mere EURÂ 3Â billion needed for devising treatments for these diseases that affect children and adults in the developing world.
TB and AIDS exist here in the West, so treatments do too.
These diseases mainly affect adults, however, and we do not have treatments suited to children.
Public funds need to be invested in this area, for the children of the developing world have no way of financing their medical needs themselves.
The money may, for example, come from a 1% tax on the profits of pharmaceutical companies that has to be paid when they have found cures.
There are many other solutions.
It is our shared responsibility to ensure that resources for combating these diseases are created immediately.
How developed a civilisation is may be judged on the basis of how it deals with its most vulnerable members.
The worldâs most vulnerable group consists precisely of these poor and sick children.
If we cannot even help them, humanitarianism has gone out of the window, and we should return to the caves.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to make a few comments on the report on behalf of our colleague, Mr MaÅ¡tÃ¡lka, who, due to urgent duties in the Czech Republic, could not attend this part-session.
First, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Bowis, on his report. It is a well-balanced, well-written and well-presented report.
Secondly, we are talking about a problem that directly or indirectly affects three-quarters of the world's population, and its possible solutions.
This means that immediate practical steps need to be taken and financial and other help provided.
Third, these diseases require a complex approach.
Cooperation is needed between international organisations, NGOs and the private sector, as well as dedicated individuals such as researchers and petitioners.
For maximum effectiveness, there needs to be complete dedication, attention and support, both financially and in the form of know-how and experts from the industrialised countries, and close cooperation with developing nations, based on partnership.
Fourth, the problem of neglected major diseases cannot only be associated with poor developing countries.
Some of the European Union's neighbouring states are not considered developing countries and yet their epidemiological situations and possible solutions are similar in nature to those in the developing world.
Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as Russia, have serious problems with HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and other diseases.
We should include them in our debate and when considering financial and other forms of aid.
My fifth point is that, although we have discussed the threat of bioterrorism in our committees and at our part-sessions, I wonder whether we are prepared for the inevitable spread of some of the diseases mentioned in this report.
There are often disaster scenarios that link the spread of some tropical diseases and their mutations to global warming.
There are even warnings that some diseases such as malaria might affect our continent.
Do we want to wait until our lives are directly affected before we act?
People in the developing world are human beings too and it is our duty to help protect them.
We should not narrow down the issues presented in this report to the accessibility of drugs and cures for diseases, but should also take into account the situation of those less fortunate than ourselves.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, although poverty-related diseases claim many victims, it is still the case that not enough attention is being given to HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and various other diseases.
In some cases, there are insufficient safe and effective medicines available and if they are, their price often renders them unaffordable to the sick.
The Bowis report underlines that as a result of this, it is virtually only poor people who are affected because there are no profitable markets for the medicines.
Moreover, as we have seen in the cases of tuberculosis and malaria, renewed outbreaks of the diseases can be traced back to the lack of sufficient investment in research and development.
If this is to change, there must be joint efforts at international level.
This illustrates the importance of the dynamic approach for which the Bowis report presses.
Although some diseases are not given enough attention in the developing countries themselves, it would be useful if there were initiatives in Europe that could support the control of them.
The example that springs to mind is leprosy.
Should the report not have devoted more attention to this disease?
Has the Commission already launched various initiatives in order to combat leprosy?
One of the points made in the Bowis report is that we should ensure that the EUâs approach, in cooperation with the Member States, is realistic and readily understood.
If, however, we argue in favour of obligations on the part of governments and industry that are imposed by the international community, there is relatively little hope of concrete improvements on the ground.
Health is not enforceable but is a result of improving care that is supported locally by the people.
Finally, it is important to have an understanding of the issue as a whole.
Despite a strong link between disease and poverty, it is unwise to mistake the control of specific diseases for the objective of poverty reduction in general.
Understanding is of crucial importance for parliamentary control in terms of the nature of the policy measures and their efficacy.
I would like to thank Mr Bowis once again for his stimulating report.
Â Â  â IÂ would like to thank Mr Bowis for his important report, to which IÂ also proposed several changes and amendments, most of them accepted by the committee.
IÂ would like to also thank Mr Bowis for accepting these remarks.
IÂ agree with him that aid to developing countries and resolving this problem is aÂ complex issue, but if such aid is to be effective, it needs to be comprehensive and target-oriented.
This means not only the need for meticulous statistical calculations of the types of disease and their morbidity, together with their expected rates of spread, but also proposed solutions as set out in his report.
The diseases at issue are those which, if ignored at the outset as it was the case, for instance, with HIV infections, may spread throughout the world.
The fact that we have taken the lesson was evident in the rapid and effective reaction to SARS and bird flu.
We in Europe cannot afford to sleep quietly, reassured by the fact that we have resolved the problem of tuberculosis thanks to the availability of drugs and diagnostic capabilities that allow us to effectively prevent the disease, when we know that countless children in Africa are dying of the disease every day.
When IÂ spoke of comprehensive aid, IÂ also had in mind the supply of drinking water in developing countries, since its shortage directly contributes to the emergence and spread of certain diseases.
IÂ also had in mind educational programmes for children and young people concerning, for example, the issue of reproductive health, sex education and hygiene.
Within the framework of this aid it is also important to provide guarantees, including financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies that stopped manufacturing certain drugs for tackling diseases of poor people, since there was no one to pay for them.
Last but not least, it is necessary to ensure better conditions, in particular safety, for health workers who provide assistance in these regions.
Â Â  Mr President, I fully endorse this excellent report by the rapporteur MrÂ Bowis, but I feel that little justice can be done to the topic of major neglected diseases in developing countries in just two minutes.
1.8 million people died in 2002 from tuberculosis alone; 2.2 billion are at risk of malaria, which is preventable and curable provided that sufficient ACT or the new combination therapy is made available; 39.4 million people are living with the HIV virus, and last year alone 3.1 million died from AIDS, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.
Only 700Â 000 of the 6 million who needed antiretrovirals could access that treatment.
The huge human, social and economic fall-out from this is incalculable.
60 million people, again in sub-Saharan Africa, are at risk from sleeping sickness via the tsetse fly.
2Â 500Â million people â two-fifths of the world's population â are at risk from dengue, another mosquito-borne infection, which is now endemic in 100 countries, with no specific treatment or even a vaccine yet.
There is no specific treatment or vaccine available yet for the ravages of Ebola, which has hit the headlines in recent years in these parts and which has killed 1Â 200 since the virus was first discovered.
The list of neglected diseases continues.
We could also add, as our rapporteur does, the 121Â million people living with depression.
Nearly 9% of men worldwide and nearly 10% of women have a depressive episode each year.
873Â 000 people commit suicide, and that is probably underestimated.
50Â million live with epilepsy, over 80% of them in the developing world; 24Â million live with schizophrenia; 37Â million live with dementia, mainly Alzheimer's and, with an ageing population, this is increasing all the time.
In conclusion, we have listed the problems, but what are the causes?
Lack of clean water, lack of sanitation, lack of essential drugs, the cost of essential drugs, drug resistance issues, ineffective pesticides and drugs, drug toxicity, but above all, the main cause is the lack of political will in the developed world to do something about it.
Our response to the SARS pandemic shows what we can do if we make communicable diseases a priority.
This led to the establishment of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and, as our excellent rapporteur says, we urgently need the same dynamic approach to deal with the other major global diseases.
Mr Bowis led us in relation to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and he leads us here in this report.
Thank you, John, you have done an excellent job.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to take my turn to thank and congratulate my honourable friend John Bowis for the highly comprehensive report which he has presented to us.
Our debate today is particularly topical in the run-up to the major UN General Assembly debate on the millennium development goals.
However, it is also topical owing to the problem created by the emergence of avian influenza and the risks created by its transmission to Europe.
That is why I call on Commissioner Michel to activate all the necessary mechanisms and to take all the precautions needed to protect public health in Europe.
Every day we see a dramatic increase in diseases in developing countries, especially on the African continent.
This situation is an insult to mankind and imposes on the international community, on the UN and on the European Union, the need for global action which will go beyond bombastic pronouncements and will immediately create and implement an integrated strategy.
The increase in diseases is the result of the dramatic economic and social situation in which people live in developing countries.
At the meeting of Heads of State or Government in New York, when the millennium goals will be examined, pretty words and wishes may be superfluous, but one thing is certain: none of the goals set will be achieved, especially goal no. 6 on halting and beginning to reverse the spread of AIDS.
International commitments and undertakings are not being kept.
Despite the undertaking by G8 to write off the debts of the poorest developing countries, no progress has been made to date.
Despite commitments on the integration into national legislation of WTO agreements on intellectual property rights, which help poorer countries import cheaper drugs, no progress has been made.
Even European countries are delaying ratification and I call on the European Commission to exert all the necessary pressure in this direction.
The European Commission must also, within the framework of humanitarian aid, demonstrate particular interest in the granting of bursaries to developing countries for the medical and nursing professions.
Finally, I should like to comment on a particularly important problem, the problem of the increase in mental and neurological illnesses in conflict and war zones.
I refer in particular to the case of Palestine, where Israeli occupation, the blockade of the occupied territories, poverty and imprisonment have dramatically increased the proportion of mental illness, especially among young people and women. The European Commission should address the problem by financing treatment programmes in cooperation with the World Health Organisation.
Poverty and the continuing spread of illnesses are the slavery of modern times.
We bear a huge responsibility.
A responsibility towards world peace, security and stability.
Thank you very much, and my warmest thanks and congratulations to Commissioner Michel, who is doing a very important job.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much welcome this report.
In recent years waiving or reducing royalties on drugs for poor countries has been championed by the EU and I urge us not to be fainthearted in pressing for more concessions, whatever the complexity of the arguments, many of which I do not fully believe, and I say that as a European patent attorney, as well as a politician.
Only yesterday we voted measures to compensate for the cost of research for paediatric medicine.
Clearly, when market forces of themselves will not provide cost-effective research for drugs for our own children, it is not surprising that there are even fewer resources available for developing and poor countries.
For malaria and TB, which are already increasing in developed countries, there are several partnership research projects under way which include a pledge to make the eventual drugs affordable for developing countries.
One such project is being led by Oxford University.
It aims to produce a malaria vaccine and is being run in conjunction with an Oxford biotech company and a German pharmaceutical company.
A TB vaccine is being similarly investigated elsewhere by others.
As well as being preventative, vaccines are usually one-off treatments, something which is an additional benefit in environments and countries where drug storage and dosage regimes are hard to follow or supply routes are insecure.
But we have to recognise that, especially for lesser-known diseases, public funding will be essential and I believe that the EU should include this in its programmes.
I can support this report, as will many, simply from my heart and sense of humanity, but there are reasons to support it with your pockets, for with many of these diseases delay in action will come back to bite in other ways later.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all, as has been done previously, to congratulate my fellow Member, MrÂ Bowis, on his excellent report on major and neglected diseases, which is both comprehensive and balanced.
On the eve of the United Nations Summit in New York, where the Millennium Goals will be at the centre of debate, this report forms part of a highly topical subject area.
It is pointless to remind you that we already know that these goals will not be achieved in the timeframe that we had set ourselves and that they are about to be added to the list of promises broken by the rich nations.
As three out of eight of the principal Millennium Goals concern health care issues, the work of my fellow Member, MrÂ Bowis, should ensure there is a greater level of awareness of this reality.
In addition to showing the necessary awareness of the situation, I would like the European Parliament to deliver a strong and clear message to the Member States to revive the goals.
The health care issues that the poorest countries must face fuel the spiral of their under development.
The observation is simple; those who today have most need of treatments do not have access to them.
Why?
Either because they are expensive or because fundamental research and the development of research are inadequate, indeed non-existent, for certain major and neglected diseases.
Furthermore, when these drugs do exist and are affordable, the populations in some cases do not have access to them, as they are not adapted to the particular sanitation conditions in these countries.
The problem is more serious and of a structural nature; while the fundamental research is mainly carried out by the public sector, the development of these drugs is almost entirely in the hands of the private sector.
Without a guarantee of profits, the pharmaceutical industry has no interest at all in investing in the development of new molecules.
Any innovation is therefore dependent on obtaining highly profitable patents.
It is therefore practically impossible for populations with weak purchasing power, the vast majority of whom come from the countries targeted by the Millennium Goals, to obtain these drugs, which are vital nonetheless.
This logic also leads to prices being fixed at an artificially high level.
In the era of globalisation, ladies and gentlemen, the health of each person must be the responsibility of all.
As regards drugs, it is needs that must dictate our strategy for action to deal with the worldwide issue of health and development.
Furthermore, we must also encourage and support developing countries so that they might devote a minimum of 20% of their budgets to health care policies, policies of investment in research and development or policies for adapting intellectual property rules. These countriesâ financial resources are, therefore, insufficient on their own.
There can be no progress in todayâs world as regards the major challenge of health care without a shared commitment from the public authorities and the private sector.
The pharmaceutical industry must emerge from an exclusively profit-making mind-set and revise its commitments and its priorities, in particular in the research and development sector but also in the marketing sector.
As for the public authorities, they must lay down legal frameworks, set objectives and offer perspectives that guarantee the common good while respecting the interests of each person.
I therefore draw the attention of the Council and of the Commission to the need to take initiatives: to draft a new international treaty on research and development in medicine, to include within the seventh European Union Research Framework Programme a specific reference to research and development for neglected diseases, which would be guaranteed funding, to ensure that the Doha Declaration on compulsory licences is not challenged by bilateral trade agreements, and, finally, to encourage the swift entry into force of the Community regulation, currently being debated by Parliament and the Council, enabling the generic medicines industry to produce treatments that will prevent health care disasters with tragic repercussions for a large part of our planet.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one global megatrend is that people want to live, and keep their health, for longer, and this is also something of great concern to us in the European Union.
Parliament has decided, by an overwhelming majority, to double the funding for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
I hope that the Council will act in line with our decision and enable this Seventh Framework Programme to enter into force in the shortest possible time.
Along with doubling the budget, we also need to get the world of business involved, which, in the developing countries, means those small and medium-sized businesses that move to places where the only state structures present have to date proved themselves incapable of getting a grip on the problems.
It follows that we should promote localised production in small and medium-sized businesses, along with those small businessmen who really are familiar with the needs and aspirations of local people, and, above all, we should also focus our attention on the services they use, such as the water supply, which has already been mentioned today.
We should be promoting small businesses that would take responsibility for the local and regional water supply and have the right idea how to go about obtaining fresh drinking water, which is so much needed and sought after.
In the field of development aid, we should endeavour to give guarantees, support and loans to entrepreneurs who declare themselves willing to attend to the needs of the local people in a coordinated way and in a global context.
I think this would be a good use of resources and ask the Commissioner to consult with his fellow-Commissioner Mr Verheugen, for an initiative of this sort surely needs to be put centre stage.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr RÃŒbig said, people want to live longer and healthily.
The people in the developing countries, who are the subject of this debate, want to be allowed to live, and to live in a manner worthy of human beings.
As one might put it: âpoor, sick, unemployed, hopelessâ â in these countries the one state often leads to the other.
I regard this report as an eye-opener; it raises awareness, cries out and brings us face to face with diseases that we cannot even pronounce properly even if we have any idea how many millions of people suffer from them.
No sooner did avian flu pop up than we in Europe declared ourselves prepared for it.
Have we, in Europe, made preparations against infection with these diseases?
We have not.
Are we prepared and willing to help people fight these diseases in their own countries?
Not to any adequate extent.
I want, then, to put forward three proposals.
Here comes the first; under the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council, we resolved to raise Europeâs development aid payments to 0.7%.
We must, I think, as a matter of urgency, join together with the Member States in planning how much of that can be spent on combating disease and on the health sector, with due regard for poverty, work and health.
Secondly, we should increase the funding for research into them in Europe.
Thirdly, I ask that all organisations, such as the one I chair, that receive EU funds in connection with development policy, should be invited to a conference at which we could consider how, together, we might be more effectively active in these fields in the developing countries.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to pay tribute to the quality of the report presented to us.
I am in agreement with nearly all that has been said on this matter.
This comes at just the right moment today: two days ago, I was in fact at the rearmament conference, if I dare say so, of the Global Fund to fight against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
There, I specificallyannounced a number of measures I intended to take, in particular to boost the research into diseases that are endemic in developing countries and poor countries and that, unfortunately, do not always interest the pharmaceutical industry, on the grounds of poor cost-effectiveness.
I am therefore more or less in agreement in saying that the public authorities and the Member States must obviously become more involved in these policies.
I also announced a number of measures to encourage health professionals living in Europe or elsewhere, and who are part of the diaspora, to return to their countries.
We could implement a number of incentives to this end.
I will not conceal the fact that I am increasingly tempted to propose a progressive plan to you shortly in order systematically to increase the proportion of our budgets devoted to education and health care, either in the tenth EDF, or in the forthcoming budget, since this issue has still not been resolved.
In actual fact, I increasingly believe that education and health care are of the utmost importance.
Even though we must, of course, urgently respond to a series of difficulties and harness the resources to do this, we must reflect seriously on a real â I would say almost systematic â strategy in the areas of education and health care.
I have heard people talk about a figure of 20%, indeed 35%.
I believe that it is perhaps difficult to envisage 35% for the moment, but we could certainly plan a gradual increase over several years of the resources invested in these two sectors.
I also believe, although I will no doubt come back to this point later on during the debate on the European Union policy and the debate on budgetary aid, that it would be advisable to open negotiations with the governments on sectoral aid.
This would also enable us, within a specific and coherent framework with minimum conditions, to encourage governments, as public authorities, to take charge of these priority sectors.
I have taken note of many ideas that also appear in this report.
I can assure you that I will draw a great deal of inspiration from them in order to carry out and propose policies to you in this area.
Like you, I am very alert to this area, and I wish to thank all of the speakers and the rapporteur for having made available to us this excellent tool, which is a source of inspiration and which I will be sure to use.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the New Italian Socialist Party and of the Committee on Development I wish to make the following remarks.
The health systems in developing countries are permanently in trouble: repaying and servicing the debt take up roughly 40% of GDP, while the resources allocated to education and health remain pitifully low.
In addition to the efforts made by individual countries, the international community must, in any case, agree to supplement those investments with adequate long-term financial support.
The hope is that the seventh framework programme, like the strategic Millennium Goals, will include a specific reference to research into the diseases that affect those countries and also allocate the appropriate funding.
It is an absurd and, in many respects, intolerable fact that, because there are no profitable markets, there is practically no research being conducted into those diseases that almost exclusively affect poor people in developing countries.
Such a situation needs to be put right quickly by means of a serious, tangible and prompt international commitment.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on famine in Niger (1).
Â Â  . â Mr President, we face a harsh reality: poor countries, especially the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, are hungry and rich countries are making promises.
Climate changes on the planet, as demonstrated in the case of New Orleans and with the prolonged drought and temperature increase in Africa, do most damage to underdeveloped countries and poor populations.
The leaders of the members of the UN due to meet in New York must realise at long last where their responsibilities lie and must move from pronouncements to specific actions.
The dramatic famine which the people of Africa are suffering imposes the need to plan global strategic aid, not belated mercy actions.
The objective set by G8, primarily to combat poverty and hunger in Africa, is linked to direct and bold decisions.
However, it is undermined by the very stance of its members.
A typical example is the continuing delay in actually writing off the debts of the poor countries.
The anarchic liberalisation of the international trade in agricultural products is widening the gap between developed and developing countries.
The global food crisis is now of a structural nature.
It is threatening stability and needs international structural intervention.
From this point of view, although humanitarian aid needs to be increased, it cannot answer Africa's serious problems.
The crisis in Niger has confirmed the serious deficit in the UN and the European Union of early warning and prevention mechanisms.
As the case of Niger demonstrates, this deficit is causing a huge increase in financing for ex-post humanitarian intervention.
Nonetheless, any strategy still based solely on generous international humanitarian aid â Mr Anan has called for a tenfold increase in the UN Assistance Fund â will not be effective in the long term unless the international community starts a 'green revolution' in Africa.
Far-reaching changes and reforms in the state, society, the economy and agricultural production are needed.
The European Union has important comparative advantages in Africa and must put the important decisions it took at the Council of Ministers on 24 May 2005 into practice.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, on 28 August, MrÂ Annan declared: âWe are all responsible for the famine in Niger.â
Must we do the same?
In actual fact, I myself sent a letter to you in April in which I questioned you about the threat of famine in Niger.
I also seize this opportunity to thank you for your response.
Yet there we have it, we always have to wait to see horrific images on our screens before we intervene.
Indeed, only in June, the government of Niger, which has long denied the scale of the crisis, refused the free distribution of emergency food rations, in order, it said, to avoid destabilising the market, when we know full well that the poorest people were unable to obtain and afford these reasonably priced, subsidised food products.
We therefore keep coming back to the same question: what are we doing for this dying, declining Africa?
Admittedly, the world has finally turned its attention to the fate of Niger.
Aid is finally there.
The donors realised that this crisis was a real famine, affecting a third of the population of Niger, or 3.6Â million people, which is a huge number.
What we can still call for in our resolution is for aid reserved for these populations to be equal to demand and, of course, to reach the most vulnerable people without exception.
Yet on that subject too, I am not telling you anything you do not already know.
I am referring in particular to the nomadic populations, for example, who are not necessarily on the lists of the World Food Programme and who have lost almost all of their livestock, which is itself also dying of hunger.
Consequently, a number of suicides have been recorded among the Fulani, a proud people who cannot bear to beg.
This famine also reminds us that we must conduct a real development aid policy.
Commissioner, I am very well aware that you can back up words with figures and actions.
Therefore, what sustainable development project is the Commission implementing for Niger?
For Africa?
What about support for agricultural exports?
All these questions will constantly be asked, but I believe that, one of these days, they really will have to be resolved at European Union level.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Although this item has the heading âFamine in Nigeriaâ in the Czech version of the agenda, I intend to discuss the situation in Niger, as stated in other versions of the agenda, including the French, German and English versions, and in the motions for resolutions that have been tabled.
One distinctive feature sets the African continent as a whole apart from Europe.
There is a constant stream of hundreds and thousands of people crossing the continentâs borders, which were only firmly established in the first half of the 20th century, and this phenomenon is entirely impossible to control.
Many people travel with their livestock and all their belongings, particularly in the Sahel region, to which Niger belongs, and this is whyÂ crises spread so rapidly between the various countries in this region.
A great many people who are familiar with Nigerâs abundant natural resources, such as the large deposits of uranium ore that are mined in the country, would be surprised to learn where the profits from these activities end up.
Measures to reduce corruption and to bring pressure to bear on the countryâs government to put budgetary resources to efficient use are therefore a logical and necessary first step.
There is no denying that the imposition of VAT on flour and milk could make things worse as far as food supplies are concerned.
The fundamental error, however, is the lack of support for modern agriculture, based on the construction of irrigation systems and water resources for the development of crop production.
The widespread practice of nomadic pastoralism, which is particularly common in the northern part of the country, leads to desertification and an escalation of the crisis over the years.
What is more, the fact that nomads travel across borders could result in the crisis spreading to other countries, in particular Mali and Burkina Faso.
Two decisions must therefore be taken without delay.
The first must be to address the immediate need for food aid, and the second to develop a broad-based programme for constructing irrigation and water resources.
An essential addition to this programme must be a system for teaching a sufficient number of farmers about rational agricultural practices, based on crop production methods that benefit the area in question.
In addition, trees must be planted in order to prevent desertification.
It is likely that the most difficult task will be to restrict the practice of pastoralism in areas that are most at risk.
Other countries in the region must also be involved in this programme, since we will otherwise be faced with an ever-increasing number of related problems as the desert spreads south.
Food supplies only provide a short-term solution to the problem, and a broader solution needs to be found in the long term.
Pressure to liberalise public services and to open markets up rapidly is quite clearly not what is needed, and could make the situation even more critical in the near future.
During the vote, we should therefore endeavour to adopt a resolution worded in such a way that it can act as the basis for a genuine resolution of the problems faced both by Niger and by the region as a whole.
Â Â  . Mr President, this motion reflects an anxiety, based on evidence from previous African famines, that dealing with the immediate crisis by flooding the country with foreign food aid might undercut local producers and increase poverty in the longer term.
However, there are ways of tackling this crisis which do not risk damaging the local economy.
The NGO Oxfam, for example, is operating income creation schemes so that people can afford to buy food.
Oxfam has reduced the number of weak animals by buying them at a fair price and slaughtering them.
It is also using voucher-for-work schemes, covering activities such as the removal of animal carcasses, drying of slaughtered meat and reforestation.
The crisis in Niger this year is not exceptional; for many people, the hunger they now face is only a slight worsening of what they see every year.
Despite short rains and locust infestation, food production this year was in fact only 11Â % below the five-year average.
Therefore, the real question is not what caused the crisis this year, but what is causing endemic hunger and poverty.
The answer to that is complex; there are reports that, in the villages where women and children are starving, grain is lying in locked household stores, which women are forbidden by custom to enter.
We often talk about the importance of the role of women, but there can be no starker an example than this of the damage that occurs when women are powerless.
Only one in four girls attend primary school in Niger; if girls start to go to school then women will start to break into their own grain stores.
Finally, we in Europe are making the long-term problem worse because of our failure to take strong enough action on climate change.
All the agricultural improvement programmes ever invented will be useless if the desertification of the Sahel continues.
Overgrazing and deforestation are factors, but so is the rise in the world's temperature.
So let us have some joined-up thinking here in the European Parliament.
Next time we are discussing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, let us remember marginal lands and famine in Africa.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should like to start by quoting the words of James Morris of the World Food Programme. He said, 'Niger has sent us a message in the whimpers of children too malnourished to cry for help'.
He also said, 'Sadly, the spotlight has already shifted and donations have again dried up.'
That is the problem.
2.7 million people in Niger are in urgent need of food aid.
There is growing concern that, while food aid distribution continues across the worst affected parts of the country, financial support for emergency operations is tailing off.
In the second half of August the WFP only received two donations.
Funding for its emergency operation is still under 50% and $29.6 million are still needed to deliver the aid required.
A food crisis is complex. Weather patterns, food production, markets, technologies, sanitation, health care, education and child-rearing practices have all played their role.
Last year's drought coupled with the invasion of locusts, followed by drought this year, have combined with an increase in food prices, which have tripled in rural areas and doubled in cities, partly as a result of demand from neighbouring countries such as Nigeria.
We share the view of the MSF, which has been critical of the slow response, first by the Government of Niger and then by the UN.
The WFP only expects to deliver food rations to 110 000 people, 10% of the worst-affected area's 1.2 million.
The concern is that the food distribution is not reaching those in the greatest need, especially children under five, and the food being distributed is not appropriate for the young children and infants who are the main victims of this current epidemic.
We are concerned, too, that the crisis will spread to the other countries in the region.
The wider Sahel and northern areas of Mali are already suffering and in Burkina Faso farmers have already lost up to 90% of their harvest and are having to sell their cattle to raise money for basic foods.
We need urgent action and we need it now.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I echo the comments made by my Group colleague, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, in questioning the Commission's action in this area, but we must also play our part in this House.
The situation in Niger almost defies description â a country of 12 million people afflicted on a regular, ongoing basis by all manner of natural disasters, compounded by domestic error and international indifference until it is too late, and by incoherence on an ongoing basis.
It was hoped that the G8 Summit, which we in Scotland hosted, would take some brave steps towards providing an ongoing framework, perhaps giving the Commission a lead for ongoing, coherent, constructive engagement with countries like Niger.
We were sorely disappointed, but at least the debt relief announced was a step forward.
It is our role in this House to monitor that those words are actually turned into action.
Perhaps we can discuss that at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which â I am delighted to say â will be coming to Edinburgh in November.
We in this House must play our part in providing a coherent framework and I look forward to working with the Commission on that basis.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, todayâs debate highlights one of the many tragedies of our contemporary world. Ours is a world in which it has been calculated that a child dies of starvation every seven minutes, despite the great advances made in technology, research, production and new techniques.
No one present here today can even begin to imagine the agony of those dying of starvation, nor can we understand the plight of adults and children reduced to abject poverty.
Niger is not the only place where this is happening.
Other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and indeed elsewhere in the world are similarly afflicted.
Niger itself is currently suffering from drought and a plague of locusts.
As a result, five million people are starving, and over one million, including children, are in imminent danger of dying of starvation.
This should weigh heavily on all our consciences. In particular, it should weigh on the consciences of those governed solely by the profit motive, who resort to market principles restricting food production, with scant regard for inalienable human rights, human dignity and moral principles.
The much-heralded success stories propounded amongst other places from this House have become an indictment in the face of the globalisation of poverty and the threat posed to the peaceful coexistence of nations.
Debates like the one we are engaged in today will change nothing, nor will humanitarian aid handed out by the very rich G8 countries, for whom Africa seems to have become a priority.
Debt relief and a long-term development policy are required, and also a spirit of solidarity with countries in the developing world.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the food crisis that Niger is currently sustaining is intolerable.
It is intolerable because populations, and children in particular, are starving and are in vital need of aid.
Yet, the way in which this crisis has been exploited to criticise the slowness of the donors and to accuse them of failing to provide aid to people in danger, prompts me to make a handful of remarks aimed simply at presenting an objective analysis of the prevailing situation in Niger and at offering accurate information, at least with regard to European aid.
Niger is one of the poorest countries on the planet.
It forms part of the driest region of the Sahel, where the supply of food is always in the balance.
Security of the food supply in Niger is extremely fragile and there are recurring malnutrition problems.
The slightest climatic uncertainty, such as rain failures or indeed the destruction of crops by predators, be they birds or locusts, the slightest market price disruption immediately gives rise to food shortage problems.
People use up their stocks too soon, storehouses are empty from April and food products become scarce at the markets or are sold at soaring prices.
People have to wait until the following harvest in September or October, always assuming, of course, that there is a proper rainy season.
The crisis that we are currently facing is, however, more severe than in previous years.
The invasions of locusts at the end of the summer of 2004 and the poor rainfall in several areas of the Sahel, and particularly in certain regions of Niger, resulted in a very poor harvest.
As far back as September 2004, the Commission released EURÂ 25.5Â million for the anti-locust campaign in the most affected countries of the Sahel, that is to say Senegal, Chad, Mauritania, Mali and Niger, and funds have been allocated to the FAO (the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation).
As far back as February/March 2005, the warning signs of a difficult food shortage emerged in Niger.
There was a rapid increase in the price of grain, a drop in the price of livestock, a mass and premature transhumance of herds and a shortage of local food products at the markets.
In March, the Government of Niger, relying on information from the national agency for the prevention and management of food crises, broadly supported by the Commission, released money to buy 42Â 000 tonnes of grain resold cheaply, and distributed food in return for work requiring high-intensity labour.
For its part, the World Food Programme, intervening in support of the national agency, launched an appeal for a sum of EURÂ 2.3Â million, to which the Commission responded immediately with an allocation of EURÂ 1Â million.
At that time, no one, not the government, the WFP or the NGOs, were able, due to the lack of precise overall data, to assess whether it was a slightly more difficult crisis than in previous years or a serious food crisis.
The Commission consequently made contact with aid organisations to ascertain their analysis, and, above all, their plan, as we did not receive any request for funding at that time.
None of the NGOs, and none of the operating bodies with which we currently work, contacted us to make an appeal to us, as is usually the case, given that, as you know, the Commission itself does not participate in this type of intervention operation.
It was only at the end of May and beginning of June that the nutritional surveys carried out in certain areas of the country revealed the crisis underway.
It was then that the humanitarian partners appeared.
The Commission thus took two urgent decisions, through ECHO, to release a total amount of EURÂ 6.3Â million.
That is the chronology of events.
What is the situation today?
A recent ECHO evaluation mission concluded that nutritional requirements are today being met to a satisfactory degree, even though there is some delay in implementing the aid.
The Commission is obviously prepared to step up its aid if additional needs emerge.
At present, what is needed is effective coordination between the partners on the ground to enable them to target areas successfully and to speed up the aid.
The European Commission has also released EURÂ 2Â million for Mali, EURÂ 4.6Â million for Eritrea and EURÂ 4.5Â million for Ethiopia, countries that have also been affected by food and nutrition crisis situations.
This crisis concerns us, and calls for us all to learn the lessons from it in full.
For my part, I can see two main lessons.
With regard to Niger first of all, it is crucial that, in addition to humanitarian efforts, a long-lasting solution be found to addressing the countryâs vulnerability, by enhancing the food security strategy.
That is precisely the policy that has been adopted by the Commission over many years in an attempt to respond to this crisis on a long-term basis.
I am mainly referring to irrigation projects, projects to build reservoirs and so forth, which benefit from Community funding.
Nigerâs national early warning systems and mechanisms for detecting food shortages must be supported and enhanced.
Rural development and market organisation programmes form part of this objective, as do school meals.
The Commission is Nigerâs principal donor.
The ninth EDF has enabled this country to benefit from a funding package of nearly EURÂ 400Â million, including EURÂ 60.6Â million for developing food security.
The budget heading âfood securityâ is devoting EURÂ 15Â million to a support programme (2004 to 2006) for the national agency for the prevention and management of food crises.
But for a handful of European countries, the Commission is, however, practically alone in helping this country.
The debates, which will begin next year, on allocations after the ninth EDF will without doubt take account of the lessons learnt from this food crisis.
Yet, it must be stated right now that, whatever the Commission may do for Niger, the challenge remains immense.
It will be difficult to rise to it without more substantial development aid from the entire international community.
Increasing the funding for development aid is, as you know, the Commissionâs priority, and that is the message we will deliver in New York.
Secondly, with regard to the response from the international aid organisations, I regret to observe that it could have been better coordinated and been the subject of greater coordination with the Government of Niger and among the aid organisations, be they NGOs or United Nations agencies, and whether at the warning and detection stage or at the stage of responding to the crisis and targeting needs.
The Commission is prepared to give its backing to an independent evaluation aimed at identifying the means for improving aid coordination in a similar situation.
I would like to say a word about donor action.
I confess to being troubled â I do not disguise the fact â by the remarks made by certain humanitarian organisations.
As a donor, the Commission could have acted more swiftly if, in the spring, it had discovered, there at the scene, the humanitarian organisations it had hoped to find.
I note, however, that, once the media machine snowballed, there was no longer any difficulty in finding partners prepared to come to Niger.
I have always paid tribute to the expertise and commitment of the humanitarian organisations that are our partners, but the remarks that I heard from a number of them about the food crises in Africa, whether in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa or South Africa, asserting that the problem was due to the inadequate donor response, surprised me.
It is pushing it, intellectually, to argue along those lines.
The food crises in Africa â as you are very well aware â are complex phenomena that are the result of several factors: the climate, demographics, the state of health of the populations â one only has to think, for example, of the disastrous effects of AIDS in southern Africa as a result of lower physical resistance â political governance and economic governance.
To claim that donor aid would be enough to prevent these crises does not appear to me to be entirely fair.
It is also, furthermore, a slightly paternalistic and moralistic attitude, which I reject.
Rest assured that the Commission will remain extremely vigilant, and I hope that, from now on, when we become aware of a problem and an appeal is made, we will find operator and partner organisations to enable us to work more swiftly.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on breaches of human rights in China, in particular as regards freedom of religion(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, religious freedom is a fundamental human right and an important indicator of the level of civilisation of a society.
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that religion has in some cases been exploited for political and economic gains.
Nor can it be denied that religious fanaticism has, in some cases, led to many extremist manifestations aimed at our democratic institutions.
In essence, the balance between religious freedom and adequate protection of the citizen is a very fine one and requires extreme wisdom in framing legislation, coupled with an honest determination to apply it correctly.
Not unexpectedly, such will is lacking in totalitarian states, where religion is perceived merely as a possible threat to the political stability of the ruling regimes.
This, it appears, is the case with China.
Recently, thanks to international pressure, the Chinese Government put into effect new regulations on religious affairs, but it is already abundantly evident that these changes do not go far enough and policies limiting religious freedom persist.
Numerous examples of persecution and harassment of religious groups and individuals in China are well documented and need not be mentioned here again.
We call on the Chinese Government to put a real end to religious repression in the country and, furthermore, to immediately release from detention and stop the prosecution of all individuals persecuted by the state authorities as a consequence of their religious beliefs and practices.
I urge you to support this joint motion for a resolution.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we should welcome the development of the relationship between the European Union and China in the areas of trade, economics, culture and politics.
China could become a strategic partner for the European Union in the effort to create a new world order.
It should be borne in mind, however, that a genuine partnership must be built on the foundation of shared values.
Our positive approach to China cannot overlook violations of human rights in the Peopleâs Republic of China, nor can it condone attacks on political and trade union freedoms.
We must never forget either that China is not a democracy.
In its resolution, the European Parliament highlights violations of fundamental human rights in China, notably concerning freedom of religion, and in particular as regards Christian churches and denominations.
We call on the Chinese authorities to put an end to strict controls, repression and persecution of religious groups, both Christian and others.
I have in mind also Tibetan Buddhism and Islam.
The Roman Catholic Church has largely been driven underground.
This is a cause of great concern for us, as is the situation of the Protestant churches.
In addition, we call for explanations of the fate of certain Roman Catholic bishops and missing priests.
We call for the release of Catholic priests and Protestant clergy who have been arrested and imprisoned, and for the release of all lay persons punished for their religious practices.
The Chinese authorities must undertake to guarantee compliance with ArticleÂ 36 of the Constitution of the Peopleâs Republic of China, which provides for freedom of religion in China.
I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the information provided by the organisation Reporters Without Borders, concerning the conviction of MrÂ Shi Tao, an Internet user.
On 30Â AprilÂ 2005 a court in Changsha sentenced him to 10Â yearsâ imprisonment for revealing State secrets.
MrÂ Shi Tao was a journalist working for the economic publication, and his crime was to publish on the Internet information contained in a confidential Central Propaganda Department document, forwarded to the editorial department prior to the 15thÂ anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
The action of the Yahoo Internet portal that revealed MrÂ Shi Taoâs details to the court should also be investigated.
Â Â  . Mr President, China is once again the subject of debate in this House, and I fear that this will not be the last time that we deal with this issue.
The growing relations between the European Union and China offer a great opportunity for both parties, and I would go as far as to say even for the world in general.
Nevertheless, these relations cannot be based solely on improving the commercial relations of each party.
If what the European Union wants is policy on China to be credible, it must demand much more clearly that it radically improve its policy on human rights.
The European Union-China dialogue on human rights is a good instrument for doing this, but I fear that it is clearly being underused.
There are various problems that China is not dealing with responsibly, given its role in the world, which is becoming increasingly interdependent: trade union freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom and also religious freedom.
I am one of those who advocate that governmental and public institutions should be secular in nature and that it is essential to ensure the separation of political and religious powers, but I also believe that true secularism must guarantee freedom of religious practice in the private sphere.
I am therefore concerned about the constant complaints from various groups concerning the difficulties they face practising their religion in China.
Just as I oppose a State providing special finance and support for a particular religion rather than others â a few days ago, for example, I condemned the fact that the Commission had dedicated so much money to the World Youth Days promoted by the Catholic Church â I do not believe it is acceptable for institutions to violate the individual right to religious freedom.
As such, this is a human rights issue that we must complain about and denounce.
In summary, in this Resolution we are calling on the Chinese authorities to put an immediate end to all religious repression, to ensure respect for international standards of human rights and to guarantee democracy, freedom of expression, association and the press, and also, as the Resolution states, religious freedom in all territory controlled by the Chinese authorities.
Â Â  . Mr President, present-day China is still being ruled by a party that is Communist in name but has not â and this is certainly true of its leadership â been Communist for many years.
These days, nothing matters except the pursuit of economic growth and export benefits on the world market, achieved by low wages, poor working conditions and the banning of independent trade unions, all of which is highly reminiscent of the dictatorial model which South Korea used in the past in order to become an industrialised nation.
Whether the large majority of the people will gain any benefits from this will not be evident until a few decades down the line.
Meanwhile, a society has been created with large discrepancies between the people in terms of power and income and with major disregard for nature, landscape and the environment.
It is a far cry from the protection of man and the environment that we Socialists hold dear.
Although the Chinese leaders are no longer Communists, they have unfortunately retained the worst features of the Communist state tradition.
They do not tolerate independent organisations and other centres of power alongside them.
People can adhere to a faith, but are not allowed to organise themselves to any serious degree.
The leadership fears that independent churches could become a source of opposition, and so, in line with a combination of atheist tradition and power politics, it is the government that decides which faiths shall be permitted and under what circumstances.
It is a matter of general knowledge that it is not the official Catholic Church that is allowed, but a nationally controlled variant.
Less well known is the fact that the Jewish faith â which, before the revolution of 1949, had a large following, particularly in the large cities along the East coast â is completely banned.
We should not give this China the opportunity to threaten neighbouring countries or clamp down on domestic opposition.
It should therefore go without saying that the arms embargo should be enforced.
Under no circumstances should EU Member States be allowed to sell arms to China.
Any attempt to lift the arms embargo would be reprehensible.
It would not be in anybodyâs interest to launch a new costly arms race and incite new threats.
That is exactly why Europe, too, should press for disarmament.
Â Â  . Mr President, while I congratulate Mr Meijer on his excellent and very precise speech, I have to say that I was amazed to hear what some Members said earlier on.
No wonder Christians are so brutally deprived of their rights and persecuted as they currently are when we consider how some of Europeâs leadership class behave.
Even in this House, there are those who, when they speak, cannot bring themselves to denounce the violations of Christiansâ human rights in China unless they have prefaced them with expressions of hostility to the Church that have nothing whatever to do with this issue, and who, in a debate devoted to the fundamental rights of victims of persecution, cannot refrain from indulging in criticism of World Youth Day.
While there is of course no Christian monopoly in this European Union of ours, and quite rightly not, 85% of the EUâs inhabitants are Christian, 56% being Catholics. These people, too, have a right to appropriate political representation.
Who is supposed to speak up, not only for the persecuted and tiny Christian minorities in China, but also for that countryâs Jews, Muslims and Buddhists, if we do not?
The Islamic world takes up the cause of their brothers and sisters of the Muslim faith who are persecuted in places such as China; it is only we Europeans who have to keep on downplaying these violations of human rights or adopting a critical attitude.
In so doing, we make ourselves complicit in them.
Seeing the pictures of Mr Blair at the EU/China summit reminds me of how it was he who told us that the EU was for him more than a free trade zone.
I see no evidence of that being so, for, if he really did regard it as a community of values, he would adopt a foreign policy that focused on human rights â including these human rights â even in his dealings with a large country such as China.
The same can be said of Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, to whose solitary attempt at relaxing the arms embargo we have, thank God, put a stop.
We need a unity that transcends party boundaries if we are to speak out clearly, even to a large country such as China, in the cause of human rights and religious freedom.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to quote a brief, revealing excerpt from a letter by an anonymous Chinese Protestant: âI am really looking forward to receiving spiritual foodâ, something which, according to him, is in short supply in the official Protestant church because the state keeps it on an ideological leash.
It is precisely this government violation of the freedom of religion in the Peopleâs Republic of China that has led to a growing stream of flourishing, non-registered Protestant house churches.
In the light of Chinaâs new rules in religious matters that took effect on 1 March this year, they are exposed to a wave of random government repression, including cruel disturbances of services, hefty fines, arrests, destruction of private houses and beatings or reprimands along the lines of âteachers cannot believe in Christianityâ.
What was particularly shocking was the account of the raid on 7 August this year on a Protestant house church in Shenyang province.
Among the thirty worshippers, there were some 10 women who were forced first to undress and then to pose naked.
Those who offered resistance were brutally beaten up.
During a recent inquiry into whether it is the central government or local authorities that are responsible for the violations of freedom of religion in China, a salient point came to light.
Some local authorities are sympathetic towards Christian fellow citizens and actively protect them on account of their loyal contribution to the local economic and social development.
This is a practical example that the Chinese central government would do well to follow, because after all, it always determines what exactly normal religious activities are, and it is those alone that are permitted by law.
Commissioner, I would ask you, your fellow-Commissioners, or else the Council, to explain in detail to the Chinese authorities this disturbing criterion for the fundamental right of freedom of religion.
What are normal religious activities?
More than anything, I hope that you and the Council will press for the release of all those who, whatever their beliefs, are imprisoned or suffer under the lack of freedom of religion in China.
Â Â  . Mr President, sadly, it is becoming traditional for us to devote Thursday afternoons to debating actions perpetrated by the Chinese authorities against their own people and against all others they have subjugated.
I would remind the House that we recently debated violations of human rights in Tibet.
The term violations of human rights is somewhat of a euphemism, when the actions actually being referred to include murder, imprisonment, mass disappearances, and when people are prevented from practising their religion and there is no question of freedom of any sort.
Let us call a spade a spade.
This should be termed criminal activity, not violations of human rights.
We have been observing events in China for the last 60Â years.
Those of us who hail from former Communist states know full well how Communist authorities tend to behave, regardless of whether they are ideologically committed to Communism or not.
That is immaterial.
I speak from personal experience, and still have a strong memory of the early years of Communism in Poland.
Quite simply, it is a case of a vicious Communist or post-Communist dictatorship.
Everyone is persecuted.
Believers in Islam, Buddhism, Jews ... all are hunted down.
As to those that are persecuted most cruelly ... well, perhaps not, because in Tibet Buddhists have been persecuted equally cruelly, but it should be said that Christians and especially Catholics are persecuted.
In particular, those Catholics are targeted who adhere to a fundamental principle of the Catholic Church, namely unity with the wider church, personified in the Pope.
Certain schisms have been encouraged, and a national church has come into being, though obviously this could never be recognised.
Things are getting worse, not better.
As stated in our resolution, the number of arrests is increasing. So too is the number of cases of torture, unexplained disappearances, detentions through the criminal system, and the number of isolation camps.
The very term âisolation campâ should make our blood run cold.
We Europeans are well aware of the horrors perpetrated under Nazi German and Communist Russian domination.
The European Union has had diplomatic relations with China for 30Â years.
There has been much talk of dialogue.
I wonder about the nature of this dialogue and what it involves.
It seems to mean this House adopting one resolution after another on Thursday afternoons when most Members are already on their way home.
At the same time, however, others who could have a significant influence on what might take place in China are presenting the case for a relaxation of the embargo.
France and Germany are doing so particularly eloquently, maintaining that the embargo is ineffective.
All this is happening in the context of a situation when we should be isolating China as much as possible.
This is not just about economics.
Above all, it is about moral principles.
The European Union should make it abundantly clear that there can be no deals or dialogue of any kind with China.
China deserves outright condemnation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, last week Tang Jaixuan, a former Foreign Minister of the Peopleâs Republic of China, said to the UNâs High Commissioner for Human Rights that every country should promote and protect human rights in its own way, and that there should be no outside interference in this respect.
We simply cannot go along with this view.
Respect for fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion, is not an internal Chinese concern.
It is a concern for all those who are not egotists or opportunists.
We should bear in mind that freedom of religion is also possible in non-democratic countries.
Czechs, Jews and people from the Netherlands emigrated to Poland in the 16th century not because our country was a democracy, but because all religions could be practised in complete freedom in Poland.
We should also remember, however, that there were and still are political systems that only recognise religious leaders of different persuasions if they support the theory that all authority is God-given, even the cruellest.
China should respect not only freedom of religion, but also the independence of churches and religious associations.
Secular authorities cannot be allowed to influence decisions on who might become a Catholic bishop, the 15th Dalai Lama or the 12th Panchen Lama.
Tibetan monks cannot be compelled to attend ideological training.
The 87-year-old Gongola Lama has stated that on training courses of that nature, instructors indoctrinate the monks on the nature of love for the common Chinese fatherland, and mould them into subservience to the law.
They also teach the monks that the Dalai Lama is a danger.
Certain monks are forced to sign a document stating that they no longer recognise the spiritual and political leadership of the Dalai Lama.
World history is full of accounts of repression for religious motives.
It is worth remembering, however, that such repression proved ineffective, even under the cruellest of regimes.
It will prove ineffective in China as well.
It does not matter if a person has their work or property taken away, is imprisoned, expelled, crucified or gassed.
Neither the Pope nor the Dalai Lama can call up any so-called divisions, because the source of religious strength is not to be found in believers or in the clergy, but in the very nature of religion itself.
For most religions, death is not a tragic end but the start of a new life.
Â Â  .
Mr President, religious freedom is a fundamental human right and, as a previous speaker said, the Chinese Constitution claims, at Article 36, to allow for freedom of religious belief, yet the rhetoric is not the reality.
One example given by Amnesty International was the case of ZhangÂ Rongliang, who was the leader of one of the largest house church networks in China.
He was detained in his village; the police searched every house in that village, confiscating any Christian material; his wife and child have been in hiding; he has been imprisoned five times for a total of 12 years, during which time he was severely tortured.
This House has also raised the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, the Tibetan monk, who was sentenced to death by the Chinese authorities in an unfair trial.
He is now in prison for life, but no one knows where he is being held, and his family would like to know.
Until China deals seriously with religious freedom, we will have to highlight human rights abuses in this House.
We have to speak up for those who do not have the freedom to speak for themselves.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an established fact that China is well known for its scant regard for human rights.
Any further emphasis would be euphemistic.
Ladies and gentlemen, what is lacking in this Parliamentâs resolutions â including cross-party resolutions like this one â is a little intellectual honesty.
Paragraph 3, which asks that it should be made clear to the Chinese authorities that a genuine partnership can only develop when shared values are fully respected and put into practice, ends up being hypocritical.
The resolution then becomes ridiculous when, after listing a lamentable series of breaches and making the usual demands, it welcomes the fact of having a EU-China human rights structured dialogue.
Not a word of serious condemnation, let alone any suggestion of sanctions.
Associating oneself with this resolution would be to make oneself a laughing-stock and morally complicit with the most violent combination of free-market and communist ideas that has ever occurred.
I urge my fellow Members not to vote for this resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Peopleâs Republic of China is not complying with the principle of respect for the fundamental human rights of the individual.
For many years now, Communist China had been failing to meet the most basic universal standards and requirements concerning freedom of expression, thought, action and creation.
At the most recent EU-China Ministerial meeting in MayÂ 2005, the Union expressed its concern with regard to four aspects of human rights.
In particular, it called for those still imprisoned further to the 1989 pro-democracy movement to be released, for censorship of the media to be reduced, for the âre-education through workâ system to be reformed, and for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
We ought also to be calling for an end to repression of the Roman Catholic Church. The latter is not recognised by the regime.
Over 126 families lost loved ones in the 1989Â Tiananmen Square massacre, and the circumstances surrounding that event remain unclear.
According to Amnesty International by the end of last year alone over 50 persons were imprisoned for publishing on the Internet information that could be damaging to the authorities.
Amnesty International has also reported that 3Â 400 people were executed and over 6Â 000 sentenced to death in 2004 in China.
These statistics are truly alarming.
The Chinese Government is mercilessly exterminating the people of Tibet.
It is resorting to false accusations of law-breaking, fixing the outcome of trials in advance and organising mass deportations of Tibetans from areas subsequently resettled with ethnic Chinese.
Over 100Â Tibetan religious leaders are being held in Chinese prisons on charges of subversive activity.
The world is standing idly by as one of the oldest and most important cultures of all times vanishes before its very eyes.
How many more tragedies and statistics will it take for the world to start taking notice of the violations of human rights being perpetrated in China?
Diplomacy will fail to produce the desired outcome.
The Union must rise to an enormous challenge.
Its action will determine whether China will manage to take specific measures in response to the calls for it to change its policy towards its own people.
Â Â  Mr President, China is a great nation and has been a great civilisation, but its name and standing are diminished by its human rights abuses.
I want the Chinese to listen to the words of my colleagues and to this resolution on religious freedom.
I want them to release the Catholics and Christians in prison.
I want them to bring justice to the Muslims, the Uigurs in Xinjiang.
I want them to bring justice to the Tibetans and withdraw their threat of imposing their Panchen Lama.
I want them to stop the abuse of psychiatry.
I want them to listen to the voice of Miss Fen Yang, arrested when visiting friends and sentenced without trial to two years in a female labour camp, where she is abused and brainwashed.
I want them to listen to the mother of Wang Nan, who died in Tiananmen Square.
Her mother was arrested for receiving a parcel of T-shirts.
Those are the abuses that we cannot tolerate.
Only if China listens, acts and puts an end to these abuses will it earn and deserve our respect.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to reply on behalf of my fellow Member, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner.
Although significant progress has been made on human rights issues in China over recent years, in particular in the area of economic and social rights, the European Union remains concerned by the overall human rights situation in the country and, more specifically, by the restrictions on civil and political rights that have been enforced.
Respect for human rights is, in fact, a crucial component of the European Unionâs external policy.
The European Union has regularly raised this issue with the Chinese authorities in a frank and open manner, both through political dialogue â including at the top level, as was recently the case during the last bilateral summit held in Beijing on 5 September â and through the bilateral dialogue specifically devoted to human rights.
In the framework of the European-Chinese dialogue, the issue of freedom of belief, religion, expression and association has always been one of the main priorities of the European Union.
The Union, in particular, has continually expressed its deep concern regarding the situation of individuals who have been persecuted or stripped of their fundamental rights for having openly practised their faith, no matter, moreover, what their religion or belief.
A number of imprisoned religious figures mentioned by Members of this House appear on the list of individual cases that the Union systematically sends to its Chinese negotiating partners in the framework of the human rights dialogue.
Furthermore, the European Union has, on several occasions, officially approached the Chinese authorities through its representatives in Beijing. TenzinÂ DelegÂ Rinpoche and PastorÂ ZhangÂ Rongliang â to mention some recent examples â are among those on whom these actions have been focused.
The abolition of the death penalty, or at least the introduction of a moratorium on its application, Chinaâs swift ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and cooperation with the United Nationsâ mechanisms also feature among the priority issues regularly addressed with the Chinese authorities.
In the latter case, the European Union specifically made calls, during the last session of the human rights dialogue held in Luxembourg on 24 and 25 February 2005, for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief to be able to travel to China as soon as possible.
The European Union undoubtedly intends to continue and develop the dialogue with Beijing in the area of human rights through seminars connected to these issues. Alongside the dialogue, these seminars also make it possible to raise the awareness of certain major players in Chinese civil society.
We hope that the next session of the specific dialogue on human rights, which will take place in Beijing on 24 and 25 October 2005, will enable significant progress to be made.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of this afternoonâs debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on political prisoners in Syria(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, this Parliament has dealt with the issue of human rights violations by Syria in the past, and there is no doubt that, following both European Union and international pressure, some improvements in the field of respect for human rights have been accomplished over recent years.
Unfortunately, however, these improvements do not go far enough.
The example of the continued imprisonment of two ill parliamentarians, Riad Seif and Mamoun al-Homsi, and the recent persecution of many civil activists, such as Hasan Zeino and Yassin al-Hamwi, are pertinent proof of that.
As is, indeed, the Syrian authorities' continued tactic of imposing obstacles on the registration and free operation of non-governmental human rights organisations in the country.
As well, of course, as the tactic of intimidating and harassing numerous Syrian human rights activists.
The Syrian Government must realise that this situation is unacceptable to the EU, and its continuation will no doubt hinder the accomplishment of a future EU-Syria Association Agreement.
We call upon the Syrian authorities, and especially the current President, Mr Bashar al-Assad, who has given hopeful signs of wanting to open up the Syrian political system, dominated for many years by the Ba'ath party, to proceed in a speedy and determined fashion in the much needed process of democratisation and reform of his country.
Such changes will not only earn him and his Government much respect abroad but, more importantly, they will greatly benefit the Syrian people.
Colleagues, I urge you to support this joint motion for a resolution.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, if we had to choose the subjects of our debates today, in relation to breaches of human rights, we would perhaps have chosen Tunisia, where human rights defenders were besieged yesterday by the Tunisian army.
The problem concerning Tunisia demonstrates in a general manner how seriously we treat human rights in our Association Agreements.
That is the reason why we wanted this resolution on Syria.
We want Syria to open up and become democratic.
For months now, we have been calling for cases involving political prisoners such as RiadÂ Seif and MamounÂ al-Homsi to be treated seriously.
MrsÂ Patrie and I, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the President of Parliament, MrÂ Borrell, sent letters in August calling for the release of these two political prisoners who have already served two thirds of their prison sentences.
They are former members of Parliament who are in a poor physical condition.
These letters have remained unanswered.
We want the forthcoming Association Agreement with Syria to clearly indicate that human rights are a condition on which we will not compromise.
We do not wish to isolate Syria.
It is a country that we consider to be a friendly country, which must become democratic and which we can assist. However, for the time being, we are keen to address the following message to the Syrian Government: now that it is time to reach a decision on this Association Agreement, please take this message seriously; do not think that, in every instance, we will have to table resolutions in order to finally start a constructive dialogue with Syria on human rights, in particular with the subcommittee on human rights that we are calling on you to set up.
Â Â  . Mr President, while we are in the midst of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, we must remember that respect for human rights is one of the cornerstones of Euro-Mediterranean Association and, in this context, the Resolution we are voting on today on the situation of political prisoners in Syria deserves special attention.
We would therefore call upon the Commission, the Council and the Member States to make it clear to the Syrian authorities that the agreement we are currently negotiating must include clear clauses on human rights, as established by the Euro-Mediterranean Association.
Furthermore, like Mrs De Keyser, we are calling for the establishment, within the context of the Association Agreement, of a sub-committee on human rights in relation to Syria, as has been done in the case of Jordan or Morocco, with a view to holding a structured dialogue on human rights and democracy.
This sub-committee would become a key element of the action plan.
Finally, we must once again insist on the importance of consulting and involving civil society in the work of this sub-committee, in order to better supervise the human rights situation.
Â Â  . Mr President, even before the era when power ended up in the hands of father and son al-Assad, Syria laboured under the belief that that country deserved to be much bigger and more powerful than it really is, and that it should include Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine and parts of Iraq.
Syria blames France and Great Britain for needlessly splitting up these regions, which they had won from Turkey in the First World War and for hence making impossible their return to the greater Syria that existed before the Ottoman Empire.
Over 40 years ago, the desire for greatness caused Syria to join with Egypt and Yemen in leading the attempt to create a United Arab Republic.
It was when this project failed and Syria also lost the Golan area in 1967 to Israel that the seeds of an authoritarian and militaristic regime were sown.
The regime is intolerant of ethnic minorities, of Christianity and of interpretations of Islam that deviate from the version propagated by the state.
It is also intolerant towards domestic opposition, distrustful of neighbouring countries and even more distrustful of great powers further away.
Over the years, violent acts by exiles from other countries have been supported from Syrian territory and it is also suspected that recent political assassinations in Lebanon were organised from Syria.
The European Union hopes to establish strong relations with all the states in its immediate surroundings, including all countries around the Mediterranean.
Indeed, if Turkey ever joins the European Union, Syria will become our immediate neighbour, as will Iraq.
My group thinks that it is not only economic or military considerations that should play a role as our relationship with Syria becomes even deeper.
The European Union must place more emphasis on the release of political prisoners, the right to opposition and the governmentâs democratisation.
How will the Commission do this?
Whilst we should appreciate the circumstances as a result of which Syria has ended up in this bad situation at present, we should not resign ourselves to this.
The democratisation of Syria now takes priority over closer trading relations.
The al-Assad familyâs criminal regime must not be rewarded for bad behaviour.
By taking this line, we will contribute to making Syria democratic, and the recognition of a Palestinian state will also have a part to play in this.
Â Â  . Mr President, Syria remains under President Bashar al-Assad, the sole Baathist regime left in the Arab world following the demise of Iraqi Baathism.
Since 1963, Syria has operated under a state of perpetual emergency, which is the legal basis for many of the repressive instruments imposed by the government and which it justifies on the grounds of the ongoing conflict with Israel following Syria's loss of the Golan Heights in 1967 and the struggle against Islamist terrorists who oppose the secular socialist state.
More recently, as Syria has pursued a more active engagement with the EU through participating in the Barcelona Process and signing a EuroMed association agreement, all areas of its domestic policy have been subject to intense international scrutiny, in particular its poor human rights track record and alleged holding of political prisoners, with deaths in custody and arbitrary arrests, the preventing of free assembly or of citizens from leaving the country, and, of course, the use of torture.
Matters have not been helped by Syria's lamentable behaviour in turning a blind eye to Islamist terrorists crossing into Iraq from its territory in spite of its own fight against Islamism, as well as its covert support to terrorist training for Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, in spite of its continuing denials of such support.
Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon under international pressure has been marred by the arrest of the pro-Syrian security chiefs in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, a fierce critic of the Syrian regime.
Syria remains a one-party state although there is talk of ending this state of affairs.
This resolution calls for clemency for a number of cases cited by Amnesty International and there can be no doubt that the plight of the stateless Kurds in Hassake and the discrimination against the still remaining small Jewish community are totally unacceptable.
As rapporteur on the European neighbourhood policy, I believe that it is nevertheless important to keep Syria engaged in dialogue with the EU and to encourage the process of democratisation and observation of fundamental human rights which Syria has signed up to in its international obligations - obligations which it must meet if it really wants to enjoy a beneficial EuroMed action plan in future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to follow on from MrÂ Tannockâs conclusion.
When President Bashir Assad succeeded his father in office, he was the focus of a great deal of hope.
Syrian Christians who know him well tell me that he, as a member of the Alawi minority himself, has a very tolerant attitude towards other faith communities, not least the Christians.
It is all the more disappointing that the Baath regimeâs brutal machinery of oppression is still operational, with the secret services at work in Lebanon, and the police in Syria itself.
I would like to emphasise that, as we have ties with Syria through the Mediterranean dialogue and the Mediterranean community, we have to apply particularly rigorous standards to it.
While we ought to support it in its desire to draw closer to the European Union, we cannot do so unless it upholds fundamental human rights and moves towards pluralism and democracy.
That such a thing can happen only step by step is obvious, but the process must be begun without delay, and we must send a clear message to that effect.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the UN was quite right to express concern about violations of human rights in Syria.
I fully support the European Parliamentâs motion for a resolution calling on the Syrian authorities to release political prisoners held in that country.
Their number includes several Syrian parliamentarians we consider to be our colleagues.
Syria must be persuaded to ratify the convention banning the torture of prisoners.
It is, however, difficult for me to support the proposal in the draft calling on Syria to guarantee that those arrested will be well treated.
After all, we know that this refers to political prisoners, so we ought really to be insisting that no political prisoners are ever taken, and not condoning the fact and politely asking Syria not to be too cruel to them.
It is essential for human rights and Syriaâs respect for them to be a when it comes to the Union entering into an Association Agreement with Syria.
It would be inconceivable for us to be associated with a country that held political prisoners and practised torture and other forms of anti-democratic repression, resulting in the persecution of religious minorities such as Jews or Christians.
Â Â  â Mr President, unfortunately the hopes cultivated even about the recent conference of the Ba'ath party in Syria have quickly been dashed.
The regime continues its anti-democratic methods and autocratic practices against any protestors.
President Assad appears to be too weak to overturn the autocratic, nepotistic and back-scratching regime which permeates the political system.
The two former members of parliament in prison whose immediate release we are calling for â together with an immediate end to all political prosecutions â are also victims of the accusation of nepotistic behaviour on the part of the regime.
However, I believe that it will be in the interests of the people of Syria and their rights for the European Union to sign and ratify the association agreement.
This will give us more tools to control and exert pressure, such as the human rights clause and structured political dialogue.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission fully participates in the European Unionâs efforts to support human rights in Syria.
On the basis of the principles outlined in the Barcelona Process Declaration, our goal is to establish a constructive human rights dialogue with the Syrian authorities.
In this context, the European Union troika has, in the past, taken steps following the arrests of opposition figures, including MrÂ Al-Turk, and the judgment on two parliamentarians, MrÂ al-Homsi and MrÂ RiadÂ Seif.
Very recently, the Commission conveyed to the Syrian Ambassador its grave concern regarding the detention of public figures and of members of Parliament and, more specifically, that of MrÂ al-Homsi and MrÂ Seif.
The European Commissionâs Delegation in Damascus is very closely monitoring the detention of these two political prisoners.
A short time ago, the Head of Delegation drew this situation to the attention of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, MrÂ Moallem.
The attempt to have MrÂ al-Homsi and MrÂ Seif released was a failure even though, under Syrian law, they could be granted early release after serving three quarters of their prison sentences.
The law, however, requires the two political prisoners to sign a declaration announcing that they will cease all future political activities detrimental to the Syrian State.
They refused to sign it.
From a Syrian point of view, therefore, nothing more can be done to release the prisoners.
We can also observe conflicting, yet positive, signs, which are perhaps the outcome of international pressure: consider, for example, the acquittal in June of this year of AkthamÂ Naisseh, a human rights activist.
However, the overall situation is, unfortunately, unsatisfactory, and the Commission will continue, in close cooperation with the Presidency and the Member States, to bring up other individual cases at every level of its contacts with the Syrian administration.
With regard to the Association Agreement negotiations, the Commission remains convinced that a human rights dialogue will be more effective in the framework of the contractual relations provided for in the Agreement.
This Agreement, including the provisions on free trade, cooperation and political dialogue, and with the clause on human rights and democracy as crucial components, will be an important instrument for opening up Syrian society and for making it more democratic.
As regards enhancing the MEDA programmes with the aim of supporting the development of a democratic society, the Commission, under the current national indicative programme with Syria, continues to have support for civil society as one of its priorities in the area of cooperation, and it hopes to continue along these lines thanks to future programmes.
Since it has been mentioned several times, I will say a word about the Association Agreement.
The Commission remains aware of the current political difficulties regarding the signing of the Agreement with Syria.
By arranging the military withdrawal from Lebanon, Syria has taken a first positive step towards implementing Resolution 1559 of the United Nations Security Council.
It is clear, however, that, owing to the current situation, that is to say the continued and visible presence of the Syrian secret service in Lebanon, as well as the lack of cooperation in Iraq, Syria absolutely must take strong and positive action in order to restore confidence and must do this before it considers any possible signing of the Agreement.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a few moments.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is an oral amendment to recital E: when talking about âRiad al-Hamood, civil society activistâ, it must be specified that âKurdishâ precedes âcivil society activistâ.
Â Â  That concludes the voting, and we shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of a report on major and neglected diseases in the developing countries.
We believe that disease and ill-health are dominant problems in these countries and that they are both causes and consequences of under-development.
However, we have our doubts about the EU expressing views on the way in which the pharmaceutical industry prices different products.
We also have our doubts about forcing the pharmaceutical industry to reinvest a portion of its profits in R[amp]D in relation to neglected diseases.
We should prefer to encourage the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily and for ethical and moral reasons to decide to re-invest a portion of its profits in research into diseases affecting poor countries.
This is in line with assuming responsibility for global development.
What should also be drawn attention to are the African governments that deduct sales or import tax on antiretroviral and other medicines. This leads to medicines becoming unavailable to many impecunious groups.
In those cases, the governments concerned must be strongly encouraged to abolish such taxes.
Â Â  The global fight against infectious diseases is a very important issue demanding extensive international commitment.
The June List is of the view that international cooperation should be practised within already established organisations, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), with skills and experience in this area.
The June List recommends limited EU cooperation.
We are critical of a situation in which the EU seeks influence and powers in relation to issues already being dealt with by existing international organisations.
Â Â  . As a result of the economic development and the improved quality of life in Europe, we have a number of responsibilities towards the rest of the international community.
Whilst one may subscribe to a worldview that sees free trade as one of the main keys to development, one must also bear in mind that there are certain areas that cannot simply be left to the whims of the market.
This is because, however global it may be, the market does not favour more worthwhile objectives.
That is not to discredit the market, but to point out that, inevitably, it does have its limitations.
In this context, we must not forget that certain diseases hamper the development of the worldâs poorest countries.
It is therefore essential that the EUâs development initiatives â the effectiveness of which is sometimes open to question â should involve combating these diseases, within the context of development aid as a whole.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 8Â September 2005.
Â Â  The first thing we should do today is welcome our Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues; I shall do so expressly in my speech to the House immediately following the adoption of the order of business.
For the moment, I can just say to them: and.
Â Â  The next item is the adoption of the order of business for the present part-session and the October I part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 22 September pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of our Rules of Procedure.
No amendments have been proposed.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, if my information is correct, that group alone â and not the Liberal Group, as I had been told at one point â requests that the debate on Tunisia be replaced by the issue of minorities in Voivodina.
Mr Watson confirms that.
All right, then it is just the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that has made the proposal.
Furthermore, the Group of the Socialist Party in the European Parliament has requested that it be the debate on Uzbekistan that should be replaced by âMinorities in Voivodinaâ.
Could you clarify this please, Mr Schulz?
Â Â  Mr President, what you have just described is what came out of the Conference of Presidents and the subsequent discussions between the groups.
A matter of minutes ago, though, in this House, Mr Watson, Mr Poettering and I had a brief discussion, and we agree that what we would recommend is that we consider Uzbekistan in the October part-session and now proceed to debate the situation in Vojvodina (), whilst adjourning discussion of Tunisia.
Â Â  In addition to Mr Cohn-Bendit, it would be good if everybody else could hear what we are discussing as well.
All right, we are talking about replacing the issue of Uzbekistan with Voivodina, on the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Is the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats maintaining its proposal?
Â Â  Mr President, our primary concern was to do a swap by taking Tunisia off the agenda and replacing it with Vojvodina, but, as we still see it as important that we should, in human rights matters such as these, achieve outcomes with which we can all agree, we propose to keep Tunisia on the agenda, while â as Mr Schulz said â debating Vojvodina instead of Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan will then be on the agenda for the next part-session, and we can be certain of getting a broad majority on that.
Let me say, for the benefit of the members of my own group, that the reasoning behind our motion was that we would thus ensure that Vojvodina is dealt with this week.
Â Â  You are therefore withdrawing your proposal.
No amendments have been proposed.
If you will allow me, I would like to use the speech I am to make next as an opportunity formally to welcome our colleagues.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we must offer a very warm welcome today to the observers from Bulgaria and Romania, who are already seated in our Parliament.
Their presence reminds us that, in May of last year, the fifth enlargement of the European Union was left incomplete while we waited for Romania and Bulgaria to complete their accession processes.
It is also good to remember that our Parliament gave its assent to the Treaty of Accession with these countries, which is being ratified by the Member States, and I believe that we are all now expecting their accession actually to take place on the scheduled date, 1 January 2007.
I am sure that we will all make every effort, that we will all do everything in our power, including Romania and Bulgaria, to make sure that this becomes a reality.
I would like to say today to our new colleagues that we eagerly await their contributions to our debates, and we wish them every success in their parliamentary work.
Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, the arrival of our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues comes at a particularly difficult time for the European Union.
On a day-to-day level, the institutions are functioning normally, nothing out of the ordinary is happening in the Unionâs everyday life; but the European project is suffering an identity crisis which we cannot ignore.
According to some people whom we have heard over recent days, the European Union could do without a vision of its future, and it would be sufficient for the Union simply to improve the functioning of its markets and to carry on enlarging.
For some people, that would be sufficient.
I believe, however, that the problem is more profound.
The problem relates to the political meaning of the European project and its geographical dimension.
Today, both aspects, the political meaning and the geographical dimension, are faced with deadlock and the European Parliament must make an enormous effort in order to help resolve it.
Our Institution must contribute in every possible way to resolving this situation.
Ladies and gentlemen, a little more than a year ago I explained to you the priorities for our parliamentary work.
Believe me, it would have been difficult for us to imagine back then, in September of last year, what our current circumstances would be.
It would have been difficult to imagine the situation we are in today.
I therefore believe that we should review what has happened this year and reconsider our objectives for the parliamentary year ahead of us.
Please allow me to ask you collectively which of the things we proposed a year ago have been achieved, and how we are going to approach the parliamentary year now beginning during this critical phase in European integration.
Also a year ago, we were joined by new Members.
A year ago we received our fellow Members from the 10 new Member States and at that point we asked ourselves, amidst the joy of reunification, whether we were going to be able to work together, to combine such different parliamentary cultures; whether we were going to be able to rise to the challenge, a challenge unique in the world, of working in twenty different languages, a number which still does not sufficiently reflect the Unionâs linguistic diversity.
I believe that one year later, an intense year in every respect, we can say that this challenge has been met and that the Unionâs enlarged Parliament is operating satisfactorily.
I would like to thank everybody for their contribution in this success.
Also a year ago, I told you that I was determined to resolve the complex and sensitive issue of the Statute of Members.
You will remember that everybody agreed that this was a priority, and I was very eager to try to find a solution to it.
Well, today we can say: mission accomplished.
Thanks to the invaluable contribution of the Luxembourg Presidency, in July the Council expressed its agreement with the text approved by Parliament, which I will sign next Wednesday.
This agreement is very important to our institution, since the absence of such an agreement had been poisoning our public image for a long time.
I would now like to point out to you that, with regard to our operational rules, we must set two objectives: the rules relating to parliamentary assistants and the reform of the financial regulation so that the Union can manage its resources more efficiently. There is broad consensus in this regard.
Without prejudice to good management, the Union needs a financial regulation that enables it to operate more efficiently.
We already have a draft that the Commission has communicated to us.
I propose that we set the objective that this new financial regulation should enter into force together with the 2007 budget.
A year ago too, we were preparing for the investiture of the new Commission and you will recall that that was a turbulent period.
I believe we can say today, however, that the European Parliament has gained in maturity, legitimacy, credibility and public visibility, and also that our cooperation with the Commission rests upon solid foundations.
Following that rocky investiture, we negotiated a framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission.
That agreement enables us to make considerable progress in the field of information and democratic control.
I am pleased about that too.
In application of the agreement, the Conference of Presidents will receive Mr Barroso in two daysâ time to hear about the proposals that the Commission has announced for this year directly from him.
A year ago too the tragic fate of the Beslan hostages overshadowed our plenary session.
At that time I insisted on the need to push ahead with the European area of security and justice, by actively promoting an anti-terrorist strategy.
A year on, however, and the barbarism of the terrorists is continuing.
London has been the latest victim on European soil, but Iraq is a victim every day.
Today the terrorist threat is greater and it will not disappear for the time being.
It will test European societyâs capacity to tackle it while respecting our democratic values.
The balance between freedom and security will therefore be a permanent element in our debate.
It was during the last part-session, when we heard Minister Clarke, and it will continue to be so in the future.
Furthermore, we are all aware that terrorism blurs the distinction between internal affairs and external policy and that today, whether we like it or not, it appears to be directly related to immigration problems.
We must therefore combat terrorism together with our neighbours and partners in the Islamic world, in particular in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to pause here for a moment to tell you that one of the great issues for the future of the European Union is its relationship with the Muslim world.
Perhaps the most important issue.
I propose that we make use of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which is now being chaired by the European Parliament, to develop this relationship in a positive manner, preventing the terrorist threat and the tensions created by immigration from leading to the Islamophobia that the terrorists would see as their greatest success.
A year ago I also spoke to you about two issues that were fundamental at that time and which today are even more important.
I am referring, as you know, to the Constitutional Treaty and the financial perspective.
In both cases, Parliament has done what we proposed doing.
With regard to the Constitutional Treaty, we hosted a great debate that ended with majority support for the Treaty.
Thirteen countries have ratified it, but the French and Dutch noes have led the Council, as you know, to establish a period of reflection, to which I will refer in a moment.
With regard to the financial perspective, we have been able to draw up an ambitious and reasonable report by means of an ad hoc committee that enabled us to coordinate all the relevant points of view.
As a result, our Parliament has a position of its own on the basis of which it can analyse those of the other institutions.
We know what we want and we have said it.
With regard to our position, we must assess those of the Commission, which we also know, and those of the Council, which we are awaiting, because the Council has not been able to reach an agreement.
I very much fear that that was not due to the problems of the Constitution, but to a worrying lack of Community spirit and an increasing devaluation of the idea of European solidarity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have come this far by following this path.
What more must we do from now on and how must we do it?
In my view, the most urgent and most important thing â at least the most urgent â is the financial perspective.
It would be good to remember that an agreement in the Council is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition if the Union is to have this multi-annual financial framework.
I have said this to members of the Council on several occasions: an agreement amongst you will be of no use unless it is acceptable to Parliament, because this is an interinstitutional agreement which involves the three Institutions.
I would take this opportunity to urge the Council to do its duty and to reach an agreement during the UK Presidency, because afterwards it will be too late, or much more complicated.
From the brilliant speech with which it began its term in office, it appeared that the UK Presidency had ideas for achieving an agreement on a better structure for Community spending.
The European Parliament would point out that it is urgent to turn these ideas into reality.
In the meantime, we must continue to work on the legislative programmes.
I am aware that drawing up these programmes without knowing what resources are allocated to each spending programme complicates our work, but it does not make it impossible.
I must inform you that the Commission and the Council have insisted that we continue to work on these legislative programmes, because they are essential to the implementation of the 2007 budget.
Over the coming days, the Conference of Presidents will have to decide how to do it and call upon the competent committees to act in a coordinated fashion in accordance with their guidelines.
Ladies and gentlemen â if I may speak more formally for a moment, while the British Prime Minister is here, and I thank him for his dedication to Parliament â the Union needs the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
However, something that it needs even more than that, something that is essential to the Union, is a budget that can be implemented from 1 January 2007.
Not to have one would be a serious problem.
From now on, therefore, we must anticipate the possibility that we may have to begin to draw up the 2007 annual budget before there is an agreement on the financial perspective.
That possibility exists.
From now on I would like to assure you that Parliament will do its duty, as laid down in the Treaties, in order to guarantee that, with or without a financial perspective, the Union has a budget that can be implemented for 2007.
It would be a novel situation, but if it arose we should face it in our proper democratic fashion.
Then we have the other great fundamental issue: the future of the Union and its relationship with the Constitutional Treaty.
As you know, the Council has agreed to a period of reflection until next spring; and that is what it is, a period of reflection.
It is not a pause, a word which you will note does not appear anywhere in the Councilâs conclusions. It did, but it is not in the final conclusions.
In fact, other countries have continued their ratification processes since that Council, including, by referendum, Luxembourg.
It is clear, however, that, while we reflect, for some time we are going to carry on working with what we have: the Treaty of Nice.
There is no crisis of day-to-day operation.
There is no legal vacuum.
That is an obvious thing to say, but in politics it sometimes makes sense to state the obvious.
There is good reason for pointing this out because I am going on to say that the future problems that the Constitutional Treaty was intended to resolve remain.
Those problems are still there.
Resolving the Unionâs institutional problems is not a merely cosmetic issue.
We need institutions that are appropriately designed so that they operate effectively.
Everybody can now see that there was, and there remains, no plan B as an alternative to the Constitutional Treaty.
There is no plan B, but amongst all of us we have coined a plan D: âDâ for democracy and debate.
It is precisely democracy and debate that define the essence of a Parliament.
This Parliament, therefore, in which the last great democratic debate on the Union took place with speeches by Mr Juncker and Mr Blair, this Parliament which witnessed that great moment of parliamentary democracy, must continue in this direction and â why not? â urge the Heads of State or Government of the countries in which the results of the referenda were particularly significant to continue that debate which was started so brilliantly.
Furthermore, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is in the process of drawing up a report on this period of reflection and will subsequently present its proposals to us.
Ladies and gentlemen, you will remember that a year ago I believed that the ratifications were going to be a decisive time for talking to the Europeans about Europe.
A great opportunity to talk to the Europeans about Europe, I said, but the truth is that I never thought that it would be an opportunity to talk to the Europeans about Europe.
After what has happened, we must promote a great conversation amongst Europeans throughout Europe, a decentralised conversation of course, in cooperation with the national Parliaments of course, but also involving the views of the whole of civil society.
We have enough time. Let us do it, perhaps less passionately than during the referendum campaigns, but with more and better information.
I have just received a letter from President Barroso, and I have held working meetings with the Vice-President, who is here at the moment, in which he proposes that we work together in this field.
We are going to do so, of course, both with the Commission and with the Council, because we are all convinced that the Europe we are going to construct will be neither technocratic nor bureaucratic and Parliament must therefore fully demonstrate its .
Please allow me now to return to our legislative work.
I believe that our results are positive.
We must, however, place more emphasis on the added value that Europe offers the Europeans and we will have the opportunity to do so when we debate the REACH Directive â the type of directive, incidentally, that the Commission says it will never again send â and the directives on services, working time, air safety and railways.
Then there are security and justice matters, and also Turkey, because a year ago we proposed giving our opinion on Turkey.
We did so.
Our position had a definite political impact.
This Wednesday we will once again study the situation on the eve of the start of the negotiations.
We are undoubtedly at an historic moment, and Parliament will have to give its opinion on the Protocol to the EU-Turkey Association Agreement, which has led to the problems of which we are all aware and which the UK Presidency is working to resolve.
Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has an essential role to play in terms of defining the balance between liberty and security in the fight against terrorism.
If Europe has to have an anti-terrorist policy that redefines the relationship between freedom and security, this Parliament must be fully involved.
That was laid down in the Constitutional Treaty, with significant advances in terms of our Parliamentâs role in this field.
Without a Constitutional Treaty, however, it is a positive sign that at the last informal Council of Home Affairs Ministers, the Council and the Commission agreed that Parliament should participate fully in the definition of this balance.
If that is the case, and I hope that it is, I believe that it would be an excellent demonstration of cooperation amongst the three Institutions and the best way to define an anti-terrorist policy that is fully accepted by European society.
I would like finally to refer to the issue of quality and the relevance of European legislation.
What legislation we produce, its quality, the issues it deals with, its relevance, how good it is: âbetter regulationâ is a fashionable issue.
It is not a new issue: every Commission states that it wants to simplify the .
I believe that this is the third time, at least, that a Commission has said that that is what is going to happen.
As far as the present situation is concerned, the President of the Commission has recently stated that he intends to withdraw several dozen legislative proposals.
From a procedural point of view, I have reminded the Commission of its obligation, according to our Framework Agreement, to inform Parliament before withdrawing those proposals and to do so without treating this obligation to inform merely as a meaningless formality.
We do not yet know which texts they are â I am sure that President Barroso will tell us â but I must point out right now that, depending on the stage they are at in their passage through the Council and Parliament, their withdrawal could raise legal problems, which Parliament would like to resolve in a positive fashion.
That is what I have to say with regard to procedure.
With regard to content, it is true that the European Union sometimes deals with many issues in great detail.
As well as trying not to legislate in excessive detail, however, it would also be good to consider the question of whether the European building is not lacking certain main beams that are needed to ensure the solidity of the whole structure.
There is no question that measures are needed to simplify legislation, to assess its impact and to analyse how texts are transposed.
I am told, for example, that there are currently 56 directives regulating the labelling of products.
If it is true that there are 56 directives regulating the labelling of products in Europe, then that batch of legislation should be consolidated.
In that respect, the UK Presidency has called an extraordinary Summit for the end of October, at which I will have the honour of representing our Institution, whose participation has been increasing, and I believe that that is something we should be pleased about.
We do not yet know the agenda for that Summit, but there is no doubt that the issue of the famous European social model will be one of the main issues being debated.
That social model, which for some people does not exist and for others takes many forms, is a priority issue for our debate, because it represents no less than the debate on European societyâs response to economic globalisation.
This is absolutely fundamental to the future of our society.
The work of our committees will be very important for that, as will the debate that we will hold in plenary in the presence of the British Prime Minister, who will come here to hold a debate with Parliament on the eve of the Summit.
Furthermore, I must tell you that throughout all my journeys this year I have noticed that the Unionâs foreign policy has ceased to be exclusively the domain of the governments; that on all my trips to non-EU countries I have noted that parliamentary diplomacy is increasing in maturity and responsibility, in particular thanks to the excellent cooperation with the Council and the Commission.
I must also tell you that everywhere I go I am told that Europe is needed and I often hear the complaint that its presence is insufficient.
Perhaps non-Europeans feel the need for Europe more than we do ourselves.
Ladies and gentlemen, when analysing the democracy that was emerging in the United States, a democracy like the one we intend to create, a supranational democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville said that nations, like men, only reach a greater destiny through dialogue and political debate.
I would like to urge you to bring this spirit alive in the debate on the future of Europe, in our respective States and in the European Institutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending, on behalf of our group, a warm welcome to our friends from Bulgaria and Romania and to assure them that we look forward to what will be a process of mutual learning.
Those of us who are already in this House will have a lot to learn from Bulgaria and Romania on how matters progress on those fronts, while they, our new observers, will have much to learn from the way we work.
An understanding attitude on the part of both sides will bring us successes in which we can all share.
You, Mr President, made reference to an identity crisis, and I welcome the opportunity that your speech gives us to take inventory today.
You also made reference to the Constitution.
I am convinced in the depths of my being that the only way we can respond to this identity crisis in which we in Europe find ourselves is if we succeed in expressing the values that unite us â even across party political boundary lines â in the shape of European constitutional law.
It is for that reason that our Constitution â and I am thinking particularly of its second part in which these values are described â must not be set aside, but must remain on the agenda, for the fact is that we need these values, and it is on them that our common future depends.
It is for that reason that the negative response from France and the Netherlands must not be allowed to be the last word.
We must of course set the right timeframe and be discriminating in deciding when to move forward, and so we need to join with the Commission in considering this.
Neither of us must allow the impression to be given that the Constitution is in some sense no longer on the agenda; even now, we are giving thought to how to give tangible form to this Constitution and its essential elements.
I also think it would be a good idea â and I believe that the President is thinking along similar lines â if we were, from time to time, irrespective of which country currently holds the presidency of the European Union, to invite to this House Heads of Government for the purpose of engaging with them in a debate on the future of Europe.
We are of course perturbed to learn that many members of the public regard this Europe of ours as a very distant thing.
There is no doubt, Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, that this is in part a public relations matter, and, as such, one of your responsibilities, but it is in essence about the legislative work that we do, and so let me say on behalf of our group that the Commissionâs approach â that we make fewer laws â is, in principle, the right one.
What we do, though, must be good; it must be âbetter lawmakingâ.
The Commission is approaching things from the right angle, but I urge you not to circumvent the procedures agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, for that is to go down a blind alley.
While we can go along with the substance of what you want, I very strongly recommend that you stick to the procedures for consultation with the European Parliament before you pass formal resolutions.
If you want to come to a decision as early as this coming Tuesday, it is not enough that Commissioner Verheugen â and I have no idea why it should be him â should unofficially inform the groups today; what is needed instead is constructive institutional exchange between the Commission and the European Parliament.
One of the most important matters to be considered will be, no doubt, the competitiveness of Europe.
We agree with Mr Barroso that the debate on the Constitution must not be allowed to distract us from this issue, which, along with the question of how we construct a social Europe, is at the heart of everything.
We also need to engage in closer dialogue with the parliaments at the national level, for division between us and them would be a tragedy for the European Union.
If we want to lead the European Union into a bright future, we will have to seek ways of doing so together.
I would also like â and with this I shall close, not least because I see that the Deputy Prime Minister is here in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council â to address the issue of how we should proceed as regards data and the combating of terrorism.
We have heard that there are governments that want to deal with this only by enacting framework resolutions, which amounts to excluding the European Parliament.
The British Home Secretary, Mr Clarke, has said that the UK Presidency of the Council is prepared to involve this House if we manage to come up with something definite within a reasonable period of time.
Speaking on behalf of our group, I can tell him that that is what we want to do, as terrorism needs to be combated.
I can assure you of that.
We also, however, want Parliament involved in order that there may be a proper legislative framework, and in order that it is not brought into being by the national governments alone.
It is with this in mind that I hope that the Council, the Commission and we in this Parliament will work together well, for if we do not, this European Union will find itself in still greater difficulties.
We are working together for the future of the European Union, and it is a matter of shared obligation that we do so.
Â Â  . Mr President, many thanks for what you said about the general direction of our work over the coming year.
I extend a warm welcome to our friends from Romania and Bulgaria, no matter what their political allegiance: a particularly warm welcome to those who belong to my own group, but a welcome nonetheless to those of differing views, coupled with the hope that we will work well together in this House for the good of the European Union.
What I also ask of them is that they work hard and debate hard in this House, for the European Union has need of that too.
It is in this Parliament that European democracy happens, so let me pick up what my good friend Mr Poettering said.
I do indeed share his view that we cannot accept the Commissionâs way of passing information around, which involves it, through the medium of Commissioner Verheugen, telling the what it wants to withdraw, followed by Mr Barroso, the following day, telling the international press what he is withdrawing, so that Parliament has, to this day, not been officially informed, even though the Commission is obliged to do so by the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Parliament is surely entitled, though, to know what is going on in the secret corridors of power in this building.
One opportunity to tell it would have been last Thursday in the Conference of Presidents, when Mr Barroso could have done the job.
He was, of course, invited, but said he could not be there.
I was then told that the reason why he would not be there was that Mr Poettering was not there.
Well, I said, there you go: if Mr Poettering is not there, then there is no point!
Looking at the newspapers today, I now learn where Mr Barroso was last Thursday, when his absence was unavoidable.
The Chairman of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats may well get worked up about our not being informed, but we could have been last Thursday, had not Mr Poettering, together with President Barroso, been attending an event in Lisbon staged by the European Peopleâs Partyâs think-tanks.
You should not go complaining to the Commission if it is you yourself who ensure that the appointments intended for us to be informed cannot be kept.
I am not aiming these remarks at Mr Poettering, for that is not his job.
I have some sympathy for him, but none for the President of the Commission.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, you can tell Mr Barroso from me that I will not accept a situation in which the President of the Commission tells the international press what he intends to do, but not the European Parliament.
That is unacceptable!
Nor can I see it as acceptable that a President of the Commission, should, in a press conference on the occasion of his return from holiday â which must have been a long one, for I have heard nothing from him for a long time â say that there was no point in concentrating on the Constitution, which was going to be a long time coming anyway, and that now was the time for us to focus on something else: that from someone whose task it is to contend for this same Constitution!
I really do wonder what the President of the Commissionâs attitude is towards those states that actually have ratified the Constitution, or towards those currently in the process of doing so.
What are they, faced with a Commission President such as this one, actually meant to think?
I have no quibble with the substance of this; it is indeed the case that we have to make a better job of making laws, and that superfluous ones need to be withdrawn.
With that I wholeheartedly agree, but let me make it abundantly clear, Mr President, that the work programme you have announced for the coming year cannot be gone through in the same way as its predecessors.
It is all about cooperation between the European institutions, between the Commission and Parliament in particular, but what I then expect of the Commission is that it should meet Parliament halfway and make Parliament â rather than a press conference or the Commissionâs briefings in Brussels â the venue for debate about the future of Europe.
That is the only way that we will reach any sort of agreement, not least on the Financial Perspective.
Let me just remind you that, between Parliamentâs figures â our proposals, in other words â and those that the Summit failed to adopt, by which I mean the 1.07% compromise that was on the table there, there is a gulf of several billions, but between the demands the Commission makes on the Financial Perspective and what the Council actually wants there is a yawning chasm amounting to double that amount again.
Any President of the Commission who wanted to implement his own ambitious programme ought, after the failure of the Financial Perspective, to have made a scene about it and denounced it as a road to ruin for the European Union!
What I am criticising, Mr President, is the Commissionâs far too lengthy absence from the debate on the Financial Perspective and the Constitution.
While wholeheartedly endorsing your proposals, we also hope that the Commission â and its President in particular â will soon get back on the playing field.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to welcome President-in-Office Prescott, clearly keener to enjoy the company of former colleagues than to join his party's bean feast in Brighton.
I, too, welcome our new friends from Romania and Bulgaria.
I am sorry that they join us at a less than happy time. Europe is in the doldrums: its Constitution has suffered a setback, its budget in stalemate, its economy stagnating.
It seeks a fresh breeze to lift its sails.
Previously, Parliaments looked to the Commission to take the lead: as the guardian of the Treaties; as the motor of integration, the initiator of ideas.
This Parliament must challenge the Member States.
Is Germany ready to reform?
Will Italy deal with its deficit?
Will Tony Blair back up his fine words with full British participation in Europe's projects?
And will Paris and The Hague show leadership of their people?
Now more than ever, Parliament and Commission must work together to rescue the European project, to unite the Union.
Five years ago in Lisbon, the Member States agreed an agenda.
Five months ago in Brussels, the Commission set out a new strategy for jobs and growth.
How many weeks must we wait for consensus in the Council, and when we reach consensus, for the courage to carry it through?
We have read of a bonfire of regulations, doubtless long overdue.
But permit me a word on process.
Better enforcement of laws: that is for the Commission and the Court.
Fewer, more focused new laws: that is for the Commission, too.
But decisions to scrap directives and to improve scrappy directives are a process involving Parliament, and we expect a say in withdrawing or re-writing laws.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, our involvement is your accountability.
Our approval is your legitimacy.
I fear you will not agree the budget under Britain's Presidency.
But use your public tour of Europe, together with Mr Barroso, to get agreement in national capitals for the financing the Union needs.
We need more champions like Airbus.
We will not have those with a cap of 1%.
We need to invest in upskilling; to provide for lifelong learning; to boost research and development â no way on 1%.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, do now the tour you should have done in June.
Set the agenda or the Member States will set it for you.
Europe's Constitution bears fine signatures of presidents and prime ministers.
Yet some of our citizens declined to sign it off.
Arguably the recipe is not quite right.
Possibly, people suspect it was signed in bad faith.
Certainly its signatories show precious little respect for the institutions they have established.
For the present, it is in cold storage.
So, yes, Mr Barroso, let us get the politics right, and getting them right probably means getting them centre.
But, where the Constitution is concerned, do not rush to perform the burial rites.
To paraphrase Mark Twain, rumours of its death may be exaggerated.
Let us use this period of reflection to call Chirac and Balkenende before this House to tell us how they propose to proceed; hold hearings with those who have not yet ratified; confront the Member States with their responsibilities.
Together, let us show that our Union meets the needs of its people: enhancing security without threatening liberty; building the foundation for jobs without undermining solidarity; gaining EU added value without diminishing identity.
If this is our agenda, some time from now our institutions and our institutional plans should once again command from our citizens the support and dedication they deserve.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen from Romania and Bulgaria, everybody has warmly welcomed you, our group warmly welcomes you and, as you can see, you have arrived at just the right time.
Your situation is, in fact, peculiar.
This Parliament is clearly furious, or at any rate is if we are to believe the group chairmen who have voiced their opinion against the Commission, against such and such a person.
MrÂ Borrell, you said that the moment MrÂ Blair spoke in this House was a great moment for democracy.
What happened?
He gave a speech, he left and since then the Presidency has gone quiet.
âTheyâ no longer exist at all, we do not know what âtheyâ do: this is not a great moment for democracy.
We are not talking here about the French Presidency; for the time being, we have a UK Presidency.
There is a UK Presidency, it should preside over matters and it is not doing so.
We are therefore entitled, as Parliament, to point out that it is doing nothing.
That is the least a Parliament can do.
Full stop.
I would like, at this point, to make a very simple remark.
If MrÂ Barroso thinks this or that about the Constitution, let him come and say so to Parliament.
We will debate it with him and we will give him a dressing-down.
Let him come and speak about the Constitution to Parliament.
If MrÂ Barroso believes that laws exist that should be withdrawn, let him come and say so!
Moreover, on this issue, MrÂ Poettering, you cannot say that, as regards the content, you agree with MrÂ Barroso: we do not know what MrÂ Barroso wants.
You can say that, as regards the format, you agree, but personally speaking, as regards the content, I do not know what the Commission wants to do.
With regard to better regulation, let us take the example of MrsÂ Reding, who wants to create European television, television in the style of MrÂ Berlusconi, with advertising everywhere.
Is that better regulation?
No, it is worse regulation and we do not want it.
We know what its content is.
Let MrsÂ Reding come and propose her new directive on television, and you will see that what the Commission wants will never gain majority support in this House.
Matters are therefore very straightforward.
The Commission makes proposals and formulates ideas.
It goes into recess, it asks itself some serious questions, it returns and it formulates ideas.
Let it come to Parliament to present its ideas.
When we have a directive, we put it to the vote: it is accepted or it is not accepted.
When we want to withdraw a directive, we vote on the proposal: it is accepted or it is not accepted.
We take things one by one and whether it is a question of better regulation, of neoliberal regulation, of socialist regulation or of no regulation at all, what matters is the content.
I have had enough of those people who continually make proposals in the European area without knowing whom to address themselves to.
We want a Commission that is a Commission proposing European laws.
We want a Parliament.
We want a Council that looks after its affairs. When there is a Presidency, let it preside over matters without other distractions.
If MrÂ Blair likes to play cricket and drink tea, then that is his choice but, as President, he has other matters to attend to.
He has to make proposals so that Europe moves forward and, for the time being, Europe is not moving forward, and it is because of this Presidency.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Prescott, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, together with my group, I gladly endorse all the words of welcome that have just been addressed to the observers from Romania and Bulgaria.
If we do not want our words of welcome to be mere lip service, however, we must have the courage to accept all the implications of our choices.
The now fast-approaching prospect for which my group has, moreover, given its full support - of these two countries entering the European Union in fact only makes a genuine change in direction for the EUâs economic, monetary, budgetary, fiscal and trade policy all the more urgent and decisive.
With 15 Member States, this was necessary; with 25 or 27 Member States, this becomes essential.
MrÂ President, you have spoken of an identity crisis.
I believe you are right.
To overcome it, political choices have to take precedence over market requirements, because if, in the name of international competition, we are content with adapting ourselves to globalisation as it is today, then there is quite simply no room either for social issues or for solidarity.
With the mass unemployment, rapid growth in job insecurity, large-scale poverty and glaring inequalities that we are experiencing, it would be politically irresponsible and socially explosive to remain with set ideas about free competition, restrictions on public spending, social and fiscal dumping and, the icing on the cake, miserly budgets.
As the elected representatives of our fellow citizens, we have a duty to bear witness to the profound uneasiness that, in one form or another, is being expressed throughout the whole of Europe.
What can Parliament undertake to do in the coming months to send out to Europeans the positive signals they are waiting for?
I would put forward three proposals.
Firstly, we are going to be judged on our votes on a whole range of draft directives.
As of this week, the one aimed at totally liberalising rail transport and, in the next few weeks, the deeply symbolic Bolkestein Directive, which MrÂ Barroso has been very careful not to throw out with the others.
These will be followed by the texts on regional transport, port services and working time, without forgetting the opinions that we will have to provide on the negotiations at the WTO and, in particular, on the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
If we want to satisfy expectations, we would be wise, in each case, to adopt a clearly anti-liberal and very demanding stance on public services.
Secondly, we should take a number of significant political initiatives on major issues of civilisation.
One single example: war and peace.
In order to express our rejection of war, and particularly of the involvement of EU countries in such a venture, let us invite to Parliament MrsÂ Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a US soldier killed in Iraq, whose cry of pain, truth and humanity is moving opinion on both sides of the Atlantic.
Thirdly and finally, and in conjunction with the first two areas, let us contribute to giving our fellow citizens their freedom of speech.
Let us organise debates by all means, but let us make them genuine, uncensored debates in the 27 Member States of the enlarged Union on what ought to change in the Union in order to breathe life back into the European dream.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome our friends from Bulgaria and Romania.
They will be warmly received by this ever-expanding European empire.
I would say this to them: although you are not elected, you will be treated as full members of the European political elite.
You will be entitled to the very generous daily allowance; you will find the chauffeur service at your disposal; there will be an endless round of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and drinks receptions.
After all that, with your expanded waistlines, the plan is that you go back to your home countries and tell people that all is well with this club that you have agreed to join.
As Marx said â and I mean Groucho Marx, not Karl Marx â 'I wouldn't join any club that would have me as a member'.
As far as the EU is concerned that is pretty sound advice, because this is a club whose accounts have not been signed off for the last ten years.
This is a club, as you heard from the group leaders earlier, that is treating the voters of France and the Netherlands with absolute contempt as it tries to impose the provisions of a Constitution that should be dead.
